And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field,
and he was faint:
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that
same RED POTTAGE; for I am faint: therefore was his name
called Edom.
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
profit shall this birthright do to me?
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto
him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and
he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus
Esau despised his birthright.

FOREWORD
RED PottAGE is history humanized. It is the story of a
generation of man told in the form of drama. The scenes
and the acts are authentic. The actors, some of whose names
are disguised, are portrayed as faithfully as memory and
research can reproduce.
The generation depicted in RED Pottage begins with the
year 1923. Perhaps no other generation in the long, brave
story of man, in time and space, witnessed drama on so vast
a scale.
And yet, fundamentally, there is nothing new about the
global action, except the scope and the names of the dramatis
personae.

INTRODUCTION
“All things are double one against another:
and he hath made nothing imperfect.”
Ecclesiasticus XLII:24
King David and of the illustrious King Solomon, Boaz
of Bethlehem, is hailed as “a mighty man of wealth.”
Boaz is the prototype of the man of wealth whom the in-
telligentsia of all civilized countries, in every generation, hold
in contempt. The modern Boaz is the paragon of Capitalism.
Our twentieth-century drama is a realistic, free-flowing
revelation of the inalienable rights of the mighty man of
wealth. Every Boaz who acquires wealth through persevering
exercise of his individual talents and skills is no less an
honorable member of society than are the scientist, the war-
rior, the athlete, the journalist, the ballet dancer, and the
StateSman.
Twisted talk about the mighty man of wealth as the root
of all social evil has fueled volcanic revolutions. It has
flooded the earth with violence, blood, and devastation.
Never has it liberated the masses of men from the pit of
poverty.
The world today is swarming with noxious germs which
we call slogans, ideologies, and battle hymns. Perhaps the
most abominable of these germs is the Marxian “dictatorship
of the proletariat.” Yet the most destructive is the term
“socialization,” because it is the most deceptive, the most
seductive, and, in the end, the most enslaving.
Socialization is based on the twin theory that all men are
created equal and that all men must share equally—not
equitably—in the distribution of the nation's wealth.
All men are not created equal. Only the simple-minded,
the hypocrite, the professional politician, and the yellow jour-
nalist will continue to say so. In the realm of the intellect,
9| N THE Old Testament, the progenitor of the debonair

by way of illustration, between a Winston Churchill and a
feeble-minded adult there is a chasm as deep, as broad, and
as unfathomable as the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
Throughout the centuries, the disease of poverty has evoked
the thunder of demagogues as well as of prophets. As with
Stalin in our day, so in the many generations before him, the
finger of scorn and the thumb of condemnation have been
raised against Boaz, the capitalist, the mighty man of wealth.
And so the confusion and the babble of tongues prevail
not alone in Bolshevik Russia, but also in Egypt, Iran, China,
and even in these United States. The fury, the fanaticism,
and the futility of the struggle are unabated. The mighty
man of wealth, Boaz, is still the hapless, convenient ogre.
The liquidation of Boaz—master of the art and science of
the production and distribution of wealth, and civilization's
indispensable dynamic agent—is wildly prescribed as the sur-
est, swiftest means by which to attain to liberation from
social maladjustment.
In the course of this fiendish orgy, Boaz is separated not
merely from his natural, just, and inalienable right to the
secure and tranquil enjoyment of his property, but also from
his divine right to liberty and life itself. Pillage and murder,
as in Bolshevik Russia—not justice and equity—become the
foul instruments of socialization.
Many, too many, theologians have been subtly sucked in
as allies in this maelstrom of socialization. Would that these
theologians might ponder the even more subtle significance of
pertinent New Testament parables! We affirm that the Old
Testament declaration, “For the poor shall never cease out
of the land,” is as much a canon of sociology as the law of
diminishing returns is an axiom in the science of political
economy.
In self-defense, in response to the primeval impulse of life
for self-preservation, Boaz joins forces with other mighty
men of wealth. In modern times, he turns to legal craftsmen
who know how to twist and evade legal strictures formulated
by shortsighted and often sinister parliamentary factions.

The uninterrupted exchange of goods and services—trade
and commerce—is the life of civilization. Against all arti-
ficial barriers, in the struggle for survival, the higher law of
self-preservation is imperious. Adjustment to environment
and to privation as well as to infirmity is one of man's most
amazing talents. On a larger scale, adjustment or adaptation
is one of Boaz's most remarkable traits as a man of wealth.
His conquest of such physical phenomena as desert, moun-
tain, and ocean, brooks no contempt.
Were it not for these day-by-day adjustments and new
forms of adaptation, civilization would vanish from the earth,
and society, as we now know it, would cease to be.
The net effect, therefore, of Stalinist socialization would
be perhaps even more devastating upon civilized communities
than the detonation of many atomic bombs.
So it is that in countries under the iron heel of the Kremlin,
merchants and manufacturers continue to do business with
Bolshevik agents who are not at all disinclined to accept
baksheesh. In countries like East Germany today, the history
of Nazi mimetism is repeated; only the actors are different in
language and uniform, not in greed and guile.
In the United States, merchants and manufacturers subsi-
dize both major political party organizations not merely in
order to enable them to maintain the normal course of trade
and commerce, but so that the American civilization may be
preserved. How else can they liberate themselves from the web
of legal blackmail spun by demagogues, theoreticians, and
unscrupulous bureaucrats?
Everywhere and at all times, Boaz is the patron and con-
servator of culture. He is the sponsor and chief benefactor
of all private academies of art and learning. Paradoxically,
Boaz is too often the fawning votary of musicians, writers,
lecturers, and peddlers of socialization. He rushes in to offer
incense upon the altars erected by self-anointed liberals, those
very altars upon which, in time, he will be offered up as a
sacrifice to material dialecticism.


## p. xii (#18) #############################################

Boaz, as a mighty man of wealth, is proud, arrogant, cock-
sure. But standing before men of learning and talent, Boaz
is often, too often, a shrinking, sniveling suppliant, unable to
maintain poise and spiritual equilibrium, which are the hall-
marks of an artist of living. This makes him an easy prey to
ridicule, contumely, and eventual immolation.
Involuntary poverty, like syphilis, is a disease. It is the
result of ignorance, indulgence, indolence, or inertia. In a
land such as the United States, where opportunity and philan-
thropy are almost as free as the air we breathe, involuntary
poverty—like syphilis—must be stigmatized as a social mis-
demeanor. It must be diagnosed as an individual, rather than
a mass, ailment, challenging the individual to pull himself
out of this pit of poverty by the persevering exercise of in-
telligence, industry, imagination, probity, and sobriety. In a
democracy, whose great theological tenets are the divinity and
the inviolable rights of man, the individual, the focus and
the emphasis of all curative processes should and must be on
the social responsibility of man, the individual. To be free
from disease, in all its ugly, corrupting forms, man must will
it so. Salvation in all its spheres is a purely personal affirma-
tion or dynamic.
They who advocate socialization as that one miracle drug
or process which will categorically eradicate the disease of
poverty are no less ox-minded than those who would pre-
scribe socialization of syphilis, cancer, or tuberculosis as fool-
proof medical technique, leading eventually to the disappear-
ance of all the pain and anguish that flesh is heir to.
Some sentimentalists.applaud socialization as “a noble ex-
periment” in humanism. A little more than a generation ago,
like-minded sentimentalists imposed the “noble experiment”
of national prohibition upon a great nation well on its way
to reasonable standards of temperance. When social control
replaced individual responsibility, when the thrilling statute
of Liberty, “Police thyself,” was contemptuously discarded,
the vilest species of crime, deception, wantonness, hypocrisy,

and lawlessness sprang up all over the country. The mischief
of alcoholism, instead of being mitigated, was grossly aggra-
vated by the rise of Al Caponism.
Indubitably, Boaz, the capitalist, has not always been per-
fect. The capitalistic system has always had its imperfections.
It is a human institution. Yet the trend of all clear-sighted
leaders of industry has been toward a more equitable dis-
tribution of the wealth which they and their fellow-workers
together have created. American capitalism leads the world
in the fulfillment of the promise of ever higher standards of
living for ever more millions of American citizens.
Who among all theologians will deny that ethical control
is infinitely more desirable in the regulation of the social-
political-economic life of man, the individual, than any man-
made device for commissar control, whether such device bear
the imprimatur of a Hitler, a Stalin, or a Franklin D.
Roosevelt?
And if the restless, impatient intelligentsia must have a
set of slogans or patterns as the warp and woof upon which
they may pleasantly weave their ideologies, philosophies, and
social programs, let them take up these words fashioned by
the mind and the spirit of the Supreme Intelligence:
“Thou shalt not covet . . . anything that is thy neighbor's.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. Thou
shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt
not murder. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”

CHAPTER I
THE BLIGHT THAT TRAILED
ERE are we going this morning, Milt?”
“To Patterson Park, over to the boathouse.
You and I can take turns at rowing, Sam.”
“Do you know the way?”
“Of course I do. Patterson Park was one of my favorite
haunts before I went to Cincinnati seven years ago. I am
sure I can direct you to every important part of this place:
the swimming pool, tennis court, clubhouse, and the boat-
house.”
Rabbi Milton Stern and his colleague, Rabbi Samuel Wolk,
recently ordained at the rabbinical seminary in Cincinnati,
were home on vacation in Baltimore. It was the second day
of August in the year 1923.
Laying aside heavy sermonic labor at his typewriter, Stern
took Wolk's proffered right arm and walked briskly to the
nearby park.
“Shall we turn right or left here, Milt?”
“Turn right and before long you'll see a number of old
guns propped up on a mound. I believe those guns were
used in the War of 1812. There are also a few of the old-
time cannon balls nearby. Those iron balls aren't as fierce-
looking, however, as the long shells I saw piled in the
Argonne Forest alongside the big Navy guns on the flat cars.”
The two clergymen were now at the boathouse. While
waiting their turn, Wolk chatted with the young man in
charge.
Stern listened for a moment, and then asked: “How long
have you been working here, Buddy?”
“About nine years.”
“Sam, that's just the number of years I’ve been preparing
for the ministry. Lots of things have happened during those
1

nine years: University, World War, and Ordination. But I
haven’t much to show for it. I am so thin and so pale. My
mother was terrified when she first saw me this summer. I
am wondering what this young man looks like after spending
nine years at the boathouse.”
“I am sure he wouldn't mind if you felt his muscles, Milt
—nine years of them. Here, just feel his right arm.” -
Stern offered his right hand. Together they ran their fin-
gers over the upper right arm of the proud young park
attendant.
“Say, he really has something to show for his nine years'
work. I hope we, too, will have plenty to offer for all our
toil and sweat and mental exertions.”
Wolk and Stern each took turns at rowing close to the rim
of the tiny body of water artfully styled “lake.” As they were
about to begin a second turn around, Stern said, “Sam, I
hear a lot of noise up there near the boathouse. I wonder
what's happened. Let's row back and find out.”
The shrill, poignant cry of the newsboy could be heard as
they reached the landing. Extra! Extra! President Harding
dead!” -
Quickly Wolk and Stern sat down on a nearby bench.
Wolk began to read aloud to the blind rabbi the front-page
story of the sudden death in San Francisco of President War-
ren G. Harding. As waters tumbling down the falls of
Niagara, so were the words flowing from the lips of his
colleague. Stern was deeply affected. He listened, nerves
quivering.
Ptomaine poisoning? Incredible! This was too simple an
explanation. What of the even more devastating effect of
the poison of moral degeneration, if the fantastic stories of
Harding's personal and public indiscretions were to be
believed?
On and on, the torrent of memories and flashes of reflec-
tions mingled with every word relayed from the black ink

of the newspaper by the swiftly moving tongue of the reader.
There was the Presidential campaign during the summer and
autumn of 1920. Some of the men who had served with
Stern overseas with the 37th Division, Ohio National Guard,
had taken leading roles behind the scenes in that campaign.
When Harding spoke in Cincinnati, Stern had been given a
place of honor on the stage at Music Hall.
But the victory of the Republican Party at the polls in
November, 1920, was not the triumph of a great political
organization. It turned out to be the snatching of power by
a very small band of cunning, unprincipled men who, in the
course of time, dragged the twenty-ninth President of the
United States down with them into the slough of dishonor.
And, like the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat—as the
Scriptures often repeated—the blight of Harding's abbre-
viated administration would never be forgotten.
Stern winced. Responsibility for the curse of the Harding
blight must be borne by the leaders of the Republican Party.
In a moment of confusion, brought on by fear of the dema-
gogue's baying and barking at the “man of wealth,” they had
rejected General Leonard Wood and succumbed to the
blandishments of Harding's promoters.
Stern remembered that the sole disqualification in the
candidacy of General Wood was that he was supported by
such men as Colonel William Cooper Procter, the Cincinnati
soap manufacturer. General Leonard Wood was a man of
honor and of high attainment in the field of statesmanship,
no less than in the sciences of medicine and war. William
Cooper Procter was one of the nation's most progressive, en-
lightened, and socially-just industrialists. His company, The
Procter and Gamble corporation, was far in advance of most
of the proposed programs for industrial democracy. Colonel
Procter had served as the commanding officer of the 1st Regi-
ment of the Ohio National Guard, shortly before Stern en-
listed in that military unit. There was scarcely a civic or
charitable undertaking unaffected by the leadership and

generosity of Colonel Procter. He might well have been
called the first citizen of Cincinnati.
Stern turned to the other side of the record. The Harding
Administration, true, would be remembered because of the
unsavory acts of a few men. But it had weathered the back-
wash of post-war reconversion with remarkable skill and
rapidity. Its Naval Disarmament Conferences had brought
many of the nations together in an atmosphere of good will
and in a spirit of international cooperation, though cynics and
professional enemies of the Republican Party continued to
label Republican politicians and statesmen with the epithet
“isolationist.” Generally speaking, the country had been re-
stored to a large degree of economic and financial stability,
so that the people everywhere could pursue their daily occu-
pations and enjoy a large measure of domestic tranquility.
The Harding Administration, under the captaincy of
Charles Evans Hughes, the Secretary of State, and of Herbert
Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce, had acted in accordance
with the Swing-back of American sentiment and long tradi-
tion of non-interference, non-entanglement in foreign leagues
or alliances. For the most part, the people of the United
States wanted the diplomatic doors locked against Soviet
Russia, and closed their eyes and shut their ears to the in-
describable wretchedness of the abject prisoners of Lenin's
Utopia.
Samuel Wolk and Milton Stern walked home arm in arm.
Their voices were hushed. The death of President Harding
seemed to have cast a pall over everything and everyone.
The death of the Chief Magistrate, whatever his shortcom-
ings, is always in the nature of a national bereavement and
a very personal sorrow. And the nation would mourn for
him as one stricken household. Until his body was interred
in the soil of his native Ohio, men and women would view
his casket with genuine grief and reverence, and solemn
memorial services would be held for him in church and
synagogue throughout the land.

Rabbi Milton Stern again sat before his typewriter. His
mind surveyed the rest of the world in wonderment. Millions
of other persons in many lands were mourning, though in
subdued, perplexed spirit, the swiftly deteriorating founda-
tions of their governments: Japan, a seething cauldron of
militarism; Soviet Russia, a never-ending pit of hell and de-
struction; and for nine months in the Landsberg prison in
Germany evil genii were at work with the artist's hand, the
twisted mind, and the insane energy of an Austrian-born
Orator.

MELODY OR MALADY"
the role of student, and entered the Divinity School
of the University of Chicago. For the first time he
took up residence in a dormitory on the campus. His room-
mate was big, jovial Ben Frankel, a rabbi and Stern's former
classmate at the Cincinnati seminary. The two graduate
divinity students occupied a suite of rooms, two small bed-
rooms separated by a study hall. The suite was modestly
furnished.
In the summer of 1924, in America, all was comparatively
peaceful and prosperous. Calvin Coolidge, the new Presi-
dent, had set up his rainbow of optimism as a token of en-
during tranquility at home and of peace abroad. Coolidge
had become the symbol of old-fashioned New England cau-
tion, prudence, sagacity, and the spirit of lovingly-let-alone.
The Coolidge era was marked by a minimum of government
control, a maximum of rugged individualism, and the ardent
cultivation of good will and harmony with all nations. In
the summer of 1924 the predominant topics of conversation
in the United States were summer vacations, the 1924 Presi-
dential campaign, and the Leopold-Loeb murder trial in
Chicago.
The University of Chicago on the South Side of the great
city was like a world within a world. It was as if a circle of
hieratic sanctity had been drawn round the campus, cutting
it off completely from the profane tread of the non-collegiate
denizens of the outer world. Here on the university campus,
students, faculty, and personnel seemed to be beings of a
higher order who could not be tarnished by the smoke and
dust of a great city's mills, furnaces, and shops.

Stern was keenly aware of this apocryphal situation. Dur-
ing the previous winter and spring he had been part of that
outer sphere. As the national field representatives of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations (with headquar-
ters in Cincinnati), Stern and his sister Dinah had journeyed
from the South Side to the North and from the Loop, hub
of the city, to the West Side, preaching before almost
every Reform Jewish congregation and auxiliary unit in the
metropolis.
Between weekends, when not engaged in trips to meet with
Jewish students at universities near the great city—such as
the University of Illinois at Champaign, where “Big Ben”
Frankel had established the first branch of the international
B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation—Stern and his sister explored
the manifold elements which made up this amazing coa-
lescence of village upon village: streets, avenues, shops, stock-
yards, the Hull House, museums, theatres, and restaurants.
Hundreds of thousands of men and women, old and young,
toiled at thousands of crafts and trades, while scarcely any
seemed to be aware that in this maze of entangling activity
each was contributing to the welfare of the other. All with-
out overseer or grand dictator, visible or invisible! This was
the marvelous miracle of the social labyrinth or metropolis.
And as they strolled along the avenues, Stern was certain
that there was some Guardian Spirit presiding over Chicago
and every other similar hive of humanity, with Compassion
and Courtesy the chief ministering angels, or agents, to main-
tain each living soul within its separate and sovereign orbit.
This drastic transition from city to campus was, therefore,
very profound. The lecture halls of the university, free for
the most part from every possible contaminating touch of
private or public caprice, invited the mind and the soul to
throw off the spell of commerce and to lie down in the green
pastures of intellectual and spiritual Elysian fields.
The professors were all men of renown. Ames, Tufts,
Smith, Haydon, Matthews were men seemingly without guile,
men of truth, Americans of the finest variety.

Because Stern did not busy himself with note-taking in the
classroom, he was able to concentrate on the personality of
the lecturer and thereby to be molded by the refining spirit
of the scholar and the man. There were other lectures and
lecturers, informal and out-of-doors. These dispensers of
knowledge were men with a passion for anonymity. They
were latter-day Sophists who traveled from Washington Park
to Jackson Park wherever there was an audience in the mak-
ing. They spoke without contract and without fee, merely
for the joy of sharing their wealth of wisdom. One epithet
applied to these mobile educational units was “The Nut
Club.” The predominant topics for illumination were the
writings of Shakespeare and the modern theses of such world-
changing sociologists as Karl Marx. Students in bathing suits
mingled with other meandering auditors and occasionally
bantered the zealots with what they thought were irrelevant
and irreverent tests of the lecturer's sanity.
There was, of course, no complete isolation from the noise
and tumult of the ocean of reality as its waves rolled against
the fabulous island. Students and faculty still read the news-
papers. And now, for the first time, a new instrument for
the transmission of harsh and mundane thought and facts
captivated the interest alike of professor and student. When
Stern and his companion walked along the nearby streets,
they could not but stop and listen as from every shop, so it
seemed, this new mechanical marvel called the radio im-
periously summoned. In every block, these mechanical town-
criers maintained an unceasing trumpeting of the proceedings
of the 1924 Democratic Party's National Convention then
taking place at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
Day by day, hour by hour, the report of the struggle be-
tween the forces of Smith of New York and of McAdoo of
California during the month of July swept across the wireless
channels of communication. The intensity of the contest and
the stubborn, unyielding spirit of the Smith and McAdoo
adherents were magnified by the strident blare of the mega-
phone. All through the day and into the late hours of

evening, Stern could hear the echo of the words, “Alabama
casts twenty-four votes for Underwood,” though he was miles
away from any radio. And when John W. Davis of West
Virginia emerged as the victorious nominee, on the one
hundred and third ballot, and the voices of the reading clerks
at the New York convention hall receded into the yesterdays
of history, great peace and tranquility settled over the Mid-
way and its environs.
Scarcely had the fury of the political convention subsided
when a yet more real-life drama, staged in Chicago, gripped
the mind and the heart. The entire civilized world was the
audience. Here was unfolded a tragedy as stark and as
tumultuous as any fabricated by the Greeks of ancient days.
The “perfect crime” had been scientifically planned by the
sons of two socially prominent Chicago citizens. Nathan
Leopold and Richard Loeb had been richly endowed with
everything that society could offer to children of men of
wealth—everything but the ability to distinguish between
right and wrong, good and evil, life and death, a fellow
human being and a guinea pig in a scientist's laboratory.
They had murdered their fourteen-year-old friend as coolly
as though they were practising vivisection on a nameless cur.
The two exceptionally brilliant youths had kidnapped and
killed a neighbor's son to gratify a wild conviction that they
could perpetrate the perfect crime. But, horrendous as were
the plotting and the execution of this adolescent prank, the
focus of attention was not riveted upon the character and
miscreancy of Leopold and Loeb. The personality and the
artistry of Clarence S. Darrow, chief counsel for the defense,
captured and held the spotlight. The guilt of the accused
was too well documented to leave even the shadow of a
doubt in the minds of the jury and the world. A pair of
spectacles, found by an exploring Chicago newspaper re-
porter, proved to be that one bit of conclusive evidence not
only to establish the guilt of the youths but also to demon-
strate, in shocking elaboration of detail, how Leopold and
Loeb had failed in their “scientific” experiment to achieve

the perfect crime and that their minds, which should have
brought forth a melody of harmonious social graces, had
been blunted by the malady of undisciplined self-indulgence.
Darrow had early discarded the possibility of a “not guilty”
verdict. The sixty-seven-year-old counsel for the defense was
regarded by many as America's outstanding criminal lawyer
who specialized in defending, as he believed, victims of the
social order. He was eminently successful because he was a
great actor. As he addressed the jury, it was not so much
in behalf of his two clients that he spoke. Darrow drama-
tized his righteous indignation over what he considered the
blindness of our criminal code. He challenged the basic
theory underlying the entire structure of our criminal law—
the assumption that human beings themselves are, within
certain limits, responsible for their own acts. He spun his
case around his personal ideology that the social order—not
the individual—must bear the burden of responsibility for
the wayward actions of such persons as Richard Loeb and
Nathan Leopold.
After thirty days, despite their confession and the over-
whelming evidence of premeditated murder, despite the thun-
dering charges of Robert Crowe and his staff of Cook County
prosecutors, Leopold and Loeb, because of their youth, were
sentenced by Judge John R. Caverly to life imprisonment
in an Illinois penitentiary.
The sensation-packed court trial overshadowed everything
presented in the quiet lecture halls on the campus. Darrow's
lengthy, impromptu speeches were more attractive than the
enshrined writings of the Vedas, of Aristotle, Kant, Spinoza,
or Nietzsche. No student needed urging or prodding to read
the newspaper accounts of the manner, the method, and the
content of Darrow's defense of Chicago's woefully notorious
young intellectuals. What Darrow said was fresh, vital,
stimulating.
One morning, as the summer quarter drew to an end,
Stern sat in his dormitory study, engaged in the preparation
of a psychology term paper for the course on problems of

12 *> R E D POT TA GE
personality. The essay called for strenuous individual crea-
tive thought. His topic, “What Is Insanity?”, flowed from
Darrow's novel, ingenious defense of the two doomed shed-
ders of man's blood. There was no doubt, no question, no
casuistic tortuous twisting as to the appalling nature of this
form of mental high jinks. And as he tapped the typewriter
keys, horde upon horde of mosquitoes winged their appar-
ently aimless, endless flights from nearby Lake Michigan
through his unscreened windows. The bed, table, chair, car-
pet were littered with them. The mosquitoes whirled about
his hands and face. And out of this predicament came the
flash of illumination.
“Is there any semblance of sanity in the groundless on-
slaught of the insect? Has this marvelous vital machine any
conscious volition? Or does it act instinctively?”
From venting his philosophic admiration of the mosquito,
Stern turned to contemplation and analysis of the theories
of the reigning American psychologist, McDougall. Stern
concluded that it was not volitional concentration but the
unbridled instinct of curiosity which transformed placid man
into a genius, and that “Genius in any form is insanity. The
variations of genius are the expressions and the coloring of
the multiple personalities of innumerable mortals. . . .
“Suppose then that a human being, we shall say, Napoleon
Bonaparte, conceives in his fertile mind the possibility of
becoming the mightiest man in all the world. This thought
is therefore acted out upon the brain. The brain communi-
cates its energizing force to the hands which control and
compose orations of irresistible appeal; the tongue discloses
ideas of conquest and glory. In a moment millions of human
beings [like mosquitoes] respond to the call of a single man
—millions of like human beings rush forward to execute the
dreams of a tiny man possessed of the disease of megalo-
mania. This disease is the cancer upon the instinct of self-
assertion. Thus another instinct triumphs, and what some
call genius and some call insanity is in reality an instinct
run amuck. . . .”

CHAPTER III
REFORM AND RETRIBUTION
the purpose of enlarging and strengthening the bonds
of union and to assure a steady flow and interchange
of essential financial and spiritual currents between the widely
dispersed member congregations and the parent institutions
in Cincinnati, Rabbi Stern and his sister Dinah saw many
cities. They were regally entertained everywhere. Presiden-
tial suites were reserved for them at the leading hotels. Po-
lice escorts and eager reporters awaited them at railway sta-
tions. They were the guests of civic clubs. Veterans' societies
feted them at banquets and dances. Almost everywhere the
young rabbi and his sister were portrayed in the most favor-
able light by newspaper columnists: a frontline war veteran
dedicating his life to the high calling of the Holy Spirit,
accompanied by his beautiful sister consecrating her life
completely as the eyes of her brother.
Now and then the paeans turned from prose into poetry.
In Fort Worth, Texas, Attorney Theodore Mack wrote these
Stanzas:
9| N THE course of their six months' extensive travels for
To you who gave and gave
That your country would not be a Tyrant's slave
I see now, Ah! how small
My portion, my all.
You make me bow my head so low
In shame if you would know;
As a pygmy I stand beside the likes of you
In comparison so small, it's true.
13


## p. 14 (#36) ##############################################

14 Yºs R E D POT TA GE
How little then did I conceive
The great recompense I did receive
When from war I was free;
'Tis now I see the fool in me.
Of God you seem to be a part
As I listen to the gladness in your heart;
As you praised The One above,
Surely God is Love.
Had I prayed the same as you
He might have shown me mercy too:
But, how I cursed and took His name;
I feel now the pang of shame.
His Love for you He has shown.
You are His chosen, His very own.
Surely your eyes are not always as night
For He has given you power to see the Light.
So it's someone just the likes of you
To make me see myself in colors true;
And this night is never to be forgot.
I saluted a Great Hero and Patriot.
With these credentials and with such an aura, Stern and
his sister were afforded enviable opportunities to see and to
come in touch with the height, depth, and breadth of many
cities: Jacksonville, Memphis, St. Louis, Omaha, Denver,
Cleveland, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Portland. They visited the
academies of learning and many civic institutions to which
every resident pointed with justifiable pride. They viewed
the majestic mountains in Colorado. They sat in awe in a
pew of the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. They
admired the harbors of New Orleans, San Francisco, Seattle,

and Duluth. They beheld the length and the sweep of the
great Mississippi and the Columbia Rivers. They were pho-
tographed with moving picture celebrities at the Warner
Brothers studio in Hollywood.
Yet when each season's itinerary was concluded and the
Cincinnati-bound train neared its destination, Stern and his
sister eagerly, anxiously, peered through the window while
the car was jerked back, rebounded, and at last rolled into
the Cincinnati depot. Cincinnati was their home. They were
proud of her churches and synagogues, the suburbs encircling
the seven hills, the municipal university, the major league
baseball club, the symphony orchestra, the Music Festival,
the world-famous industries, and the thirty-mile scenic-rich
Ohio River front.
Cincinnati was hardly the City Beautiful. Her large waste-
land, blighted water-front “Bottoms,” never failed to shock
the high-minded and the just. Yet Cincinnati was foremost
among cities. Out of her experiments and pioneer ventures,
Cincinnati had shown the way to the progressive movement
of civilization. Her city fathers were the first to recognize
fire fighting as a profession; the first steam fire engine was
made in Cincinnati. It was the cradle of the Salvage Corps,
and of the fire insurance business in the West. It was the
birthplace of the idea of cooperative education. Ever since
the days of Alice and Phoebe Cary, this city had had a
lyrical tradition of consequence. With the coming to Cincin-
nati of America's most illustrious schoolmasters, the McGuf-
fey brothers, it surged forward to unchallenged leadership in
the field of textbook publication, now one of Cincinnati's
most notable industries. And, perhaps most significant, was
the discovery by the daughter of Joseph Longworth that the
clays of the Ohio Valley rivaled those used in the world's
finest ceramics. Out of this discovery arose the Rookwood
Pottery, which from the first day adopted its rules of never
duplicating the design of a vase or any other purely artistic
piece and of never issuing any product even slightly imperfect

16 Yºss R E D POT TA GE
in finish or artistic quality. And, like the clays of the Valley
and the vases of Rookwood, Cincinnati produced craftsmen
of excellence in every category of civilization.
Incredibly, few American cities had a blacker political
character than did Cincinnati in the year 1925. One of the
factors in this sorrowful picture was the wholly unscrupulous
way certain ballot-brokers like Michael Mullen juggled the
Negro voting element of the population. As a Democrat, he
locked up all the Negroes in Cincinnati so that they could
not vote on Election Day. For this he was convicted in the
courts but immediately pardoned by President Grover Cleve-
land. A few years later Michael Mullen became a Republi-
can and delivered the Negro vote to the Republican Party.
The movement to emancipate the community from its
ludicrous, wasteful organization-control began almost imper-
ceptibly in the year 1920. Twenty-five business and pro-
fessional men, mostly veterans of World War I, met at a
Sunday night smoker and founded the Cincinnatus Associa-
tion. They discussed local political affairs long and earnestly.
The intrepid citizen who initiated and nurtured the Cincin-
natus Association was Attorney Victor Heintz, former adju-
tant of the 147th Regiment, 37th Division, under whom
Stern had served as sergeant-major.
For extraordinary gallantry under fire in the Argonne
Forest, Captain Victor Heintz had been twice decorated and
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf clus-
ter. But the momentous facet in the Heintz career was that
he had exchanged his seat in the House of Representatives
in Washington for the sword of the warrior early in 1917.
When he returned to his home in Cincinnati, disabled as well
as decorated, Heintz confidently expected to regain his Con-
gressional seat, alongside his very eminent fellow-Republican,
Speaker of the House Nicholas Longworth. To his chagrin
and utter amazement, the then reigning head of the county's
Republican organization, Rudolph Hynicka, coldly passed
him by in the political campaign of 1920.

Methodically, step by step, Heintz and his newly galvanized
Cincinnatus Association met and grappled with Hynicka's
formidably entrenched forces. Victory followed victory with
astonishing decisiveness. The crucial test came when Cin-
cinnati's aroused citizenry voted to remove all symbols from
the ballot. The “birdless ballot” would thus strike a vital
blow at the efficiency of the machine control by nullifying
the effect of routine instructions by ward captains to their
illiterate neighbors to vote “the bird with the pants.” Out
of the smoke of this battle came forth the non-partisan City
Charter Committee. After a survey the committee proposed
a form of municipal government to be ruled by nine Council-
men instead of thirty-two, to be elected by a highly compli-
cated system of proportional representation. In the election
of 1924, the new City Charter was enthusiastically adopted.
When Stern and his sister, in the late spring of 1925,
reinstalled themselves in their Cincinnati home, Stern pre-
pared for the usual summer academic retreat to the halls of
the Hebrew Union College. True to the Jewish tradition, as
a student he would be as cleanly cut off from the outside
world as though he had been bodily translated into that
higher sphere reserved for the great and the good scholars
of all generations. But one day a telephone call from Captain
Heintz almost completely shattered that fond prospect. Would
Stern and his sister attend a political rally at the Hotel Sinton,
staged by his revolutionary band of Republicans to win con-
trol of the first reform City Council?
A request from Captain Heintz was tantamount to an
order which a loyal sergeant-major could not shirk. This
was not the first time Stern had acquiesced when his “superior
officer” patriotically summoned. In 1920, when Captain
Heintz was second in command at Republican national head-
quarters in Chicago, Stern responded to an invitation to
speak at a meeting of the 13th ward Republican organization
in his own neighborhood. The meeting was held in the base-
ment of an apartment house across the way from the subur-

ban Avondale public school. Oddly, the presiding officer
WaS a WOrnan.
Some weeks later, Colonel I. H. Dube, a former battalion
commander of the 147th Regiment, was scheduled to appear
at the Avondale public school auditorium. Dube was the
Republican candidate for the post of county commissioner.
When the colonel's turn came, he directed his attack on the
fantastic waste of men and material in the conduct of the
war. As the colonel spoke, Stern reflected. What had the
enormous extravagance in the conduct of war—for which the
nation was even more grotesquely unprepared—to do with
the duties of a county commissioner? What had army mules
and bugles and harnesses to do with the responsibilities of
a county commissioner? In how many distinctive ways was
a former army officer and present-day high school manual
training teacher unquestionably qualified for the office of
county commissioner? Was military service the highest, the
surest test of a man's civilian administrative skill?
From the meetings in the apartment house basement and
the public school auditorium, Stern and his sister moved on,
in the progress of the campaign, to the grand climax at
Music Hall, where about five thousand men and women
awaited the arrival of the man from Marion, Ohio, Senator
Warren G. Harding, the Republican candidate for the Presi-
dency. By bewildering twists and turns, Stern and his sister
were shepherded through the thousands that lined the streets
outside of Cincinnati's largest assembly hall. Colonel Dube
and Captain Heintz were among the several hundred seated
on the stage. With them were other notable Republican
workers like General P. Lincoln Mitchell, also a former mem-
ber of the 37th Division.
As Harding spoke, it was quickly evident that here was
not a William Jennings Bryan, the master orator of the
Democratic Party. Nor was Harding the peer of William E.
Borah, the Demosthenes of the Republican Party, whose
eloquence and parliamentary showmanship had made his

name famous throughout the world. Stern had heard both
Bryan and Borah on a number of occasions. Their oratory,
he noted, had an electrifying effect on every audience. And
as Harding spoke, Stern concluded that not the senator from
Ohio, but rather Borah, the senator from Idaho, would strike
the most effective blows against the competing Democratic
forces lined up behind Governor James M. Cox of Ohio and
Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York.
“Harding is a very handsome man,” Dinah whispered.
The senator from Ohio spoke with a restraint rarely ex-
hibited by political candidates. But his voice was strong and
his arguments were cogent. Outright opposition to certain
provisions in the League of Nations covenant and return to
the glory of former days of comparative freedom from old-
world intrigues formed the substance of his Music Hall
address.
And now, after five years of undiminished zeal—with
Calvin Coolidge, Harding's successor, well established in the
White House and working quietly and efficiently with a strong
Republican majority in the Congress—Captain Heintz, hav-
ing fomented the revolution against the stodgy Hynicka
suzerainty, was about to deal a staggering blow to the Re-
publican stronghold in Cincinnati at the 1925 November
election.
The opening barrage was laid down at the pre-election
rally at the Hotel Sinton. When they entered the hotel ball-
room that summer evening, Captain Heintz came forward to
greet the rabbi and his sister. The assemblage had more of
a church or college atmosphere than that of an old-fashioned
convivial political gathering. Here the men and women came
from the upper stratum of Cincinnati's population. Here
also were some of the community's leading clergymen. The
presence of women and clergymen indicated that the City
Charter Committee's campaign would inaugurate a radical
departure in vote-getting techniques. It meant that the can-
didates of the City Charter Committee would be as welcome

in church and synagogue vestry rooms as hitherto aspiring
politicians had been inured to basements and bar rooms.
The nine City Council candidates offered by the Char-
terites had been selected because of intellectual competence
and unalloyed civic-mindedness, regardless of partisan affilia-
tion. The target of their brief “fighting” talks was Rudolph
Hynicka, still haughtily ensconced in his palatial apartment
far away in New York City. The “smallpox-like” appearance
of the city's highways was pointed out as the clearest mani-
festation of malodorous fiscal manipulations.
The fastidiously chosen candidates of the City Charter
Committee promised an efficient business administration
directed by a well-paid City Manager of flawless integrity
and exceptional ability, as well as the liquidation of the huge
municipal debt. There would be an end to patronage ap-
pointments. The five thousand municipal employees would
be placed under civil service. With it all, they promised that
there would be relief from burdensome, inequitable taxation.
The last candidate introduced was the twenty-eight-year-
old Charles P. Taft, son of the twenty-seventh President and
the then Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court,
William Howard Taft. Charles P. Taft was the committee's
choicest standard-bearer. He was a war veteran, a lawyer
of no mean ability, a man already high in the councils of
church and civic societies. Taft, the scion of one of Cincin-
nati's most illustrious families, was the emblem and the seal
of the Charterites’ impeccable motive behind the bid for
control at City Hall.
Taft was debonair. His manner of speech was as well
suited to the ballroom as it was to any fashionable drawing
room. He was almost boyish in buoyancy and jocularity.
His speech, too, was brief. It consisted entirely of an illus-
trative anecdote: an irate mountaineer mother's tart response
to a schoolteacher's complaint about her pupil’s need for a
thorough cleansing.

Spurred on by the press and the pulpit, the Charterite
hosts joined battle with the entrenched Republicans. Along
with hundreds of similarly inspired women, Dinah Stern went
from door to door. She urged her neighbors to throw out
the rascally Republicans. She pleaded with them to be sure
to go to the polls and vote for Taft and for Murray Season-
good and for the seven other Charterite candidates. Her
brother Simon, whom Captain Heintz had chosen as precinct
committeeman, also took an active part in the spiritually
uplifting struggle for power.
The battle raged on even more furiously at the polls, at
which the Charterites maintained a relentless vigil until the
last ballot bag was sealed and carried off to the central
counting room. After nearly a week's absorbing legerdemain
tabulation, the official results were announced: three Council
seats for the Republicans, six for the Charterites. In No-
vember, 1923, the official count had given one seat to the
Democrats, thirty-one to the Republicans. The jubilation of
the victorious City Charter Committee was unrestrained. The
triumph of Captain Heintz was exquisite.
And thus the “Queen City of the West,” which had been
the first to introduce the stationary bathtub, the first to insti-
tute a system of free night school education, the birthplace
of the United States Weather Bureau, the city which had
cradled the People's Party, the Union Labor Party, the United
Labor Party, the United Reform Party and the Liberal Re-
publican Party (1872); the city which had cradled American
Reform Judaism and its auxiliary institutions; on the first day
of January, 1926, gave to the world a pattern and promise
of “more perfect” municipal government. Could it withstand
the fierce, inevitable recrudescence of the party spirit, the
insidious blandishments of veneer-reformers, and, above all,
the most fatal of all corrosive elements, the insouciance of
the good citizens themselves?

CHAPTER IV
SARNOFF'S MUSIC BOX
create Adam, the progenitor of all the races of man,
He gathered quantities of dust from every part of the
earth. This parable of the cosmopolitan composition of man
may be applied to the creative evolution of radio. Out of
Uzlian, a village in western Russia, in the year 1900, came
nine-year-old David Sarnoff, and settled with his parents in
New York City. By some strange turn of the wheel of des-
tiny, six years later, Sarnoff found employment in the lab-
oratory of the Italian-born wizard of wireless, Guglielmo
Marconi.
On April 14, 1912, it was telegrapher Sarnoff of the Mar-
coni Wireless Company of America who reported to a
stunned world the sinking of the iceberg-struck S.S. Titanic.
For seventy-two hours, Sarnoff was the sole contact between
the rescue ship S.S. Carpathia and an anxious world. Soon
after, the Congress of the United States enacted legislation
requiring every ship carrying more than fifty persons to be
equipped with wireless.
World War I and the mortal menace of German sub-
marines made it possible for Sarnoff and his co-workers to
demonstrate the vast superiority of radio communication over
vulnerable ocean-bedded cables. Then a comparatively triv-
ial incident captured the world spotlight—the Dempsey-
Carpentier heavyweight boxing bout. Interest in this sports
event was extraordinary. Sarnoff was quick to exploit the
combination of favorable circumstances. On July 2, 1921,
from Boyle's Thirty Acres, Jersey City, New Jersey, with a
transmitter borrowed from the Navy, Sarnoff, general man-
$2: tells that when the Almighty was about to

ager of the newly formed Radio Corporation of America,
broadcast a blow-by-blow description of the four-round ex-
hibition of human stamina and sadism to tens of thousands
far removed from the arena.
The blood and the sweat and the excitement that flowed
from the Dempsey-Carpentier battle stirred the imagination
of the nation and opened the checkbooks of previously cau-
tious investors. Sarnoff's 1915 vision of a “music-box” be-
came the blueprint for frantic manufacturers everywhere.
Within a few years, David Sarnoff, self-trained, was master
of the practical application of the science of electronics. His
divinely intuitive powers and faith, his sagacity and audacity
made him supreme also in the art of production and distri-
bution. His name was linked with such benefactors of civili-
zation as Morse, Bell, Edison, Steinmetz, Pupin, Marconi,
and Ford.
The telephone, the motorcar, and the airplane had all but
erased the boundary lines between village and village, be-
tween city and city, between nation and nation. Sarnoff's
music-box sent forth wave upon wave of light, penetrating
the minds and the hearts of millions of listening men, women,
and children. The waves of light flooding those minds and
hearts with information and entertainment would slowly begin
to break down the walls which divided men into denomina-
tions, political parties, and nationalities. Seated at home,
Democrats would, in time, hear the arguments of their Re-
publican opponents; Catholics and Protestants, the Message
of Israel. The mountain-locked herdsmen of Montana would,
in time, listen to the voices of Chamberlain and Hitler.
True to the vanguard spirit and tradition of her builders,
Cincinnati was among the first to plant the seeds of a radio
broadcasting system. On the second day of March, 1922,
Cincinnati's “The Nation's Station,” WLW, went on the air.
Three months later, in San Francisco, Milton Stern, Na-
tional Chaplain of the Disabled American Veterans, stood
before the radio broadcasting apparatus of the Hearst Inter-

national News Service. Stern placed his hand gingerly on
the microphone before him. It resembled the familiar tele-
phone mouthpiece.
“Just talk into that speaker, Chaplain, as though you were
chatting with friends over the telephone,” said the station
manager. “We want you to send a message to our hospitalized
veterans in Hawaii. Tell them a few of your impressions of
San Francisco and this second DAV national convention.
I am sure the boys will be glad to hear from their national
chaplain. Go ahead!”
Stern hesitated. Then words poured into the unseen beyond.
He was skeptical. Was this a stunt? Was the radio just an-
other mechanical toy? There were no cables, no wires strung
from pole to pole across the more than two thousand miles
of ocean. What listening machines were available to the men
in Hawaii? Quickly the sense of novelty and incredulity
vanished. The miracle of the radio filled him with that
emotion of exaltation which accompanies great moments of
discovery and accomplishment.
In Cincinnati his brother Simon had put together a receiv-
ing device then styled a crystal set. Now and then, on a
Sunday morning, Simon would place the earpieces on his
brother's head and Stern could hear what was called static,
then a stream of words which faded and thundered alternately.
A Christian preacher was delivering his sermon. The young
Jewish clergyman wondered what his ultra-pious mother and
stepfather would say when they learned that their sons were
hearing forbidden words.
While the members of the Stern family were toying with
the crude crystal set, their neighbor, Bob Arthur, was the
proud owner of a greatly improved radio receiver. Bob, a
high school athletic coach, was confined to his bed for three
years, shackled by the coils of tuberculosis. Not less than
sunshine, rest, and abundant good food, radio provided Bob
with an almost supernatural morale-sustaining fellowship with
the outside world.

One evening in September, 1926, Stern and his sister called
on Bob. As they seated themselves, Bob said quietly: “I
have two surprises for you. Here's a model ship I have just
completed. I carved it with my penknife.”
Dinah placed the ship in her brother's hands. It was
superb workmanship, with deck, masts, and sails.
“Now, Milt, here's surprise Number 2. How would you
like to hear the Dempsey–Tunney fight?” Bob's voice was
vibrant with excitement. “And you won't have to go to
Philadelphia, where there are more than 125,000 spectators.
Now listen!”
There was a moment or two of silence. Then a sharp
click. Another moment of silence. Then came the sound of
rapid-fire talk and the shouts of the multitude. They had
been transported to ringside seats in Philadelphia. As Bob
explained between rounds, a new feature, a large-sized am-
plifier attached to the set, made clear reception possible.
Stern and Dinah were enthralled.
The next morning Dinah telephoned a dealer. They ar-
ranged for the purchase of a large radio set, a gift for their
mother. It was very much like a cabinet phonograph. Ac-
cessories such as batteries and amplifier and tubes were
installed separately. The grand price, about one thousand
dollars.
As Stern and his mother sat entranced before the wonder
box, he reflected on the meaning and force of this monu-
mental achievement of man. Like the mythical Pandora's
box, radio brought with it a multiplicity of strange sounds
and voices, a veritable Niagara of words. With it also came,
as in the story of Pandora's box, a mighty, universal hope.
Now at last men everywhere would be united in thought
through the instantaneous broadcast of noble ideals. In some
mysterious, marvelous way, radio would forge a new world
order of peace, brotherhood, and plenty for all.
Along with baseball stars, musicians, melodists, come-
dians, boxers, and preachers, politicians came into the home.

For the first time, perhaps, the words of the politician would
be heard, not alone by loyal partisans, but by opposition and
independent voters.
What would be the outcome of this infinite extension of
the politician's voice? By the very nature of his profession,
the politician must appeal to the emotions and selfish inter-
ests. The philosopher, the preacher, the pundit, the innu-
merable towncriers were like the musician, the athlete, and
the minstrel. Their words and actions were, for the most
part, evanescent entertainment. But the voice of the poli-
tician was presumably the voice of the statesman—the man
ordained to establish order and beauty in society. Would
the radio bring about a revolutionary, radical change in the
politician's technique of vote-solicitation?
Among those who gave timely, invaluable encouragement
during radio's precarious infancy was Franklin D. Roosevelt,
the patrician-politician, Assistant Secretary of the Navy in
World War I. When he was the Democratic Party's candi-
date for the Vice-Presidency in 1920, it might well have been
said of him, as it was written of Saul, King of Israel: “. . . a
choice young man, . . . and there was not among the chil-
dren of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders
and upward he was higher than any of the people.”
And now in the early summer of 1928, the period for the
new election of a citizen to administer the executive govern-
ment of the United States being not far distant, the time had
actually arrived when the thoughts of the people were em-
ployed in designating the person who was to be clothed with
that important trust.
It was late evening of June 27, 1928. Rabbi Stern sat at
his typewriter, absorbed in the self-assigned day-by-day task
of recording in book form his recollections of uncommon
scenes in which he had been privileged to play a part in
World War I. Suddenly he paused. His sister was calling
excitedly: “Come down, Milt!” Stern walked into the dining
room. His mother, Dinah, and the thirteen-year-old Sidney

were at the radio. “They're about to place Governor Alfred
E. Smith's name in nomination,” Dinah said. “Franklin D.
Roosevelt will deliver the nominating speech. I understand,
as a speaker, he is mediocre. He's been out of politics for
a number of years and came to Houston from the hospital at
Warm Springs, Georgia. Things are rather quiet now. They're
waiting for Roosevelt. It will be a little while before he is
ready to speak.”
The proceedings were broadcast from the Sam Houston
Convention Hall with the same precision, thoroughness, and
dramatic fidelity as were the world championship boxing
bouts and Charles A. Lindbergh's homeric non-stop flight
across the Atlantic. The well-modulated, beautifully enun-
ciating voices of the convention narrators added dignity and
majesty. Yet none was so gifted with clairvoyance as to di-
vine that within a few moments an incident would usher in
a volcanic epoch of immeasurable duration and consequence.
It was certain that the convention delegates were grimly
determined not to reenact the 1924 New York Madison
Square Garden fiasco. The bitter issues of religion, section-
alism, and prohibition were sedulously pigeonholed, at least
temporarily. The Governor of the great State of New York,
Alfred Emanuel Smith, the idol of Manhattan, the first Roman
Catholic candidate for the Presidency of the United States,
would be nominated on the first ballot.
Alfred E. Smith's unequaled record as New York's Gov-
ernor stamped him indisputably as a political genius. His
integrity, patriotism, capacity for leadership, and character
were well-nigh unassailable. As a product of the Tammany
machine, he reformed it instead of letting it run him in the
corrupt old-boss style. Smith had pulled himself up out of
the East Side slums to the highest civic rung by the strength
and power of natural talents. Alfred E. Smith was a shining
light in the American constellation of statesmen. Most per-
suasively, for the convention delegates, the brilliant master
of statecraft, with captivating mannerisms and unaffected

idiosyncrasies of speech, was a champion in the elusive art of
winning elections.
Protestant, well-born, well-bred, Tammany-molded Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt, the politician with a golden talismanic
name, had been Alfred E. Smith's personal choice to detonate
the wild demonstration instantly the nominating speech was
concluded. As an orator, Roosevelt was not among the
mighty men of speech. None who heard him before he was
cut down in his physical prime would acclaim him as another
William Jennings Bryan or even as the equal of Alfred E.
Smith.
It was a climactic moment for the 18,000 delegates and
spectators in the convention hall and for the millions at their
radios. Tension mounted as Roosevelt reached the edge of
the platform. Here was a man, Apollo-like, yet the lower
part of his body was supported by heavy steel braces and a
pair of crutches. Strong men lifted him onto the upper level.
The radio narrator's voice was choked. Then a prolonged
hush; the introduction. Then Roosevelt spoke: “I come for
the third time to urge upon a convention of my party the
nomination of the Governor of the State of New York. The
whole country now has learned the measure of his great-
ness. . . .”
Every syllable was distinct. Each word rang out with con-
fidence. Each phrase, each clause, each sentence vibrated
with conviction and with deep sincerity. This was not ora-
tory. For nearly thirty minutes he spoke. He emphasized
the nation's good. He portrayed the Governor as the path-
finder for all true lovers of humanity. For the highest of the
nation's gifts, he said, the Governor possessed every quali-
fication.
This was not oratory. The alchemy of David Sarnoff's
music-box endowed Franklin D. Roosevelt with a new and
superior power whereby his words were transformed into a
kind of subtle, irresistible, intoxicating perfume. This was
hypnosis, above and beyond oratory, approaching the occult.

A man and a machine—Roosevelt and radio—had become
one flesh, one spirit.
The voice, as if from Mount Sinai, concluded: “America
needs not only an administrator, but a leader—a pathfinder,
a blazer of the trail to the high road that will avoid the
bottomless morass of crass materialism that has engulfed so
many of the great civilizations of the past. It is the privilege
of Democracy not only to offer such a man, but to offer him
as the surest leader to victory. To stand upon the ramparts
and die for our principles is heroic. To sally forth to battle
and win for our principles is something more than heroic.
We offer one who has the will to win—who not only deserves
success but commands it. Victory is his habit—the happy
warrior—Alfred E. Smith.”

CHAPTER V
GOLD AND APPLES
Stern and her brother registered at the Windsor Hotel
in Poughkeepsie, New York, a city about midway be-
tween Albany and New York City, on the east bank of the
Hudson River. They came to this long-established com-
munity for an evening meeting with a small Jewish women's
organization. This short visit to the city famous for its
annual intercollegiate boat races and Vassar College was
part of an extensive three-month itinerary. New York City
was the chief area and the pivot of their roving ministry,
which extended to Cumberland, Maryland, on the south, and
Northampton, Massachusetts, to the north.
Stern and his sister had left Cincinnati for New York City
late Tuesday evening, October the twenty-ninth. It was the
day on which millions of shares on the New York stock
market were buried under an avalanche of sales, the second
of three consecutive and stupendous stock market devalua-
tions. On that day billions of dollars worth of inflated profits
were obliterated. On that day gorgeous illusions of great
wealth were shattered. On that day the lifetime savings, im-
prudent loans, and the illusions of hundreds of thousands of
frenzied speculators were swept away by the pitiless avalanche
whose coming had been widely forecast—but not heeded.
During the days, weeks, and months that followed the
three (October 24th, October 29th, and November 30th)
major convulsions on the floor of the New York Stock Ex-
change, Dinah and her brother blithely walked the streets of
&: in the afternoon of December 4, 1929, Dinah

the great metropolis. They traveled by subway, elevated, bus,
and taxi. They dined in restaurants and hotels, and in the
homes of numerous friends. As on his four previous trips
to this most cosmopolitan of cities, Stern found railway sta-
tions, theatres, shops, and department stores swarming with
laughing, freely gesticulating, vital people. The press and
the radio carried voluminous details of the “crash,” includ-
ing stories of an unusually large number of suicides. But the
tone and general atmosphere of the city were scarcely indica-
tive of an awareness of the imminence of a staggering calam-
ity. The universal mood of the people was hardly sympto-
matic of a consciousness that a world-wide social and
economic catastrophe was inevitable.
If one dared to speak frankly, without fear of being
charged with sardonic levity, it could be said that jesting
about the universal misfortune was as common as the trait
of jocularity is part and parcel of the American temperament.
There was genuine compassion for the thousands whose fairy
fortunes had vanished. There was wholehearted sympathy
for the families of the men who chose death on the sidewalks.
But the pervading disposition was perhaps best summed up
in Comedian Eddie Cantor's rollicking, lucrative booklet,
Caught Short. Cantor, along with untold members of his
profession, had lost millions of dollars in the financial debacle.
Why should the city which had weathered blizzards, plagues,
war, and ten commercial paroxysms now be overwhelmed in
these brave days of scientific marvels by a colossal reduction
in the paper wealth of many of her citizens?
Practically everybody, from bootblack to clergyman, in-
cluding economists and professors, had gambled with shares
of common stock. At bottom, the urge to “get-rich-quick”
and easy was a common mania. What had happened in New
York City in the autumn of 1929 was but a vast extension
of the Charles Ponzi swindle in the early 1920's in Boston.
Under the name of the Securities Exchange Company and
with the promise to double one's investment in six months,

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 33
Ponzi had lured clerks, stenographers, immigrants, and small
businessmen to turning over millions of dollars for his per-
sonal enrichment.
Long after the days of doom had thundered away, the
sense of personal guilt was sincere and courageous. With it
went the charitable confession that both Presidents Coolidge
and Hoover had been humanly in error in their unwillingness
to curb the madness in land as well as in stock speculation.
The two Presidents and their Secretary of the Treasury, An-
drew Mellon, had frowned on economists and bankers like
Paul Warburg who had prophesied disaster. Back of the
unalterable spirit of optimism exhibited by the Administra-
tion in Washington was the apparently unceasing flow of
gold into America. The United States had acquired nearly
half the world's gold reserve. It was richer than any nation
ever had been.
Assured of the financial stability of the country, confident
that there would be no end of jobs for all who could and
were willing to work, cheered on by bulletins issued in Wash-
ington, twenty million men and women, of their own free
will, withdrew long-time savings from their banks. Money
which should have gone into the purchase of essential com-
modities and sound investment was recklessly poured into
the deep pits of the stock exchange.
And this spirit of courageous optimism prevailed through-
out the land for months after the autumn of 1929. It per-
sisted until the evil spirits of cynicism, lawlessness, and
Kremlin-socialism undermined a living faith, the foundation
of the great nation of home owners, with their motorcars,
radios, electric refrigerators, telephones, automatic central
heating, intercollegiate boat races, their Vassar Colleges, and
their hundreds of well-ordered, well-integrated little cities
like Poughkeepsie on the majestic Hudson.
The evening meeting with the Jewish women of Pough-
keepsie on December 4, 1929, undoubtedly would be a
pleasant experience. The visit to Poughkeepsie would be

just another excursion in their winged ministry. The student
body at Vassar College would be very much like the groups
of Jewish students they had chatted with at Princeton, Rut-
gers, Harvard, and on other campuses. The women they
would talk to in Poughkeepsie would not be as memorable
as were the men and women whom they met at the various
state penal institutions. So Dinah and her brother surmised.
But an hour after their arrival, Dinah and her brother
accompanied Mrs. Tinkelman, their hostess, to a Parent-
Teachers Association meeting. The principal speaker was to
be the wife of New York’s Governor. The Smith School
assembly hall was well filled. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt
was speaking when Stern and his sister entered and were
seated in the rear of the hall. The voice of the Governor's
wife was warm, though diffident. Her manner was very much
like that of a grandmother communing with teen-agers. She
spoke frankly, perhaps too intimately. She told of her grand-
mother and of her own early life. She described her methods
of disciplining her five children. When she responded to
inquiries, Mrs. Roosevelt was even more ingenuous, artlessly
frank.
Significantly, there was no word about the Wall Street
binge and nightmare. The formal session ended, Dinah
looked about the hall, curious to see how Mrs. Roosevelt
would mingle with the crowd. She was astonished. Mrs.
Roosevelt stood alone in a corner of the auditorium. The
women of Poughkeepsie flitted about, seemingly oblivious of
the presence of the first lady of their great state.
“Mrs. Tinkelman,” Dinah asked, “isn't it strange? Mrs.
Roosevelt is standing there all alone. Why doesn't someone
engage her in conversation? After all, she is the guest speaker
and the Governor's wife!”
“The Roosevelts are not very popular in Dutchess County,”
answered a woman nearby.
Stern and his sister returned to New York City late that
night. The days and the weeks that followed the Pough-

keepsie interlude rolled into the yesterdays of time. Each
day had been filled with stirring incidents: unstinted hospi-
tality, thousands of auditors, and an unusual variety of audi-
ences. Never was there any intimation of the deep trial and
tribulation which loomed ahead. Neither in Atlantic City
nor in Baltimore, nor yet in the national capital did they
detect any sign of economic, social, or political rumblings of
revolutionary change.
A one-day sojourn in Washington, on January 30, 1930,
was unscheduled, a stopover before returning to Cincinnati.
An unexpected telephone call from Baltimore brought with
it an invitation to spend the night at Colonel Jonathan May-
hew Wainwright's Washington home, a three-story mansion
on R Street. At dinner in the Wainwright residence, Stern
told of meeting the Colonel's brother in Scranton. Dr. Wain-
wright, a famous surgeon, was then somewhere in Central
Africa, leading a medical expedition bent on discovering vital
data on cancer control. Fonrose Wainwright, the Colonel's
daughter, spoke of the play which she had recently com-
pleted. Mrs. Wainwright recalled Stern's student days at the
Baltimore Red Cross School for the Blind. And when Colonel
Wainwright spoke, Dinah and her brother listened with
admiration. His words were measured. His voice was like
a muted trumpet.
Colonel Wainwright was a veteran of the Spanish-American
War. In World War I he served with the 27th Division, New
York National Guard. He was the recipient of the Distin-
guished Service Medal and the French Legion of Honor rib-
bon. He had been president of the New York Bar Association.
In the Harding Administration, he was Assistant Secretary
of War. Now he was completing his fourth term in Congress
as Republican Representative from Rye, Westchester County,
New York.
Seated in this regal dining room and flanked on either side
by his wife and daughter, women of extraordinary distinc-
tion and refinement, granite-hewn Colonel Wainwright was

36 *ēs R E D POT TA GE
the personification, the pattern, of the classical American
patriot. And while the conversation touched on many themes,
Colonel Wainwright's chief concern was the preservation of
the high spiritual standards of the nation. His immediate
interest was centered on the enactment by Congress of a
national flag code.
One year later, now accompanied by his wife, Stern re-
turned to New York City for a second three-month tour of
rabbinical duties. He came with undiminished zest and un-
alloyed anticipation. He had completed a circuit of states:
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ver-
mont, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Washington, D. C.,
and the Dominion of Canada. But in January, 1931, New
York City was shrouded in gloom. A thick, almost palpable
fog of depression hung over it from the Bronx to Brooklyn.
Less than two years after Herbert Hoover had moved into
the Executive Mansion in Washington, the Great Depression
paralyzed the nation. One year after the Wall Street calamity,
it seemed as though the waters from all the fountains of the
deep, from all the windows of heaven, and from the rain in
all the clouds, had suddenly engulfed the millions of men
and women in this great country. As in the case of a major
Ohio or Mississippi River flood, the Great Depression began
with floodlets, among the towns and villages, among the little
cities of the nation, remote from the tributaries, the great
centers of industry and finance. And all the raging waters of
despair roared into New York City. These same waters were
agitated, and their wild force was aggravated by the like
torrents of despair rolling across the Atlantic Ocean from
the gold-minded, tariff-bound, communist-racked, revolution-
born countries of Europe.
And when the flood of that Great Depression mounted and
struck, and, on December 11, 1930, brought down New
York's Bank of the United States with its 62 branches and
its 400,000 depositors—the largest bank failure in American
history—despair gave way to fright and fright to panic. Yet


## p. 37 (#61) ##############################################

R E D POT TA GE 2-5" 37
the outward manifestations of panic were, for the most part,
heroically bridled. There were runs on the banks, but no
riots. There were hastily drawn up relief organizations, pri-
vate and public, but no bristling barricades manned by des-
perate men and women. There were Salvation Army soup
kitchens, New York Journal-American sandwich trucks, bread
lines—but no assaults on food shops or warehouses. There
were men and women by the hundreds walking the streets,
but no mobs storming police stations. Stern and his wife saw
scores of the more than six thousand apple sellers on the
sidewalks of New York, but there was no word of rebellion
or contumely. The paramount goal was employment—a job.
Unemployment, largely induced by the flood waters of de-
spair, which, in its turn, had been set off by the abrupt shut-
down of Wall Street's twelve thousand nationwide tickers,
had brought about an industrial paralysis, a hardening of the
arteries of commerce.
The spectacle of millions of able-bodied men and women
doggedly, drearily walking the streets of a great city, in
search of work, is civilization's supreme irony. It is grotesque.
No savage is ever as helpless as an unemployed highly
trained artisan or craftsman. For all of civilization is very
much like a human being. Its life processes can be deranged
by the merest disturbance of its sensitive, complex mechanism.
In 1931, unemployment spread as had the appalling pan-
demic influenza plague of 1918. Manifold and baffling as
were the contributing factors, the most sinister and the most
decisive was that of consumers’ or buyers' flight from the
market place, combined with the frantic hoarding of money,
the vital medium of exchange which alone could keep the
farms and the factories of the world in operation and pro-
ductive. In vain did the weary, impatient masses of the peo-
ple look to the state and federal governments for swift relief.
In vain did the President plead with his countrymen to hold
fast to faith. Herbert Hoover called for a new song, for
another “Battle Hymn of the Republic” to inspire new cour-

age, new confidence. In vain did Walt Disney offer the nation
the tuneful, lilting “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?”
Was this mockery? Was this a modern version of Marie
Antoinette’s “Then why don't they eat cake?”—a song in-
stead of a job? What had come over the world's greatest
humanitarian who had so recently rescued Europe's millions
from disease and starvation? What had happened to the mag-
nificent public servant who, during the one-thousand-mile
Mississippi River flood of 1927, rescued nearly two million
persons from the ravages of that deluge? What had become
of the world-famous engineer whose divining rod had wrought
industrial miracles for the British, the Chinese, and the
Russians?
A national election was close at hand. Here was the
chance for the Democratic Party to recapture control of the
Government.
Out came a flood of cynical, searing publicity releases from
the pen of the Democratic Party's propaganda chief, jour-
nalist Charles Michelson. Herbert Hoover was the all-too-
perfect target. When nations all over the world were clamor-
ing for dictators astride white horses, for dazzling men of
action, no better scapegoat could have been found than this
man of almost excessive humility, utterly devoid of guile,
publicity-shy, mild-mannered, soft-spoken Herbert Hoover,
who sedulously refused to engage in circus-like controversy
with a power-hungry Democratic Party majority in the
Congress.
All the venom, all the vituperation, all the malice engen-
dered by Alfred E. Smith's defeat in November, 1928, were
directed against Herbert Hoover in the White House. Noth-
ing, however vile, would be omitted in this calculated cam-
paign to destroy the nation's confidence, trust, and faith in
the character and administrative ability of Herbert Hoover.
Nor did it seem to matter that the entire country, indeed the
world, would be further plagued by the devastating effects
of this unprincipled program of character assassination. The

very confusion, chaos, and lack of confidence in Herbert
Hoover, which the Democratic National Headquarters would
promote, would be the Democratic Party's chief claim to
political power. They would then have little difficulty in
convincing the masses of voters that a clean sweep out of
the national capital of Herbert Hoover and the Republican
Party would mark the first step toward the end of the Great
Depression.
And in the vanguard of the Democratic Party's ruthless
pre-election campaign against President Hoover was New
York’s Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Soon Roosevelt
would be pursuing a vigorous, highly individualized canvass
of Democratic convention delegates to win for himself, in
the summer of 1932, the Party's nomination for the Presi-
dency.
Under these melancholy circumstances, should Franklin
D. Roosevelt ride into the White House on the wings of the
economic whirlwind, his would then be the victory of a
Vandal. It would not be the victory of Wordsworth's Happy
Warrior who “labors good on good to fix, and owes to virtue
every triumph that he knows.”

CHAPTER VI
“Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,
that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
VONDALE, a Cincinnati hilltop suburb, is a unique
cºſ center of civilization. Avondale is situated three
miles north of the Ohio River, five hundred feet
above the valley. In 1931, the suburb's population was
about 25,000. Within, or contiguous to, Avondale were the
University of Cincinnati, the Hebrew Union College, Xavier
University, the Conservatory of Music, the Zoological Gar-
den, and the Schuster-Martin School of Drama. The suburb
included also eight hospitals, ten Jewish houses of worship,
two Roman Catholic churches, as well as Quaker, Episcopal,
Unitarian, Universalist, Swedenborgian, Presbyterian, and
other Protestant churches, a nine-story hotel, a College of
Embalming, and the Crematory. Within a mile beyond the
area which Avondale embraces are some of the world's most
notable manufacturing plants: Procter and Gamble Co., the
Gruen Watch Co., the United States Playing Card Co., Globe-
Wernicke Co., the Baldwin Piano Co., the American Laun-
dry Machinery Co., and the Cincinnati Milling Machine Co.
On Avondale's tree-lined streets and avenues were many
large and small apartment buildings, two-family or duplex
residential units, imposing mansions alongside modest cot-
tages and bungalows. Branch banks, chain and independent
grocery stores, automobile salesrooms, kosher butcher shops,
specialty dress shops, and a Sears-Roebuck department store
had, by the summer of 1931, transformed the once chiefly
residential suburb into a city within a city. And where only
a few years before hippety-hoppety bell-clanging trolley cars

dominated the narrow streets and thoroughfares, an ever-
increasing number of roaring, sputtering, brake-screeching,
fume-spouting—but absolutely essential—motorcars brought
a corresponding increase in hazards to life, limb, and domes-
tic tranquillity. -
On the afternoon of June 5, 1931, Rabbi Stern was at
work in his garden, some sixty feet beyond Forest Avenue,
one of Avondale's arterial highways. On either side were the
gardens of his neighbors. Beyond stretched a piece of un-
developed land, part ravine, part woods. Here, among the
irises, peonies, tulips, roses, lilacs, grapevines, and poplar
trees in his garden, Stern felt himself far, far removed from
railroad coaches, hotels, restaurants, strange pulpits, chang-
ing audiences. Now it seemed as though he were undergoing
a rebirth of body, a regeneration of spirit. The golden glow
of the sun, the gentle caress of the wind, the chatter of birds,
the fragile twigs and petals, the silent loose-grained crum-
bling clods between his fingers, lifted heart and mind above
the tension and the tumult which still lingered with him days
and often weeks after the completion of a tour.
Trowel in hand, kneeling before the flower beds, Stern re-
moved dead twigs and stalks. He loosened the soil around
each plant so that the tulips, irises, peonies, and roses might
be free to come forth in all their perennial beauty and
strength. This was the time most favorable for meditation
and clarification of thought. Things and ideas which were
dead or useless must be discarded. The ground of the soul
must be tenderly cultivated. Weeds, vain and foolish thoughts
and ideas must be rooted out and cast away.
As a rabbi, Stern had always concerned himself with
perennial, changeless, everlasting principles and laws. Weeds,
withered twigs and stalks were caricatures, distortions, false
formations which conceal but never obliterate eternal values.
In his last address, “The Dilemma of Democracy,” Stern had
little to say about the current industrial and financial crisis.
As a vivid and dramatic illustration of his appeal for the

restoration of the high standards of public service, of which
the aristocrat George Washington was the exemplar, Stern
recalled the Biblical parable, “The trees went forth, on a
time, to anoint a king over them.” After the trees had been
rebuffed by the olive, the fig, and the vine, they approached
the bramble. “If in truth,” answered the bramble, “ye anoint
me king over you, then come and put your trust in my
shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble and
devour the cedars of Lebanon.”
In his analysis of the dilemma of democracy, he had said:
“When the foundations of moral and spiritual excellence are
destroyed, what can a nation do in the hour of trial? To be
free from the pettiness of political partisanship, to be liberated
from the temptation to win votes by appealing to the lowest
instincts of fellow citizens, to be vigilant lest bribery poison
the heart and blind the eye, the chosen administrators of the
nation must be imbued, even as was George Washington,
with a profound sense of the immanence and the justice of
God. . . . The lovers of America must yet be taught that
‘government of the people, by the people, for the people’ will
perish from the earth so long as the vilest men, the bramble
spirits, continue to be exalted to leadership in the nation.”
As yet, Stern was not poignantly touched by the ravages of
the Great Depression. His deepest concern was with the
advent of a child. The perennial revival of flowers was a
stirring exhibition of natural science and divine artistry. The
airplane and radio, the skyscraper and gargantuan cities,
were monuments to the power of man, “the highest part of
the dust of the world.” Civilization and the genius for politi-
cal government were superb demonstrations of the intelli-
gence, imagination, industry, and cooperative talents of man.
Yet none of these could be compared with the miracle of
miracles—from everlasting to everlasting—the mystery sur-
mounting all mysteries, the glory transcending all glory of
creation: the birth of a child. And Leah Stern was now
with child.

The months of constant travel and readjustment had had
no ill effect on Leah. There was nothing to worry about. The
birth of a child was as simple a process as the emergence
of leaves and buds on tree, bush, and flower. Whatever the
gloom and the weight of the Great Depression on New York
City, Stern remembered the never-failing parade of mothers
wheeling their babies along upper Broadway, whenever the
sun—apparently unaware of the Great Depression—came
forth and carpeted the avenue with its rich, warm rays. They
were proud mothers. The babies all seemed well-fed, well-
clothed.
What cause, then, for disquietude? What of his blindness?
Was this talent-deprivation transmissible? He had been as-
sured that blindness due to trauma was not in the same
category with hereditary disease or deformity. As he joyfully
labored in his garden, his most fervent prayer was that he
would be blessed with a child without a blemish, perfect in
beauty and strength as the rose and the peony.
Stern was not even remotely in doubt as to his ability to
provide the financial means for the support of a family. The
commodious house in which he, Leah, and Dinah lived was
mortgage-free. He was unencumbered by debt. The cottage
which his stepfather, mother, and Sidney called their own
was also mortgage-clear, through his aid. Stern had helped
set up his brother Simon as an independent merchant. Simon
was now an enterprising small businessman and the proud
father of a son. And as long as he chose, Stern was confident
that he himself would continue on the staff of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, sure of many years of
stimulating activity and a substantial income.
The gift of a child would mark the fifth major victory in
Stern's arduous ascent up his irregularly routed mountain to
full manhood. Restoration to health and strength in an army
hospital. His ordination as a Rabbi. An eight-year traveling
ministry during which he walked with a song in his heart in
the land of the living. Marriage, by means of which he had

taken a firmer grip on life's realities. Now, a child of his own
flesh and blood would represent his personal unit of replenish-
ment of the stock of his fathers, his form of assurance of the
continuity, the preservation, and the immortality of his kind.
Ruth was born early the next morning. Her weight was
less than five pounds, and she was placed in an incubator.
As Dinah and Stern chatted with Leah in her hospital room,
Leah was almost hysterical with joy. She seemed to have
acquired an increase in vitality.
“I’m sorry, Milt, it's not a boy. But she is a beautiful little
girl.”
Leah told the story of the delivery with vivacity and with
a piquant sense of the irony of her position. For three years,
in New York and Baltimore hospitals, as head nurse of Ma-
ternity, she had assisted in the always thrilling moments of
ushering little strangers into the world. Leah was exultant.
While there had been unexpected difficulties, the condition
of infant and mother was good.
Dinah returned after a few moments’ visit to the nursery
window.
“Milt,” she whispered, “your baby is the most beautiful
child I have ever seen. She looks like something exquisitely
carved as a cameo. Every feature is perfect.”
An hour later, as Stern and his sister ascended the broad
steps leading to the massive portals of the neo-classic, Ken-
tucky-stone structure of the Rockdale Avenue Temple, they
paused to greet a friend from Williamson, West Virginia.
Stern's jubilant heart became heavy when the friend told him
that he had come to mourn the death of a twenty-one-year-old
daughter who had lost her life in an automobile crash several
days before. At the same time, at the Orthodox synagogue
one block away, Stern's stepfather and mother were offering
up prayers of thanksgiving for “the fruit of the womb.”
The days that followed were filled with moments and hours
of dazzling exhilaration preparing for the return of Leah and
the introduction of Ruth to the Avondale circle of neighbors

and friends, family and home. Accompanied alternately by
Dinah and Sidney, Stern made regular visits to the Jewish
Hospital. Leah was lighthearted. She looked upon her con-
finement as an opportunity of living again in a much-loved
hospital environment.
Monday afternoon, two days later, Leah was visibly dis-
traught. As Stern and his sister entered the hospital room,
Leah said: “Something has happened, Milt. You look upset.
I have been waiting for you to tell me what Dr. Romuly said
to you. I've been worried.”
“How is Ruth?” Stern asked in a low voice.
“Dr. Siebler says she is doing very well. But please tell
me, Milt, what did Dr. Romuly say to you this morning?”
“I thought, Leah, Dr. Romuly was going to congratulate
me on the birth of our child. Instead, he bluntly told me
that, beginning September the first, I would no longer be the
national field representative of the Union of American He-
brew Congregations.” -
Leah's voice now quivered.
“You’ve lost your job?”
“Not exactly, Leah. I have been transferred to the Hebrew
Union College. My salary will be cut in half.”
“What will be your duties at the College, Milt?”
“President Romuly said the Executive Committee of the
Board of Governors decided to invite me to become an
employe of the College. I am to perform such duties as may
be determined upon in the course of time, as need and occa-
sion may arise.”
“And why did they reduce your salary, Milt?”
“Dr. Romuly explained, Leah, that at a meeting of the
Board of Governors of the College, the Budget Committee,
after a careful analysis of the financial structure of the Col-
lege funds, as affected by prevailing conditions, and with
the desire properly to safeguard its sound stability, deemed
it absolutely necessary to revise all salaries downward be-
ginning September the first.”

“Were you the only one dismissed from the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations?”
“No, there were others. That is what is going on all over
the country, Leah. We won't end the depression that way—
putting more and yet more people out of work.”
“Milt, that means we shall have to cut down considerably
on our expenditures.”
“Let’s not talk about that now, Leah. Your first duty is
to the baby. If you worry, her health will be affected as well
as your own. I have Balzac's Droll Stories here. Some of
these stories are more entertaining than any I have ever heard
or read. After we have had a good laugh, we shall be able
to think more clearly.”
“Speaking of amusing stories,” said Dinah, “Milt and I
heard one at Weber's barber shop this morning. Joe, the
porter, thinks that Herbert Hoover is the greatest man that
ever lived. The reason is that under the new emergency
relief law, which Mr. Hoover asked for, a man can now draw
pay without working.”
“It was not amusing to me, Dinah. Dr. Romuly's own
proposal was that I should retire from all rabbinical activities
and live on a pension. I was stunned. Wild thoughts ran
through my mind, and a terrible anger burned within me.
I had to choke down my fury. My face must have been white
with humiliation. Fortunately, the Executive Board of the
College made the honorable, the only ethical offer—an earned
income.”
President Hoover in Washington and Professor Romuly in
Cincinnati were not alone in offering strange fires on the high
altars of American ethical-economy whereon the cardinal
principle is the inviolable uniqueness and majesty of every
human being.
In New York City, Harry Emerson Fosdick, the eminent
Protestant clergyman, solemnly asserted: “The ultimate deci-
sion depends on one point only: can Capitalism so adjust
itself to this New World, so move out from its old individ-

ualism dominated by the profit motive into a cooperative
epoch of social planning and social control that it can become
the servant of the welfare of all the people? If it can, it can
survive. If it cannot, our children will have some form of
Communism thrust upon them.”
And in a pastoral letter, Archbishop John T. McNicholas,
of the Roman Catholic Church in Ohio, wrote: “No one
will deny man has the right to the things necessary to sustain
life. If, through no fault of his own, he be deprived of the
opportunity to labor, he still has the same right not only to
life, but to the things essential to life that his more prosperous
brother has. Anything equivalent to the dole system could
not but prove destructive to the self-respect of our people.
Taxes which would impose a greater burden on the poor and
laboring classes should not be considered; but a conscription
of excess wealth would be wholly in harmony with the prin-
ciples of Christian social justice.”
Stung and quickened by Dr. Romuly's insensate gesture of
benevolence, Stern pursued his studies at the College summer
school with augmented determination for self-development
and greater mastery of his profession. As he listened to the
intellectual play between professors and graduate students in
the classrooms, Stern felt that it is not the lack of sight which
is so distressing, but rather the limitations it places on the
freedom to be independent and self-reliant, physically and
scholastically. Stern realized that facing the daily problems
of life is a universal experience. But the overcoming of an
obstacle has the compensatory value of increasing the alert-
ness, the confidence, and the judgment of the blinded person.
There were many opportunities open to him for useful
public service. Stern decided that order, plan, program,
method, were essential to independent creative action. It
would not be enough to wait until Dr. Romuly or the Board
of Governors found a chore or two for him “in the course
of time, as need and occasion may arise.” First he would set
in order the eight years' accumulation of notes derived from


## p. 49 (#73) ##############################################

R E D POT TA GE 25" 49
his reading and writing. He would type them, day by day,
on cards, and classify and file them systematically. These
notes would then provide the material for sermons, lectures,
addresses, essays, articles, and books.
So throughout each afternoon and late into the evening,
Stern typed the notes dictated to him by his corps of readers,
among them Leah and sixteen-year-old Sidney. Slowly, labor-
iously, meticulously, sentences, paragraphs, and sometimes
pages were transcribed in this manner from newspaper and
magazine clippings, textbooks, novels, letters, reports, jot-
tings in pocket-size diaries, brochures, broadsides, sermons,
lectures, speeches, and advertisements—covering an amazing
range of subjects with special attention to religion and politi-
cal economy. And just as punctiliously they were catalogued
in a thirty-thousand-card-capacity filing cabinet.
Neither the torrid, blistering heat of the summer nor the
often overwrought, perplexed Leah in her new role as mother
and housekeeper could deter or divert Stern from his accele-
rated self-appointed daily tasks in his study. One afternoon
late in September Sidney dictated, and his brother typed on
a 6 x 4 card: “. . . about 10 P.M. on September 18, 1931,
a small explosion on the tracks of the Japanese-owned South
Manchurian Railway at Mukden. The explosion slightly
cracked two fish-plates. The damage was so minor that it
did not delay the punctual arrival at the Mukden Station,
half an hour later, of the southbound express from Changchun.
But the Japanese Army called it sabotage and killed several
hundred Chinese soldiers in nearby barracks.”
“Simultaneously,” continued Sidney, “along the entire
length of the railway, the Japanese Army, assisted by several
thousand armed reservists among the civilian Japanese, seized
Chinese barracks, airfields, and military equipment. By
next morning, Japan controlled an area in China about as
large as Italy—one of Asia's richest sections. It was probably
the quickest and cheapest conquest in the history of the
world.”

Sidney's voice was melodic. His reading of the diversified
material was praiseworthy. Stern marveled that one so young,
so high-spirited, so thoroughly normal an adolescent could
be so painstaking.
“Is the League of Nations going to do anything about this,
Milt?” Sidney asked.
“It must. Otherwise it will mean the end of the power of
the League to prevent aggression and to maintain peace
throughout the world. But let's run downstairs now, Sidney,
and listen to the radio for a few moments. We may be in
time to hear the broadcast of the last inning of the Reds'
ball game this afternoon.”

“MAKE US A KING . . . .”
winter another summer emerged, radiant in all its
perennial beauty and fulfillment of promise and uni-
versal hope. No manifesto of man, no magniloquence of the
conventions of men, could change the primordial decree:
“While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold
and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall
not cease.”
Notwithstanding his deep acceptance of the cosmic order
and grandeur, and the sovereignty, justice, and wisdom of
the King of kings, the coming of spring and summer in the
year 1932 seemed to taunt Stern's broken spirit. Though he
had toiled strenuously and systematically, the year's record
of accomplishment resembled not a garden but rather a
desert. Stern was disconsolate. It was not enough that cir-
cumstances had made it possible for him to complete the
writing of his first book, an autobiography. There was some-
thing stirring within, which could not be quenched—the fire,
the passion for public service.
It was a day of great social upheaval. The poet, the
philosopher, the true patriot had been supplanted by the
politician. While all the civilized world was electrically
charged by the lightning and thunder of words and weapons
of war, it was a mockery of his own aspirations and knightly
spirit to be thus confined, for the most part, within the four
walls of his little study in Cincinnati.
This was not a day of limited Mosaic revelation, but of
world-wide Marxian revolution. This was not the generation
9| T WAS Friday, July 1, 1932. Out of the icy cavern of
51

for exploration and discovery, as in the days of Columbus
and Magellan. It was a generation of bloody dialectic and
fratricidal extirpation on the scale of a Noachian deluge—all
in the name of the new idol: “social justice.”
Unlike other times and seasons, the eyes and the thoughts
of mediocre men were not concentrated on one meteoric
man, an Alexander or a Napoleon. Giants, strong men,
mighty men of action were springing up in almost every part
of the world: Gandhi in India, Mussolini in Italy, Mustafa
Kemal in Turkey, Chiang Kai-shek in China, Hitler in Ger-
many, Franco in Spain, Stalin in Soviet Russia. And in the
evening of this very day, Friday, July the first, out of the
Democratic National Convention's five-day travail, at the
Chicago Stadium, the United States of America would bring
forth her national apotheosis of action. Each of these mighty
men was bent upon acting out his peculiar dream of national
glory—in the name of “social justice.” At the same time,
each was oblivious of the misery and chaos which arrogancy
and delusion concealed.
It was a singular thing to live at such a time and in such
an epoch. Stern was keenly aware of the measure of his
vitality, ardor, zeal, and capacity for public service. To be
a mere spectator—through the channels of newspaper, radio,
and magazine—in a day calling for the noblest patriotic par-
ticipation was tantalizing. It was mental and spiritual
torment.
Leah paused until Stern was ready to resume his typing.
She had listened to his review of the year's work with an
understanding heart.
“Why not give up the rabbinate altogether and study law?
Why should you have to depend on the College for a return
to active life?”
“I can't give up the rabbinate, Leah. It would mean that
thirteen years of training and practical experience would be
wasted. And, Leah, I love my profession.”

“Dr. Romuly has not been impressed with what people
everywhere around the country have said about your out-
standing service, Milt.”
“The decisive factor, according to Dr. Romuly, was that
some people wrote to him, complaining that I made them
weep when they saw and heard me in the pulpit.”
“Dr. Romuly's remark was boorish, Milt. I would say that
those who wrote the letters lack imagination, are sentimentally
maudlin, emotionally immature, and socially malevolent. It
was an aesthetic, not an ethical judgment.”
“Evidently Dr. Romuly did not see it that way, Leah.”
“Let’s go into this matter of tears, Milt. Pity or compas-
sion is a normal initial reaction. When the sight of a handi-
capped person like yourself stirs the soul, tears are the tender
tribute of admiration. It is an uplifting moment. It is a
challenging experience. It is an instant of inspiration which
remains long in the minds and in the hearts of those who
see and hear you. Rabbis and lecturers come and go. Most
often what they have said is forgotten. Their names are re-
called with difficulty. I am confident that the hundreds and
the thousands who have seen and heard you in the pulpit and
elsewhere will never forget what you stand for: loyalty; physi-
cal, moral, and spiritual courage; and faith to an extraordi-
nary degree. You don't just preach the highest ideals of
Judaism, Milt; you dramatize them every moment of your
life.
“That is what Mrs. Miriam T. Simon, of Natchez, Missis-
sippi, meant when she wrote to the Union:
The Natchez Temple Sisterhood has recently had the
honor of a visit from two most distinguished guests:
Rabbi Stern and his charming sister. They came to us
with spiritual messages of faith and hope and fortitude.
Angels, as we moderns believe, are those who minister

Judaism. Those two are missionaries in Judaism whose
work is of inestimable value. We want you to know
that we feel grateful for having had them with us.
“Here, in your files, you have copies of letters like this
from men and women in every part of the country.”
“A thousand and one such letters would not move Dr.
Romuly, Leah. He is one of those Biblical critics whom
Maurice Samuel tags as maniacal specialists. Professor
Romuly has a Procrustean mentality. He doesn't have the
intuitive imagination of a poet, philosopher, or great states-
man. Professor Romuly begins with a theory. Woe to any
fact that doesn’t conform! Dr. Romuly is dead set against
having a blind person in the rabbinate. Not many years ago
he wanted to drop Maurice N. Eisendrath, a most brilliant
and capable student, because his vision was seriously im-
paired. I am sure Dr. Romuly has always regarded me
professionally as an interloper. Along comes the depression.
He adds a few tears and discards me cavalierly, dispassion-
ately, mechanically, as with his exegetical scalpel he disposes
of sacred passages in the Scriptures as interpolations not in
harmony with his theory of the moment.”
“Aren't you rather severe in your analysis, Milt?”
“Dr. Romuly is an archetype. Call it Procrustean men-
tality, maniacal specialism, narrow-mindedness, or bigotry,
Leah. It is the pattern-mind of so many social workers and
college professors today. It has spawned fascism, totalitar-
ianism, authoritarianism. It is the type of mind impatient
with tradition and conservative progress—ruthless, tyranni-
cal, arrogant, imperious.”
“Why do you include social workers, Milt?”
“A social worker's basic creed is institutionalization or
collectivization. A social worker is emotionally stirred by
social ills. He proposes glowing schemes of betterment, pass-
ing lightly over significant facts of human nature. Institu-
tionalism is Socialism in miniature. The individual loses his

identity as a personality. He becomes a case number, a ward,
an inmate. Institutionalization is far more of an affront to
civilization and is vastly more reprehensible aesthetically and
ethically than a physical or mental handicap.”
“Isn't an institution good for some people, Milt?”
“Institutionalization is but the first step, Leah. It not only
robs the individual of his unique personality. It has a dis-
integrating, disastrous effect on family solidarity and family
responsibility, and the family unit is the foundation of
civilization.
“Let us see what is going on today. Twelve million are
unemployed. Immediately they are classified as wholly de-
pendent upon society. They are massed with professional
mendicants and the utterly helpless. This is a radical division
of society into wards and guardians.
“In this process of institutionalization, collectivization, or
state centralization of social welfare, compassion has been
blinded by emotion, ignorance, or arrogance. It is churned
into complacency and condescension. Ultimately it is gal-
vanized into class consciousness or caste. The Nazis in Ger-
many began as Socialists. Now the objective is a superrace.
The Russian Marxian Socialists started in terms of dictator-
ship by the proletariat. Today the peoples of Soviet Russia
are cruelly segregated: some are masters, the overwhelming
majority are slaves. Soviet Russia, the promised workers’
paradise—the hoped-for consummation of every Socialist's
dream—is in reality one immeasurable prison.”
“I have time for one more question, Milt. I must go down
and prepare for the Sabbath. This is Friday, you know. It
may be you have lost track of time during this Democratic
National Convention. You were at the radio all last night.
Now here is my question. Why are you so strongly opposed
to the nomination and election of Franklin D. Roosevelt?”
“Eleven years ago, Leah, Roosevelt was a helpless para-
lytic. My admiration for his courage and accomplishments
is boundless. Roosevelt's rise to eminence and power is proof


## p. 56 (#80) ##############################################

56 Tºs R E D POT TA GE
of the truth of the ancient Greek scientist's affirmation: “Give
me a place to stand and I will move the earth.” But once
Roosevelt is enthroned, Washington will become the magnet
not only for old-line politicians, lawyers, and bankers. You
will see a repetition of the California and Yukon gold rushes
to the nation's capital. And the prospectors will be profes-
sors and social workers. This combination of politicians,
professors, and social workers, cunningly powdered with
Communists, native-born and foreign, will be almost as devas-
tatingly explosive as Russian Bolshevism.”
Leah Stern returned to the kitchen. The rabbi walked over
to the window. He gazed across the garden below and far-
ther, over the silent woods.
“What irony!” he mused. “Out of the millions upon mil-
lions of stalwart citizens of this marvelous nation, a cruelly
handicapped paralytic may be chosen to lead the country out
of the dreary wilderness of despair!
“Is it supreme irony? Or may it be the answer to Presi-
dent Hoover's prayer for a spiritual, psychological lift in the
person of this audacious captain courageous whom Alfred
E. Smith does not trust and whom Columnist Walter Lipp-
mann describes as merely an inconsequential person who
wants to be President and who does not have the intellectual
capacity to conduct a campaign successfully? Or is the selec-
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt to be God’s rebuke to a nation
so miserably paralyzed by fear?”
It was close to eight o'clock. The sun had set. The Jewish
Sabbath discouraged the traditionalist's concentration upon
such mechanical instruments as the radio. Stern would honor
the Sabbath Day as scrupulously as did his mother. Tonight
there would be no radio, no rapt attention to political speeches
and parliamentary combat. The Enquirer would give the
answer in the morning.
But Dinah could not wait. She stepped over to the cabi-
net. She switched on the radio. A moment of waiting. Then,
like a cloudburst, the tumult of the convention filled the

room. The radio announcer shouted above the rolling thun-
der: “Roosevelt’s nominated!”
At the nod and bidding of Publisher William Randolph
Hearst, the strength of the Garner California and Texas dele-
gations had been transferred. Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
Governor of New York, had acquired the necessary two-
thirds vote for the nomination.
Stern and his sister listened with burning dismay to the
unconfined roars of triumph. It was as when Moses and
Joshua, coming down from Mount Sinai with the Tables of
the Covenant, heard the wild shouts of the children of Israel
dancing about the golden calf.
A fortnight before, the Republican Party's delegates had
renominated President Herbert Hoover, with trepidation and
dark forebodings of defeat. Now, loftily confident of victory,
the Democratic National Convention had elatedly brushed
aside Glass of Virginia, Ritchie of Maryland, Smith of New
York, Ely of Massachusetts, Baker of Ohio, Horner of Illi-
nois, McAdoo of California, and Garner of Texas—almost
without exception mature, mellowed, magnanimous states-
men, soundly conservative in temperament, steadfast admin-
istrators.
By the grueling process of attrition and connivance, out
of the cauldron of that Chicago Stadium, the master poli-
ticians came up with a dazzling unicorn of whom it might
be asked: “Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide
by thy crib? Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band to
the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? Wilt
thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou
leave thy labor to him? Wilt thou believe him, that he will
bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?”
The following morning, Stern and his brother Sidney wor-
shipped at the Rockdale Avenue Temple. The Sabbath morn-
ing service was conducted by Dr. David Philipson. After
forty-four years of continuous, conspicuous devotion to this
congregation, the great scholar, in the shade of retirement,

had lost much of his vigor as a preacher. But his reading of
the English and Hebrew prayers was singularly penetrating
and edifying. Few of his colleagues could match this out-
standing clergyman in the vocal interpretation of the Bible.
With Dr. Philipson, the reading of Scriptures was not a me-
chanical, professional, liturgical routine. With him it was
the assumption of the prophet's role, in the precincts of the
magnificent edifice which he himself had helped to design.
Clothed with the prophetic spirit, the rabbi began to read
the Scriptural portion of the week, the eighth chapter of the
first book of the Prophet Samuel. “. . . And his sons walked
not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes,
and perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gath-
ered themselves together and came to Samuel and said, Now
make us a king to judge us like all the nations. . . . And
Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto
Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they
say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have
rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. . . how-
beit yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the man-
ner of the king that shall reign over them. . . .”
As the threescore-and-ten-year-old rabbi reproduced the
dialogue between the elders of Israel and the Prophet Samuel,
and between the Prophet and the Almighty, Stern's mind was
startled by the curious appropriateness of the sacred word.
His heart beat excitedly. The eighth chapter of the first book
of the Prophet Samuel was, coincidentally, the vital message
which should now be declaimed from every American house-
top.
However deep his devotion to the rabbinate, Stern was
even more deeply rooted emotionally and spiritually in the
life of his country. It was something more than patriotism,
something too chaste and restrained to be alloyed with chau-
vinism, fanaticism, or jingoism. The names of rivers, moun-
tains, cities, institutions, and states were not just geographical
symbols of identification. There was hardly a part or parcel

of the continental area alien to him. For thirteen years
Stern had entered into the kaleidoscopic flow of life in almost
every American community, wherever there were Jewish men,
women, and children. By the swift action of memory, he
could summon up the personalities of friends in San Fran-
cisco, Galveston, Omaha, Jacksonville, Brooklyn, or Duluth.
In the same way, Stern could reproduce impressions, photo-
graphed on his memory, of institutions—hospitals, schools,
colleges, prisons, luncheon clubs—everywhere over the three
million square miles which are the United States of America.
He thought he understood the dominant trait of all the
people, their fierce love of individual freedom and their
willingness to accept any trial or to make any sacrifice to
preserve it for themselves and for posterity. Stern had never
doubted that the individual American really meant what he
said when he sang, “Thou wilt not yield the vandal toll, Thou
wilt not crook to his control. Better the fire upon thee roll,
Better the shot, the blade, the bowl, Than crucifixion of the
Soul.”
What evil spirit might snuff out the spark of divinity: that
jealous love of liberty, the high courage, the invincible forti-
tude, the incomparable faith which had well-nigh moved
mountains? Was the breakdown of the resolute will and
rugged spirit of the people the inescapable corollary of the
moral, political, and physiological degeneration brought about
by the unnatural legal restraints of the social evils of drunk-
enness, gambling, and immorality?
Or was it the baffling intransigence of the Democratic ma-
jority in the Congress in refusing to support President
Hoover's efforts to cope with the unprecedented unemploy-
ment crisis? The President had asked for less than a billion
dollars. The Democratic majority balked. “With a deficit
of about three billion dollars.” they bleated, “that would cer-
tainly bankrupt the Federal government.” If elected, Gov-
ernor Roosevelt promised a drastic twenty-five per cent budget
slash.

Nor did the Democratic majority in the Congress content
itself with doleful predictions of doom and ruin, while voic-
ing opposition to large expenditures for immediate relief.
When President Hoover pleaded with the majority not to
divulge the names of the great commercial and industrial
concerns seeking financial aid, the ruthless, short-sighted,
power-hungry politicians sneered contemptuously. And when
the President offered a large-scale, long-range, enlightened
program for gradual industrial recovery, the Democratic
Party's spokesmen, in every part of the country, spurned it
derisively. Urged on by so-called liberal intellectuals, and
always surreptitiously fueled by strategically infiltrated Com-
munists in the Federal Government, the people clamored not
for the sober blueprints of an American engineer, but for
the strong hand of a master planner or European-model
dictator.
By the summer of 1932 there were definite indications that
the country was on the road to industrial recovery. Around
the world, other nations were likewise regaining economic
equilibrium. World-wide stability was in sight. So President
Hoover and the Republican Party's orators assured the nation.
But the American people—like the peoples of other nations—
could not wait for the promised plenty of tomorrow. This
was the era of the telephone, the telegraph, the radio, and the
airplane—of swift, instantaneous action. This was not a
horse-and-buggy age for slow and patient convalescence.
This was the time for push-button, magical performance.
The nominees of the two major parties, Republican Hoover
and Democrat Roosevelt, each in his name, appearance, style,
temperament, and character, was the perfect representative
of the clash and contrast. Hoover was stolid, heavy of speech,
deliberate in judgment, incorruptible. Roosevelt, debonair
as a matinee idol, spoke with verve. He acted with the mas-
ter showman's sure sense of the dramatic, yet his words and
his actions were too often not congruous.

Late Saturday afternoon, July the second, radio's political
experts lowered the curtain on that scene of scenes: the spec-
tacular flight from Albany; the awe-struck people massed on
the streets and avenues along the way from the airport to
the convention hall; the golden-belled, nerve-tingling speech
of acceptance.
Soberly, Stern measured Roosevelt's advantages over his
rival candidate, President Hoover. Chief among them was
the astonishing charm of the Roosevelt personality, and the
fervent, almost hysterical desire of the country for a complete
change in national administration. There was yet another
powerful factor, though not immediately discernible. Roose-
velt's nomination campaign chairman, James A. Farley, of
New York, had been appointed the Democratic Party's
national chairman. More than any other individual, Farley
had been responsible for Roosevelt's victory at the Chicago
Stadium. Long before the Chicago assembly—well-stocked
with funds supplied for the most part by such good friends
as Henry Morgenthau, Sr., and Jesse I. Straus of New York
—Farley had gone up and down the land, winning convention
delegates for the New York Governor. Having demonstrated
his genius for hard work and for making loyal adherents, his
organizational skill, his sterling integrity, and his remarkable
grasp of practical politics, big Jim Farley now became the
commanding and conquering field general of the party. Side
by side with Charles Michelson, the astute chief of the party's
public relations bureau, they would storm the Republican
Party's ramparts and, in the course of time, establish their
candidate as the undisputed ruler of the great republic.
Then, as if to cap the climax of Roosevelt's good fortune
and to seal the fate of the Republican Party for perhaps a
whole generation, through an immedicable trick of circum-
stances, even while the Democratic Party convened in Chi-
cago, President Hoover was indelibly cast as the sinister
figure in the Kremlin-directed, Kremlin-financed Bonus Ex-

peditionary Forces' march, 15,000 strong, on the national
capital.
On July 16th, two men fell in the streets of Washington
while charging the police. One, a bystander some distance
away, was hit in the back. The other, William Hushka, was
killed instantly by a shot at short range into his heart. Be-
fore the federal government intervened, fifty-five other per-
sons had been injured. At the call of the President, an army
unit stationed nearby prepared for action. Riding at the head
of his six hundred soldiers and five tanks, General Douglas
MacArthur arrived at the scene of the mob violence. He
found the mob animated “by the essence of revolution.” The
rioters were dispersed with harmless tear gas. Not a shot was
fired. Not a person was bruised.
And this, in brief, is the manner in which there was
ushered in the economic Alice-in-Wonderland, the political
phantasmagoria dubbed the New Deal, which one of Ameri-
ca's most illustrious historians, James Henry Breasted, was
soon to epitaphize as “the biggest program of public bribery
in the history of the world, infantile in conception and child-
ish in its execution.”

CHAPTER VIII
VOICES FROM VIENNA
part of the nineteenth century, there went forth two
mighty voices: one, a woman's; the other, a man's.
For nearly half a century, the voices of the two Austrians
were known and their power was felt throughout the world.
The name of the woman was Ernestine Schumann-Heink;
that of the man was Adolf Hitler. The voice of Ernestine
Schumann-Heink is associated with the personality of the
world's most beloved artist. The name of Adolf Hitler is
synonymous with “hell and destruction.”
Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, in the little
Austrian town of Braunau-am-Inn, facing Bavaria across the
river. At about the age of fifteen, the orphaned, penniless,
charity-loathing Hitler went to Vienna, with a suitcase in his
hand and an unshakable determination in his heart. He
wanted to become “something—but in no event an official.”
While working in Vienna as a common laborer, the vision-
ary Hitler saw that the “psyche of the great masses is not
receptive to half-measures or weakness.” The self-styled
social guinea pig concluded that “if Social Democracy were
confronted by a doctrine of greater truthfulness, carried out
with the same brutality, then the latter would be victorious,
though the struggle might be hard.”
In the spring of 1912, the art-inspired Adolf Hitler went
to Munich. There, in Munich, the discouraged artist was
transformed into a phrenetic prophet of Weltpolitik, which
called for a world-spanning chain of German colonies. The
(9. of Europe's celebrated city of Vienna, in the latter

youth brooded over the dilemma of Germany's multiplying
population and self-evident need for more “living space” and
the Reich's stultifying foreign policy: “preservation of world
peace by all available means.” Out of these morbid musings
came forth the hideous hypothesis: “Never was a State
founded by peaceful economy, but always by the instincts of
preserving the species, no matter whether they are found in
the field of heroic virtues or sly cunning.”
In the summer of 1914, overpowered by the vision of
Weltpolitik, Kaiser Wilhelm-II and his Junkers proudly and
contemptuously forsook the ways of peace and, with Teu-
tonic fervor, romanticism, and fury, plunged the world into
a dance of destruction. Soon afterward Hitler enlisted and
put on the uniform of a German soldier, with the obsession
that it was a “belated favor” that he was “allowed to appear
as a witness before the tribunal of the Eternal Judge in order
to proclaim the truth and sincerity” of his convictions. After
four years of obscure military service, Hitler emerged with
a battle-wound, an iron cross, and a pair of corporal's
chevrons.
When, on November 10, 1918, the temporarily blinded
corporal received the news of the impending Armistice, he
threw himself onto his hospital cot and buried his burning
head in the covers and pillows. Upon his discharge from the
hospital and the army, Hitler found himself one among the
hundreds of thousands of defeated, humiliated Reich veter-
ans scattered over the face of the land, and comprising a
host of disillusioned, despised, seemingly disinherited, dis-
franchised human flotsam.
Stunned and shocked by the spiritual and political disin-
tegration of the once great empire, Hitler was seized with
the paranoic conviction that he had been chosen to bring
forth a new political party whose primary goal would be “the
security of the existence and the increase of his race and his
people.” Five years later, this same Adolf Hitler, who, in the
autumn of 1918, had come to the sober conclusion that he

was one without name and that he did not possess “even the
least presupposition for any useful activity,” captured the
spotlight on the world stage. By an astonishing display of
oratorical power, combined with an extraordinary faculty for
mass conversion and a phenomenal genius for organization,
the Austrian-born Hitler became Germany's most conspicuous
political leader.
The program formulated by Hitler and his National So-
cialist German Workers' Party, on February 24, 1920, con-
sisted of a jumble of pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and
anti-capitalism, and stressed “the common interest above
self.” At the outset, German Communists, routinely, like the
destructive lamprey infesting the American Great Lakes,
latched themselves onto Hitler and the National Socialists.
In 1932, speaking in defense of the old German Socialist
Party, Reichstag Deputy Kurt Schumacher daringly de-
claimed: “The whole National Socialist movement is only a
lasting appeal to the inner swine-dog in man. For the first
time in German political history, someone has succeeded in
absolutely mobilizing German stupidity.”
In the autumn of 1932, while the audacious Socialist Schu-
macher was straining to hold back the flood of Nazism,
Hitler swore to his wavering subordinates that if the clearly
perceptible upswing in business proved disastrous to his party,
he would shoot himself. Concurrently, in the United States,
the Republican Party's candidate, President Herbert Hoover,
was doggedly, though dully, defending his administration;
and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic Party's Presiden-
tial candidate, was conducting his countrywide campaign of
fervid denunciation of the Republican Administration, fol-
lowed by glib promises of total salvation.
In that same autumn, on September 28th, Madame Ernes-
tine Schumann-Heink, the world's greatest prima donna con-
tralto, came to the Albee Theatre in Cincinnati.
Ernestine Schumann-Heink was born on June 15, 1861,
at Leiben, near Prague, Austria-Hungary. Her father was an

Austrian-Bohemian army officer. Her mother, Charlotte
Goldman, was Austrian-Italian. At the age of fifteen, she
gave a recital at Gratz. In Vienna, one year later, at her
first audition, the music director said to Ernestine: “Go home
and learn to sew!” There, in Vienna, the plain face and the
plain dress overshadowed the majesty of that divine channel
of beauty!
Unlike her compatriot Adolf Hitler, this genuine artist was
neither crushed nor corrupted by the verbal whip and scorn
of the Viennese music director. Against great odds, she
labored to the limit of her strength. She married young. She
studied songs and parts, literally with children in her arms.
Frustration and suffering sculptured her soul and endowed
her with mellowness and an understanding heart, and lifted
her voice far above mediocrity. Schumann-Heink's spirit,
tested and triumphant, carried her to Dresden, Hamburg,
Berlin, Bayreuth. Then, in 1898, she made her American
debut in Chicago, in the opera Lohengrin.
The height, depth, breadth, and richness of Schumann-
Heink's voice penetrated the hearts and enchanted the souls
of millions everywhere in the United States. Music students
and music critics spoke of her with awe. “The singing of
Schumann-Heink,” wrote Nina Pugh Smith, a Cincinnati
critic, “never conveyed to her hearers that she was concerned
about a vocal method, that assassin of the voice. She sang
naturally, evidently having required no more than musical
guidance, and coming as she did from an artistic family, had
never heard of those artificialities in vocal instruction which
limit either the voice quality with all sorts of unnecessary
throat-adjustments, or destroy the interpretative ability,
through depriving the artist of complete spontaneity of ex-
pression.”
“One recalls of Schumann-Heink's singing,” added the
critic, “that she seemed to use the full gamut of her fine com-
pass and to lend the glory of her voice to an almost elemental

probe of the possibilities of the roles she sang. No voice like
hers is to be anticipated during this generation, but it might
be possible, through the understanding of the essential sim-
plicity of fine singing such as she had, that as great an inter-
preter might come.”
What the people of the United States saw in Schumann-
Heink was not alone the perfection of a musical instru-
mentality, but a radiant, living soul. Above all else,
Schumann-Heink was a quenchless flame of love. That white,
glowing flame was not confined to professional performances
in opera, concert, or the world-famous Cincinnati May Fes-
tival. She was never austere, never frigid. As she moved
forward swiftly to greet a friend or a stranger, her hands
were outstretched, her eyes were bright with enthusiasm, and
her voice overflowed with fervor and animation. There was
something majestic in the personality of this vigorous and
voluble artist.
Such was the Madame Schumann-Heink whom Rabbi
Stern met for the first time in Minneapolis, in the spring of
1923, at the Disabled American Veterans’ National Conven-
tion. As the supernal contralto opened the convention and
sang the Star-Spangled Banner, Stern felt that hands and eyes
as well as vocal chords were stretching out to embrace every
man and woman in the great assembly. The national anthem
came from her heart and from her lips as though accom-
panied by a deep affirmation of gratitude and a ringing
promise of fidelity to the country of her choice.
Here in Minneapolis, in the presence and hearing of the
nation's representative disabled veterans, Schumann-Heink
was not merely a magnificent minstrel and trouper; she was
a mother, a mother of eight children. Four of her sons had
served with the armed forces of the United States. But
Schumann-Heink, though a naturalized American citizen,
was Austrian-born. One of her sons, August, had been an
officer on a German U-boat! August died wearing the uni-

form of the Huns. Schumann-Heink thus stood before the
world as the sign and tragic witness of the fratricidal folly
of war. Her great heart had borne the woes of two nations.
Yet as she journeyed about the United States, from training
camp to training camp, and poured out her soul in song, as
a freewill offering to soldiers and sailors, Schumann-Heink's
heart was pierced by the cruelest of all forms of human tor-
ture—she was pilloried as a traitor to the country of her
adoption. For after April, 1917, the once magnanimous
people of the United States lost their reason in their revulsion
against all things and all personalities German or Austrian.
Madame Schumann-Heink stepped to one side of the plat-
form. It was a moment of great emotional tension. At the
call of General George Leach, the convention chairman,
Rabbi Stern, the national chaplain, walked toward the podium.
As he offered the invocation, Stern thought of his own
mother and of her grief. He thought of the noble Schumann-
Heink and of her immeasurable burden. He recalled the
despised and harassed German- and Austrian-American citi-
zens. He remembered the young German soldiers he had
seen lying dead on the battlefield. And he thought of these
gallant young American veterans standing before him, whose
wounds and struggles so quickly had been forgotten by their
countrymen. He prayed for a just and enduring peace among
all nations.
The stirring formalities concluded, Stern and his sister
left the platform. A moment later, backstage, they conferred
with Raymond Lasance, the national adjutant. Abruptly,
Lasance said, “Milt, Madame Schumann-Heink is coming
toward us. I think she wants to talk to you.”
The national adjutant turned to greet the diva. “Mr.
Lasance, please, I want to meet your national chaplain.”
The great artist grasped the hands of the rabbi and said,
“Rabbi, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for your
prayer. It was the noblest speech I have ever heard. Thank

R E D POT TA GE 22.5" 69
you, thank you, for your words. I shall never forget them,
Rabbi.”
One year afterward, in Salt Lake City, Schumann-Heink
and the rabbi similarly met and participated in the national
convention of the Disabled American Veterans. Five months
later, in Cincinnati, at the Emery Auditorium, they met
again.
“Mother Ernestine had just finished one of her delightful
Songs,” wrote a Cincinnati columnist, “and onto the stage,
where she stood bowing to the plaudits of her guests, came
Milton Stern heading a delegation of disabled veterans. Then
Milton spoke. We’ve heard a lot of speeches in our time: a
few Presidents, a general or two, some admirals, great pulpit
orators and a king, but—we've never heard a speech so elo-
quent with sincerity as the one Milton Stern made at Mother
Ernestine's party. A tribute to the queen mother of the
soldiers . . . a eulogy of motherhood. An appreciation of
the singer with the immortal voice. A message from the
hearts of grateful soldiers for whom she sang in the war
camps.”
During the decade between 1923 and 1932, Madame
Schumann-Heink and Rabbi Stern continued to meet annually
at the national conventions of the Disabled American Veter-
ans. When in Cincinnati, Schumann-Heink visited the Stern
home. Her letters to Stern mirrored her personality and
registered intimate sentiments on personal and professional
natterS.
“I am longing for a good, real heart-to-heart talk with
you—with Sister—we three together . . . ,” she wrote from
Kansas City. “We two women listen to you, learn from you
a lot of worth-while wisdom.”
And now, at the age of seventy-one, in that fateful autumn
of 1932, the world's most renowned contralto came to Cin-
cinnati to fill a four-a-day engagement at the RKO Albee
vaudeville-cinema downtown theatre. Over a period of nearly

70 *ēs R E D POT TA GE
thirty years, Schumann-Heink had given a total of fifty
dazzling performances in Cincinnati: in opera and concert,
as symphony orchestra and May Festival soloist.
On the afternoon of that September 28th, Stern and Leah,
his wife, sat alongside the great singer in a small dressing
room of the theatre. The rabbi and his wife were visibly
affected by the somber sunset-aspect of the once-brilliant star.
“Rabbi, you are wondering what brings Madame Schu-
mann-Heink to vaudeville,” she said softly. “I have been
doing this for two years. Many of my friends in New York
think that a great-grandmother like myself should stay com-
fortably at home and be cared for. Rabbi, I must work.
There are about a hundred persons who depend on me for
some form of financial aid.
“Some women in New York said, “This is terrible!” Or
else, behind my back, they said, “What a come-down! From
grand opera to vaudeville!”
“I answered, ‘You! You have rich husbands. And your
husbands are jumping out of tenth-story windows these days.
That is a come-down!’”
There was a moment of silence. “Come-down”? Stern
mused. Perhaps this was her grandest performance. Mil-
lions of people in almost every part of the civilized world
were clamoring for public relief. Men and women in the
prime of manhood and womanhood were ready and willing
to surrender their honor and their very lives to a Hitler or
a Roosevelt—for a job. Stern himself was groping for the
light of understanding. He, too, had experienced a come-
down. Until two years before, as the national field repre-
sentative of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,
he had been a trouper, a front-page newspaper story, a fea-
ture attraction, everywhere in the United States and in
Canada, speaking always to capacity audiences.
Schumann-Heink continued. “Some people think I am
lowering my art, Rabbi. But I am glad to come closer to the
people. I am glad to sing for the plain men and women who

are so dear to my heart. Mein Gott! This is my life. An
artist can't live without an audience and applause.”
How well Stern understood the magic of the words, “audi-
ence and applause”! His heart and his flesh yearned for more
than sporadic contact with masses of alert, critical, challeng-
ing men and women.
“But, Rabbi, I am not going to stay in vaudeville very
long. When I return to New York in December, I am going
to open what I call a master class in music. I shall be up
at half-past five every morning. I'll read history, prepare
notes for my lectures. My regular work with the students will
begin at nine o'clock. I'll teach, coach, and lecture. I'll
supervise the housework and the personal needs of my pupils.
“Now, Rabbi, tell me about your work and your family,
your mother, your sister and, ach, the baby. I love you all.”
A few moments later, Stern and his wife rose to leave.
Madame Schumann-Heink walked with them to the elevator.
“God bless you both,” she said fervently.
“Take good care of my rabbi, Leah.”

brother, Stern found comradeship, complete under-
standing, and singleness of devotion. Whether the
subject was baseball, theology, invention, war, or politics,
Sidney responded to his brother's questions with enthusiasm.
He was then a high school lad of seventeen. Clean in
mind and straightforward, Sidney could never pretend; nor
would he offend. His grasp of knowledge was remarkable.
His comprehension was swift and almost mechanically pre-
cise in intuitive appraisal. As with his sister Dinah, Sidney
was granite-like in his adherence to the highest standards of
ethics. Yet unlike Dinah, Sidney was rarely explosive in
expressing his sentiments. Unlike his sister, Sidney was not
fanatical in opposition. He was not an extreme partisan,
either professionally or emotionally. His radiant countenance
reflected magnanimity of spirit.
When the brothers walked home together with Dinah in
the evening, from the Hebrew Union College, Dinah would
invariably seize the ball of conversation and carry it along
the way, like an irresistible football player, plunging, dodg-
ing, squirming, fiercely throwing off every attempt to halt
her. On the Wednesday evening, following the November,
1932, election, Dinah was furiously assertive.
“Of course Roosevelt won,” she almost shouted. “Those
Democrats talked about a bloody Bolshevik-type revolution.
They had the people so scared, they believed everything
charged against the Republican Party. There wasn't a word
of truth in anything they said about Herbert Hoover.”

“Dinah,” said Stern, “Hoover was no match for Roosevelt.
Over the radio, President Hoover sounded like a tired, old
man.”
“What difference does it make what Hoover sounds like?”
Dinah countered. “Didn't John Spargo, the outstanding
Socialist leader both here in the United States and in England,
say that Hoover's Presidential addresses are, in his opinion,
the finest and most statesmanlike papers of our generation?
What was good about Roosevelt’s campaign speeches? I
wager he didn't write a word of any of them.”
Dinah continued:
“Roosevelt isn't capable of writing a speech. Herbert Hoover
wouldn't let anyone write even a sentence for him. That
would be intellectual dishonesty. Hoover wouldn't deceive
anyone, even if it meant winning the Presidency.”
“Aw, Sis,” Sidney interposed, “you take politics too
seriously.” -
Stern and his sister were severely jolted by the crushing
defeat of the Republican Party. Only six states had given
Herbert Hoover their Electoral College votes. The 1932 vic-
tory of Franklin D. Roosevelt was a stupendous triumph for
the Democratic Party in general, and for James A. Farley
and Charles Michelson in particular. The campaign had
been waged by Roosevelt, Farley and Michelson with un-
precedented skill and consummate knavery. The Democratic
Party's platform and campaign releases—verbal and printed
—had a promise for every faction and for every class. There
was a promise for the factory worker, the Negro, the farmer,
the foreign-born, and the labor-union leader. There was a
promise for the South, the Middle West, and the Pacific
Coast. There was a promise of world peace. There was a
promise for the repeal of the national Prohibition Amend-
ment. There was, finally, the grandiose pledge of a drastic
twenty-five per cent reduction in federal expenditures.
But it was quite palpable that Roosevelt's formidable vic-
tory at the polls could not assuage the qualms and the fears
of the solid middle-class, particularly the misgivings of the

merchants and the manufacturers. The nation's press gen-
erally accepted the decision of the electorate with apprehen-
sion. Would Roosevelt be so intoxicated with the wine of
victory that he would spurn and discard the wholesome re-
covery measures already initiated by President Hoover?
Despite the obstructionist tactics of the recalcitrant Demo-
cratic majority in the Congress, Hoover had won a year's
moratorium on war debts and reparations, set up the Recon-
struction Finance Corporation, called a world economic
conference, launched a reform of the nation’s “rotten” bank-
ing system, and, above all, held firm for staunch adherence
to the gold standard.
It was almost universally accepted that the fixation of the
gold standard was the crucial factor for sound industrial re-
covery. If Roosevelt and the new administration could be
counted upon not to tamper with the gold standard, all would
soon be well again. Even the slightest deviation from the
well-established gold standard might be regarded as fool-
hardy, calamitous tinkering with the exceedingly sensitive,
intricate, delicately constructed instruments of world-wide in-
dustry and commerce. It would be as though a tyro-surgeon,
striving to remove a few minor excrescences on a human
face, brashly explored the nerve cells of the brain.
Out of the sharpest conflicts of wits and wisdom came
forth the conviction that “the only reasonably cogent answer
was the allegation that gold furnished a foolproof currency.
Provided that simple rules were adhered to,” the experts
asserted, “a gold currency could never develop the infla-
tionary aberrations that have characterized many mismanaged
paper monetary units.” It was then concluded that “the
question at issue thus became whether it was better to have
an imperfect standard allegedly not subject to gross mis-
management, or a potentially better standard which was,
however, open to the gravest abuse.”
The threat of a radical assault on the gold standard
haunted the minds of conservative politicians at the 1932
Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Among these

conservative delegates was Senator Carter Glass, of Virginia.
The journalist-politician Glass had served as Secretary of the
Treasury in Woodrow Wilson's cabinet. Before the Virginia
Senator would accede to the nomination of Franklin D.
Roosevelt, he had wrung from the New York Governor the
solemn promise that no ruthless hand would be laid on the
hallowed gold standard.
But still the fear persisted. Still the conservatives in both
parties called for a public statement of policy by the Presi-
dent-elect. During the four months’ interval between the
election in November and the inauguration on March 4,
1933, Roosevelt would not pronounce the glad tidings that
would buoy up the confidence of merchants and manufac-
turers and bankers in the good will, the good judgment, and
the integrity of the new administration.
Again and again, President Hoover pleaded with Roose-
velt to give a disquieted world a decisive, positive, and ex-
plicit declaration of intentions. But Roosevelt was silent. He
was maddeningly inscrutable. When, by a word, order might
thus have been brought out of the chaos of confusion, and
light out of the darkness of doubt, President-elect Roosevelt
sardonically chose to let the nation—and much of the rest of
the civilized world—toboggan into a deeper chasm of de-
pression.
What of the solemn promise extracted by Senator Glass?
Ah! Politicians like Carter Glass were but men. But pro-
fessors, like George F. Warren and Frank A. Pearson, were
like Olympian gods. Politicians like Glass and Alfred E.
Smith had their time and place as masters of the harangue
and electioneering. Professors like Warren and Pearson were
wizards of the cunning word. They were masters of esoteric
economics. Politicians might shrink from unholy contact
with such sacrosanct, tradition-bound human values as the
gold standard. As for professors, they were gods before

flect, and whose dicta they must accept as oracular cate-
gorical imperatives.
Thousands of miles eastward, across the Atlantic Ocean,
the golden ethical standards of other nations were likewise
being undermined. In Germany, Hitler and his paganized
National Socialists, by devious parliamentary machinations
and, later, by wholesale atrocities, wrested the scepter of
power from the weak hands of Marshal Paul von Hinden-
burg, second President of Germany. Over the immense
surface of the earth which is Russia, Joseph Stalin, seemingly
stone-hearted, continued the terrible civil war, begun by
Nikolay Lenin, against the millions of war-weary, yet spirit-
ually unconquerable, Russian people who could never ulti-
mately yield to the dialectically concocted Bolshevik program
for the machine-like collectivization of land, cattle, tools, and
the products of industry and commerce, and then of the
minds, bodies, and souls of men, women, and children.
Still eastward and southward of the Russian empire, the
even more millions of China, Manchuria, and Korea were
awakening out of their long torpor. These oriental peoples
were stirred to action by the lash of similar instruments of
enslavement wielded by the merciless hands of the invading
Japanese. Hitler, Stalin, and Tojo each plotted on a global
scale. Each sought world supremacy. In their new science
of geopolitics, man had no pre-eminence over the beasts of
the field.
And what of the solemn promises of non-aggression and
peace promulgated through the covenant of the League of
Nations and by the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Peace
Pact?
“The most optimistic observer of affairs in the Far East,”
wrote Syngman Rhee, President of the Provisional Govern-
ment of Korea, in November, 1932, “must be disquieted
before the prospect now opening in the new Bosnia, the new
Alsace-Lorraine, that the world has allowed to be created

there. The Kellogg Peace Pact, of which we had hoped so
much, is virtually canceled by these events in Manchuria.
Hailed as the step that marked man's emergence from the
savageries of the past, it appears now without the substance
of a gesture.
“If,” President Rhee added, “treaties so explicit, so impor-
tant, and so done in the world's daylight as these, have no
validity, what treaty can have real meaning? In the face of
the developments in Manchuria, no nation can think of dis-
arming. The lesson is not smaller but larger war establish-
ments. At a time when all the western nations are in need of
resources to succor their unemployed workers, treasuries
must be drained to provide for national defense.
“Even the most ardent pacifist would be puzzled to sug-
gest another course consistent with national safety in a world
where treaties have now been reduced to scraps of paper and
covenants have become mere pipe-lighters.”
So while the fire and the brimstone and the tempest of
revolution raged over almost all of Europe and Asia; while
the volcanic spirits of such men as Hitler and Mussolini
preached peace—peace by Marx, Mammon, and Mars!—in
the United States, on February 15, 1933, three weeks before
his inauguration, President-elect Roosevelt marked the com-
pletion of a leisurely vacation voyage by a triumphal parade
through Bay Front Park, Miami, Florida.
It was evening. The President-elect rode in a slowly mov-
ing open car. Riding alongside, on the running board, for
a moment, was Anton Cermak, the former mayor of Chicago.
Then, with the suddenness of an earthquake, after Cermak
had stepped about fifteen feet from the open car, he was
fatally wounded by the bullets of an assassin's weapon. Five
other persons were injured before the police plucked the
assassin from the hands of infuriated spectators on the side-
walk. Later, when questioned, the assassin, Giuseppe Zan-
gara, a foreign-born bricklayer, attributed the foul action to
the excruciating pains in his stomach.

All the world was stunned, and shuddered at the provi-
dential, seemingly miraculous escape of the President-elect
from the consequences of the assassin's bullets.
On their walk in the evening of that day in February,
Dinah and her brothers rehearsed the story of the Miami
assassination.
“This is just what Roosevelt needed,” Dinah blurted out.
“Now people will really think he is a great leader.”
“I am wondering,” Stern said, “if Zangara actually wanted
to kill Mr. Roosevelt.”
Little public attention was given to the slowly dying Anton
Cermak. Few knew that Zangara's weapon was not directed
against the person of the President-elect. Giuseppe Zangara
was a hireling of the Chicago underworld. He had been
assigned to kill Anton Cermak, the former mayor, in retalia-
tion for the wounding of an all-too-powerful crime-syndicate
chief by a Chicago detective.
The light that was extinguished by Zangara's bullets trans-
figured the jaunty, debonair, cocky, wisecracking, pun-loving
Franklin D. Roosevelt into a personality of supernatural
stature. Recovering from the shock of so close and so mo-
mentous a catastrophe, and rejoicing that the President-elect
had been spared, the nation experienced a new feeling of
confidence, akin to worship. Even the press—particularly
the United Press—instantly cast off the mood of distrust. It
now seemed to be very clear that Providence and Destiny had
preserved Roosevelt for a monumental place in world history.
Anton Cermak’s vanishing light became Franklin D. Roose-
velt's halo, enveloping him with an aura of royal majesty.
But Dinah Stern was deeply depressed.
“I don't care if Roosevelt were to live a hundred years.
I just don't want him to be our President. Something tells
me that this moment of emotional exaltation may spell an
age of woe not only for our wonderful country, but for all
the world.”

“Why don't you give Roosevelt a fair chance?” Sidney
asked. “Perhaps he will make a good President.”
“Not that man. Look at the shabby way he is treating
Hoover and Smith. Roosevelt is acting as if both Hoover
and Smith have been junked. And will he keep his promise
about the gold standard?”
“Is that all you have against Mr. Roosevelt?” Sidney in-
quired. “Mr. Hoover and the gold standard?”
“No, Sidney,” Dinah replied fervidly, “I am worried about
something else. Anne O'Hare McCormick, writing in the
New York Times, predicts that Roosevelt will recognize Bol-
shevik Russia.”
“Won't recognition mean desirable trade with Russia?”
“Roosevelt isn't interested in trade, Sidney. The recogni-
tion of Russia is just another political stunt. Sensationalism
is his stock in trade. He builds himself up, shock by shock,
for the next Presidential election. Roosevelt is not always
particular about the methods he employs to attain his
objectives.”
“And what about trade with Russia? Won't that be good
for the country? Won't it give us another market for our
surplus goods?”
“Surplus goods? With millions of Americans in dire need
of food, clothing, and shelter? What an irony!”
“Sidney, trade with the Russians won't make much of a
change in our export business. The Bolsheviki will buy from
us provided we give them a billion-dollar credit. How do we
know they will pay their debts? But the most important mat-
ter is not trade, Sidney, but traitors. Once we open our doors
to Russia's diplomatic representatives, our country will be
infested with Bolshevik agents. Some of these agents may
call themselves industrial engineers. But mark my words,
Sidney, those agents will be highly trained specialists in sabo-
tage, espionage, and propaganda. They will organize an
American auxiliary for Russia, armed to carry on class war-
fare here in the United States.”

Up until the hour of his inauguration, Roosevelt main-
tained his sphinx-like posture as to the gold standard. Then,
a few days before Roosevelt gravely pronounced the Consti-
tution's prescribed oath of office, businessmen began ship-
ping gold abroad, sparked by a rumor that the country would
go off the gold standard. Then came the bank run in the
great manufacturing center of Detroit. Like a fantastic forest
fire, the sparks and the flames spread from Michigan to Ohio.
With incredible swiftness, every banking institution was like-
wise menaced.
“The most senseless and easily prevented panic in all his-
tory,” Herbert Hoover lamented, “was caused by fear of the
incoming administration.”
In Cincinnati, only one bank, the People's Bank, char-
tered by the State of Ohio, and perhaps the least among the
banking houses of the community, could not stand up against
the frenzied demands of its depositors, and closed its doors.
Fortuitously, Stern had withdrawn the greater part of his
savings shortly before the collapse of this Avondale bank.
The president of the bank was one of Cincinnati's most rep-
resentative men, Alfred M. Cohen, president of the Hebrew
Union College's Board of Governors, and one of the leading
members of the Democratic Party in Ohio.
What the burning of the Reichstag was to Hitler in Ger-
many, and what the deliberately sustained famine of 1932
was to Stalin in Russia, so the bank crisis was to Roosevelt.
That “most senseless and easily prevented panic in all his-
tory” provides the pattern of the American counterpart of
Italian Fascism, German Nazism, and Russian Bolshevism—
American authoritarianism.
It was government of the people by a benevolent despot
for the preservation of a political dynasty. The pattern may
be delineated as the calculated cultivation of a crisis. “We
planned it that way,” said the American totalitarians.
The next step was the summary rejection of measures pro-
posed by the Congress, “the delegated will of the nation.”

This was followed by the peremptory introduction of “must”
legislation, “mirrors of the ill-concerted and incongruous
projects of fashion,” drawn up almost overnight by an inner
circle of from ten to thirty cybernetic calculators whose pri-
mary thesis was that the citizens are incapable of intelligent
action.
The final step was the complete usurpation of legislative
powers by a cunning attack on the integrity, intelligence,
and patriotic devotion of the “obstructionist” opposition.
Alone in his study, Rabbi Stern slowly reread these lines
from President George Washington's Farewell Address to the
People of the United States:
“The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the pow-
ers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever
the form of government, a real despotism. . . . Let there
be no change by usurpation; for, though this, in one instance,
may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon
by which free governments are destroyed.”

fulness. His companionship was now more stimulat-
ing. His knowledge of American history expanded.
His information about public affairs widened in scope and
depth. Now he spoke more maturely about volcanic world-
wide social eruptions. In the confluence of opinion and
knowledge, Stern felt a physical exhilaration. As there were
harmony and rhythm in their discourse, so there was re-
freshing exercise in their work and in their walks.
With scarcely a pause, their conversation flowed from the
academic and the solemn to speculation on the prospects of
the Cincinnati baseball club's winning the 1933 National
League championship. When Sidney spoke about the “Reds,”
the Cincinnati baseball team, it was with intensity, passion,
and enthusiasm matched only by his sister's earnest concern
with politics, national as well as local.
On their evening walks, their route took them past Cincin-
nati's hospital center. The mammoth General Hospital, the
Jewish, the Holmes, the Children's, and the Medical College
were all along the way. This was the section of the city most
significant for Sidney. At the age of eight, he had soberly
voiced the determination to become a physician. As, each
evening, they passed the men and women in their white hos-
pital uniforms, Sidney's manner of speech revealed his sense
of dedication to the ministry of medical healing.
Now it was Monday, March 6, 1933.
“Milt,” asked Sidney, “have you heard from Mrs. Weston
about your “Broken Lights’ manuscript?”

“Leah is waiting to hear from her.”
“How long did it take you and Leah to finish the book?”
“About two years, Sidney. We could work only about an
hour each day. Leah has to spend most of her time with
Ruth.”
“You’ve also typed a lot of notes, haven't you, Milt?”
“During the past two years, I believe we've filed about two
thousand cards.”
“Hold it, Milt! Here comes Sis,” Sidney announced, as he
caught sight of Dinah on Jefferson Avenue. “Judging by her
stride, it looks as if she is very angry about something. I
wonder what Mr. Roosevelt has done this time?”
“Certainly she isn't worried about the banks being closed,
Sidney. I think it's just what we needed to wake us up out
of the nightmare of depression-hatched fears. Almost every-
one is taking the bank holiday good-naturedly. We realize
that the world hasn't come to an end and that in a day or so
most of the banks will be doing business as usual.”
As Dinah quickly ranged herself alongside her brothers,
Sidney asked, “What's wrong, Sis?”
“I can't get over the shabby way they treated Mr. Hoover
last Saturday after the inauguration. While all those victory-
drunk Democrats and their newly-won converts were turning
Washington upside down with their jubilation, Mr. Hoover
went down to the railway station unattended. And when his
train reached New York City and Mr. Hoover alighted at the
station, a crowd was there, to be sure. But that crowd was
not there to welcome Mr. Hoover. It came to cheer a movie
star! The only person who paid the slightest attention to
the man who for four troubled years served as our President
was a policeman.”
“That is supreme tragedy, Dinah.”
“And what a tragedy, Milt! Think of it! Herbert Hoover!
One of the greatest men this century has produced, a true
patriot-statesman, now despised and rejected by his coun-
trymen!”

“Do you know,” asked Sidney, “that Herbert Hoover never
made personal use of the nearly $500,000 he earned variously
as President of the United States, Secretary of Commerce,
Food Administrator, and Belgian Relief Director?”
“What did Mr. Hoover do with the $500,000, Sidney?”
“He placed his salaries in a separate fund, Milt, and then
distributed every cent of it. Part of it went to the people
who worked for him at low government pay; the rest to
charities.”
“Mr. Hoover,” said Dinah, “is a man of honor, a Christian
in the highest sense of that word. That was his greatest
weakness, believe it or not—he could not stoop to the tactics
of his detractors. There was no bitterness, no violent reac-
tion against his slanderers. Herbert Hoover is always the
gentleman, the good Christian. Roosevelt and the men with
him know this only too well. They are building Hoover up
as the symbol of all that is repulsive in the American way of
life. Roosevelt will make the name of Herbert Hoover synony-
mous with depression and stupidity and anathema for all
progressive and liberal elements in the world.”
“Perhaps, Dinah, Mr. Hoover would be a happier man
today if, four years ago, Alfred E. Smith had been President
when the world depression came.”
“As for Al Smith,” Dinah said scornfully, “mark my
words, Milt, Roosevelt will put him in the same class with
Hoover and the Republican Party. Roosevelt will have noth-
ing to do with Democratic oldsters like Smith and Bernard
Baruch. Roosevelt has a volatile disposition and a strong will
to rule. He will give the people the impression that men
like Smith, Hoover, and Baruch belong to prehistoric times,
and that everything they stand for should be ploughed under.
“Here is another striking facet of Mr. Roosevelt's person-
ality. Take his curious talk about the ‘forgotten man’ and
his bewildering endorsement of the Marxist principle of the
class struggle. Herbert Hoover and Alfred Smith are what
may be called ‘self-made.” They came up the hard way, from

the lowest rungs of the social ladder. Neither Hoover nor
Smith has ever complained about the misfortunes of their
early environment. On the other hand, while Mr. Roosevelt
quixotically and professionally assumes the role of champion
of the ‘forgotten man,’ socially he will have nothing to do
with either Smith or James Farley, though both Smith and
Farley elevated him to his present position. Mr. Roosevelt
openly shows preference for the yachts and the companion-
ship of the Astors and the Vanderbilts.”
“I see Roosevelt had a very difficult time getting men to
serve in his cabinet, Dinah.”
“It took him almost four months, Milt, to complete his
cabinet. Men like Senators Carter Glass, Hiram Johnson,
and Bronson Cutting turned down his urgent invitation. As
a result, he had to fill in with men whose names are scarcely
known to the country. And for the most part they are men
who will rarely say ‘No.’”
“What worries me, Dinah,” Stern added, “is that Mr.
Roosevelt has a higher regard for the thinking of European
economists than for the opinions of such men as Smith,
Hoover, and Baruch. If Mr. Roosevelt, like so many of our
college professors, runs true to form, he will import Euro-
pean techniques and European technicians like John Maynard
Keynes.”
“What will happen, Milt, if Roosevelt goes ahead and
recognizes Soviet Russia, something which Woodrow Wilson
and the three Presidents after him strenuously opposed?”
“Recognition of Soviet Russia at this time, Dinah, will be
a terrible blunder. The consequences of our recognition will
reach beyond the range of imagination. The effect on world
affairs will be horrendous, indeed. Here in our country,
communists will swarm all over the land. They will infiltrate
every department of the federal government. In time, the
Kremlin—and not Wall Street, the subject of Roosevelt's
attack in his Inaugural Address—will be in control in
Washington.”

“Wait a minute, Sis,” Sidney insisted. “This won't be the
first time Mr. Roosevelt will have renounced Woodrow Wil-
son's foreign policy. For a long time, Mr. Roosevelt was all
for the League of Nations. But at the Chicago convention
last summer, didn't he change his mind completely on the
subject of the League?”
“That's another example of Mr. Roosevelt's genius in
political expediency. Oh, yes, he was a Wilson League of
Nations man. But all the lofty moral principles of Woodrow
Wilson were forgotten when Roosevelt had to choose be-
tween the League of Nations ideal and the vital votes con-
trolled by William Randolph Hearst at the Chicago con-
vention.”
“How will Mr. Roosevelt benefit by recognition of Soviet
Russia?”
“He wants to win the support of a very powerful, though
numerically insignificant, left-wing element in this country.”
“But how will Mr. Roosevelt get away with all this, Milt?”
“I’ll tell you, Sidney,” answered Dinah. “Last Saturday,
in that Inaugural Address, Mr. Roosevelt played on the
words “The only fear we have to fear is fear itself.’”
“Preposterously enough,” Dinah continued, “Mr. Roose-
velt and his inner circle, like the witches in Shakespeare's
Macbeth, will constantly brew crises and fears. He will use
each artificial crisis and fear as an excuse for declaring a
national emergency. He will call in his Attorney-General,
as he did in the matter of the closing of the banks. The
Attorney-General will dig up some old law on the statute
books. Armed with this legal sanction, Mr. Roosevelt will
ram his program through the Congress.”
“In a word, Dinah,” said Stern, “you mean that the Roose-
velt method will follow the patterns drawn up by Mussolini,
Hitler, and Stalin. In order to attain prosperity and peace,
he will beatifically say, in effect, to the people: ‘Let us do
evil, that good may come.’”

“Well, folks,” Sidney cried, “here we are at 318 Forest
Avenue. I’m going to rush home. Mom will be worried if
I don't show up for the six o'clock radio broadcast. I want
to hear what our ‘Reds' are doing at their Florida training
camp.”
The newspaper and radio commentators had much to re-
port on this sixth day of March, 1933. There was no dearth
of sensational news. The bank holiday in the United States,
relatively speaking, was now a minor matter. In Europe,
Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini were moving at a tempestuous
pace—to achieve “peace and prosperity” for their stupefied
countrymen. Mussolini resorted to castor oil as a major
deterrent to opposition. But Hitler and Stalin, at the head
of their bloodthirsty comrades, operated like mobile guillo-
tines. Human blood seemed to flow in every street in every
city in Germany and Russia. And in Germany and Russia,
prisons and foul concentration camps devoured the best ex-
ponents of Western Christian culture.

judgment and opinion are worth a good deal.”

summoned the leaders of the new Congress to the
Executive Mansion. With dazzling sang-froid, the
President announced to the stunned legislators that he wanted
authority to put through the first of a series of economy
measures: to cut $100,000,000 from the salaries of govern-
ment employees, and $400,000,000 from the pensions of,
and compensation to, war veterans. Two million, five hun-
dred thousand persons would be directly affected by this
sweeping income slash. The following day, a Presidential
message was dramatically rushed to the Congress. The pre-
amble which accompanied the message blandly professed that
passage of Economy Bill Public 2 was imperative. Otherwise,
it was affirmed, the national deficit would reach the stagger-
ing figure of $5,000,000,000 by June 30, 1934.
Two days later, comfortably seated before a microphone
in an upper study in the White House, President Roosevelt
delivered a fifteen-minute radio talk to the nation. This was
not a sonorous speech, nor was it a solemn rendition of an
administrative decree. The President's voice was low-pitched.
The millions who listened were completely hypnotized. Each
believed that the Chief Magistrate of the United States was
opening up his heart to him individually, earnestly seeking
his counsel as a friend and his steadfast confidence as a
trusted neighbor.
This was Roosevelt’s first “fireside chat.” In the fifteen-
minute magical communion with his fellow-citizens, the
9": days after his inauguration, President Roosevelt

President cast aside sober statistics and the lore of the banker
and businessman. Instead of logic, there was the lyrical
Sweep of the poet. Instead of mathematics, there was meta-
phor. And instead of realism, there were the mists of allegory.
In the voice, there were the sense of mission and the emo-
tional intensity of a Paul or a Mohammed. The two million,
five hundred thousand government employees and war veter-
ans accepted the decree of their dynamic leader. Common
dangers and common suffering called for acquiescence. Pa-
triotism forbade rebellion or resistance. Yet the fact re-
mained that Economy Bill Public 2 represented a victory
not for the common man, but for the National Economy
League, formed shortly before the adjournment of the last
Congress. The League was made up of “multimillionaires,
international bankers and Wall Street financiers, for the pur-
pose of reducing the amount of money paid by the govern-
ment to disabled war veterans, who receive compensation
checks ranging from $16 to $40 a month. . . .”
Under the caption “What a Title!” the editor of the semi-
monthly publication of the Disabled American Veterans
queried: “The so-called Economy Bill Public 2, officially
entitled ‘A Bill to Maintain the Credit of the United States
Government’ſ . . . Were the facts such as to justify such a
title? During the calendar year 1932 the United States
Treasury offered thirteen Government bond issues ranging
in maturity dates from a period of six months to a period of
five years, and with interest rates ranging from 1% 9% to
3% 9%, aggregating the sum of $4,700,000,000.
“The total public subscription to these preferred bond
issues was in the aggregate sum of more than $32,000,000-
000; in other words, the people oversubscribed for these
bonds to the extent of nearly six times the amount of the
authorized issues.
“Every one of the issues was oversubscribed, and the last
one on October 16, 1932, was oversubscribed more than
nineteen times.

“Certainly this would not indicate that the Federal Gov-
ernment had been having any difficulty in securing a ready
response to its bond issues.
“Its financial credit was apparently well established.
“Where then was there any sufficient justification for en-
titling the bill ‘A Bill to Maintain the Credit of the U. S.
Government"? Many Congressmen were rushed into voting
for this Economy Bill without having read any more of it
than the title. Somebody pulled a fast one. What a travesty
on justice! What a title!”
The wanton triumph of the National Economy League
was enough to convince the most skeptical that President
Roosevelt's Inauguration Day evangelical tirade against the
“money changers” was just another hideous oratorical hyper-
bole. When Major-General Smedley D. Butler, retired com-
mander of the Marine Corps, came to Cincinnati to address
a rally of members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the
United States, he emitted these shattering blasts:
“Talk about a dictatorship; talk about the power of the
mob; we could have a dictatorship here in 30 days if the sol-
diers wanted to do it.
“They won’t, because they are too patriotic for one thing
and they are too full of personal jealousies to stand together.
The soldiers of this country have the power to mass 18,-
000,000 votes if they would, and they could control them.
They could make a soldier dictatorship with this strength, if
they were not too dumb to use their power.
“What do they do? They sit and yowl and lots of times
they don't even yowl. They sit and yowl when the politicians
and the international bankers and the Federal taxpayers call
them Treasury raiders.
“They don’t even howl when Congress and Roosevelt take
away their bonus and in the next six months turn over
$2,500,000,000 to the railroads and the banks. They don't
even raise a squeak when the President takes their money
and sends it out to the Conservation Corps to plant trees and

to give jobs to half a million. What did I see on that Econ-
omy League petition to cut down the soldier's compensation?
There were the names of four Past Commanders of the
American Legion.
“I won't talk for gold. I won't talk for business. I know
what Wall Street and the international bankers have done to
the Marines. I know they have made the Marines the greatest
collection agency in the world.
“As soon as the bankers could force you out of uniforms,
they corrupted your leaders with jobs and did everything
they could to steal your bonuses.
“You soldiers have got 'em frightened and Wall Street is
ready to compromise if you will organize and show your
strength like you did when you retired Hoover.
“Did you ever hear of anyone talking about a soldier as
a human being? They talk about sound money and saving
the dollar and helping business and the banks and the rail-
roads, but they don't give the serviceman a penny if they can
help it.”
In the course of time, Associate Justice Louis D. Brandeis,
of the United States Supreme Court, declared that Congress
could not constitutionally break its contracts with our one-
time soldiers. But step by step, national honor was defiled
“because they transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
and broke the everlasting covenant.”
Economy Bill Public 2 was the forerunner of, and the
pattern for, New Deal legislation. It was the model for the
mocking, hypocritical “Roosevelt Revolution.” On April
19th, the President jauntily took the nation off the gold
standard. In June, in a frenzy of fanatical righteousness,
Congress established a government agency known as the
NRA. The National Industrial Recovery Act which set up
this alphabetical agency was, in the main, made up of two
parts. The first portion of the Act represented a subtle
commingling of apparently hostile forces, the United States
Chamber of Commerce and the doctrines of Karl Marx, for

the regulation of trade and commerce, not by competition
but by cartel.
The President was only momentarily piqued that the Act
was in thorough violation of the hallowed Sherman Anti-
Trust Law. With spectacular bravado, he declared a state of
national emergency. He invoked the war powers of the
country's commander-in-chief. Then he wrested the Act from
the stupefied and submissive Congress.
But it was the second part of the National Industrial Re-
covery Act which further tantalized the tormented spirit of
the war veterans. Under the provisions of that act, the Presi-
dent was granted unlimited authority in the expenditure of
$3,300,000,000 for public works. The full impact of this
prodigal measure opened the eyes of the harassed targets of
the National Economy League. Sentiments of duty, disci-
pline, and common sacrifice gave way first to indignation
and then to open, large-scale protests. In less than six months,
the Congress, the President, and the country-at-large had
sloughed off the fear of a $5,000,000,000 deficit as embodied
in Economy Bill Public 2, an act “to maintain the credit of
the United States.”
Amid this political razzle dazzle and economic high jinks
and their sickening world-wide concatenations, the citizens of
Cincinnati, during the month of June, 1933, wrestled with
two debilitating phenomena: the inexorable oven-like heat,
and the preparations for the thirteenth annual national con-
vention of the Disabled American Veterans. The torrid cli-
mate which afflicted all segments of the population reflected
the prevailing atmosphere and the relationship between the
war veterans and the general community. Never was the re-
pute of the “saviors of the country” more unsavory. The
President “has a mandate to do what he pleases,” oraculated
the New York Times' Anne O'Hare McCormick, “with the
machinery of the Federal government, and if he had done
no more than scratch the veterans' lobby and cut down on

government overhead by something like a billion dollars, he
has justified his election.” Around the country, Protestant
and Jewish clergymen, beguiled by the glittering grandeur of
their pacifist resolutions, thundered: “The American Legion
is a cancer on the life of America.”
Hence the grim apprehension of the good people of Cin-
cinnati. They believed that all veterans, even the disabled,
“were frauds, treasury raiders, bums and Bolsheviks.” Many
of the community's leading business and professional men
looked on these disabled veterans, whom in 1917 and 1918
they had hailed as heroes whose military service and sacrifice
on the battlefields could never adequately be rewarded, as a
“motley crew of high-binders, chiselers, income-tax raisers,
and extortionists.”
Patently these were miserable distortions of the patriotic
emotions of the substantial elements of the nation's citi-
zenry. They were but the visible manifestations of a world-
community ravaged by Europe's double blight, Bolshevism
and Nazism. Ironically, they who were foremost in this alto-
gether sardonic and concerted effort to discredit the former
“heroes” and “patriots,” invalided in the service of their
country, took the lead in making pro-Bolshevism the badge
of the new dynasty, the American intelligentzia. Thus while
battle-scarred American veterans were humiliated, humbled,
and in some instances hounded, Bolshevik agents and their
American fellow conspirators zestfully set up their cells and
their underground apparatus in almost every department of
the federal government. And while the American Legion
was anathematized by “liberals” and their votaries, Nazi
agents and German-American Bundists came to Cincinnati
in the spring of 1933 as part of Adolf Hitler's global grasp
for power. As a kind of satanic twist, the men whom certain
business and professional groups in Cincinnati importuned to
ferret out, expose, and then to break up local Nazi infiltra-
tions were members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the
American Legion, and the Disabled American Veterans.

“How can you sit there and typewrite in all this blistering
heat, Milt?” asked Dinah.
“Alvin Rowe will be here this evening. I want to finish
this job before he arrives.”
“What are you working on now?”
“A resolution Alvin and I expect to introduce the latter
part of this month at the national DAV convention. But
first it must be approved by the Cincinnati Chapter meeting
tomorrow night.”
“What is the resolution, Milt?”
“We are petitioning the Government to take vigorous ac-
tion against Hitler's Third Reich.”
“How did you and Alvin get mixed up in this business?”
“Professor Marcus and members of his committee came to
us and insisted that it is the patriotic duty of the Legion and
other veteran organizations to come to grips with this Nazi
menace.”
“So that is why you attended the two Bundist meetings?”
“They weren't glad to see us there, Dinah. We sat in the
rear of the meeting room. There weren't many people at
these meetings. Oddly, Dinah, the theme of both the speak-
ers was that Hitler is the great paladin of peace and the arch
foe of Bolshevism.”
“Why didn't Professor Marcus and members of his com-
mittee go themselves, Milt? I don't see why you and Alvin
have to do this dirty work.”
“Perhaps Professor Marcus is attending other Bundist
rallies.”
“Coming back to this resolution, Milt, I believe you and
Alvin are going to have a hard time getting the endorsement
of the Cincinnati DAV. I know these men. Many of them
are German-Americans. They aren't going to go along with
your indictment of the Third Reich.”
“We realize it will be a difficult undertaking, Dinah, but
not because these men are naturally sympathetic with Hitler's
efforts to restore Germany to her place in the sun. Most of

the men are more vitally concerned with hospitalization and
restoration of compensation cuts. The DAV knows that we
have been fighting their battles all these years. They can't
impugn our motives.”
“But won't they assume that you and Alvin are opposing
the Bundists because you are Jews?”
“Naturally they will. But, Dinah, Alvin and I are thinking
in terms of another world war. We believe that the persecu-
tion of the Jews is like the blowing out of a fuse. It is a
warning of an imminent, world-wide conflagration. Anti-
Jewish atrocities provide a smoke screen to conceal what is
really going on inside the Third Reich.”
“What evidence do you have that Hitler is planning an-
other world war, Milt? Germany is too poor. She hasn't
gold enough or credit enough to produce the armaments
needed for even a minor war.”
“Go to my war file, Dinah. Pick out the card marked
‘Germany—Sports’ with a statement by our highly respected
European correspondent, H. R. Knickerbocker.”
“Hitler Germany,” Dinah read aloud, “has initiated a
thorough-going counter-revolution in sports. One of the out-
standing post-war developments in Germany was the intro-
duction and immediate popularity of American athletics—
football, track, tennis, swimming, etc. Today, however,
Wehrsport (war sport) is the only form of exercise approved
by the authorities. It consists chiefly in maneuvers by bands
of uniformed youths. Favorite specialties are “taking a
trench,’ ‘routing an enemy from a village,’ ‘hand-grenade
throwing,” and similar pastimes. ‘War sport, young Germans
are taught, is genuinely German. Sports in the usual sense,
they are reminded, are childish, un-German, downright
American. What, exclaims a Nazi sports writer, should real
young Germans do to develop their bodies, have a good
time, and serve their Fatherland? They should ‘march 12
kilometers in complete silence, hold a simple ceremony honor-
ing the flag, then march back again" 12 kilometers in com-

plete silence.’ This cheerful program has engaged the fancy
of enough German youth to induce 18 sports associations
to protest against the holding of the Olympic Games in Ber-
lin in 1936. Their reasons: ‘Olympic medals are trash.
Nations are not honored by winning foot-races. Nations are
honored by winning wars.’”
“Does this sound as if Germany really wants peace,
Dinah?”
“What about the London Economic Conference arranged
by Herbert Hoover last January, scheduled to begin on the
12th of this month? I understand that representatives from
sixty-six nations will attend, including Maxim Litvinov of
Soviet Russia. What's the purpose of this gathering, Milt?”
“It’s to consider methods of stabilizing world commodity
prices.”
“And if commodity prices are stabilized, will that insure
world peace?”
“Many good people think so, Dinah.”
“And if the nations do not achieve economic stability,
what then?”
“It could mean that both Bolshevism and Nazism would
profit in proportion to world distress.”
“How about Mr. Roosevelt? Is he giving the Conference
full cooperation?”
“Mr. Roosevelt repudiated the League of Nations last
June. When he took us off the gold standard two months
ago, Roosevelt inflicted a serious blow upon the economy of
Great Britain and other European nations. It seems to me,
Dinah, that Mr. Roosevelt is flirting dangerously with Soviet
Russia.”
On the evening of Friday, June 9th, Dinah, accompanied
by her brother, motored to the DAV clubhouse, the quarter-
of-a-million-dollar gift of the Cincinnati community. Lawyer
Alvin Rowe and Rabbi Stern were confident that their reso-
lution would win unanimous approval. Both men had taken
a leading part in the founding and growth of the DAV. Both

had been indefatigable workers, giving of their time and
professional services freely and unstintingly. The building
which the disabled veterans called their clubhouse was, in
large measure, the consummation of the labors of Stern and
other disabled Jewish veterans.
While Dinah remained in the office, Stern and Rowe
mingled with the men in the spacious lobby. All were aware
that Stern and his companion were prepared to test the
loyalty of their comrades. Before the peal of the bugle sum-
moned the men to the auditorium, it was whispered about
that Commander Otis Hess, one of Cincinnati's rising jurists,
would not preside. Too many entangling political and social
alliances could be severely disrupted by the slightest indis-
creet word or gesture by the chairman.
The regular order of business moved along with scarcely
a dissenting voice. Everyone seemed to be eager to take up
Stern's resolution. Under the heading of new business, Stern,
“our distinguished Past National Chaplain,” secured recog-
nition. He advanced and stood before his comrades. At his
left was Acting Commander Russell G. Flynn.
“Comrade Commander and comrades,” Stern began, “may
I yield the floor to our worthy comrade, Alvin Rowe, who
will read the resolution? We urge you to adopt and send it
on to the national convention.”
Permission having been granted, the slender, prematurely
gray-haired lawyer came forward. He was greeted with more
than perfunctory applause. In a clear, mellow voice ringing
with sincerity, Rowe read:
“Whereas, on April 2, 1917, Woodrow Wilson, Presi-
dent of the United States, did proclaim to the Congress
and to the people of the United States of America:
“We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of
false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate
peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples,
the German people included: for the rights of nations

great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to
choose their way of life and of obedience. The world
must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be
planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty.
We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no con-
quest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for our-
selves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we
shall freely make. We are but one of the champions
of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when
those rights have been made as secure as the faith and
the freedom of nations can make them. It is a fearful
thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into
the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization
itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is
more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the
things which we have always carried nearest our hearts
—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to
authority to have a voice in their own governments, for
the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal
dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as
shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the
world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate
our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and
everything that we have, with the pride of those who
know that the day has come when America is privileged
to spend her blood and her might for the principles that
gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she
has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other'
and,”
Here Rowe paused. He surveyed the assembly. The talis-
manic words of Woodrow Wilson had stirred up memories
which even the rancor of the National Economy League
could not obliterate. Assured of a sympathetic audition,
Rowe continued:

resolution of Congress, and approved April 6, 1917, to exist
between the United States of America and the Imperial Ger-
man Government was declared at an end; and,
“Whereas, a treaty between the United States and Ger-
many was signed at Berlin, August 25, 1921, to restore the
friendly relations existing between the two nations prior to
the outbreak of the war; and,
“Whereas, it is the solemn conviction of the enlightened
peoples and nations of the world that the Imperial German
Government is again threatening the liberties, freedom and
peace of democratic governments; and,
“Whereas, the Imperial German Government as at present
constituted, and as revealed through audacious and heinous
crimes against the fundamental rights of man, is a positive
menace to the institutions and to the freedom and peace of
this Republic; and, -
“Whereas, it is self-evident that unless the President of

the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life
and of obedience, the supreme sacrifice of 10,135,000 sol-
diers on the fields of battle, and the cruel disabilities and
infirmities borne by innumerable millions will then have been
in vain; and,

Veterans of the World War, through personal sacrifice and
suffering and service during the past sixteen years, have con-
secrated ourselves as champions of the rights of mankind;

every part of the world against the Imperial German Gov-

American Veterans of the World War, call upon the Presi-

the appropriate diplomatic channels and through the League

ment at Berlin to make immediate redress of such grievances
and just complaints.”
“(Signed) Milton Stern
Cincinnati, Ohio
June 9, 1933”
Stern and his sister rode home late that night of June ninth.
Their hearts were heavy. How would Professor Marcus and
the members of his committee be able to break through the
apathy of the veterans to the ominous roll of Germany's war
drums?
“So,” snapped Dinah, as she wheeled the car into Forest
Avenue, “they ruled your resolution out of order!”
“Yes, they rejected it, Dinah. The argument was that our
resolution was partisan in character. As such, it ran counter
to a ruling made at the San Diego national convention last
summer barring discussion of all partisan political matters
at DAV meetings.”
“It seems to me that everything the DAV takes up at its
national conventions is political. How else could they secure
congressional legislation for veterans?”
“Alvin and I feel that the San Diego ruling was used as
a precedent to kill our resolution as painlessly as possible.
The DAV membership reflects the sentiment and the attitude
of the nation generally. Along with other segments of the
population, our veterans don't want even to think about
another war. The veterans, in particular, are fed up on
appeals to patriotism and such slogans as ‘make the world
safe for democracy.’”

“I can’t blame our veterans, Milt. The Central Conference
of American Rabbis has been consistently issuing anti-war
resolutions. Pacifism seems to be fashionable today.
“Do you remember, Milt, what the Rev. Peter Ainslie of
the Baltimore Christian Temple said? Pastor Ainslie asserted
that the Kellogg Pact outlawed war just as the Eighteenth
Amendment outlawed the saloon, and therefore ministers
would be out of place as chaplains. He said there is no more
justification for being a chaplain in the Army or Navy than
for being a chaplain in a speakeasy.”
“The analogy is ridiculous, Dinah. The duty of a clergy-
man is to be wherever there is need for him. If men are
conscripted or volunteer to fight a war, it is the duty of the
clergy to go with them.”
“And Mr. Roosevelt solemnly assured us we have nothing
to fear but fear! If tonight's action of the DAV is sympto-
matic of the general mood of the nation, Milt, we are going
to wake up one day and find ourselves just as fantastically
unprepared as we were when Woodrow Wilson called for a
declaration of war against Germany in April, 1917.”

CHAPTER XII
GREEN LIGHT FOR THE RED BLIGHT
a momentous political covenant was consummated at
the Executive Mansion in the national capital. The
next morning, at a special convocation at the White House,
with a cigarette holder between his smiling lips, President
Roosevelt welcomed nearly two hundred press correspond-
ents. With Jovian aplomb, he declared that, after sixteen
long years, the government of the United States of America
would establish diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. With astounding swiftness came the
enumeration of the five points covered in the exchange of
five diplomatic notes between the American Chief Magistrate
and Maxim Maximovich Litvinov, People's Commissar for
Foreign Affairs for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The five points were recognition, propaganda, freedom of
worship, the protection of nationalists, and debts and claims.
Soon afterward it was announced that the first American
ambassador to the realm of the “dictatorship of the prole-
tariat” would be William Christian Bullitt, a Philadelphia
millionaire, diplomatist, and novelist, and the divorced
husband of a Communist, who, in 1919, had almost suc-
ceeded in persuading President Woodrow Wilson formally to
recognize the Bolshevik government of Lenin.
President Roosevelt's precedent-shattering recognition of
Soviet Russia came at that moment in American history
when, having been elected to office by the largest majority
in the annals of the Republic and having subsequently been
voted extraordinary powers by the Congress, he pursued his

“omnipotent” business with the blessing of the Constitution
and the wild approval of the populace. It was also precisely
that moment in the weird world revolution when Joseph
Stalin and his Bolshevik henchmen had brought Russia down
into the pit of hell and destruction. May we not believe that
if, at that crucial moment in the story of man, Franklin
Delano Roosevelt had frowned on the blandishments and
spurned the importunities of thick-tongued Maxim Litvinov,
Gori-born Joseph Stalin, and all his grisly host, together with
the preposterous program of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, might
have been washed away with the blood which the demented
children of Mother Russia were to shed on a scale far beyond
the comprehension of the human mind?
As Rabbi Milton Stern contemplated this stupendous, spec-
tacular Rooseveltian diplomatic stroke, he recalled the coun-
sel which Beelzebub gave to Satan, as he had read it in his
Braille edition of John Milton’s “Paradise Lost”:
“Seduce them to our party, that their God
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works. This would surpass
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
In our confusion, and our joy upraise
In his disturbance, when his darling sons,
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse
Their frail original and faded bliss,
Faded so soon. . . .”
What might have been the positive effect of an unbroken,
uncompromising foreign policy of non-recognition of an in-
dubitably unconscionable adversary whose imperialistic blue-
prints called for step-by-step world conquest, and whose
principal goal was first the demoralization and subsequently
the mastery of the people of the United States? It is reason-
able to assume that the kiss of recognition which President
Roosevelt implanted on the Litvinov mask transformed the
mangled Bolshevik phantom into a formidable Frankenstein

and simultaneously accelerated the growth of the alleged
Communist-fighting antibiotics, Italian and German Fascism.
Sixteen years before, on the seventh day of November,
1917, Lenin and his comparatively small Bolshevik band,
comprising less than eighty thousand, overthrew the conserva-
tive Kerensky government. Then followed the infamous
“peace” treaty of Brest Litovsk and the fratricidal civil war
which only too graphically demonstrated that the Russian
people would never bend their necks to the Bolshevik iron
yoke. There is a terrible parallel in the significance of the
events of November 7, 1917, and those of November 16,
1933. The downfall of Kerensky instigated the wholly un-
expected, all-out participation of the United States in World
War I. The diplomatic triumph of Litvinov at midnight of
November 16, 1933, set in motion a chain of other master
maneuverings culminating in the Nazi-Communist pact of
March, 1939, and later in the Molotov-Matsuoko treaty in
the spring of 1941. The Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression
treaty of August, 1939, was the springboard for Hitler's in-
vasion of Poland. The Molotov-Matsuoko pact was Japan's
carte blanche to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
In that informal exchange of five diplomatic notes, on the
night of November 16, 1933, between the American master-
politician Roosevelt and the Polish-born master-diplomat
Litvinov, it was on the quixotic issue of propaganda that the
former sank to the nadir of appalling naivete. The Bolshevik
agent promised an end to the active promotion on American
soil of the world Communist conspiracy and to interference
in American affairs. Deception is a pattern of propaganda—
and play—practiced in varying degrees by almost every na-
tion. But the Litvinov “Big Lie,” perpetrated on the inordi-
nately self-confident President of the United States, was an
accomplishment of staggering dimensions in that titanic game
of political chess.
Four Presidents and five Secretaries of State—Democrats
as well as Republicans—had refused to set the American

seal of approval on the blood-drenched realm of Marxian
Socialism. Seated on his Olympian throne, fawned on by
sycophants and word-intoxicated reformers and idealists,
blinded by the white light of undreamed of power, Roosevelt
was as a child in the hands of this consummate Communist
conspirator. He whose predominant characteristic was the
“will to rule” became the captive of the Kremlin and, in the
process of time, the victim of lethal Communist intrigue.
No more propaganda? No more interference with Ameri-
can affairs? Litvinov might as cherubically have promised
no more floods in the Mississippi River Valley. Communist
propagandizing continued unabated on American soil. The
dramatic turn of events metamorphosed Soviet Russia—the
pariah among the nations—into an eminently respectable
principality. No greater technique of propaganda could have
been devised to match Roosevelt's grandiloquent life-giving
espousal of the dying Red Bolshevik political planet. It was
resurrection—not merely recognition. At the wave of the
President's magic wand, the bedraggled American Communist
Party also became eminently respectable. Insipid Communist
officials, like Earl Browder, took their places on the Ameri-
can political stage alongside such comparatively chaste pa-
triots as Norman Thomas. Soon the worst of these treacher-
ous heathens moved unmolested through the corridors of the
White House, exempt even from the routine surveillance of
Secret Service agents. Unprincipled, mentally perverted
fellows such as Alger Hiss wormed their way into the very
heart of the Federal government. All these American apos-
tates were the loathsome minions of Moscow. They were
part and parcel of the accelerated Communist world-wide
espionage apparatus. Litvinov's pledge notwithstanding, they
actively promoted on American soil the imperialistic, reac-
tionary, cannibalistic Communist conspiracy.
President Roosevelt's unchallenged assumption of power,
and the nation's hypnotic acceptance of his “omniscience”
and “omnipotence,” established the American Communist

Party—and not the American Socialists—as the catch-all
party for left-wingers, liberals, social reformers, utopians,
and political psychopaths. The American Socialist Party
slowly disintegrated. Many who had openly, gallantly,
marched under the brave banners of Eugene V. Debs and
Norman Thomas now, unappeased by Roosevelt's toying with
revolution, found in Communism a swifter, more enchanting
vehicle to the Socialist millennium. These wandering Socialist
soldiers of fortune evidently were strange souls. Patently,
they would not distinguish between murder and morality,
between treason and truth, nor between Marxian class war-
fare and the Prophet Malachi’s “Have we not all one father?
Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously
every man against his brother?” Was it not enough that, in
1921, the foremost American anarchist, Emma Goldman,
had fled from the Soviet slaughterhouse, overwhelmed by the
Kronstadt massacre? Like the hypertrophied mentality of
the two Chicago university students who murdered their kins-
man in the spring of 1924, the atrophied soul of the Com-
munist would not differentiate between men and mosquitoes.
No more propaganda? No more interference with Ameri-
can affairs? “Ever since we recognized Russia in 1933,”
reported the head of our Federal Bureau of Investigation,
“Moscow's spies have been at work. At first they penetrated
factories and laboratories, in order to grab our most advanced
manufacturing processes. For this purpose, the Amtorg
Trading Corporation, established here to promote trade with
the Soviet Union, provided an excellent cover. Amtorg offi-
cials recruited undercover agents who stole formulas for
petroleum products, lacquers, textiles, industrial chemicals.”
“Much espionage assistance,” continues the official state-
ment, “comes from non-Communists—partyless Marxists,
misguided idealists and politically naive reformers. With
such dupes the Soviets have been astoundingly successful. In
many instances these ‘idealists’ furnished valuable data to the
Russian espionage system, unknown to themselves.

“The first approach to this type of recruit is on a high
moral basis,” added J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI,_
“humanity to be the beneficiary.”
Fattened and, as it were, gold-plated by the White House
imprimatur, the conspirators did not stop with the penetra-
tion of industry and labor unions. Suavely flashing White
House credentials, they planted their cankerous cells ubiqui-
tously. The theatre, the press, magazine and book publishing
houses, and the radio soon swarmed with Communist con-
federates. Nor was the church immune. Perhaps the most
efficacious infestation was in the American educational system.
A genuine apostle of social regeneration, Japan's Toyohiko
Kagawa, warned that Communism is no cure but that “it
creates only an infantile paralysis of the social order.” The
sterling liberal American journalists Max Eastman and
Eugene Lyons publicly denounced the Lenin-Stalinist en-
slavement of the Russian people. Notwithstanding, Moscow-
trained panderers of social perfectibility plied their wares
most successfully among the presumably “best people” and
the intelligentsia. Their principal market was America's
most cherished institution, the school and the college.
Teachers make ideal party workers. They are highly artic-
ulate. Teachers are warm and sympathetic. They are easily
converted to “causes.” Some teachers began by joining the
Anti-Fascist Literature Committee, a typical Communist-
front organization. In time they found themselves members
of a teachers’ union controlled by the Communists. Orig-
inally the teachers thought that their job was to fight for
better housing, the workingman, better schools, and similar
humanitarian or social welfare programs. But when they
looked about in vain for leadership and action in these vital
matters, they were cynically told that only those community
tasks were important where there was a group—or minority
—of dissatisfied people in whom they could arouse violent
class and national hatred.

infiltrations of the Communist carriers of social, economic,

political, moral, and spiritual degeneration, foursquarely
stood the American Legion. Unawed by President Roose-
velt's transfiguration of the Bolshevik tyranny, or by the
scorn and contumely of the “liberals,” the American Legion
persisted in its uncompromising, now fourteen-year-old, holy
war against the Communist plague.
Included in the catalogue of “sins” which the enemies of
the American Legion gratuitously broadcast was the smear
that the Legion was a fascist auxiliary of Germany's Adolf
Hitler. Such a canard was standard in the Communist arsenal
of propaganda. It was the poison gas used against all anti-
Bolshevik warriors. In its columns, the Cincinnati American
Israelite of October, 1933, reported: “Without mentioning
the persecution of the Jews in Germany, the annual conven-
tion of the American Legion here [Chicago] went on record
as being vigorously opposed to the activities of the Nazis in
the United States.
“The resolution, presented by the Americanism Committee,
which was adopted, read as follows: “Whereas the Constitu-
tion of our country. . . . Therefore, be it resolved that the
American Legion, in national convention duly assembled,

liam Green of the American Federation of Labor, and Dr.
Edmund A. Walsh, S.J., Vice-President of Georgetown Uni-
versity, marshaled arguments against abandoning the non-
recognition policy of the last fifteen years. . . . Louis A.
Johnson, National Commander of the American Legion, who
presided, read to the assemblage a letter from Bainbridge
Colby in which Colby asserted that the reasons which led to
the non-recognition, declared first by him as Secretary of
State under Wilson, still held good. Colby's letter maintained
the original refusal had nothing to do with debt repudiation,
communism, or any internal matters, but was ‘predicated upon
the fact that Russia was an enemy state.’”
“‘To concede recognition as a friend,’ the letter continued,
‘to a nation that protests she is not a friend, but, on the
contrary, is dedicated to the overthrow of our institutions
and to conspire against our peace and security, is unthink-
able.’”
The patriotic zeal of the Legionnaires in the lower eche-
lons, at this time, was parochial. In Cincinnati, the members
of the Avondale American Legion, Eli Wittstein Post No. 524,
under the leadership of Commander Alvin Rowe and Chap-
lain Milton Stern, earnestly devoted themselves to community
service. As chairman of the post committee on traffic, Rabbi
Stern drew up a list of detailed recommendations for the
relief of traffic hazards in the Avondale suburb. Together
with Past Commander Nathan Vigran, Stern prepared an
elaborate Memorial Day program, the first of its kind in the
area. On Sunday afternoon, May 27th, Rabbi Stern, repre-
senting the Jewish faith, participated in a unique “Massing
of the Flag Service,” in Cincinnati's historic Eden Park.
These ceremonies, held for the first time in the Middle West,
were purely patriotic in nature, and civic, veteran, patriotic,
fraternal, and religious organizations joined in tribute to the
flag of the United States. In addition to their national colors,
the Sons of the American Revolution brought ten American
pre-Revolutionary flags. Two pages, dressed in white, ac-

companied the national colors and the standards of the
Daughters of the American Revolution.
“The time has now come,” thundered Stern from the band-
stand, “to declare that every citizen who salutes the Stars
and Stripes and, at the same moment, fails to realize the
spiritual significance of the act, is akin to the idol worshipper.
The time has come to denounce every citizen who pays
allegiance to the flag of any foreign nation as a political
adulterer, and his act as treason. The time has come to
combat every form of foreign intrigue on our soil. The time
has come to exterminate every force in this country which
plots to destroy the Union by propagation of alien doctrines
and by attempting to divide the inhabitants into racial
enemies.
“Hail then the spirit of American Democracy! Hail the
spirit of Liberty! Hail the spirit which strengthens every man
in his pursuit of happiness, which sweetens his daily toil, that
makes him prince of his soul, and that brings closer the king-
dom of God on earth!”
At the Isaac M. Wise Center, on Wednesday evening,
December 20th, at a regular meeting of the Eli Wittstein
Post, the sober tone of the deliberations in the Center class-
room was heightened when Commander Rowe said: “Com-
rades, I have a letter from our Fourth District Commander
John E. Hendrixson. John is asking us to do something that
strikes your commander as being most extraordinary, even
though many of our American Legion posts have already
approved. I am going to read the letter. Afterward, Adjutant
Metzner will read the resolution that our post committee on
Americanism has drawn up in answer.”
The hardly more than twelve Legionnaires—a glazier, a
dentist, a physician, three lawyers, and several merchants—
listened diffidently as Adjutant Metzner, a Protestant, read
the defiant resolution. All the other posts in the Fourth Dis-
trict had supported the plan. How could this little band of

rebels stand up against the almost unanimous will of the
Ohio Department? But that was the essence of the demo-
cratic foundation of the American Legion: freedom of speech
and freedom of action.
“Whereas,” began the adjutant, “John E. Hendrixson . . .
has sent out a letter which in part reads as follows: ‘Each
post commander is requested to appoint at once a committee
of three to five members to serve on their Americanism Com-
mittee. These committeemen should be alert to investigate
all Communist activities and endeavor to find out who in
their community is inclined toward Communist endeavor,
their occupation, their activity, their addresses, etc. This in-
formation is to be communicated to. . . . In order that the
work of this committee may be effective, it is the desire to
have its members known only by numbers. Our American-
ism Committee means business and wants to eliminate from
Ohio the leaders of these subversive groups. Select your best
men . . .';
“And whereas, the said letter was published in all the news-
papers of the City of Cincinnati before it was received by
the post commanders in the Fourth District;
“And whereas, the natural result of the activities of such a
secret-service committee would militate against the guaran-
tees in the Constitution of the United States of freedom of
speech and the right peaceably to assemble and to petition
the government for the redress of grievances; and, therefore,
would be inconsistent with the oath which every Legionnaire
gave on attaining membership, “to uphold and defend the
Constitution of the United States’;
“And whereas, the activities of such committees would
breed violence and would frequently interrupt the reign of
law and order which is necessary to the permanence of peace
and security within our own boundaries;
“And whereas, the members of Eli Wittstein Post No. 524,
American Legion, repose the utmost confidence and faith in
the governmental institutions of this country for the main-

tenance of law and order, including the United States Secret
Service, the United States Department of Justice, and the
Police Departments of our local and state governments, which
are fully competent, as they have proved themselves to be by
the test of time, to curb and root out any and all illegal,
radical, and Communist activities plainly against the law;
“And whereas, the American Legion will be hated and
despised by all thinking people if we waste the energy, which
should be devoted to our comrades and to the welfare of our
country, on this fruitless cause of super-espionage service, to
be imposed over and above our governmental agencies;
“And whereas, it is the firm belief of the members of this
post that the right way to combat subversive groups, spon-
sored by foreign countries, in their radical and fallacious
appeals, is to encourage them to come out into the open,
where the agencies of law will meet them, and to challenge
their radical propaganda by an educational campaign of true
American ideas and ideals, as sponsored by the Legion;
“Therefore, be it resolved by Eli Wittstein Post . . . that
this post go on record as condemning the request . . . as
being un-American, as being in violation of the Constitution
of the United States of America, and as being in violation
of the Constitution of the American Legion;
“And be it further resolved that the request . . . to ap-
point committees . . . whose function it shall be to spy on
their fellow citizens . . . would be a violation, not only of
the oath of the post commander of the American Legion, but
would be a violation of the same oath on the part of the
members who would constitute such a committee;
“. . . the Eli Wittstein Post . . . will have nothing to do
with such activities as stated above;
“And be it further resolved that our commander be em-
powered and directed to write an open letter, embodying the
essentials of this resolution, to Comrade John E. Hendrixson
. and that copies of such letter be furnished to the news-
papers.”

In response to rapid cross-fire questioning, Commander
Rowe allayed the trepidation of his fellow Legionnaires. He
assured them that nothing would be done to weaken the
structural relationship between the post and the upper
branches of the American Legion. Rowe also expounded the
legal tenet that membership in the American Communist
Party per se could not be regarded as an act of sedition. The
year-old Roosevelt recognition of the Soviet Union, the com-
mander averred, carried with it the pledge that Communists
would not engage in any form of subversive activity on Amer-
ican soil.
The resolution was formally approved and adopted. The
twelve or so veterans returned to their homes that December
night, unaware that the manifesto which they were about to
issue would shake the American Legion from coast to coast.
The intensity of the public discussion which followed in the
press was summed up in the personal reaction of Cincinnati's
best-known columnist: “Cincinnatus salutes the Eli Wittstein
Post, American Legion, which refuses to be a spy.”
The forensic whirlwind could be confined neither to Cin-
cinnati nor to the State of Ohio. One week after the resolu-
tion had appeared in the Cincinnati newspapers, Commander
Rowe telephoned Stern. “Milton, I want to read to you an
article in the New York Post dated December 29, 1934.
These are the headlines: “Use of spies in war against “Reds”
denied by N. Y. Legion. State chief says campaign is “open
and above board.” Disclaimer follows revolt of Cincinnati
post against “Snoop order.” Ohio group condemns peril to
free speech.’”
Then Rowe turned to the body of the approximately one-
thousand-word story of the American Legion's sensational
“nationwide survey” on Communists and Communist nefar-
ious enterprises on American soil. Included were passages
from the Wittstein Post resolution of December 20th. The
New York Post's effusive report concluded with a disserta-
tion on the history and goal of the Legion's vigorous program:

“Early this month a bulletin issued by the Legion's ‘Na-
tional Americanism Commission,’ under title of “The Huddle,”
urged every Legion department, district, county and post
organization to “start the year with an active Americanism
chairman. . . . [It is] important that this man be among the
most patriotic and active members. . . .”
“An editorial column said the commission was ‘carrying
on a nationwide survey to collect all authentic information
concerning the activities of Communists and other un-
American groups. . . . Every post of the Legion is urged
to send to the office of the director of the National Ameri-
canism Commission every bit of authentic information on
this subject.
“‘If a Communist agitator is at work in your community
spreading his poisonous propaganda, we want to know his
name and address and also have a resume of his activities.
Clippings from newspapers or periodicals of any kind will
be of great help in making this compilation.”
“The first page of “The Huddle' is decorated by sketches
of two Legion groups, one of women, one of men, with their
heads together as though in secret pow-wow.”
There was a lull over the telephone. Commander Rowe
had completed the reading of the newspaper text. Then
Rowe's voice vibrated again through the instrument. “What
do you think of this article, Milton?” he asked exultantly.
“It is a strange situation, Alvin. Under the law, the Amer-
ican Communist Party has as much right to existence in our
country as do the Republican, Democratic, Socialist, and
Prohibition parties. Our government has exchanged ambas-
sadors with the Soviet Union. Notwithstanding, we of the
American Legion are still unalterably opposed to Commun-
ism, as well as to Nazism. Communists are our enemies.
Every member of the American Communist Party is a Rus-
sian robot in the world-wide conspiracy to turn his country
Over to the Bolsheviki.”

“But, Milton, certainly you are not in favor of the Legion's
directive to spy on our neighbors?”
“I am absolutely opposed to it, Alvin. That would be an
adoption of the Communist tactics we condemn.”
“It means, Milton, we'll have to stand practically alone.
Our post has taken the unpopular position. There are many
outside the Legion who think we were wrong in opposing
Hendrixson's orders.”
“You and I must stand firm in opposition to Legionnaires’
serving as vigilantes or spies. But, Alvin, we must be vigi-
lant. Otherwise, while the American Legion is conducting
guerrilla warfare against Communists, our country will slide
imperceptibly from New Deal Socialism into Communism.
And in the interim, real patriots—to paraphrase the words
of George Washington—who resist the intrigues of the Com-
munists will become suspected and odious; while the tools
and dupes of the Bolsheviki usurp the applause and confi-
dence of the people, only to surrender their interests to the
enemy.”
“The President is a good man, Milton. We can trust him.”
“I know you idolize the President, Alvin. Yet I believe
we have less to fear from the geopoliticians in Berlin, Tokyo,
and Moscow than from the Marxist-infatuated, pseudo-
political genii who use Mr. Roosevelt as a ventriloquist
operates a wooden puppet.”

peregrinations as the national field representative of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Stern
had met Attorney Abe D. Waldauer, an uncommonly radiant
and warmhearted personality, in the city of Memphis, Ten-
nessee. One evening Waldauer placed a fifteen-page pamph-
let in Stern's hand, with the fervent recommendation that he
read it carefully. The pamphlet contained a lecture on Moses
by Henry George, first delivered in San Francisco in June,
1878. Homeward bound, as Dinah read, Stern was enthralled
with both the grandeur of the style and the astonishing com-
prehension by the Christian interpreter of the character and
the accomplishments of Israel's greatest teacher.
“Just a moment, Dinah,” Stern said almost fiercely, “let’s
underline these passages.”
Constant interruption of this sort was almost too much for
Dinah, whose chief concern was to complete the task before
the train reached their destination. Then, when all the fifteen
pocket-size pages had been read, Stern asked his sister to
reread the passages she had marked. Among them were:
“Habits of thought are even more tyrannous than habits
of the body.”
“The striking differences between Egyptian and Hebrew
polity are not of form but of essence. The tendency of the
one is to subordination and oppression; of the other, to indi-
vidual freedom.”
“Nor was it [the Hebrew commonwealth] a republic where
the freedom of the citizen rested on the servitude of the helot,
and the individual was sacrificed to the state. It was a com-
9: THE month of March, 1929, in the course of his

monwealth based upon the individual—a commonwealth
whose ideal it was that every man should sit under his own
vine and fig tree, with none to vex him or make him afraid;
a commonwealth in which none should be condemned to
ceaseless toil; in which, for even the bond slave, there should
be hope; in which, for even the beast of burden, there should
be rest.”
“It is not the protection of property, but the protection of
humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code.”
“And the doctrine of immortality, springing as it does from
the very depths of human nature, ministering to aspirations
which become stronger and stronger as intellectual life rises
to higher planes and the life of the affections becomes more
intense, may yet become so incrusted with degrading super-
stitions, may be turned by craft and selfishness into such a
potent instrument for enslavement, and so used to justify
crimes at which every natural instinct revolts, that to the
earnest spirit of the social reformer it may seem like an
agency of oppression to enchain the intellect and prevent
true progress; a lying device with which the cunning fetter
the credulous.”
“He [Moses] saw that to permit in land the same unquali-
fied private ownership that by natural right attaches to the
things produced by labour, would be inevitably to separate
the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to
enslave labour—to make the few the masters of the many,
no matter what the political forms; to bring vice and degra-
dation, no matter what the religion.”
Thus the quiescent spirit of Henry George, the “Prophet
of San Francisco,” revivified by the alchemy of Dinah’s read-
ing, captured the soul of Rabbi Stern. And in the course of
time, the smoldering Single Tax movement, for which the
writings of Henry George were the scriptures of truth, ac-
quired a new and bold advocate. Stung to the quick by the
seeming callousness of the supposedly high-minded directors
of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, during

the dismal days of the Great Depression, Stern read Henry
George's 565-page magnum opus, Progress and Poverty, with
the conviction that the American social philosopher, Henry
George, and not Moses, the Hebrew-Egyptian prince and
master-builder of Judaism, was humanity's chief dissolver of
doubts.
It was natural, therefore, that when Stern met with the
Cincinnati committee in charge of the national convention
of the Disabled American Veterans at Cincinnati, in June,
1933, he should have recommended Abe Waldauer of Mem-
phis as one well qualified to bring a message of hope to the
economically distressed veterans.
But convention chairman Robert Bunge and National Ad-
jutant Vivian Corbly met Stern's proposal with misgivings.
If Waldauer was a Single-Taxer, he was thereby a radical.
His words, they claimed, would only add fuel to the already
too, too many torches of rebellion carried by the veterans.
“There is nothing wild about Waldauer's economic prin-
ciples,” Stern said. “Waldauer is one of Tennessee's leading
Democrats, and very conservative in his political thinking.”
“What's so good about Waldauer's ideas, Milt?” asked
Bunge, himself a stalwart Republican, and by profession an
engineer specializing in the construction of federal and state
penitentiaries.
“Waldauer believes that land speculation is the chief cause
of major depressions. He would like to make land so cheap
that it will be possible for the average man to own a small
farm. This could make him truly independent. He would no
longer be a wage slave, utterly dependent upon a factory job
for his livelihood.”
“Isn't that something like Communism?” Corbly inquired.
“Individual ownership of land is contrary to Communist
doctrine, Vivian. Waldauer wants a maximum of private
ownership in industry as well as in land. That can be brought
about by the abolition of all forms of taxation save that on
the socially created value of land. Communism calls for the

total abolition of private ownership in any shape or form,
with the government in complete control of everything, in-
cluding man himself.”
“That sounds to me like the philosophy of some European
radical. It's the sort of stuff they talked about during the
days of the French Revolution, Milt.”
“Nothing of the sort, Bob. Those ideas were worked out
by a God-fearing Christian, born in Philadelphia, not far
from Independence Hall. I would say that Henry George
comes closer to the teachings of the Bible than any social
philosopher since Moses.”
“I’ve never heard of Henry George, Milt,” Corbly said.
“I’ve heard of a Henry George cigar,” added Bunge. “But
if you think that Abe Waldauer is worth hearing, why, we'll
make room for him somewhere on our program. Go ahead,
Milt, and send him an invitation.”
Waldauer came to Cincinnati. His speech was sandwiched
in perfunctorily between introductions of distinguished
guests. But his professorial manner of speech and his words
lacked dramatic appeal. Scarcely a delegate seemed to be
affected by Waldauer's polished exposition of Henry George's
noble concepts. The veterans wanted something tangible.
They were impatient with theories. They wanted restoration
of their just compensation and adequate hospitalization. The
sublime utterances of Moses and Henry George were as taste-
less and effete as were the preposterous word-jugglings of
the New Deal wizards in Washington.
Waldauer's failure to electrify the convention and to win
converts put a damper on Stern's enthusiasm. Clearly the
world was not eager to turn a receptive ear to the undefiled,
radically pure teachings of Henry George. Nevertheless,
Stern continued to study Progress and Poverty until he was
sure he had a firm grasp on the basic principles and precise
plan for social and economic regeneration.
Two years after the national Disabled American Veterans'
convention, in the spring of 1935, one morning's mail brought

a circular. The name of Henry George was conspicuous.
It advertised, not a cigar, but a school in New York City.
A school, opened in 1933! That was something concrete.
That was a daring gesture. Would the reader, the circular
inquired, care to have the field director of the Henry George
School of Social Science visit his community?
John Lawrence Monroe, the field director, very young and
very earnest, came to Cincinnati on June 5th. Stern and his
sister had followed the instructions previously mailed them
and sent invitations to those on the list furnished by the field
director. The Sterns’ Forest Avenue home was the meeting
place. The roll was called: Dr. Abraham Cronbach, Hebrew
Union College professor; Frank B. McConaughy, attorney;
Carl H. Olsen, pastor of the Universalist Church; Herbert
S. Bigelow, Cincinnati's famous clergyman-politician; Fenton
E. Lawson, manufacturer; Robert Harris, carpenter; O. A.
Toepfert, photographer. Monroe reported on the modest ad-
vances made by the New York school. The distinguishing
features of the Henry George School were these: the doc-
trines of Henry George would be taught systematically; the
textbook for the preliminary course was Progress and Pov-
erty; there was no professional faculty. Would these old and
new friends of Single Tax be willing to establish a branch
of the Henry George School in Cincinnatiº The eighteen
present enthusiastically endorsed Monroe's proposal. Stern
and McConaughy were appointed the school committee. The
field director assured his Cincinnati audience that he would
return in good time and with its aid inaugurate classes in
Progress and Poverty in various sections of the city, early in
September. The names of Ed Alexander, Assistant City
Solicitor; Charles Merrell, manufacturer; and Dr. Louis
Hoeck, Swedenborgian minister, were added to the school
committee.
The caliber and character of the men and women who
thus openly espoused the Georgist program of social recon-
struction were proof enough of the soundness and vitality of

the Single Tax reform. And when Stern found that the Cin-
cinnati newspapers gave wide publicity to the work of his
school committee, he was sure he was on the right path. He
followed the field director's instructions with the same ardor
and singleness of purpose as though he, too, had been em-
ployed professionally. He read more and more of George's
writings. As they came from the lips of his readers, George's
words were lightning-like in their prophetic quality. If only
every intelligent and truly patriotic American would read
Progress and Poverty! Ah, the pity of it all! Why did
Roosevelt and his entourage of brilliant “bragging-jacks” turn
to the writings of European economists? Why had they
ignored the unadulterated, undefiled, universally acclaimed
words of the American master of the science of political
economy?
Stern was now convinced that Henry George's writings
were no less divinely inspired than the utterances of Moses
and Isaiah, and that George was also a channel of divine
revelation as were Jeremiah and Amos. Stern resolved to
expound the teachings of Henry George with the same rever-
ence and the same lofty confidence as he did the eternal
verities of the great prophets of Israel.
Classes were set up in high schools, branch public libraries,
downtown office buildings, and the vestry rooms of churches.
There were no fees, no salaries. It was all a labor of love,
a consecration to the highest calling: “Ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free.” Those who came
as students were eager, anxious, seeking the answer to the
great human perplexity of poverty existing side by side with
opulence. There was an air of hopefulness and urgency. If
only the truth taught by Henry George could reach the world
in time! It would avert colossal catastrophe. Naught else
was needed to bring bread and peace to undernourished mil-
lions of human being everywhere on earth. In Italy, Russia,
Germany, Japan, armies and armaments were the first order

of the day. Would America, in desperation, at last succumb
to the arbitrament of arms? Was Marxian chaos to be the
only ultimate prelude to a new social order?
With the same doggedness with which a scientist in his
laboratory pursues a series of experiments that he fully be-
lieves will culminate in the discovery of a miracle drug,
Rabbi Stern, avidly, tirelessly, read not only Henry George's
Progress and Poverty, but likewise George's other works:
Social Problems; Protection or Free Trade; The Condition of
Labor; The Land Question; and, at last, George's proudest
literary achievement, The Science of Political Economy.
Again and again, Stern paused to ask his Hebrew Union
College student-reader: “How can any genuinely intelligent
person prefer the writings of Karl Marx to those of Henry
George? George's every sentence, every clause, every phrase,
are perfect examples of ‘thought and art in one.” They demon-
strate the requisite classic qualities—truth and seriousness.
In contrast, the passages from Marx are a wilderness of
words.
“Is it,” Stern continued, “because the so-called American
liberal will believe only that which is absurd? Here, as in
innumerable instances, Henry George comes up with the cor-
rect answer.”
“This pseudo-science [of political economy],” Stern's com-
panion reread, “gets its name from a foreign language, and
uses for its terms words adapted from the German—words
that have no place and no meaning in an English work. It
is, indeed, admirably calculated to serve the purpose of those
powerful interests dominant in the colleges under our organ-
ization, that must fear a simple and understandable political
economy, and who vaguely wish to have the poor boys who
are subjected to it by their professors rendered incapable of
thought on economic subjects. [Italics mine.]
“There is nothing that suggests so much what Schopen-
hauer [Parerga and Paralipomena'] said of the works of the

German philosopher Hegel,” the reader went on, “than what
the professors have written, and the volumes for mutual
admiration which they publish as serials:
“‘If one should wish to make a bright young man so stupid
as to become incapable of all real thinking, the best way
would be to commend to him a diligent study of these works.
For these monstrous piecings together of words which really
destroy and contradict one another so causes [sic] the mind
to vainly torment itself in the effort to discover their meaning
that at last it collapses exhausted, with its capacity for think-
ing so completely destroyed that from that time on meaning-
less phrases count with it for thoughts.’”
“Rabbi,” the student-reader asked, “Waldo Frank says that
the modern Jew, if he is to exist, must interpret Marx as a
prophet as surely as his forebears interpreted Moses and
Isaiah. Frank also claims that Marx gives reality to a pro-
gram of social justice in an age of machines.”
“The German Socialist Karl Marx,” Stern answered, “was
an atheist and a misanthrope. When Waldo Frank puts Marx
in the same order with Moses and Isaiah, it is as blasphemous
as when Germans place Hitler in the same class with Martin
Luther.”
“But, Rabbi, you seem to feel that Henry George is also
among the prophets.”
“Henry George was a man of God. He was not a “verbal-
istic humanitarian.” Henry George thought, wrote, and lived
by the grace of the holy spirit, as did the great prophets of
Israel. Henry George and Karl Marx were contemporaries.
Let us see what George had to say about Marxist Socialism.”
The student drew out the card containing George's an-
alysis of the Marxian dialectic. He slowly read: “The Ger-
man mind, learned, bureaucratic and incomprehensible, put
this in the form of what passed for a system in Karl Marx's
ponderous two volumes entitled “Capital,’ written in England
in 1867, but published in Germany and not translated into
English until after his death in 1887. . . .

“We sometimes hear of ‘scientific socialism' as something
to be established, as it were, by proclamation, or by act of
government. In this there is a tendency to confuse the idea
of science with that of something purely conventional or
political, a scheme or proposal, not a science. . . . [Italics
mine.]
“How such a combination could be called a science, and
how it should get a following, can be accounted for only by
the ‘fatal facility of writing without thinking,’ which the
learned German ability of studying details without any lead-
ing principle permits to pass, and by the number of places
which such a bureaucratic organization would provide.”
“Rabbi, isn't the Single Tax principle really European in
origin?”
“As with almost all our institutions, traditions, and even
language, the Single Tax is not indigenous to America. It is
not the creation of Henry George. He borrowed the concept
from François Quesnay, an eighteenth-century French physi-
cian and economist. Quesnay was a physiocrat. Had the
doctrines of Quesnay prevailed over those of Rousseau, there
would have been no Reign of Terror in France.”
“Doesn't Spinoza mention the Single Tax in his tractate
on politics?”
“Yes, he does. And if you pursued the idea further, you
could trace it back to the Bible and Moses. Turn to the
twenty-fifth chapter of the Book of Leviticus. Here are the
words inscribed on the Liberty Bell: ‘Proclaim liberty through-
out all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof.” But don’t
stop there. The next two clauses are most significant: ‘It
shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man
unto his possession.’ Possession means the land!
“It is the twenty-third verse which is all-important: “And
the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine.’
The inescapable conclusion is that there can be no liberty
without the perpetual and private ownership of land, man's
endowment from the Creator.”

“Then what is so distinctively American about Henry
George's social philosophy, Rabbi”
“That men should not ask a just God's—or society's—
assistance in ‘wringing their bread from the sweat of other
men's faces.’”
Late in September, 1935, Stern, accompanied by Leah,
registered at the Hotel New Yorker, in New York City. They
were the Cincinnati delegates to the tenth international Henry
George Congress. And Stern was more than a delegate. At
the first evening session, on Thursday, September 26th, he
was to deliver the principal address on the general theme of
“The Solution of our Present Economic Problems.”
This was not the first opportunity which Stern had had to
occupy the center of a convention stage as a Single Tax
orator. Twice previously, before war veteran organizations,
he had appeared as a convention speaker and had dared to
offer the Single Tax reform of Henry George as the only
effective remedy for social, economic, and political malad-
justments. But in each instance, the response of the veterans
was as though they were listening to the words of an ancient
oracle—mystic, and far removed from reality. In Toledo,
at the 1934 reunion of the 37th Division (Ohio National
Guard), Stern had exhorted his comrades: “I warn you not
to look to Europe for a way out of our economic dilemma.
We can, we will, be victorious if we rely upon the honor, the
good sense, and the virtues of our American prophets. All
we need today is men of courage and vision, men in whom
there is the spirit of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln to
show us the way to victory.”
In Charlotte, North Carolina, at the state convention of
the Disabled American Veterans, in the spring of 1935, in
a speech entitled “When the Dead Awake,” Stern declared:
“Many remedies have already been tried. Many creations of
heat-oppressed brains have been weighed and found wanting.
I say that the Single Tax program of Henry George must

ultimately become the sure foundation of our American
democracy, the fulfillment of our Declaration of Independ-
ence, the word become flesh. Today I can but prophesy. It
is for you to act. You can bring this most blessed state into
living form by the wise and consecrated use of the ballot.”
At the Hotel New Yorker, the milieu was most propitious.
Here before him were men and women from every part of
the United States and Canada. Here were also F. Folke from
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Arthur Madsen from London.
Here were Charles R. Eckert, Congressman from Pennsyl-
vania; Walter Fairchild, secretary of the American Associa-
tion for Scientific Taxation; William N. McNair, mayor of
Pittsburgh; Colonel Victor Rule of Chicago; Charles H. In-
gersoll, of New Jersey, watch manufacturer; and Anna
George de Mille, daughter of the American prophet of social
justice. Here was the broker Lancaster Greene, a New York
Quaker and a lineal descendant of the illustrious General
Nathanael Greene of the American Revolution. Here were
reporters from the New York Times, one of the world's great
newspapers. Here again was the highly esteemed Tennessee
Democrat, Abe D. Waldauer of Memphis, who had been
chosen to open the Thursday evening session with a speech
of introduction. And here Charles O'Connor Hennessy, pres-
ident of the Schalkenbach Foundation, in New York, read a
profoundly prescient message from Viscount Stanley Bald-
win, former prime minister of the British Empire. No orator
could have asked for a more sympathetic audience, or a more
dramatic moment, or a greater crisis. The world wanted a
way of salvation now. Stern was sure that out of the delibe-
rations of this congress would come the light, the truth, and
the way.
“I am a Georgist,” Stern concluded his “New Birth of
Freedom” address. “I have chosen the way of truth. I am
a disciple of the divine teachings of a long line of prophets,
philosophers, poets, and economists, whose muse was Liberty

sublime revelations of Moses, Confucius, Spinoza, Adam

“I affirm that the earth is the Lord's and that the fulness
thereof, God hath given to all His children. I affirm that

“I declare that private exploitation of land has been and
continues to be the cause of the unmitigated reign of poverty,

“I affirm that every form of taxation is legalized robbery,

tions of tribes, nations, and empires.
“I affirm that Socialism, Communism, Fascism, and New
Dealism are naught but modern reproductions of ancient
despotisms.
“I believe with all my mind and with all the power of my
soul that the only sure foundation for political, social, and
economic progress is the Single Tax program of Henry
George.”

CHAPTER XIV
“WE CHOOSE PEACE”
& C LITTLE more than two years ago,” reported
cºſ Herbert Harris in Current History for February,
1936, “Dr. Francis Everett Townsend, then 66
and jobless, looked out the window of his apartment into an
alley and saw three aged women rummaging among garbage
cans, seeking scraps of food. The good doctor swore: it
was a cry of pain and protest against a social order that
permitted such things in America.
“All day he raged to his wife. It was unjust. He would
do something about it. He did. That night he drafted the
first rough outline of what was to become the Old Age
Revolving Pensions, Ltd., the “Townsend Plan.”
“He was actuated,” continued Harris, “by a profound
faith in the rightness of his course, and has confessed that
sometimes he feels chosen of God to accomplish his mission.
“The road of American politics is strewn with the corpses
of monetary panaceas, from the first “Greenbackers' to Father
Coughlin's new sacredness of silver.
“The cards,” Harris presaged, “are stacked against the
Townsendites because, facing a Presidential year, both Demo-
cratic and Republican chieftains will avoid as a plague any
such inflammatory issue.”
Under the provisions of the Townsend Plan, every person
sixty years of age and over would receive a federal pension
of $200 per month. For the estimated eight million pen-
sioners above the sixty-year limit, the cost would be twenty
billion dollars a year, at least four times the 1936 federal
TeVenue.

And while the spiritually rejuvenated Dr. Francis Town-
send, and the several million “Townsend Marching Soldiers,”
in particular, and the nation at large girded themselves for
the quadrennial political Armageddon in the autumn of 1936,
Rabbi Stern was engrossed in a multiplicity of details con-
nected with other and vastly less significant coming events.
In November, shortly after Election Day, Cincinnati would be
the host city to delegates to the eleventh international Henry
George Congress, with Stern as general convention chairman.
Around Labor Day, Cincinnati would also welcome the par-
ticipants in the eighteenth annual reunion of the 37th Division
A.E.F. Veterans Association.
Among the notables invited to Cincinnati for the 37th
Division reunion was Count van der Straten Ponthoz, the
Belgian ambassador to the United States. In a letter of
regret to Rabbi Stern, the Memorial Service Committee
Chairman, the ambassador wrote:
“There is a special association between my country and
the 37th American Division. A detachment of your troops
accompanied King Albert with Queen Elizabeth and their
son, our present Sovereign, King Leopold, on their entry
into Brussels after the Armistice, and it was your Division
whose irresistible dash through Flanders and across the
Scheldt was described by King Albert as ‘one of the most
brilliant feats of arms of the latest war' . . . assure them that
their courage and conduct will ever be remembered by the
Belgian people and by their comrades of the Belgian Army.”
Somewhere, sitting unobtrusively in the cross-section rep-
resentation of Ohio's war veterans, during the Sunday morn-
ing memorial service, on September 6th, was Al N. Jappe, a
Cleveland attorney. In the autumn of 1917, Jappe and Stern
were non-commissioned officers attached to the staff of
Brigadier-General Charles Zimmerman of the 37th Division,
then stationed near Montgomery, Alabama. They were of
the same stature, religion, temperament, and political affilia-
tion. Nineteen years of friendship had been marked by
unbroken loyalty and genuine comradeship. Jappe's admira-

tion for his former comrade-in-arms was unfeigned. His
affection was tempered with a robust respect for Stern's pro-
fessional attainments and rugged convictions.
At the conclusion of the memorial service, both Dinah and
Jappe met Stern at the platform. After a half-hour exchange
of greetings with the men and women in the auditorium, the
three entered the hotel dining room. Spurred on by Dinah, the
conversation, purely personal in character, now veered to the
topic of world-wide interest and importance: the 1936 Presi-
dential campaign. Few persons were more intimately in-
formed on this subject than was Al Jappe. He and his brother
James served the Republican National Committee as con-
sultants in the broad field of public relations.
“Did you hear the radio broadcast of the Republican Con-
vention in Cleveland last June, Milt?”
“I didn't miss very much of it, Al. Dinah and I thought
that John D. M. Hamilton, the new national chairman of the
party, made a better speech than did Governor Alf M.
Landon.”
“We liked Landon's stand on the gold question. We also
liked his position in favor of liberal legislation for women
and children in industry,” said Dinah.
“None of us,” interposed Stern, “will have to apologize for
anything in the Republican Party's platform, Al, except in
the matter of reciprocal trade. I believe the Republican
Party's greatest mistake is its incorrigible advocacy of a high
tariff. I am all for a sound currency and against any further
devaluation of the dollar, and for all reasonable social welfare
planks. I am strongly in favor of resisting any attempt to
impair the majesty and the authority of the Supreme Court.”
“Is there really very much difference between the platforms
of the two major parties?”
“Very little, Dinah.”
“But you don't expect the Democrats to keep their cam-
paign promises, Al? Certainly they haven't done much about
reducing expenses and balancing the budget.”


## p. 132 (#158) ############################################

132 *> R E D POT TA GE
“It seems to me, Al,” continued Dinah, “Landon should
be able to defeat Roosevelt with the greatest of ease. Leading
Democrats like Tydings, Byrd, Reed, and Colby don’t want
Roosevelt. Carter Glass expects to sit out this campaign. Al
Smith is going to take the stump for Landon. There seems
to be no end to large-scale unemployment. The Roosevelt
administration has already spent about $10,000,000,000 on
relief alone, since March, 1933. The national deficit is larger
now than it has ever been. The Supreme Court has invali-
dated the NRA, the AAA, and the Guffey Bill—those grandi-
ose New Deal measures. Congress has stopped work on
such profligate projects as the Western ‘shelter-belt, Passama-
quoddy, and the Florida Ship-Canal.”
“What about the other candidates, Al?”
“Norman Thomas is running on the Socialist ticket; Earl
Browder, on the Communist.”
“We hear that William Lemke,” Stern added, “has lined up
all the followers of Father Charles Coughlin, Dr. Francis
Townsend, the Rev. Gerald Smith, and Huey Long's powerful
organization in the South. Some experts believe that means a
shift of nine million votes away from Roosevelt.”
“Not many months ago, Al,” Dinah mused, “there was talk
in Washington about sending Dr. Townsend to jail for con-
tempt of Congress. Six months before, the pensions-for-
oldsters issue was ridiculed. Now both major parties have it
in their platforms, and Roosevelt is certainly pounding away
as hard as he can—in its favor.”
“What about Roosevelt’s veto of the bonus, Milt? Won't
the veterans vote against him for that?”
“We can't put any reliance on a solid veteran bloc. Polit-
ically, the veterans are split. Here in our 37th Division
Association, we have such Democrats as Judge Thomas Mor-
row and Congressman John McSweeney. Both men are well
thought of.” -
“Milt, tell Al about your reactions to Roosevelt's Peace
Address at Lake Chautauqua, on August 14th.”
“It was a ghastly thing, Al.”


## p. 133 (#159) ############################################

“Why so, Milt?”
“In the first place, let's remember what Frank Simonds,
in his book America Faces the Next War, has to say about
Roosevelt's foreign policy. Simonds is convinced that the
foreign policy Roosevelt is pursuing will just as surely get us
into another war as did the foreign policy of Woodrow Wil-
Son.”
“That is hard to believe, Milt.”
“Nevertheless, in that Lake Chautauqua address last month,
the President re-echoed the extreme pacifist sentiments of Dr.
Harry Emerson Fosdick. Two years ago, in his threnody on
the Unknown Soldier in Arlington, Dr. Fosdick vowed, ‘I
renounce war. I renounce war and never again, directly or
indirectly, will I support another.’
“In that August 14th speech, the President said, ‘I hate
war. I shall pass unnumbered hours, thinking and planning
how war may be kept from this Nation. I can at least make
clear that the conscience of America revolts against war.’”
“What were some of the other significant sentences in that
address, Milt?”
“‘Permanent friendships between Nations as between
men,’” the President declared, “‘can be sustained only by
scrupulous respect for the pledged word.
“‘If we face the choice of profits or peace, the Nation will
answer—must answer—“We choose peace.”
“‘We can keep out of war if those who watch and decide
have a sufficiently detailed understanding of international
affairs to make certain that the small decisions of each day
do not lead toward war and if, at the same time, they possess
the courage to say “no” to those who selfishly or unwisely
would let us go to war.’”
“This is sheer mockery,” Dinah asseverated. “‘I hate war!
We choose peace!”
“It is part and parcel of the fantastic campaign canard
that the Republicans are warmongers—'merchants of death.’
“I hope and pray Mr. Roosevelt will not forget 'scrupulous
respect for the pledged word.’”

Al Jappe was laconic in speech. His voice was gentle. But
his mental processes were well disciplined. As with the
seemingly aimless yet marvelously productive cross-pollination
of flowers by insects, conversation must likewise be fruitful.
“Milt,” Jappe inquired slowly, “would you like to take an
active part in this campaign?”
“I am not quite sure about that, Al.”
“Have you ever thought of going into politics?”
“Yes, back in the summer of 1933. I was desperately look-
ing for something worthwhile. I went to Jim Cleveland of
the DAV, then in the U. S. District Attorney's office here in
Cincinnati. I asked Jim to try to get me into government
service. But Bill Leonard, county chairman of the Democratic
Party, turned me down. He told Jim he was afraid I would
be too independent.
“About two years ago,” Stern went on, “the Rev. Mr.
Bigelow, pastor of the People's Church and a member of
Cincinnati's City Council, urged me to make a career of
politics. He spoke about the new People's Power League which
he hoped would capture control of the Democratic Party
in Ohio. I told Mr. Bigelow I was a registered Republican.
I could not, therefore, run in the primary on the Democratic
ticket, as he suggested.”
“What would you want Milt to do, Al?”
“I have something in mind, Dinah. You will hear from me
very soon.”

CHAPTER XV
O DEMOCRACY, WHERE IS THY VICTORY?
rumors of war in Ethiopia, China, Spain, Austria,
Poland, and France. From his spiritual observatory,
any American Jeremiah might have dictated this lamentation
to an attentive amanuensis: “They have healed the hurt of
the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when
there is no peace.”
Three months before, a somewhat bizarre and unreal sover-
eign, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, stood before the
august assembly of the League of Nations in Geneva. This
was that mournful moment in history when the representa-
tives of the great nations of the earth, among them the
troubled democracies, “made the shameful mistake that
brought their world toppling about their ears.” For “it was
through their cowardly, pussyfooting hypocrisies that they ex-
posed themselves to the merciless destroyers of civilization as
timid compromisers and as cautious Boy Scouts of Expedi-
ency.” To that impatient and contemptuous audience, the
inglorious victim of blatant Italian aggression spoke these
words:
“It is my duty to inform the governments assembled in
Geneva of the deadly peril which threatens them. I assert
that the problem submitted to the Assembly today is much
wider than merely a question of settlement of Italian aggres-
sion. It is the very existence of the League.”
“It is,” the Negus of Ethiopia declared, “the confidence
that each State is to place in international treaties. It is the
value of promises to small States that their integrity and inde-

pendence shall be insured. In a word, it is INTERNA-
TIONAL MORALITY that is at stake. God and history will
remember your judgment.”
On the 26th day of September, 1936, the stalwart Alf M.
Landon of Kansas and the intrepid Colonel Frank Knox of
Illinois vigorously hammered away at the political fortifications
ingeniously erected by the Democratic National Committee's
remarkable staff—Farley, Michelson, and Hopkins. These
fortifications were manned by confident Democratic Party
regulars, heavily reinforced by hundreds of thousands of civil
servants and a host of beneficiaries of the swollen, seemingly
limitless federal relief rolls. This was war of another sort.
In obedience to the election laws of the nation—which, be-
cause of the even more deeply rooted dictates of Tradition,
could not as cavalierly be dispensed with as other provisions
of the Constitution—the bureaucratic interests of the party-
in-power had come to grips with the maligned “entrenched
interests” of the “royal economists”—the American merchants
and manufacturers whom the President, once, in a gracious
mood, had condescended to call that “vast majority of law-
abiding businessmen.”
On September 26, 1936, it was officially reported that
Europe was confronted with “an acute monetary situation
which threatened to develop into disastrous competitive cur-
rency depreciation, and even to result in serious political
consequences.” Notwithstanding, the President continued to
move about leisurely from city to city, like a “cloud of glory.”
Everywhere, his voice, projected over the mystic waves of
radio, vibrated audaciously. His words sorely stung the hearts
of those who sought to dethrone him. But they were like
“corn of heaven” to his fanatical followers.
Then, near midnight, on this 26th day of September, for
Rabbi Stern, the stature of all the great of the earth was
dwarfed, and their struttings and frettings vanished like smoke.
A jubilant voice across the marvelous telephone proclaimed
the yet grandest of all events—the birth of a second child, a

R E D POT TA GE 22:5" 137
daughter. And once again Stern's spirit soared, exalted by
the golden glow of immeasurable happiness.
The spirit's flight heavenward was shortlived. The ecstasy,
excited and evoked by the presence of Alice, the second child,
filled five-year-old Ruth with anguish. She was convinced
that Alice's coming had brought about her expulsion from the
garden of love. So when many mischievous stratagems and
many petty annoyances failed to draw the attention of her
parents and of Aunt Dinah away from Alice and toward her,
Ruth resorted at last to the clinching tactic of cunningly self-
imposed illness. The Stern household was in perpetual tur-
moil, torn with the conflicting emotions of unbounded admira-
tion for Alice and compulsive compassion for Ruth.
Simultaneously, Rabbi Stern was wrestling with the endless
bafflements which are the ordinary perplexities and trials of
every convention chairman: hotel accommodations for the
Single Taxers from every part of the country, speakers for
all the sessions, bills for printing, sale of banquet tickets,
reception of notables, publicity releases, etc. So the first week
of October, 1936, was not an auspicious time for any adult
member of the Stern family to put on the alluring armor of
patriotism and to go forth with ardor and abandon into the
battle-thundering valley of decision. After all, a clergyman,
Stern reflected, ought to be a neutral in politics. Had not
George Washington admonished that partisanship “unfortu-
nately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the
strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different
shapes in all governments . . . but in those of the popular
form it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst
enemy”?
Then, almost concurrently, there came a letter and a long-
distance telephone call. The letter was from New York City's
Roger W. Straus, son of Oscar S. Straus, who was Secretary
of Commerce and Labor in President Theodore Roosevelt’s
cabinet and one of the nation's renowned citizens. Roger
Straus, industrialist and author, was co-chairman of the

National Conference of Christians and Jews. He was the first
president of the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods,
an affiliate of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,
when Stern was the national field representative of the Union.
“I call your attention,” Straus wrote, “to the statement
given to the press by Governor Landon last week in which he
stated:
“‘My attention has recently been directed to the activities
of a number of agencies which, for selfish purposes or political
reasons, are endeavoring to exploit prejudice between groups
of American citizens.
“‘I have no use for any elements who are endeavoring to
bring racial prejudices and religious bigotries into American
life, and state frankly that I disclaim the support of any such
organizations or groups.
“‘If ever the day should come in this country that would
see persecution of any racial group or sect because of race
or religion, contrary to the bill of rights, I would stand among
their defenders.”
“Of course,” Straus continued, “those who know him per-
sonally and know his public and private record, expected a
declaration such as this. I am calling it to your attention
because of the vicious campaign accusation that he is intoler-
ant. I am anxious to nail this lie. . . .”
Stern was incensed. Indignation wrenched him out of his
posture of neutrality. So! The Democratic Party's high com-
mand again was not content ghoulishly to drag out and to
belabor the ghost of the late President Warren G. Harding!
It was not reprehensible enough that they were resorting to
the lowest form of vilification in setting up former President
Herbert Hoover as a depression-breeding monster! Nor was
their lust for political power satiated by the subtlest of Machia-
vellian strokes: the mass transplantation of Negro citizens
from the shacks of the South to the slums of eleven key
Northern states which, combined with other spectacular
patronage manipulations, wrested the more than seventy-year-

old political dominance from the Republican Party. And now
the Democratic Party's high command had stooped to the
foulest of all tactics in order to capture the votes of another
large segment of the population. It had set in motion the
whispering campaign that Alf M. Landon was anti-Semitic!
“James Warburg is right!” moaned Dinah. “Roosevelt is
hell bent for election!”
On Monday, October 5th, Al Jappe telephoned from Cleve-
land. Stern listened with mounting excitement. Presidential
nominee Landon would be the guest of honor at a breakfast
at the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnation Saturday morning. Could
Stern attend as Jappe's guest, meet Mr. Landon, be photo-
graphed with him—all for the purpose of counteracting the
venal accusation of racial and religious discrimination?
The voices of the more than one thousand activated Repub-
lican partymen and women rolled like ocean waves across
the hotel ballroom. But when Rabbi Stern stood before Gov-
ernor Landon, the tall contender for the highest gift in the
power of his countrymen, the voice of the governor was clear,
serene, amiable. The nominee spoke warmly of the rabbis in
Topeka and Kansas City. Synchronously, the cameras of
eighteen photographers clicked. The Cincinnati rabbi fer-
vently felicitated the mighty man of honor who seemed to be
aware that he was only the humble instrument of Providence
and that he was fully resigned to whatever might be his portion
and his destiny according to the will of the American elector-
ate.
The reactions to the nationwide press display of a “Jewish
leader’s” faith in the Republican Party's standard-bearer were
swift, diverse, and poignant. And out of the glamorous pub-
licity—the sweet and the bitter—there emerged the sinister
dictum that “a vote for Landon is a vote for Hitler.” In a
letter from New York came a newspaper clipping purporting
that Fritz Kuhn, “Fuehrer” of the German-American Bund,
had instructed his members that they “would find it to their
interest to support the Kansas governor.” It was too late, Mr.

Straus. The lie could not be nailed! Around the country, the
baleful aberration found expression in the words of an Eastern
citizen:
“From no other point of view but from purely a racial one,
which may appear on the face as un-American because there
should be no racial issue involved, we cannot act as the
proverbial ostrich and bury our heads in the sand.
“The issue is here and we as intelligent men must face it.
There is no other way out of it, but to vote for Roosevelt,
for therein lies our salvation. A vote for Landon is a vote for
Hitler.”
And Republican National Chairman Hamilton's imprudent,
perfervid, and persistent maledictions on the head of the incon-
spicuous onetime Socialist, Labor-leader David Dubinsky of
New York, seemed to underscore the addled axiom that “a
vote for Landon is a vote for Hitler.”
Contrary to Hamilton's charges, David Dubinsky was an
aggressive anti-Communist. Thus the oft-repeated, unwar-
ranted, and promiscuous use of the epithet “Communist”
proved to be a twofold fiasco. It was one of those blunder-
fumbles which Roosevelt swiftly converted into a triumphant
political touchdown. Far more calamitously, it provided the
pretext which drove thousands of mentally blind “intellectuals”
to the defense of actual Kremlin mercenaries proliferating on
American soil.
So, drugged daily by doses of New Deal gobbledygook leg-
islation and propaganda, the “too dumb” millions spiritually
slumbered and slept while the Communist underground spread
like a virulent malignant cancer.
But was there real cause for foreboding? The Literary
Digest polls majestically pointed to a Republican victory. The
Republican Party had spent $1,000,000 for billboard-advertis-
ing, giving assurance that a vote for Landon meant a vote for
a job. The vast majority of metropolitan newspapers supported
the Kansas governor. Opinion-molders, such as James War-
burg, pilloried Roosevelt. John J. Raskob, who had been
hailed as the architect of the revived Democratic Party, joined

in the revolt led by Alfred E. Smith. Then there was a most
staggering assault on the Democratic Party's social security
and job insurance drive. The Republican National Committee
was systematically sending out millions of payroll envelopes
to large manufacturing and mercantile establishments, bearing
a message which implied that the government was taking a
big piece out of every weekly wage, and that it was doubtful
if the employee would ever get any of it back.
Notwithstanding, evening after evening, when Dinah and
her brother sat before the radio and in turn listened to Landon
and to Roosevelt, the tongue would not dare disclose what
the heart recorded. The Democratic Party had one asset
which all the wealth, all the power, and all the oratory of the
opposition could not overcome: the Lorelei-like radio voice
of the man “compassed with infirmity.”
The radio performance of the two Presidential candidates
were very much like the broadcast of a major league baseball
game. The road of the thousands was detonated by every
turn of a phrase and by every twist of the tongue. As Landon
spoke, Dinah and her brother listened as though enthralled.
Throughout the half-hour drama, they prayed that Landon—
like a baseball star—would score with every line he spoke.
When he faltered, when he showed signs of doubt and inde-
cision, or lack of vigor, Stern and his sister were gripped with
dismay. If they could only be as coaches on the sidelines,
shouting words of encouragement, goading him on to out-
bursts of righteous indignation! Dolefully, the gentleman
from the great prairie state would not change his pace. Lan-
don would not resort to vitriolic, venomous, shattering grand-
stand-attacks on his adversaries. The governor from Kansas
could not stoop to the mire of character-assassination. Lan-
don would not sell his soul, pandering slander of patriots who,
like the duPonts, had honorably created great wealth not only
for themselves, but also for all their countrymen.
Roosevelt's voice was high-pitched, cocky, penetrating. His
radio manner was jocund. Roosevelt was both maestro and
virtuoso. Nor did the reading of the script restrain the rol-

licking rhythm of this unrehearsed heroic grand opera wherein
each accent, each grimace, each roguish innuendo and toss
of the magnificent head whipped up the delirium of the masses.
“Turn him off, Milt!” cried Dinah. “Turn him off! I can't
stand listening to him. He is lying, lying, Milt! Please turn
him Off!”
Yet, ironically, no circus, no world-series baseball game,
was as irresistible as the radio broadcast of the Democratic
Party's concluding rally at Madison Square Garden on Satur-
day evening, October 31st. And as the chairman heralded,
“The President of the United States,” Dinah, reluctantly, al-
most savagely, joined Stern and Leah in the living room.
“If Roosevelt doesn't stick to the truth tonight, Milt,” Dinah
Snapped, “I’m going to scream.”
“Try to control yourself, Dinah,” interposed Leah. “This
may be Mr. Roosevelt's last Presidential campaign speech.”
“God grant that Landon defeat him!” Dinah murmured, as
the President began to read.
“In 1932,” Mr. Roosevelt said, beatifically, “the issue was
the restoration of American democracy; and the American
people were in a mood to win. . . . In 1936 the issue is the
preservation of their victory.”
“Just what does he mean, ‘American democracy, American
people’? Dinah mumbled. “Aren't we Republicans Ameri-
cans?”
“More than four years ago,” the President's voice boomed,
“in accepting the Democratic nomination in Chicago, I said:
‘Give me your help not to win votes alone, but to win in this
crusade to restore America to its own people.’”
“Such arrogance!” Dinah rasped.
“Does he mean that Hoover, Landon, Smith, and the mil-
lions who are going to vote against him are aliens—not true
Americans?”
Now the President seemed to take on supernatural power.
Perhaps it was because Franklin D. Roosevelt may have felt

that his fate depended on this last-minute effort. Perhaps the
thousands who were in the immediate range of his voice in
Madison Square Garden, by some positive telepathic trans-
mission of electric energy, endowed him with the aspect of a
godling hero. Aside from its patent oratorical artifices, there
was something unearthly, fabulous, about this speech. Words
flowed from the lips of the radiorator with terrifying grandeur.
“What was our hope in 1932?” the President asked grand-
iloquently. “Above all other things, the American people
wanted peace. They wanted peace of mind instead of gnawing
fear.”
“‘Peace of mind'!” Dinah mimicked. “‘Peace of mind'!
“Gnawing fear’ſ We haven't had peace of mind since that
day in the spring of 1932 when Roosevelt wept over the
‘forgotten man.’”
“I submit to you a record of peace,” the President con-
tinued, “and on that record a well-founded expectation for
future peace—peace for the individual, peace for the com-
munity, peace for the Nation, and peace with the world. . . .
Today there is war and rumor of war. We want none of it.”
Then came the crescendo of emotions and a stupendous
climax. Roosevelt conjured up the forces arrayed against him.
He called these forces “government by organized money . . .
unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.”
It was an audacious assumption of personal, individual mes-
siahship. And when he shouted, “these forces met their
master,” pandemonium engulfed Madison Square Garden.
Stern was dumbfounded by this bold reassertion of “the
will to rule” and by Roosevelt's self-disclosed “strategy of
tyrants to delude their victims into fighting their battles for
them.” -
At that moment, as in a trance, Stern beheld an apparition
at the rostrum in Madison Square Garden. It had the form
and similitude of a huge woman. The voice, now strident and
piercing, soared and soared. Soon it was attenuated and alto-

gether feminine. Simultaneously, the nails, fingers, arms, the
whole grotesque figure expanded and floated over the frenzied
thousands seated in that mammoth enclosure.
“Dinah!” Stern whispered. “Do you remember the picture
we once saw of the witch of Endor bringing up the ghost of
Samuel, in the presence of King Saul? That is exactly what
Roosevelt looked like to me as he finished his speech.”
Forty-eight hours later, on Election Eve, the Republican
National Committee staged its grand finale, its final appeal
to the great American tribunal. For one hour, over all radio
networks, many notable American citizens, including Landon,
Knox, and Hamilton, speaking from radio stations in every
part of the country, sought to win the hearts of all who still
revered the Federal Constitution, who abhorred government
by personal fiat, and who prized freedom of opportunity far
above “new instruments of public power in the hands of a
people's government.”
At the radio station in Cincinnati, Rabbi Stern awaited his
cue. Nearby, at the Jewish Hospital, five-year-old Ruth lay
critically ill. It was a night of thick darkness and gloominess.
Yet Stern was exultant that National Chairman Hamilton had
singled him out for a part on such a historic program. Above
all, he was exhilarated by the conceit that, here at least, in
the hearing of millions, he might render unique service to his
country. Perhaps his prayer might exert a timely, decisive
influence on the vacillating American President-makers. He
was profoundly convinced that if Roosevelt were re-elected,
that moment of victory would usher in an era of untold woe,
not only for America, but for all the nations.
In the anteroom with him and Dinah was Alice Roosevelt
Longworth, daughter of the twenty-sixth President of the
United States and widow of Nicholas Longworth, the eminent
Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives. Unlike
Stern, Mrs. Longworth was unruffled and in good humor. She
did not seem dismayed in the least that James Warburg had
made a complete volte-face, recanted his philippics, and

marched ostentatiously into the Roosevelt camp. Mrs. Long-
worth was apparently unmoved by the enormity of John L.
Lewis' huge contribution to the treasury of the Democratic
National Committee. Nor did she recoil from the intimation
that within twenty-four hours, the Communist-debauched party
of Jefferson, Jackson, and Alfred E. Smith might brazenly
by-pass the Constitution and wantonly wield the new instru-
ments of Fascism.
Quivering, with high hope and with heart overflowing with
great love of country, Stern stood before the wondrous little
instrument, and poured out his words to the Eternal Father
in thanksgiving and earnest petition:
“. . . Who shall dwell in Thy holy place?
“He that walks uprightly and speaks the truth in his heart.
He that has not lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn deceit-
fully. He that slanders not his neighbor. He that reveres the
covenant of our fathers. He that in judgment will not exploit
the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty.
He that swears to his own hurt and changes not. He that will
not despise or reject the counsel of the elders.
“He that will proclaim to all mankind that slavery and not
peace is furthered by the handing over of the whole authority
to One man. . . .
“This is the faith of them that seek Thee. . . .”

CHAPTER XVI
“WOE TO HIM THAT INCREASETH THAT
WHICH IS NOT HIS!”
HE will of the people as registered at the ballot
Ø. in November, 1936, culminated in a landslide
victory for President Roosevelt. His re-elecion was
a great personal triumph. Out of the more than forty-five
million votes cast, Roosevelt received 27,751,612, a plurality
of a little more than eleven million. Landon's total was
16,681,913. The Socialists rolled up only a fraction of their
1932 vote. The Communist vote was negligible. (In the
great State of New York, the total Communist Party vote was
less than the fifty thousand requisite to permit the Communists
to run a ticket in the subsequent election.)
It is well to bear in mind that every election in the previous
twenty years had likewise been a landslide. Proportionately,
the Roosevelt majority was not so great as that of Calvin
Coolidge in 1924: 65.2%, as compared with Roosevelt's
60.02%.
Alas, though historians like James Truslow Adams have
regarded the Roosevelt re-election, superficially, as a “normal
incident in our national life,” more deeply, the return of Roose-
velt to the White House revealed “the urge toward dictatorship
and getting things done quickly regardless of retaining per-
Sonal liberties.”
Alas, and perhaps more calamitously, the reverses sustained
by the American Communist Party at the polls in November,
1936, were also deceptive. For, like Pluto's abduction of
Proserpina, the Communist underground apparatus had, by

the spring of 1937, spread into almost every nook and cranny
of every department and branch of the Federal Government.
The second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt oc-
curred on Wednesday, January 20, 1937. By virtue of the
Twentieth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, ratified on
February 6, 1933, a hallowed day—March Fourth—had been
consigned to the “horse-and-buggy” limbo. This calendaric
concession to the passion for change and acceleration—of
which the President was the all-too-perfect personification—
may or may not prove to be a wise and sound measure of
progress and an improvement on the sagacity and foresight of
the framers of the Constitution. Mental and political adjust-
ments can not be mechanically or chemically expedited. A
change of mode may reflect a transient mood. Projects of
fashion can not be called genuine progress. Liberalism may
too often turn out to be naught but a precarious desecration
of indispensable and timeless tradition.
The tone of voice of the twice-sworn-in Chief Magistrate of
the United States was regal and supremely confident as he
read his second inaugural address. “The greatest change we
have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of
America.” This awakening, this change, the President af-
firmed, “in our moral climate and a rediscovered ability to
improve the economic order has set our feet upon the road
of enduring progress.” And as he spoke, in a chilling down-
pour of rain, the atmospheric reality was not so reassuring
as were his words.
Yet again in the parade that followed from the Capitol to
the White House, the change in the moral climate of America
was not visibly accentuated. For it was the military division
that evoked the applause of the spectators. Cadets from West
Point, midshipmen from Annapolis, with more than one
thousand from each school, marching with fixed bayonets,
made a thrilling picture. Then came Coast Guard cadets, and
detachments of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, along with the
weapons of the coast artillery, field artillery, anti-aircraft and

machine gun units. Included in the demonstration of the
military might of the nation were novel Navy, Marine, and
Coast Guard landing and beach apparatus.
On the afternoon of this same day, on the outskirts of the
city of Toledo, an eighty-one-year-old patriot-clergyman was
laid to rest in Memorial Park Cemetery. Twenty years before,
the Reverend Harry F. MacLane, twenty-one years over the
military age limit, became a chaplain in the Ohio National
Guard (later federalized as the 37th Division). The body of
the pastor of the Norwood Avenue Christian Church was
borne to the grave in the presence of his family and a number
of devoted friends and former army comrades, among them
Father William P. O'Connor and Rabbi Milton Stern, both of
Cincinnati.
Early the next morning the two Cincinnati clergymen
boarded a train for Urbana. There they would resume the
homeward journey in the automobile which they had been
compelled to abandon the previous day because of inclement
weather and hazardous highways. There was little conversa-
tion in the railway coach. While the priest sat absorbed in
his breviary, the rabbi read the Jewish Braille Review. Shortly
before the scheduled arrival at Urbana, Father O'Connor
closed his book, turned to his companion, and said: “Rabbi,
if the weather was as bad in Washington yesterday as it still
is here in Ohio, the inauguration ceremonies and parade must
have been enveloped in a gloomy atmosphere.”
“Are you a Democrat, Father?”
“Not a very active one, Rabbi.”
“Do you approve of the New Deal, Father?”
“I think Mr. Roosevelt and his advisers mean well for the
country. But I don't like a lot of the things the President is
doing.”
“Do you think the President is justified in claiming that the
American people has given him a mandate to do as he thinks
best, even though the Supreme Court invalidated his major
New Deal measures?”

“No, Rabbi, I can't accept that mandate thesis. We must
be mighty careful, Rabbi, lest we go too far toward Bolshevik-
Socialism. The Communist Party is already too powerful in
the world today.”
“It’s very baffling to me, Father. In the November election,
the Communist Party was all but obliterated. We Republicans
turned out more than sixteen million strong for Governor
Landon. Will we have a Voice in the Roosevelt Administra-
tion? I think not. Yet Moscow's American agents, totally
repudiated at the polls, posing as liberals and humanitarians,
are taking over Vital posts in that administration. If these
Communists are not eradicated in time, Father, we, the people
of the United States—Democrats as well as Republicans—will
be governed, not by congreSSmen of Our choosing, but by
Kremlin-picked commissars.”
In the car, the conversation continued. Throughout, there
was no abatement of the rain. Stern perceived that the ac-
customed gaiety of the priest was giving way to grave concern.
The man at the Wheel was perceptibly in a quandary. Should
they again abandon the light motorcar and finish the trip by
rail? The priest's cigar seemed to be slipping from between
his lips.
As they approached the city of Lebanon, Father O'Connor
turned off the motor. For a moment he rested his head on the
steering wheel. “Rabbi, we're in a real jam now. My wheels
seem to be locked. The water is above the hub.”
“Can we get out and walk, Father?”
“No,” the priest Smiled broadly, “we'll just sit here and
wait for the highway patrol to pull us out. I’m sure I can
manage after we reach Lebanon.”
The highway patrol came as if in answer to a whispered
prayer. Then slowly, very cautiously, unaided, Father O’Con-
nor steered along the thirty-mile road from Lebanon to Cin-
cinnati. The waters were rising everywhere. The rain came
down in unceasing, almost terrifying, rhythm. And when
the priest and the rabbi alighted from the car, Leah and
Dinah rushed toward them with outstretched arms.

“Thank God, thank God!” Dinah gasped. “We thought you
wouldn't make it. The Ohio River in Cincinnati has already
reached the sixty-foot flood stage and is still rising!”
Cincinnati has high water about every other year, a minor
flood every five years, a major flood every ten years. As in
Pittsburgh, Louisville, and other Ohio River Valley cities
stretching from the confluence of the Allegheny and Mononga-
hela Rivers a thousand miles westward to the Mississippi, a
large section of Cincinnati's business, industrial, and resi-
dential area lies in the great river's natural flood plains. Con-
sequently, the periodic inundation of buildings and streets is
accepted as a natural shock in the affairs of these river-
wedded communities. But the yellow angry waters rushing
along the thirty-mile shore of Cincinnati went far and bevond
their natural bed and basin in the latter part of January, 1937.
This was a Superflood.
Neither history nor legend has recorded comparable devasta-
tion in the Ohio Vallev. For three long weeks Cincinnati
was flood-stricken and flood-bound. On Wednesdav. Fehru-
arv 10th, the waters Soared to the astounding heioht of 79.99
feet—more than twentv feet above flood stage! Thev struck
not onlv across the banks of the Ohio. The waters cascaded
into tributarv streams and creeks. It was like an irresistible
invadino host encircling and smashing through the rear and
flanks of an opposing army.
Phvsiologists tell us that the ineffable, examicite “niece of
work” we call man is ninetv per cent water. Tm like manner,
the colossal conglomerate of streets, underground conduits,
overhead transmission cables. Shops, factories, schools, and
homes we call a citv is water-rooted. When the towering,
turbulent. rampaging flood waters clambered above the ram-
parts of Cincinnati’s waterworks and the great pumps were
paralvzed, a proud, mightv, wealth-producing city was
brought to the verge of the primitive.
Water carts, supplied by artesian wells of the contiguous
city of Norwood, appeared on the streets of Cincinnati. Bath-
tubs, kettles, pots, and other containers were filled with water

drawn from trickling faucets. Now and then snow was carried
in and left to melt in laundry tubs. The drug stores were soon
depleted of their stock of distilled water and other shops of
their candles, flashlights, lanterns, and boots. Concurrently,
all household electrical appliances were rendered impotent.
Only those residents who were not dependent upon electrical
controls for their heating units were able to protect themselves
against the bitter cold and penetrating dampness of that winter.
But the major deprivation was water: water for the kitchen
and for the bathroom, water for the ever-present hazard of
fire, clean drinking water to guard against typhoid and other
plagues.
Water was that decisive factor which brought on the vol-
untary, continuous, unregulated exodus of many people from
Cincinnati to cities as near as Hamilton and as far away as
Chicago, Des Moines, and New York. The fugitives from the
flood traveled chiefly by motorcar. The magnificent Union
Terminal (completed in 1933) was water-locked.
Although the nearly one-half million inhabitants of Cin-
cinnati were confronted with fire and flood and threatened
with plague, and although the hearts of their fellow-
countrymen were as one in apprehension and compassion,
Cincinnati was relatively free from fear. Instead of panic,
there was an almost frantic impulse to participate in a great
adventure. Instead of hysterical groping for guidance, there
was a marvelous sense of unity and coordination. Conspicuous
among the organizations which joined their forces with the
community social agencies, the American Red Cross, the Sal-
vation Army, and the Public Works Administration personnel,
were the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans,
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
As an example of discipline and inspiring leadership, there
was Father William P. O'Connor, wearing now not the garb
of his religious order, but the sober uniform of a lieutenant
colonel in the 37th Division, Ohio National Guard. But fore-
most among the civilian and military officers was Clarence A.

Dykstra, Cincinnati's superbly endowed City Manager, ap-
pointed Disaster Administrator and clothed with dictatorial
powers.
“Washington sent special agents to Cincinnati,” wrote Col-
lier's Walter Davenport, “to find out, among other things, why
no hysterical telegrams and terror-hoarsened telephone calls
had come out of the dispiriting gloom of her city hall.”
Dykstra had neither the time nor the temperament for
heart-melting tours of the flooded area. He forded no streets
hip-deep, carrying children and grandmothers to safety.
Dykstra stood in no bread lines to demonstrate a great, all-
enveloping humanity.
On “Black Sunday,” January 24th, an immense pall of a
deathlike quietus fell over most of the city. Only houses of
worship were exempt from the general order closing theatres
and other public gathering places. Along with similar institu-
tions, the Hebrew Union College was taken over by the
American Red Cross and converted into an emergency refugee
center. College students were mobilized for relief duty. Stu-
dents of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,
among them Sidney Stern, manned temporary stations to ad-
minister first-aid and to carry on a seemingly never-ending
program of immunization against the threat of a typhoid
epidemic. To the very last, Ruth Lyons, of radio station
WKRC, remained at the microphone and poured forth lively
songs and sentiments of high courage.
As the voice of the intrepid radio artist faded out of the
dining room and the room temperature continued to fall, Leah
Stern rushed to the side of sleeping four-month-old Alice.
How would she protect the babe against the cold and damp-
ness? And what about clean, disease-free water? It was
early evening. Outside there was rain, rain and thick darkness.
Were they altogether cut off from the rest of the world?
Then, incredibly, the telephone bell rang. For a second or
two, Leah was too startled to respond to the familiar sum-
mons. “It’s the telephone!” Dinah shouted. “I’ll answer it.”

Another instant of silence. “It’s long distance, Leah, for
you. Your cousin, Ruth Hoffman, is calling from Chicago.”
While Leah spoke, Stern and his sister listened.
“My cousin insists that we take the next train to Chicago.
She will meet us at the South Side station and take us all to
her home for the duration of the flood. Shall we go? Can
we get a train out of Cincinnati’”
“Not from the Union Terminal downtown,” Dinah an-
swered, “but we can leave from Norwood.”
“Tell your cousin we are very grateful,” Stern said. “Leah,
you, Alice, and our little Ruth will take the morning train
from Norwood. We will wire later giving the exact time of
arrival in Chicago.”
The crowd inside the little Norwood railroad depot re-
sembled a holiday shopping throng milling about in a large
department store. On the train, there was a scramble for
seats. Filipino porters dashed about the coaches uniting pas-
sengers with their baggage. Dinah and Sidney pleaded with
one of the porters to accord special attention to Leah and
her two children.
Four days later, Stern boarded the Pennsylvania train at
the Norwood station and traveled, unaccompanied, to Chicago.
There was little for him to do in Cincinnati. Dinah took up
residence with her mother and Sidney. Their home, near the
Rockdale Temple on Harvey Avenue, was heated by a coal-
burning furnace and, except for a limited water supply, was
scarcely affected by the flood.
The rhythm of a rapidly rolling railway train encourages
reverie and contemplation. On such a journey, Stern pre-
ferred to sit alone. He shunned strangers. From time to time,
Stern put down the braille magazine he was finger-reading.
He let his imagination carry him along its multifarious meand-
erings. Was it not cowardly, was it not reprehensible, to run
away from flood-ravaged Cincinnatiº But there was nothing
he could do to relieve the wretchedness of the community.

And now his mind reverted to the mocking irony of the
Severe drought of the summer of 1936 and, six months later,
this deluge, this superabundant rain. To be sure, these were
all part of the “thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.”
The flood was a repetition of the centuries-old trend on the
part of the sea to have dominion over the earth. Yet in that
universal, infinitely balanced pattern of conflict between water
and dry land, the spirit of aggrandizement or encroachment
was counterbalanced by the creative thrust of the earth.
Stern marveled at the parallelism between the natural ele-
mental forces and that sphere of human relations called
politics. In his classic farewell address to the people of the
United States, George Washington prophesied: “The spirit
of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the
departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form
of government, a real despotism.”
The spirit of aggrandizement or encroachment as exhibited
by the Ohio Valley flood of waters was operating also in
Rome, Berlin, Moscow, and Washington, in a deluge of the
elemental passions of man. Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin—
each was triumphant in his sphere of influence. At the sound
of their imperial voices, kings and princes, captains of in-
dustry and of finance, scholars, generals, and admirals bowed
their heads, quavered, and fulfilled their edicts. Fascism at
last was supreme, enthroned in majesty. Success was the seal
of the truth of Socialism. But rain-asphyxiated Cincinnati
was a graphic portent. The reign of a despot would bring on
economic paralysis and social demoralization.
Would the people of the United States eventually also sink
to these primitive levels? Lashed by the whirlwinds of New
Deal crisis-propaganda, would Americans, too, like their
European counterparts, cry aloud for a dictator and for
quick, revolutionary change?
Where was the “dumb ass speaking with man's voice” to
restrain the American Balaam of Fascism? Could the Supreme

Court in Washington hold back the flood of New Deal social
experiments? How long would the impatient, audacious, im-
perious, petulant spirit of the President tolerate the salutary
checks and balances exercised by the independent judicial
branch of the Federal Government?
The relief rolls were expanding. Unemployment was ris-
ing. The condition of the American farmer and of the small
businessman remained precariously close to the depression
abyss. The despot's only ultimate solution was war—“After
us, the deluge.”
These serious reflections were now interspersed with recol-
lections of personalities and places associated with the city of
Chicago. The train rumbled and roared across the elevated
tracks stretched over the sprawling concatenation of village
upon village. Stern's mind was still focused on the President.
Quite naturally, therefore, he recalled that afternoon at the
Covenant Club in downtown Chicago. Vividly he saw him-
self once again standing before the massive bust of Franklin
D. Roosevelt. His companion, a Hebrew Union College class-
mate, Rabbi Mayer Lipman, had placed his hand on the cold,
inanimate form, and then stepped aside.
It was a thrilling experience. With the slight touch of his
fingers, Stern literally saw the face and the character of one
who had for four years so monopolized his thoughts and so
furiously excited both his admiration and his deep anxiety.
The forehead was imposing, foursquare. The eyes were large,
the eyebrows thick and long. The ears were large, very large.
The nose was regal, and the nostrils were broad. The cheek
bones were prominent. The mouth of the greatest radio orator
of the generation was expansive. The lips were well formed.
But part of the lower lip extended in a sort of supercilious,
scornful, downward sweep. The jaw protruded challengingly.
It jutted out above powerful neck and shoulders draped with
a casual open-at-neck shirt. This was, in truth, the image of
a heroic man, into whose nostrils had undeniably been
breathed the will to rule.

One week later, on the morning of Friday, February 5th,
Stern sat before a rented typewriter in the dining room of the
Hoffman bungalow. The Cincinnati rabbi was preparing a
sermon which he would deliver that evening to the congrega-
tion of the Chicago Southside Hebrew Temple. The theme
of the sermon was “Salvation Through Suffering.”
Leah and her cousin were astir in the kitchen. Alice was
asleep in the nearby bedroom. Five-year-old Ruth romped
merrily in and out of the dining room. Stern paused and
listened to her carefree laughter. Then he returned to the
sermon and to the typewriter. As his mind swept along the
plains, the peaks, the valleys, and the subterranean intellectual
and mystical passages in the history and literature of the
people of Israel over a span of more than thirty-five centuries,
Stern seemed to be transported into another and perhaps
higher sphere of existence. Thousands of multicolored yester-
days rolled in upon him. The now of this Friday, February
5th, was like the foam of the everlasting billows and waves
of the ocean of perpetual change. Once again the mood of
the preacher and the spirit of prophecy persuaded him that he
was, at this hour, in tune with the infinite. Politics and poli-
ticians were foreign, mundane allurements. The sciences of
economics and sociology were alien to his soul at this moment.
“Almost everywhere,” Stern wrote, “people are asking the
question: how can Israel be preserved despite the furious
hatred of its adversaries? Jewish statesmen are as baffled as
are the Gentiles by the miracle of Israel's survival. Plans
for the extermination of Israel have been drawn up and
partially carried out in almost every generation since Israel's
sojourn in the land of Egypt. . . .
“Our task this evening is not to formulate a new plan for
the salvation of Israel. Rather it is to find out what has been
and what still must be the divine plan, the divine design, the
eternal destiny for Israel. . . .
“Israel must be preserved lest the world be deprived of
Israel's special genius for religious illumination and of Israel's

peculiar capacity to teach religion. The most widely read
book in the world today is Israel's Bible. The most powerful
personality in the story of man is the Galilean, Jesus of
Nazareth. One of the most beneficial social institutions is the
Mosaic Sabbath. Israel has triumphed over every change and
chance and circumstance, united most wondrously by religious
bonds. . . .
“Israel has been preserved throughout the centuries so that
Israel may function as a teacher of religion. When Israel fails
in this divinely assigned task, Israel will be no more. . . .
“Israel has been saved, not so much from the wrath and
hatred of men, as from the absorptive powers of an alien
civilization. . . . Whenever any civilization or culture threatens
to assimilate Israel, the divine command rings out, “Get thee
Out!’
“Exodus, suffering and “be thou a blessing are of the divine
plan of salvation. That which is taking place in Germany
today is but another demonstration of the same pattern, the
same plan, design, and destiny for Israel. . . .
“The plan for Israel's salvation is not the scheme of any
modern Jewish society. It is something which transcends the
imagination and the inventive power of man. It is the revela-
tion of the will of God: “For I am with thee, saith the Lord,
to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither
I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee:
but I will correct thee in measure. . . .’”
Stern rolled the final sheet out of the machine. Ruth was
standing in one corner of the room, toying with the radio.
“Are you finished, Daddy?” she asked. “May I turn on the
radio now?”
“Isn’t it almost time for lunch?”
“But let me turn it on just for a moment, please!”
It was after eleven o'clock. Slowly, noisily, out of the
crackling of the static came forth a voice, strange and arrest-
1ng.
“Do you want to listen to this, Daddy?”

“Hold it there for a moment, Ruth. It sounds like some-
thing important.”
As the words, sentences, and paragraphs flowed from the
mouth of the reading clerk in the House of Representatives in
Washington, Stern listened as one hypnotized. Franklin
Delano Roosevelt had broken the traces again. This time
the object of his animus and insensate grasp for power was
naught else but the Supreme Court of the United States. The
House clerk read first the President's message and the ac-
companying letter from Attorney General Homer E. Cum-
mings, and then the bill for the reorganization of the Judiciary.
This bill provided for the addition of fifty Federal judges in
the lower courts, for the speeding up of decisions, and for
various other minor matters. But the chief point in the bill
was the section which permitted an increase in the member-
ship of the Supreme Court, traditionally fixed at nine, to a
maximum of fifteen, if justices reaching the age of seventy
did not care to resign. The President would be empowered
to appoint one new justice for each justice over the age of
seventy.
Stern remembered that six members of the Supreme Court
were over seventy years of age. Included among the six emi-
nent jurists was Associate Justice Louis D. Brandeis, the oldest
and perhaps the most liberal of them all. Stern concluded that
the motive behind this despotic maneuver hinged on the sober
fact that the Supreme Court of the United States, interpreting
and applying constitutional safeguards, had already invali-
dated nine out of eleven major New Deal reforms.
The following Saturday morning Stern and his sister wor-
shipped at the Rockdale Avenue Temple in Cincinnati. There
was an air of thanksgiving. The waters of the great flood had
receded from the streets. The public utilities were restored to
normal service. Yet there was something dolorous in Rabbi
David Philipson's voice as he read and as he preached. Also
lacking was the customary high praise of the President of the
United States. The answer was clear. Roosevelt’s bill to

reorganize the federal judiciary had grievously offended the
venerable rabbi. The President's sophomoric reference to the
tired old men was like a random arrow that struck deep into
the heart of the proud Jewish scholar.
The septuagenarian's mood was symptomatic. The Ameri-
can people were similarly stunned. They had yielded to Roose-
velt's summary junking of the gold standard, and to his
collectivization of industry and agriculture through the NIRA
and the AAA. They had winked at his flippant sidestepping
of constitutional checks. They had forgiven so many of his
adolescent pranks in and out of the White House. They had
condoned his Oriental-like subordination of Congress and his
emasculation of the dignity and intellectual independence of
the members of his Cabinet.
In November, 1936, the people of the United States had
not so much voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt as they had
manifested their still unshakable fear of another depression.
The vagaries of his vacillating foreign policy confused them.
His audacious assumption of leadership of a new and quasi-
political party made up chiefly of the constituents of labor
unions likewise had left them gasping in bewilderment. As an
example of its submission to the “must” of the President,
Congress had voted in favor of social security, though only
one out of every five congressmen either was familiar with
the contents or comprehended the consequences of such
sweeping legislation.
But the master politician did not know—nor would he
understand—that the Supreme Court of the United States
was not to be defiled. The Supreme Court was the sacred
stronghold of traditional American conservatism. Against this
citadel, the wild, filth-laden flood waters of cynicism, socialism,
and economic voodooism were never to come even to the
outskirts. Not even the hand of this most glamorized, idolized
President could tamper with the majesty of the Supreme Court.
Unmistakably, the mood and the will of the American
people were against Roosevelt's wholly unexpected blast of

impatience with the “due processes” of American constitu-
tional government. Yet, like Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
President Roosevelt scoffed at the aura of sanctity about the
Supreme Court. He taunted Congress, mocked the press, vili-
fied those who rebuked him. Roosevelt scorned the protests
of the millions of his fellow-countrymen. He would not budge.
He would not recant. He would not turn aside from his
incorrigible determination to make the Supreme Court the
malleable instrument of his volatile hunches.
The lofty intellect of George Washington had formulated
this doctrine: “If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution
or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particu-
lar wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way
which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change
by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the
instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free
governments are destroyed.”
But after the manner of Rehoboam, President Roosevelt
forsook the “horse-and-buggy” counsel of the first President
of the United States. He brusquely turned aside the entreaties
of his Democratic elder statesmen. Roosevelt followed the
counsel of his Marxist-molded young men.
These were some of the thoughts which Stern and his
sister expounded as they walked from the Temple to their
mother's home nearby. In the dining room they poured out
their misgivings and forebodings to their mother and brother.
“Ah, children!” said Mother Stern, “Mr. Roosevelt is very
powerful. The working people all over the country almost
worship him.”
“Don’t take it too hard, Dinah,” said Sidney, consolingly.
“You may be sure the President won't get away with his
court-packing plan.”
“The only encouraging word from the White House,” con-
cluded Dinah, “is that the President has a toothache.”
In the cosmic sweep of the imagination, the vision of a
proud potentate brought low by a toothache comported with

Aristotle's concept of the comic. But to the understanding
heart of every true patriot, the laconic message from the White
House represented only the pouting of a prima donna, the
whimpering of a chastised matinee idol, the exasperation of a
rajah. Woefully, it was not an intimation of “a broken and
a contrite heart.”

CHAPTER XVII
RETROSPECT-"Ask Now of the Days That Are Past”
HE SUPREME Court “packing” measure proposed
Ø in February, 1937, may be set down as the Great
Divide in the kaleidoscopic career of Franklin D.
ROOSevelt.
The President's move toward the complete concentration
of power in the executive branch of the government at last ex-
posed Roosevelt's irrepressible will to rule and his adolescent
impatience with the constitutional processes of political action.
Now the eyes of the people were opened, blinded no longer
by idolatry. The indignation of the nation was strongly re-
flected in the stern protests of the representatives in both
houses of Congress. The time certainly had come for a mature
appraisal of the words and the actions of the chief magistrate.
The alarm sounded by former Governor Alfred E. Smith, in
the spring of 1932, and dramatically accentuated by Governor
Smith's political apostasy four years later, would now be
heeded speedily. Could the trend toward Communism be
halted? Or was it now too late? For if the volcanic ashes
of Marxism mixed with the rain of government regimentation
had formed a political plaster, then it had already hardened
into the mortal mold of bureaucratic absolutism.
It was time also for Rabbi Stern to re-examine his theo-
logical principles, his political doctrines, and his economic
ideology. Was his abhorrence of the New Deal fully vindi-
cated by the turn of events? Could he square his fierce rejec-
tion of the President’s “liberalism” and leadership with the
changeless verities discovered and enunciated by the wise of
all ages?

What, Stern asked himself, were the inviolable laws which
could be distilled from the sacred and secular writings of the
prophets, the philosophers, and the statesmen of the past?
Was the “mighty man of wealth”—the capitalist—a social
cormorant? Was ever Communism, or any such form of
Socialism, found good for man? Was benevolent despotism
conducive to the ethical progress of man?
It was indeed high time to follow the admonition of the
great lawgiver Moses and to “ask now of the days that are
past.”
So Rabbi Stern went through his books and files and set in
order the answers given by Moses and subsequent answerers
on two paramount questions: the relationship between private
wealth and public welfare, and the checks and balances be-
tween individual freedom and social control.
Rabbi Stern's compilation began with Moses and concluded
with Samuel Gompers, the American labor leader. It em-
braced a period of nearly four thousand years of recorded
thought. Like an ancient scribe, Stern copied out, one by one,
pertinent passages, just as a lawyer would set down the opin-
ions of the masters of law, the opinions of yesterday which
have become the laws for today.
And as a lawyer stands before the Supreme Court in
Washington and presents his brief in the form of arguments
hammered out by the mental processes of jurists before him,
so Rabbi Stern addressed this brief appeal to the supreme
tribunal, the American people. The conclusion of the whole
matter was: Which is the best way to promote ethical har-
mony between the natural, divine rights of every human being
and the artificial, instituted authority of every man-made
social organism?
And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

(Genesis 26:13-14)
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;
and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared
God and eschewed evil.
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my
servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a per-
fect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth
evil?
Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear
God for nought?
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his
house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast
blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased
in the land.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath,
and he will curse thee to thy face.
And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is
in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.

him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be
her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?

For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers

None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they

from him in restricted liberty—the advantage of every man
would lie in social and loyal conduct, and only clear sight
would be needed to ensure peace and order and good will.
But if the government itself is a chaos and an absurdity, if it
rules without helping, and commands without leading, how
can we persuade the individual, in such a state, to obey the
laws and confine his self-seeking within the circle of the total
good?
No wonder an Alcibiades turns against a state that dis-
trusts ability, and reverences number more than knowledge.
No wonder there is chaos where there is no thought, and
the crowd decides in haste and ignorance, to repent at leisure
and in desolation.
Is it not a base superstition that mere numbers will give
wisdom?
On the contrary, is it not universally seen that men in
crowds are more foolish and more violent and more cruel
than men separate and alone?
Is it not shameful that men should be ruled by orators,
who “go ringing on in long harangues, like brazen pots which,
when struck, continue to sound till a hand is put upon them.”
(Socrates [B.C. circa 400], Plato's Protagoras,

There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh

They are all gone out of the way, they are together be-

have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to

The last end of the state is not to dominate men, nor to
restrain them by fear; rather it is so to free each man from
fear that he may live and act with full security and without
injury to himself or his neighbor.
The end of the state, I repeat, is not to make rational beings
into brute beasts and machines.
It is to enable their bodies and their minds to function
safely. It is to lead men to live by, and to exercise, a free
reason; that they may not waste their strength in hatred,
anger and guile, nor act unfairly toward one another.
Thus the end of the state is really liberty.
(Baruch Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-
Politicus, Chapter 20)

For this communitie (so farr as it was) was found to breed

How would a blind multitude, which often knows not what
it wishes because it rarely knows what is good for it, execute
of itself an enterprise so great, so difficult, as a system of
legislation? Of themselves, the people always desire what is
good, but do not always discern it. The general will is always
right, but the judgment which guides it is not always en-
lightened. It must be made to see objects as they are, some-
times as they ought to appear; it must be shown the good
path that it is seeking, and guarded from the seduction of
private interests; it must be made to observe closely times
and places, and to balance the attraction of immediate and
palpable advantages against the danger of remote and con-
cealed evils.
Individuals see the good which they reject; the public
desire the good which they do not see. All alike have need
of guides. The former must be compelled to conform their
wills to their reason; the people must be taught to know what
they require. Then from the public enlightenment results the
union of the understanding and the will in the social body;
and from that the close co-operation of the parts, and, lastly,
the maximum power of the whole.
Hence arises the need of a legislator.
“In the birth of societies,” says Montesquieu, “it is the
chiefs of the republics who frame the institutions, and after-
ward it is the institutions which mold the chiefs of the
republics.”
. if every citizen is nothing, and can be nothing, except
in combination with all the rest, and if the force acquired
by the whole be equal or superior to the sum of the natural
forces of all the individuals, we may say that legislation is
at the highest point of perfection which it can attain.
The legislator is in all respects an extraordinary man in
the State. . . . It is not magistracy nor sovereignty. This
office, which constitutes the republic, does not enter into its
constitution; it is a special and superior office, having noth-
ing in common with human government; for if he who rules

men ought not to control legislation, he who controls legis-
lation ought not to rule men; otherwise his laws, being min-
isters of his passions, would often serve only to perpetrate
his acts of injustice; he would never be able to prevent pri-
vate interests from corrupting the sacredness of his work.
When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by
abdicating his royalty. It was the practice of the majority of
the Greek towns to intrust to foreigners the framing of their
laws. The modern republics of Italy often imitated this usage;
that of Geneva did the same and found it advantageous.
Rome, at her most glorious epoch, saw all the crimes of
tyranny spring up in her bosom, and saw herself on the
verge of destruction, though uniting in the same hands legis-
lative authority and sovereign power.
The great soul of the legislator is the real miracle which
must give proof of his mission. Any man can engrave tables
of stone, or bribe an oracle, . . . He who is acquainted
with such means only will perchance be able to assemble a
crowd of foolish persons; but he will never found an empire,
and his extravagant work will speedily perish with him.
Empty deceptions form but a transient bond; it is only wis-
dom that makes it lasting.
The Jewish law, which still endures, and that of the child
of Ishmael, which for ten centuries has ruled half the world,
still bear witness to-day to the great men who dictated them;
and while proud philosophy or blind party spirit sees in them
nothing but fortunate impostors, the true statesman admires
in their systems the great and powerful genius which directs
durable institutions.
It is not necessary from all this to infer with Warburton
that politics and religion have among us a common aim, but
only that, in the origin of nations, one serves as an instrument
of the other.

that are good in themselves, but considers first whether the
people for whom he designs them are fit to endure them.
(Jean Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract,
Chapters 6, 7, and 8)
Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn
you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects
of the spirit of party, generally.
This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature,
having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind.
It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or
less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popu-
lar form it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their
worst enemy.
The alternate domination of one faction over another,
sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissen-
sion, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the
most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.
But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent
despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradu-
ally incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in
the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the
chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more for-
tunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the pur-
poses of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.
(George Washington, Farewell Address,
September 17, 1796)
It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument
should be made in favor of popular institutions, but there is
one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most
others, to which I ask a brief attention.
It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with,
if not above, labor, in the structure of government.
It is assumed that labor is available only in connection
with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, own-
ing capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor.


## p. 172 (#198) ############################################

172 *ēs R E D POT TA GE
This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that
capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by
their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it without
their consent.
Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all
laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves.
And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired
laborer is fixed in that condition for life.
Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor
as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being
fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these
assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are
groundless.
Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is
only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor
had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and
deserves much the higher consideration.
Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as
any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably
always will be, a relation between labor and capital, produc-
ing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole
labor of the community exists within that relation.
A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor them-
selves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor
for them. A large majority belong to neither class—neither
work for others nor have others working for them. In most of
the Southern States, a majority of the whole people, of all
colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the Northern,
a majority are neither hirers nor hired.
Men with their families—wives, sons, and daughters—
work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in
their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and ask-
ing no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired labor-
ers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a consid-
erable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital
—that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy or

hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and
not a distinct class.
No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this
mixed class.
Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity,
any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that
condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in
these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired
laborers.
The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for
wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land
for himself, then labors on his own account another while,
and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This
is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens
the way to all—gives hope to all, and consequent energy and
progress and improvement of condition to all.
No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up from poverty—none less inclined to take or touch
aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them be-
ware of surrendering a political power which they already
possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to
close the door of advancement against such as they, and to
fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty
shall be lost.

December, 1861)
The view of life of my literary comrades lay in the opinion
that in general life developed itself; that in this development

priated this theory. I was paid for it, I had excellent food,

We were all then convinced that we must talk, talk, write
and print as quickly as possible and as much as possible;
because it was necessary for the good of humanity.
(Leo Tolstoy, Confessions, 1884)
Believing that the rights of true property are sacred, we
would regard forcible Communism as robbery that would
bring destruction.
But we would not be disposed to deny that voluntary
Communism might be the highest possible state of which
man can conceive.
Nor do we say that it cannot be possible for mankind to
attain it, since among the early Christians and among the
religious orders of the Catholic Church we have examples
of communistic societies on a small scale.
St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Thomas of Aquin and Fra
Angelico, the illustrious orders of the Carmelites and Fran-
ciscans, the Jesuits, whose heroism carried the Cross among
the most savage tribes of American forests, the societies that,
wherever your communion is known, have deemed no work
of mercy too dangerous or too repellent—were or are
Communists.
Knowing these things, we cannot take it on ourselves to
say that a social condition may not be possible in which an
all-embracing love shall have taken the place of all other
motives.
But we see that Communism is only possible where there
exists a general and intense religious faith, and we see that
such a state can be reached only through a state of justice.

With both Anarchists and Socialists we, who, for want of
a better term, have come to call ourselves single-tax men,
fundamentally differ. We regard them as erring in opposite
directions, the one in ignoring the social nature of man, the
other in ignoring his individual nature. While we see that
man is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil
has come or can come from the interference by the State
with things that belong to individual action, we also see that
he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him, a political
animal, and that the State is requisite to social advance,
having an indispensable place in the natural order.

But it seems to us the vice of Socialism in all its degrees
is its want of radicalism, of going to the root.
It takes its theories from those who have sought to justify
the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates generally
teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery
was the first condition of labour.
It assumes that the tendency of wages to a minimum is
the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that
the natural result of competition is to grind down workers,
and seeks to abolish competition by restrictions, prohibitions,
and extensions of governing power.
Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming
the stone for hitting it, it wastes strength in striving for reme-
dies that when not worse are futile.

power over the people can be used for the benefit of the peo-
ple; that there may be devised machinery that through human
agencies will secure for the management of individual affairs
more wisdom and more virtue than the people themselves
possess.
(Henry George, An Open Letter to
Pope Leo XIII, 1891)
To delegate control over their labor power to an outside
agency takes away from the economic power of those wage
earners and creates another agency for power. Whoever has
control of this new agency acquires some degree of control
over the worker.
There is nothing to guarantee control over that agency to
employees. It may also be controlled by employers. In other
words, giving the government control over industrial rela-
tions creates a fulcrum which means great power for an un-

I bid you have a care in all these attempts to regulate the
personal relations and the normal personal activities of the
citizenship of our country ere it be too late.
There is in the minds of many an absence of understand-
ing of the fundamental essentials of Freedom.
They talk freedom and yet would have bound upon their
wrists the gyves that would tie them to everlasting bondage.
And no matter how sympathetic or humanitarian is the gloss
over the plan and the scheme, I again bid you beware.
I know not when or how this great struggle going on in
Europe will terminate, or what it shall mean for the future
of those countries; but at least let the people of the United
States hold their liberties in their own hands, for it may come
to pass that our America, the America whose institutions and
ideals we so much revere, may be the one nation to hold the
beacon light of freedom aloft and thus aid in relighting the
torch, rekindling the heart flame of the world's liberty.

CHAPTER XVIII
“THE EVERLASTING TRIBUTE”
Washington, D. C.
June 18, 1937
My dear Rabbi Stern:
This will undoubtedly come as a surprise, but I am rush-
ing it to you in the hope that you can get a quick decision as
there is relatively little time remaining for action.
I was informally approached by a representative of the
American Battle Monuments Commission this morning, who
told me that the American Legion had named a Catholic
Priest, and the VFW a Protestant Minister, to participate in
the dedication of the monuments overseas, which ceremonies
start August 1 and continue to August 14. This friend on
the Commission wanted me to suggest the name of a Rabbi,
so I immediately suggested you and as briefly as possible out-
lined your career, after which he said he believed you would
be the ideal man.
. most of those going will sail around July 20 or 21.
The dedications are to be quite elaborate.
Confidentially, the President is going to name a committee
to represent him personally, which would be composed of
the War Secretary of War, Mr. Baker; the War Secretary of
the Navy, Mr. Daniels; a representative of each of the service
organizations and the American War Mothers; and the rank-
ing naval officer in the War, Admiral Wilson, Admiral Sims
having passed on—and there will also be included three
representatives of the Senate and three from the House.
This personal committee of the President will be entirely
separate from the permanent Battle Monuments Commission

which is headed by General Pershing and which will sail
overseas about a week ahead of the other group.
Still another group will be the three chaplains.
. . . I think within a short time you are going to receive
an invitation to be one of the three participating clergymen,
representing the three broad creeds.
I promised unofficially to approach you informally on the
matter, so if you will reply at once I will then be in position
within a few days unofficially to advise the friend on the Com-
mission that you are available, and the Commission can then
issue the invitation.
I will be deeply grateful to you if you will reply to this
letter at once, but urge that with the exception of your im-
mediate family you keep it entirely confidential, for the rea-
son that these trips are considered so extremely desirable that
if the plans of the committee got out, someone else would be
moving in, merely complicating matters.
Cordially yours,
[s] THOMAS KIRBY
National Legislative Chairman
Disabled American Veterans
On this day, June 18, 1937, the Committee on Appropria-
tions of the 75th Congress approved House Joint Resolution
415 entitled “Joint resolution making an appropriation to
defray expenses incident to the dedication of chapels and
other World War memorials erected in Europe, and for other
purposes.”
The sum to be expended for this purpose was set at
$175,000. The official delegation would consist of twenty-
four persons. For memorials in Europe, the United States
government had already outlaid $4,360,000.
The joint resolution, in the opinion of the Committee on
Appropriations, provided ample funds and ample discretion
in the Battle Monuments Commission to make the dedica-
tory ceremonies truly expressive of the everlasting tribute


## p. 183 (#213) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 183
which the nation owed to the memory of those who served
in the World War. The chapels and memorials commemo-
rated the service of over 2,000,000 American soldiers, sailors,
and marines in the late war. More than 30,000 then lay
buried in the American cemeteries in Europe.
One month later, Stern and his wife entrained for New
York City. The thoughts racing through his mind as he sat
in the Pullman car were almost as titanic and as triumphant
as the movement of the train over the tracks eastward along-
side the Ohio River, across the mountains in West Virginia
and Virginia, and then northward from Washington to Balti-
more and at last to the great metropolis. Once again Stern
was proudly conscious of being in the service of his country.
Nineteen years before, as Sergeant-Major Milton Stern of
the 37th Division, in the month of June, he had embarked
under military secrecy at Newport News, Virginia. The
transport had slipped out stealthily in the early morning to
join her convoy somewhere on the Atlantic Ocean. That
voyage to France was fraught with the perpetual menace of a
submarine attack.
Now he would have been pleased to tell everyone every-
where that he was on his way to France armed this time with
the credentials of a distinguished representative—not alone
of his country but also of his profession—that would bring
him face to face with the great soldiers and statesmen of
France, Belgium, and the British Isles. Paris! Brussels! Lon-
don!—names and places which transfigured and quickened
the heart.
Stern seemed suddenly to have been borne as on wings
into a new and brighter world. The crowning touch was the
morning newspaper's report on the now six-months-old
Roosevelt proposal “to pack” the Supreme Court. As Leah
read aloud the front page article in the Washington daily,
Stern's jubilant spirit mounted. Governor Herbert H. Leh-
man of New York had administered the decisive blow. The
President could not turn to this stalwart Democrat for sup-

port of this, his latest and perhaps most momentous political
escapade.
“Now, Leah,” Stern said, “we can travel to Europe with
unalloyed confidence. Lehman's repudiation of Roosevelt's
packing plan means that the floodwaters of dictatorship have
crested. We may cross the ocean sure that all is well again
here at home.”
(On the following day, July 22nd, the Senate completely
shattered the President's court-packing expedient by a doubly
decisive rejection vote of seventy to twenty.)
Aboard the United States liner “S.S. President Harding,”
as the ship glided gracefully down the Hudson River that
bright July afternoon, Stern's gaze was still toward the vanish-
ing city and the land over which he had traveled less than
twenty-four hours before. He had seen and heard and felt
part of the greatness of the government and people. The
concatenation of events leading up to the moment in which
he and Leah stepped inside their steamship cabin was a
revelation of the might, the power, the grandeur, and, above
all, the majesty of government which was the United States
of America. The solicitude and the efficiency of the Army
officers assigned to the American Battle Monuments Com-
mission, the attention to details and the precision of the plans
worked out by the officials in the national capital, the ease
and comfort of the railway trip, the poise and the alacrity of
the hotel clerks, the courtesy of the people everywhere on
the Island of Manhattan—everything had moved without
even the slightest suggestion of the frenzied and frantic verbal
and written ukases of the New Deal minions. There was
little cause for alarm or fear that the crushing hand of an
American dictator would stifle the national life.
“That,” Leah said, “will be the best message we can bring
to the spirits of the 30,000 Americans in our European
cemeteries. To keep America truly free will be the only
‘everlasting tribute’ we can offer to the brave men—living
and dead.”

Several hours later, the “President Harding,” seemingly
with a minimum of exertion and an almost total absence of
swaying, glided into the approaching dusk and on to the
great ocean. There was not another vessel in view.
The rabbi and Leah returned to their cabin. Here were
no Pullman-like berths, but real beds. On one of them lay
quite an accumulation of letters, packages, and telegrams.
One by one, Leah unfolded the contents of these intimate
and precious links with their country. These were like the
silken cord which Ariadne gave Theseus as he went forth
to combat the dreaded Minotaur of Minos.
There was still time before the evening meal to scan the
items in the American Battle Monuments Commission's mass
of memoranda.
“It seems to me, Leah,” Stern interrupted, “it would be
well at this time to know just who are on the same mission
with us.”
Leah turned to the printed list and called off the names of
the delegates:
“General John J. Pershing, Chairman; Colonel Robert G.
Woodside, Vice-Chairman; The Honorable David A. Reed;
Brigadier General J. B. P. Clayton Hill; Colonel D. John
Markey; Judge Finis J. Garrett; Mrs. Henry Fenimore Baker;
Lt. Colonel X. H. Price, Secretary. These are the members
of the permanent American Battle Monuments Commission.
“The members of the President's special delegation are:
The Honorable William C. Bullitt, American Ambassador to
France; The Honorable Josephus Daniels, American Am-
bassador to Mexico, and Secretary of the Navy during the
World War; The Honorable F. Ryan Duffy, the Senate; The
Honorable Richard B. Russell, the Senate; The Honorable
J. Willard Gibson, the Senate; The Honorable Lister Hill,
House of Representatives; The Honorable Charles A. Eaton,
House of Representatives; The Honorable J. Walter Lam-
beth, House of Representatives; Brigadier General Benedict
Crowell, Assistant Secretary of War during the World War;

The Honorable Harry W. Colmery, National Commander,
The American Legion; Brigadier General Bernard W. Kear-
ney, Commander-in-Chief, Veterans of Foreign Wars; The
Honorable C. A. Ragor, Deputy Chief of Staff, Disabled
American Veterans; Mrs. Howard C. Boone, National Presi-
dent, American War Mothers.
“The official chaplains are: The Reverend Perry Smith,
The Reverend William P. O'Connor, and yourself.”
“Cincinnati is well represented, Leah. Of the twenty-four
delegates, three are Cincinnatians: Ragor, O'Connor, and I.
“I also learned that there is a large delegation of Veterans
of Foreign Wars aboard the “President Harding” and that
the American Legion will be well represented at all the dedi-
cation ceremonies. These veterans and their wives are not
traveling at government expense, however. Some of them
are paying their own way. The others are the official dele-
gates of their respective organizations.”
The 2,878-mile, seven-day voyage across the Atlantic, save
for one twenty-four-hour period of northeasterly gale and
rough sea, was replete with incredible comfort and pleasure.
There were dancing, moving pictures, religious services,
games on the top deck, and games in the lounging room.
Dining thrice daily was a three-time banquet. Stern and his
wife mingled freely with the passengers. Within the confines
of this valiant vessel riding the limitless waste of roaring
water, the passengers were knit together as one family.
The bustling stewards provided a study in varying nation-
alities: German, Swiss, British, and Italian. The “President
Harding’s” captain, Lieutenant Commander James Roberts,
did not appear among the passengers until the ship had com-
pleted at least one thousand miles of her northeastward course
from Ambrose L.V., New York, to Daunt L.V., Cobh,
Ireland.
Perhaps the most gratifying home-touch was the daily
posting of the baseball scores of both the American and Na-

tional Leagues. Yet with all the luxury, refinement, and
modernity of the equipment and apparatus aboard the ocean
liner, the most impressive occurrence was the weird appear-
ance of a flock of sea gulls toward evening on the seventh
and final day of the crossing. For though the days and the
nights overflowed with holiday joy and freedom from care,
the coming of the sea gulls was a sign of surpassing assurance
that the good, green earth was indeed close at hand. As
these birds hovered gracefully over the ship, they performed
the same escort ritual for the “President Harding’s” passen-
gers as did their ancestors for the Vikings in their rude gal-
leys more than a thousand years before.
Early in the morning of Friday, July 30th, this second
contingent of the American Battle Monuments Commission's
official delegation crossed the gangplank and awesomely set
foot on the “sweet soil” of France, at the port of Le Havre.
Almost immediately the delegates were surrounded by offi-
cers of the United States War and State Departments and
officials of the French government. It was a stirring recep-
tion. Shortly before noon of the same day, following another
and similarly cordial reception, Rabbi Stern and his wife
veritably tiptoed from the railway station on to the streets
of Paris. Stern strained every nerve of his senses lest he
should fail to catch the authentic sounds and smells of the
great city. It was as in a dream. The sounds of the rolling
waves of the ocean and the swish of the good ship “President
Harding” were still with him. Now the roar and the clamor
of the motorcars caused him slightly to reel and stagger as
he walked from the Italian-built automobile into the lobby
of the Hotel Lutétia, near the Bon Marché.
Father O'Connor and Al Ragor of the Disabled American
Veterans accompanied them to their room. As Stern sur-
veyed the suite which was to be theirs for the next two weeks,
Ragor said, “You haven't much time to enjoy these royal
accommodations, Milt. We'll give you one hour to freshen

up. Then Father O'Connor and I will take you and Leah to
the City Hall to meet General Pershing, his staff, the French
dignitaries, and Ambassador Bill Bullitt.”
The remarkable American pilgrimage began with a garden
party given by President and Mrs. Albert Lebrun at the
Palais de L’Elysee on Tuesday, July 27th. No doubt, this
1937 pilgrimage was planned to mesh with the concurrent
Paris International Exposition. The American Battle Monu-
ments Commission dedicatory exercises were conducted out
of doors. They were witnessed by thousands of French peo-
ple, most of whom understood only those American speeches
which were translated by Army interpreters. The American
delegates traveled almost continuously, with the French bus
as the chief vehicle of transportation.
There was little time to spend in Paris. Yet Stern quickly
observed oddities which deflated the illusion that Paris was
incomparably the City Beautiful, and rendered it in the
imagination of the American sojourner just another colossal
beehive of humanity. Gasoline sold at fifty-seven cents a
gallon. The Parisian preferred American cigarettes to Amer-
ican coins, when tipped. The barbershop of the grand Hotel
Lutétia was as old-fashioned as a shop in a New England
village. Startlingly, there was only a wee cube of soap for
the huge bathtub, but wine flowed freely in all the cafes.
The Parisians were reluctant to entertain the tourists in their
homes. Yet they did not seem to be either annoyed or im-
pressed by the presence of the awkward, speech-handicapped
Americans.
Nowhere could Stern discern even faintly that the people
of France were in any manner agitated by the fanatical mili-
tary and political exploits of Adolf Hitler and Benito Musso-
lini at their borders. Neither the brutal assassination of
Engelbert Dollfuss nor the predatory Austrian Anschluss
had perceptibly alarmed the French statesmen. As a perfect
contrast to the sardonic spirit of Italian and German war
gods, French colonels and generals, though adorned with

ribbons, medals, gold braid of office, and swords, fraternized
amiably with sergeants, corporals, and even with privates.
This semblance of peace no doubt was preserved by the
presence everywhere of the pitiably maimed battle-casualties
—the perpetual reminders of the real price of war.
By private car, taxicab, train, bus, subway, and on foot,
the American delegates came face to face with the glory and
—often—the woe of France. The delegates stood reverently
in the aisles of the cathedrals of Rheims, Chartres, and Or-
léans. They trod wonderingly the battlefields of Verdun and
Belleau Wood. They touched the helmets, the bayonets, the
trenches, the dugouts, even the showers used by the Boches
in the World War twenty years before. They saw that part
of France whose roads, villages, fields, cafes, and churches
were as they had been in the days of Cyrano de Bergerac.
At Verdun, where every building had been razed by the
Germans and then restored through the generosity of the
American Rockefeller Foundation, Stern and Leah were the
guests of the young French Rabbi Mendel Pincus and his
wife, and drank chocolate at a cafe euphemistically called
Café Paix, some of whose patrons were officers of Poland's
Army in training at Verdun.
Everywhere, the ultimate thought was the tragic experience
of France. The fields were so lovely, so well-cultivated. The
forests were in superb condition. Wherever they turned,
Stern and his companions saw evidence of the thrift, the
industry, and the good husbandry of the French peasant.
On one of the return trips to Paris, Stern conversed with
a young American recently returned from a tour in Germany.
“Rabbi,” he reported, “I had lunch with Adolf Hitler sev-
eral weeks ago. Do you know, I think he is a very charming
fellow.”
At three o'clock, Sunday afternoon, August 1st, the three
American chaplains, Protestant Perry Smith, Father William
P. O'Connor, and Rabbi Milton Stern, took their positions

side by side before a combined radio and amplifier that would
carry their voices from the heights of Montfaucon to every
part of France and across the Atlantic Ocean, to be relayed
by Station WJZ of New York to every part of the North
American continent. Before them, below the temporary plat-
form, there were perhaps twenty thousand spectators. Seated
to the right and to the left were the eminent of France and
of the United States of America. Encircling the crowd were
many gendarmes and soldiers.
Small wonder that Stern's heart beat furiously as he awaited
the cue to offer his prayer. Nineteen years before, his divi-
sion, the 37th, one of twenty-five American divisions in the
Meuse-Argonne offensive and made up for the most part of
Ohio national guardsmen, had taken a major part in the cap-
ture of this presumably impregnable redoubt from the Ger-
mans. Nineteen years before, he, Sergeant-Major Milton
Stern of the 147th United States Regiment of Infantry, had
grimly faced the artillery and machine gun fire of the proud
foe entrenched on these heights. Nineteen years before, on
the 29th day of September, he himself had been laid low by
shrapnel, only a few miles beyond this Montfaucon.
But now Father O'Connor's nudge roused him from his
reverie. Stern lifted up his voice in exaltation and gratitude,
saying:
“Eternal Father, Creator and Governor of all nations,
whither can I go from Thy spirit, whither can I flee from
Thy presence? Amidst this scene of battle and desolation,
upon this land whose beauty still haunts my soul, we stand
before Thee in humility and awe. Who can say, ‘What doest
Thou?' How can mortal man perceive the majesty of Thy
justice and the wisdom of Thy will?
“We praise Thee for the victory of liberty and fraternity.
We ask Thy blessing of peace upon the nations whom Thou
hast chosen as the champions of truth and freedom. May the
memory of the sacrifices of those who sleep here strengthen
the bonds of love between nation and nation. May we never

be found wanting in courage, faith, and unswerving fidelity
to liberty.
“May Thy spirit abide with us now and forever more.
Amen.”
The chaplains returned to their seats.
Solemnity predominated. The majesty of the American
memorials—the shaft, the chapel, and the cemetery—blended
with the majesty of the hills and the rivers and the forest.
Yet Stern was too absorbed in the miracle of the events
which the orators were recounting to be dazzled by the
voices of Pétain, Pershing, Lebrun, and President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt broadcasting from the White House in
Washington. Stern was too deeply entranced with the history
of the transportation of two million American soldiers across
the submarine-infested Atlantic Ocean and the marvelous
formation of the American Expeditionary Forces in 1918, to
be thrilled by speeches, parades, and military bands. Poign-
antly stirred by the memory of the immeasurably heroic
conduct of the troops who fought at Belleau Wood, Château-
Thierry, and here at Montfaucon, he could not be over-
whelmed by the words of ambassadors, generals, and the
Presidents of the two great republics.
“So stupendous were the achievements of the American
Expeditionary Forces on sea and on land and, in some in-
stances, in the air,” Stern reflected, “that imposing monu-
ments and chapels are required in order to testify to the
actual and not legendary character of these attainments. The
cemeteries—so gripping, so regal—provide dramatic proof
of the valor and superb spirit of our soldiery.
“Nowhere in all the world could there be monuments or
chapels or cemeteries like these. There are stones marking
the sites of such great battlefields as Marathon and Waterloo
and Gettysburg. But perhaps nowhere in the world would
we find anything to compare with our battle memorials here
in France: magnificent and aesthetically inspiring affirma-
tions of the incredible power of the Spirit of America.


## p. 192 (#222) ############################################

“Whatever shall be the verdict of historians regarding the
motives of our statesmen, financiers, and industrialists, these
American war memorials say that two million American men
faced the hazards of submarines, airplanes, mines, machine
guns, poison gas, artillery, and poisoned wells for an ideal, a
principle. As the French critic Renan might have phrased it,
“The truest vision ever had of Liberty came perhaps here.’”
Stern's reverie was terminated by the thunderous applause
which followed President Lebrun's address. Then the 150th
Regiment of French infantry passed in review before the
President of France, Maréchal Pétain, General Pershing, and
United States Ambassador Bullitt.
After one hour and thirty-three minutes of music and
fervent oratory, Rabbi Stern and his wife watched with ven-
eration as the thousands of men, women, and children quietly
slipped away. The American travelers were now free to
inspect the war memorials. At the side of the rabbi was
Captain John R. Vance, official World War historian attached
to the American Battle Monuments Commission, chief guide
of the Army personnel assigned to the war memorial delega-
tion, and Stern's constant companion.
“General Pershing is coming this way, Milt,” said Captain
Vance. “I think he wants to say a word to you.”
Stern advanced slowly. The towering figure of Pershing
came forward. The hand of the great soldier clasped Stern's
hand warmly. His strong voice said: “That was a great speech
you delivered, rabbi. I wish I could talk as well.”

CHAPTER XIX
THE MAGINOT LINE–SYMBOL OF PROFESSIONAL
FOSSILIZATION
HE chartered Paris bus to Brussels reached the fron-
Ø. on Saturday evening, August 7th. Some of the
American passengers alighted. They wanted to feel
the Belgian soil, and they were curious to detect that which
divided one country from another. Apparently, the only
visible indication of national boundary was a stone slab, just
as it is in the United States, in the separation of one state
from another. Captain Vance and the Belgian and French
customs inspectors were engaged in an animated exchange of
papers and credentials. Rabbi Stern and Leah sauntered
close by.
“I am wondering, Leah,” Stern said, almost wistfully, “how
it was that we did not know when we passed the Maginot
Line. I am sure it's in this vicinity.”
“What is this Maginot Line, Milt?”
“Let’s wait until we resume our journey on the bus and
we'll ask Captain Vance.”
“The Maginot Line is the assurance that France's pro-
fessional soldiers have given to the French people against
the menace of Hitler and Mussolini,” Captain Vance related
to the Cincinnatians. “The chief thought is that this chain
of forts will convince the Germans and the Italians of the
foolhardiness of an attempted invasion. These skillfully
camouflaged fortifications stretch over 314 kilometers from
Belfort, near Switzerland in the south, to the Belgian border.
They are considered impregnable. The forts are about seven
stories deep underground, with elevators, railroad, power

plants, ammunition and food supply centers, and hospitals,
and are perpetually manned by Army personnel.”
“Do all French strategists believe that the Maginot Line is
France's foolproof way of keeping out the warrior hordes of
Germany, Captain?”
“The French War College has complete confidence in the
power of the Maginot Line defenses to hold back and even
to annihilate any invading host.”
“What about Colonel Charles de Gaulle, Captain,” inter-
posed Congressman Lister Hill of Alabama, Chairman of the
House Military Affairs Committee.
“Colonel de Gaulle is the one daring French officer who
is radically opposed to the defensive psychology of the
Maginot Line, Lister. In 1934 de Gaulle published a book
chiding the French High Command for its reliance on the
Maginot Line. He advocates a mobile system of offensive-
defensive strategy, calling in large measure for the coordina-
tion of air power and swift-moving armored divisions. But
the French High Command has ridiculed de Gaulle's propo-
sitions.”
“And,” added Congressman Hill, “de Gaulle's book, The
Army of the Future, is must reading across the border in
German military circles. The Wehrmacht generals will utilize
de Gaulle's ideas as thoroughly as they will profit from
Bernard Baruch's detailed plans for war mobilization which,
incidentally, lie pigeonholed in our Archives in Washington.”
“Can it be,” Stern asked, “that the French have lost their
powers of imagination and perspicacity, and that the Ger-
mans, often derided for their obtuseness, have stolen another
march on the French?”
“In matters of war and science,” Captain Vance answered,
“unfortunately, the Germans have an incredible faculty for
progress—if that is what may be called progress. Remember
what happened when Congress turned down Simon Lake's
submarine blueprints? The Germans grabbed them. We
court-martialed General Billy Mitchell in 1925. We called

him crazy because of his conviction that the next war will
be won by the nation having superior air power. But the
Germans, under Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, are doing
things with military aviation about which we can scarcely
surmise.”
“It seems to me,” added Ragor of Cincinnati, “that if the
French War College had the slightest understanding about
the way we play football in the U.S.A., they could see that
it wouldn't take the Germans very long to stage an end-sweep
around Northern France while feinting a frontal attack on the
Maginot Line.”
The colloquy at the rear end of the Paris bus continued.
Now and then Captain Vance called attention to the names
and historic significance of the Belgian towns through which
they traveled.
“No doubt, Captain, you know,” commented the rabbi,
“that when King Albert returned in triumph to Brussels on
November 22, 1918, a provisional battalion of my division,
the 37th, participated in the formal ceremony. About a year
ago I received a letter from the Belgian Ambassador in
Washington in which he stated that Belgium's King Albert
regarded the irresistible advance of our 37th Division through
Flanders and across the Scheldt as ‘one of the most brilliant
feats of arms in the late war.’”
The less-than-twenty-four-hour sojourn in Belgium was
garlanded with enchanting episodes. The suite and the serv-
ices at the Hotel Metropole, American Ambassador Gibson's
garden-dinner, the ease with which the Belgians everywhere
conversed in the English language, the high spirits of the peo-
ple of Brussels, the speech of Prime Minister Paul van Zee-
land delivered in elegant English, the glimpse of the battlefield
of Waterloo, registered distinct sensations deep in the memory
of every member of the American Battle Monuments Com-
mission and delegation. There was but one poignant sugges-
tion of happy Belgium's tenuous position as the buffer state

high degree of prosperity and well-being, and though she was
greatly respected among the nations of the earth, her soldiery
was unimpressive. For the men who wore the uniforms of
Belgium's defenders were no more heroic in stature, nor more
terrifying in aspect, than young American Boy Scouts.
The dedication functionaries moved on from the American
cemetery at Waereghem to the American monument at
Audenaerde, and then to the American monument at Kemmel,
all in Belgium, and all on Sunday, August 8th. From Belli-
court on the Aisne, the delegates traveled to Cantigny on the
Somme. The last ceremony on French soil was at the seaport
of Brest, on Thursday, August 12th. The two weeks’ tour
of France culminated in a banquet at the Normandie Restau-
rant, on the Quai d'Orsay, with the American representatives
as the guests of the Minister of Commerce and Industry and
the Commissioner General of the Exposition of 1937.
The Saturday afternoon voyage across the English Chan-
nel was perhaps a salutary interlude of agony. Even such an
intrepid traveler as the seventy-five-year-old American states-
man, Josephus Daniels, seemed to quail beneath the bludgeon-
ings of the waves. Undoubtedly, this ordeal was no whit
more miserable for the sedate American pilgrims of 1937
than the experience had been for those hardened warriors
who accompanied William the Conqueror in the year 1066.
One such trip across the Channel should be enough to con-
vince any skeptic of the power of this providential moat to
preserve the British Isles from an invasion by sea. Both
Napoleon and Kaiser Wilhelm II had turned back in despair
as they contemplated the mystic wall of water which sepa-
rated them from Shakespeare's “other Eden, demi-paradise,
this fortress built by Nature for herself.” Would the airplane,
as an instrument of invasion, at last break the spell of Bri-
tain's pristine, millennial Maginot Line?
The ceremonies and the speeches at the Brookwood Ceme-
tery, twenty-eight miles from London, were enhanced by the
music of the band of the Welsh Guards and the vigorous

utterances of the Rt. Hon. Alfred Duff Cooper, First Lord
of the Admiralty, representing His Majesty's Government.
On the return to London by rail that Sunday afternoon,
August 15th, the conversation of the American travelers
focused on two subjects: the bold attack on Communism by
a number of the speakers that afternoon, and the appointment
by the governor of Alabama of Lister Hill as senator from
that state to fill the vacancy brought about by the elevation
of Senator Hugo L. Black to the United States Supreme Court.
Rabbi and Leah Stern were elated over the good fortune
which had come to the forty-three-year-old veteran of the
World War and statesman from Alabama. Of all the men
and women who composed the Commission and the Presi-
dent's special committee, none was more enthusiastic about
Stern's participation in the eleven open air ceremonies than
Lister Hill. The short two weeks' fellowship on bus and on
the platform had ripened into a strong bond of mutual esteem
and admiration.
The Sterns, modestly installed at the Regent Palace Hotel
near Piccadilly Circus, during the next four days avidly im-
bibed the charm and the substance that were London—this
mammoth monument to man's devotion to tradition. Unlike
Paris and Brussels, London was a haunting replica of home.
With Piccadilly Circus as pivot, the two Cincinnatians
watched the changing of the Welsh Guards at Buckingham
Palace, shopped along Regent Street, accompanied Father
O'Connor on a visit to Westminster Abbey and Westminster
Cathedral, and timorously hurried through the fish markets
of Billingsgate. The twenty-one small buildings grouped un-
der the name of London Tower provided an amazing collec-
tion of jostling tourists, priceless jewels, and tall, civilian
attendants unable to stand erect in these narrow two-story
circular edifices which, contrasted with the Empire State
Building, were as a sand dune is to a mountain.

Queen Mary's Gardens and Palace might have passed un-
noticed but for the mechanical maneuvers of the Welsh Guard
on sentry duty. At St. Dunstan's School for the Blind, they
learned about Britain's admirable program of after care for
the blind. At the office of the Henry George Foundation of
Great Britain, the Sterns met some of the British counter-
parts of the faithful American adherents to the Georgist pro-
gram for social reconstruction. The all too cockney accent
of the Savoy Theatre thespians was incomprehensible. Every-
where in London, tall men seemed to have priority in the
operation of public utilities such as the bus and the subway.
Many of these amiable civil servants were war veterans.
In the evening of their last day in London, the Sterns came
face to face with that which was but the whine and the prelude
to the screams and the roar of a second and even greater
world-wide convulsion: close to five hundred young men and
women gathered together in the recreational center of the
West London Synagogue (two of whose spiritual leaders were
American-born and Cincinnati-trained rabbis) to applaud
and to be cheered by a German actress who, like themselves,
was an uprooted escapee from the blood-drenched hands of
the twentieth-century reincarnation of the spirit of Thor.
Horrendously, at this very moment, the war-weary British
were dodderingly vacillating between the conciliation-appease-
ment policy of their new Prime Minister Neville Chamber-
lain and the resolute, clearsighted, but undramatic challenge
of Britain's young Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. They
were lulled by Winston Churchill's anodyne, “Thank God
for the French Army.” They were unimpressed by Adolf
Hitler's determination, brazenly set forth in his book Mein
Kampf, to be assured of Britain's neutrality before he let
loose his terrible thunder.
The westward, homeward-bound trip on the United States
liner “President Roosevelt” was a repetition of the almost
flawless, excursion-like rejuvenating character of the eastward

voyage on the “President Harding.” On the last day, as the
golden hours vanished into the mists of memory, Rabbi and
Leah Stern chatted with Ambassador Daniels and Father
O'Connor as the “President Roosevelt” saluted the majestic
Statue of Liberty.
“Someone going to meet you at the pier, Milt?” Father
O'Connor asked solicitously.
“My sister Dinah and brother Sidney, on vacation in At-
lantic City, are coming up to meet us.”
“Are you going right back to Cincinnati, Father?” Leah
asked.
“No. As soon as I step ashore, I am going to take the
subway to Brooklyn. The Dodgers are playing the Cincin-
nati Reds this afternoon and I expect to watch the game from
the dugout.”
That Saturday afternoon, August 28th, Stern, flanked by
his sister and brother, strode buoyantly along New York's
always exciting Fifth Avenue. How good and how exhila-
rating it was to renew spiritual and physical contact with
one's own, native land, after wandering on foreign soil! Little
by little the old world vanished. Ships, ocean, and other
lands were quickly swallowed up by the counterflow of
avenues, vehicles, shops, and masses of rushing, lighthearted,
gesticulating New Yorkers.
Step by step, Dinah and Sidney drew their brother back
to the milieu of home, children, family, friends, baseball, and
national politics. For the first time he learned of the incred-
ible charge that President Roosevelt's most recent appointee
to the august Supreme Court of the United States had at one
time been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. It was incon-
ceivable that Franklin D. Roosevelt, however mortified by
the crushing defeat of his court-packing device, could have
gone so far as to bestow the highest honors of the nation on
one who once marched masked side by side with the avowed
enemies of Catholics, Jews, and Negroes. Washington's most
respected correspondent, Frank R. Kent of the Baltimore

Sun, had written of Roosevelt that “his convictions are not
very strong, his mind not very clear, and in the matter of
political philosophy, he is neither a real liberal nor a true
conservative, but essentially an opportunist, prone to do the
expedient thing in a jam.” Therefore Roosevelt could not
have deliberately committed so egregious an affront to the
millions of Catholics, Negroes, and Jews, so many of whom
had invested him with a messianic aura.
The Senate's ratification of the Black nomination was
diffident. It was based on a White House denial of the
senator's Ku Klux Klan affiliation. But the wave of indigna-
tion mounted imperiously, when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
produced indisputable evidence of such membership. The
flood of criticism and revulsion which rolled across the con-
tinent up to the Executive Mansion in the national capital
was not abated by Justice Black's confession and recital by
radio of extenuating circumstances. He had become a mem-
ber of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama as a means of promot-
ing himself politically. He bore no malice against either
Catholic, Negro, or Jew. His personal secretary was a Jew.
“I wonder how Mr. Roosevelt will extricate himself this
time,” Dinah said, derisively.
The answer came by radio on Tuesday, October 5th.
President Roosevelt was in Chicago to dedicate a bridge. The
question on everyone's tongue was how Mr. Roosevelt would
mollify the sensitive and heal the wounds which would doubt-
less seriously impair his strength as a politician and weaken
his position of growing world leadership. It seemed that if
Franklin Roosevelt did not come forth with a statesmanlike
expiation for this second blow to the prestige of the hallowed
Supreme Court, he would tumble from his eminence like
Humpty Dumpty, and all the forces of political action could
never elevate him again.
The speech, for the most part, was platitudinous. But an
undercurrent theme reverberated around the world with start-
ling significance. Here was proof again that Mr. Roosevelt

R E D POT TA GE 235" 201
was a master hand at legerdemain, a born showman, a suave
and seemingly confiding speaker who, like every great magi-
cian, created the illusion that he wouldn't deceive anyone.
In May, 1933, Franklin Roosevelt had struck out boldly,
saying that there could be no recognition at all of the possi-
bility of war for any purpose except to repel attack. It was
coupled with the plain inference that, even under those cir-
cumstances, nations should be content to build up offensive
weapons after war had begun, rather than before.
By the passage of the Neutrality Act, based on the theory
“travel and trade at one's own risk,” and the warm reception
given to the proposed Ludlow Constitutional Amendment
calling for a national plebiscite before declaring war, the
people of the United States had made it clear to the world
that they, like their President, abhorred recourse to war.
Imbedded in this speech and shrewdly subordinated on this
gala occasion commemorating “a project of civic betterment”
were words spoken by a man whose voice registered a new
and altogether strong resolve that “the peace-loving nations
must make a concerted effort in opposition to those viola-
tions of treaties and those ignorings of humane instincts
which today are creating a state of international anarchy and
instability from which there is no escape through mere isola-
tion or neutrality.”
In this radio dedicatory address President Roosevelt, by
word, and, more so, by tone of voice, turned the hearts and
the thoughts of the American people away from the com-
paratively trivial occupational indiscretion of an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court to a crisis of terrifying pro-
portions.
“If those things come to pass in other parts of the world,”
the President declaimed, “let no one imagine that America
will escape, that America may expect mercy, that this West-
ern Hemisphere will not be attacked and that it will continue
tranquilly and peacefully to carry on the ethics and the arts
of civilization.

“If those days come, “there will be no safety by arms, no
help from authority, no answer in science. The storm will
rage till every flower of culture is trampled and all human
beings are leveled in a vast chaos.’”
Clearly, Roosevelt, the pacifist, was wrestling with Roose-
velt, the showman and politician. What he offered was as
innocuous as rose petals tossed at an infuriated tiger. What
he propounded with such professorial unction was no less
quixotic than France's Maginot Line and Chamberlain's pol-
icy of reconciliation through appeasement of an insatiable
Ogre.
“It seems to be unfortunately true,” the President con-
tinued, “that the epidemic of world lawlessness is spreading.
When an epidemic of physical disease starts to spread, the
community approves and joins in a quarantine of the patients
in order to protect the health of the community against the
spread of the disease.
“War is a contagion,” he added, solemnly, “whether it be
declared or undeclared. It can engulf states and peoples re-
mote from the original scene of hostilities. We are deter-
mined to keep out of war, yet we cannot insure ourselves
against the disastrous effects of war and the dangers of in-
volvement.”
Roosevelt was feeling his way sagaciously through the
opium-like smoke of sentimental idealism. He was not the
first to shed the veneer of optimism. Before him, world-
renowned journalist Dorothy Thompson had issued this decla-
ration of the new awakening and the will to fight:
“All my life, I have been a pacifist. I have contributed to
peace societies, written, spoken, and paraded for peace. But
today I question whether our ways of seeking peace are not
playing into the hands of those who love war. . . . Do not
count upon our neutrality.”
The tide was turning.
Dinah and Milton were chagrined by the shattering con-
signment of the Black imbroglio to oblivion.

“So it seems that he would plunge us into war if by so
doing he could cover up his follies,” said Dinah.
They were walking along a Cincinnati highway that
autumn evening. Her voice was tense.
“Mr. Roosevelt's words and actions closely parallel the
words and actions of Woodrow Wilson, Dinah. I wonder if
President Roosevelt will profit by Wilson's experiences. Wil-
son was an idealist, 103 per cent. He was an amateur in
peace and in war. The Europeans and Japanese did not
understand the Wilsonian innocence. They were unblushing,
shameless professionals, professional empire builders. They
were agents of a class which is never concerned with the
hope of making the world safe for anything except titles to
land which they have obtained by conquest, by fraud, or by
inheritance. Democracy was something for the preachers and
the poets to prate about. Slogans such as Mr. Wilson had
published to the world would not repay them for the millions
of lives destroyed on the European and Asiatic battlefronts.”
“Just what do you mean by amateur and professional?”
“In the realms of war and diplomacy, we are still amateurs.
The Germans, the British, and the Japanese, and a few other
peoples, are professionals. These nations do not fight for
dear old Alma Mater. When they send their young men into
battle, they expect a handsome return for this investment of
energy, wealth, and manpower.”
“Are we Americans so stupid? Are we always going to
fall for slogans?”
“Before that shot rang out at Serajevo in Bosnia, in the
summer of 1914, nations would go through the ceremony of
declaring war. Then these nations would formally confess to
the world that they were actually going to war. Today this
is not being done. Nations just haven’t time to carry out
this rite.
“Strangest of all,” Stern continued, “the combatants refuse
to admit they are at war. There is a reason for this grotesque
mockery of reality. This is how it evolved. The nations who

were our allies during the World War—Italy and Japan, for
example—have a sense of humor, if not of honor. They pity
us. They note that we went in with “clean hands and a pure
heart’ and came out without adding anything to our record
except colossal debt and huge disillusionment. To compen-
sate for our efforts and for our losses, these nations have
come to a sort of gentleman's agreement to outlaw war. They
want us to know that they admire our standards of idealism
and our exalted conception of duty. Most of all, Dinah, they
don't want us to give up our amateur attitude toward the
game of war. So they have decided that henceforth there
shall be no more wars.”
“No more wars? Why, we’ve had about seventeen since the
Armistice.”
“War has been outlawed—on paper.”
“What do you call what is going on in China and Spain?”
“That is ‘bootlegged' war. Our militant pacifists are hard-
pressed. They are face to face with as baffling a dilemma as
were the officials of the Anti-Saloon League before the repeal
of Prohibition. Our pacifists do not realize how enormously
they have complicated things.
“Take, for example, our neutrality laws,” Stern went on.
“They are utterly futile. They can be invoked only when
nations are at war. But no country will admit that a state
of war exists. All that we are able to do at present is to call
names and pass resolutions. The property and even the lives
of all neutrals are in jeopardy because again we are ‘too
proud to fight.’”
“Why do France and England keep up this farce?”
“They want to please us. They do not want to give us the
impression that we didn't get something out of the World
War. They want us to think and to feel that the world has
been made safe for Democracy. They want us to rejoice in
the faith that war has been outlawed.”
“What do you propose we should do now?”

“Were we to scatter neutrality enactments to the four
winds, were we to come down from our lofty perch of ideal-
ism, were we to step out of our amateur class and publish to
the world our intention of becoming professional in the mat-
ter of war victories—well, this would be a staggering blow
to the Great Powers. It would take them a long time to
recover from this shock—a longer time to swallow the bitter
dose of American sanity.”
“How effective will this policy be?”
“When our neighbors in every part of the world are fully
aware of our professional principles, you may count upon it,
Dinah, they will be pretty slow in dragging us into another
war, either as their ally or as their enemy. Every nation will
have a clear-cut understanding of our grim determination to
divide the spoils with our friends or to wrest it from our
adversaries. They will have it written down as established
American policy that this nation cannot again be bought for
a slogan or lured by a golden vision of brotherhood and
peace. And they will believe us the next time when we say
that this is the war to end war, that the world must be made
safe for Democracy, that treaties are sacred, that there must
be reverence for law, that there must be a world court to
decide disputes between nations by judicial and not by mili-
tary procedure. They will at that time accept our moral
leadership and permit our statesmen to dictate the terms of
peace, if not the terms of surrender and division of land.
That is why we must turn professional. The other nations
do not understand any language at present except that rein-
forced by the will to fight.”

CHAPTER XX
THUS SPAKE FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
the miracle of radio, the auditorium of the Sports
Palace in Berlin, Germany—4,608 air-miles east of
Cincinnati-was translated by the medium, as it were, of the
light-waves of an audio-telescope to the living room of Rabbi
Stern's home. The stage of the Berlin Sports Palace was as
close to Stern as he was to the radio set in the corner of the
TOOIT1.
On this same day, September 26th, twenty years before,
the American Army under General John J. Pershing had
opened its forty-five-day Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Early
in the morning of that day, Infantryman Stern had scrambled
up the deep trench and, along with hundreds of thousands of
other American soldiers, had begun that long, indomitable
advance through barbed wire entanglements, across gas-
soaked fields, over hitherto impenetrable redoubts and forest
gun emplacements, during an almost endless downpour of
American as well as enemy artillery fire, to drive Hinden-
burg's confident veterans in headlong retreat to Berlin.
On this day, chiseled in the granite annals of American
and world history, the voice that radio was about to bring to
millions of anxious auditors, like Rabbi Stern seated for the
most part in the seclusion and security of their homes, was
the voice of one who had for nearly four years served as a
mediocre corporal in Kaiser Wilhelm's astonishingly efficient
armies which had grappled successfully with the Russian
armies, on their Eastern Front, and which simultaneously
had almost overwhelmed the combined forces of Belgium,
Britain, and France, on their Western Front.

This seemingly insipid corporal was now the fabulous
Führer of the Third Reich. This onetime despised, Austrian-
born Adolf Hitler was this day undisputed Leader of revi-
talized, reconstructed Germany, exalted above Ludendorff,
Hindenburg, and all the great and proud members of the
Junker caste. The voice which the whole world awaited with
bated breath and whispering hope was not the golden voice
of a Franklin D. Roosevelt, nor was it the melodramatic
voice of Detroit's radio-preacher, Charles E. Coughlin. The
voice of Adolf Hitler was the voice of a Wagnerian Valkyrie.
Out of Berlin, Germany, which until the summer of 1914
was the Athens of the civilized world, would issue “sound
and fury” from the lips of a man “whose diction often was
ungrammatical, his platitudes exasperatingly repetitious, his
meaning frequently obscure”; whose voice was raucous, hys-
terical, repulsive, lacking “beauty or even dignity of expres-
sion,” and yet inexplicably seductive.
What was that colossal cue which called the whole world
to suspend the normal and routine processes of civilization
so that a meteoric player might “strut and fret his hour upon
the stage” of history? The action was the dismemberment of
Czechoslovakia. The underlying nemesis was that hideous
hypothesis which had brought Czechoslovakia into being—
the Wilsonian shibboleth of “self-determination.” “For none,”
commented Walter Lippmann, “knew better than Adolf Hitler
that the principle can be and has been used to promote the
dismemberment of practically every organized state. The
principle of self-determination was Adolf Hitler's chief in-
strument for enlarging the Reich by annexation, and for
destroying from within the civil unity of the states he intended
to attack. Hitler invoked this principle when he annexed
Austria.” As the American journalist further declared: “At
its worst, the principle of self-determination is a license to
intervention and aggression. Self-determination, which has
nothing to do with self-government [and ‘democracy'] but has
become confused with it, is barbarous and reactionary; by

sanctioning secession, it invites majorities and minorities to
be intransigent and irreconcilable. There is no end to its
atomization of human society.”
On September 16th, Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime
Minister, flew to Berchtesgaden for an unprecedented, per-
sonal conference with the German Chancellor. On Septem-
ber 22nd, the Prime Minister flew, for a second time, to
Germany, meeting Hitler at Godesberg on the Rhine. To
the new Moloch of Central Europe, Neville Chamberlain was
prepared to offer up Czechoslovakia, the League of Nations'
most loyal member and perhaps the most happy and pros-
perous among the nations of the world. The British Prime
Minister, with the acquiescence of Paris and the urging of
Washington, was prepared to wink at Article 10 of the
League of Nations Covenant by which the members of the
League solemnly pledged themselves to “respect and preserve,
as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and
existing political independence of its members.” Chamber-
lain would accede to the partition—and thus dissolve Czecho-
slovakia—in order to wrest a pledge of peace from the Ger-
man Führer. Chamberlain would forfeit his own soul in order
to gain—even if temporarily—world peace!
The preservation of an independent, sovereign, and power-
ful Czechoslovakia was of the highest military importance
for the peace of Europe. In the German maw, Czechoslo-
vakia would almost completely round out Hitler's war poten-
tial, for Czechoslovakia was a veritable arsenal of conquest.
Because of these patent, realistic factors in the maintenance
of the European balance of power, it was inconceivable that
the sturdy figures of such statesmen as Chamberlain, Edouard
Daladier, Eduard Benes, Roosevelt, and Mussolini would
melt like wax before the tempestuous tauntings of this
Austrian Tamerlane.
How can we explain this glaring incongruity? These states-
men were asking for “peace, peace” from the National Socialist
German Workers' Party! They were asking that “nation

should not lift up sword against nation” from the German
Fascists who systematically destroyed every pro-pacifist bit
of writing; who remorselessly imprisoned or brutally assassi-
nated every German intellectual—Protestant, Catholic, as
well as Jewish—who would have none of this brown-shirt
brand of Marxist World-Communism; and whose Leader the
truly “great souls” among the Germans themselves were
bravely plotting to cast out as an outlaw at the first oppor-
tune moment!
To crown this universal tragedy: in mock theodicy, Adolf
Hitler's speech was to be in Miltonic form—an argument
justifying the foul ways of his satanic legions.
As the mellow Westminster chimes of the clock on the
mantel intimated that the fateful hour was at hand, Sidney
Stern, now a University of Cincinnati College of Medicine
student, entered the room and quietly sat down at his
brother's side. Stern switched on the radio. He pressed one
of the keys and then listened as though mesmerized. The
National Broadcasting Company's engineer was calling in
Berlin. Across the nearly three thousand miles of the ocean's
roaring waves there came an almost similar roar from the
multithousand throats of the brown-shirted host in Berlin's
Sports Palace. The somber voice of the German radio sta-
tion operator was soon followed by that of the American
interpreter. As outlined, the speech of the Führer would be
cut off periodically to permit a rapid English translation.
Perhaps more arresting than the jumble and the jungle of
Hitler's harangue was the rhythmic, hypnotic blast of the
“Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!” of the Nazi partymen. Unlike the
noises arising from a crowd at a stadium, baseball park, or
political rally, this roar simulated the concerted trumpet call
of grand opera warriors. These were not the shouts of men
who loved peace and would pursue it. These were the shouts
of men dedicated to war as the supreme good, to “free death”

as a blessed sacrament of youth, and whose predominant
biological and spiritual urge was the “will to death.” The
virtue and necessity of war were acclaimed as the noblest
German morality. Victory in war was more to be desired
than all the wealth and all the land that an Alexandrian con-
quest might afford.
Twenty years before, Stern had seen specimens of Kaiser
Wilhelm's generation of warriors. He had seen them on the
battlefields of France. He had seen them as docile, whim-
pering prisoners. He had seen them as abandoned corpses
strewn on the hillsides and in the woods. He had seen them
marching down the slope of a hill in formation, as though on
parade, like automatons, oblivious to the foolhardiness of
their advance. As today burly, booted, Nazi “storm troopers”
never went alone to take an aged clergyman or a crippled
citizen into “protective custody,” so then Kaiser Wilhelm's
soldiers rarely engaged in hand-to-hand combat. But how
appallingly proficient were these same German uniformed
agents of havoc in razing cathedrals and hospitals and in the
utter destruction of village upon village!
The Führer began to read the manuscript prepared by
Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels, Chief of the Ministry of Informa-
tion. At first, with the air of a man at peace with the world
and one regally self-disciplined and master of his emotions,
Adolf Hitler seemed to be standing before a university
faculty, as a dean discoursing on an abstruse subject with
correct professorial gravity. But this was only to give the
Führer time to “warm up.” As minute followed minute, the
momentum of the speech was accelerated. As tirade was
shortened by the fat of virulence, the academician and orator
gave way to the fanatical, shrieking evangelist and the
preacher of damnation and “hell-fire.”
Stern and his brother listened with rapt concentration.
They shrank back aghast when Hitler boasted that he was

lord of the greatest army the world ever saw. And when this
“hurricane of annihilation” in human form sent forth his
first storm warning that no opposition could keep him from
invading Czechoslovakia within five days—if his ultimatum
was not met—the rabbi groaned in despair.
Sidney rose from his chair as Hitler concluded.
“Don’t worry, Milt,” he said, soothingly. “That's just bluff
and double-talk. Don't you remember Willson Woodside's
article in the June Reader's Digest? Woodside is sure that
if Germany were to start a war today, even supported by
Italy, she would be disastrously defeated. -
“Woodside asserts,” Sidney continued, “that a modern
technical war cannot be fought successfully without ample
supplies of iron and oil. He claims that Germany and Austria
combined control only one-fifth of the iron ore supply which
Germany and Austria-Hungary controlled in 1914. And the
food situation in Germany is still no better than it was after
the war.”
The rabbi remained silent.
“By the way, Milt,” Sidney remarked, skillfully changing
the subject, “do you think Ohio's Bob Taft has a chance to
defeat Democrat Senator Robert Bulkley? Roosevelt seems
to be just as determined to keep Taft out of the United States

its outstanding members at this November election.”
“Roosevelt has every reason to dislike Bob Taft. Once in
Washington, Taft will fight the New Deal nonsense vigorously
and courageously. I heard Taft at an Avondale Republican
rally. He speaks with authority and with power.”
However engrossing and titillating the abortive purge might
have been to such a political combatant as Roosevelt, the
attention of the President of the United States of America
could not be diverted from the European arena. There were
some rude cynics who believed that Roosevelt could not yield
the spotlight of world attention to such a one as the former
Austrian housepainter. General Ludwig von Beck, the Wehr-

macht's Chief of Staff, and a number of leading military and
political leaders in Germany were about to execute the coup
that would rid them of their odious chancellor. On Septem-
ber 29th, Roosevelt turned aside from the domestic political
fracas to set his country up as the moral arbiter among the
nations, and through various and devious ways interposed his
sanction of the Hitler-appeasement. To the Munich confer-
ence at the Führerhaus, President Roosevelt sent his repre-
sentatives, including Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, to confer with Hitler, Chamberlain, Daladier,
and Mussolini.
From time to time, Rabbi Stern left his study to catch the
latest bulletins broadcast from Munich, Geneva, Paris, Lon-
don, Prague, Rome, and New York City. As he compre-
hended the terms of the Munich capitulation, Stern mur-
mured devoutly, “It may be that the last great war took place
twenty years ago.”
Hitler's Munich “beer hall putsch” in November, 1923,
was a tragic farce. But the Munich Pact of September 30,
1938, established Adolf Hitler as the “Man of the Year,” and
Germany's Third Reich once again as a great Power. The
promise of “peace in our time” galvanized the Führer's hold
upon the German people, the majority of whom would then
be satisfied with their daily bread and the assurance of a
gainful occupation. Dr. Goebbels himself was an example of
an inordinately educated German, morbidly opposed to the
Weimar Republic by reason of his failure during the pre-Nazi
Revolution era to enjoy an income commensurate with his
intellectual skill. For Goebbels had attended the Universities
of Bonn, Freiberg, Munich, Würzburg, Cologne, Frankfurt,
Heidelberg, and Berlin, and had earned his doctorate at
Heidelberg.

astonished man in France when he alighted from his plane at
the Paris airport and found himself the cynosure of a cele-
bration, instead of the victim of a mob.
In the United States, President Roosevelt asked the people
to join with him and his family on Sunday in prayer for the
continued peace of the world. Secretary of State Cordell Hull
said, “As to immediate peace results, it is unnecessary to say
that they afforded a universal sense of relief.”
But Hitler's triumph at Munich was not only personal and
national in scope and flavor. The Munich Pact stamped the
seal of approval on the “new idol—the State.” The Munich
surrender to Adolf Hitler at the Führerhaus conference table
was a decisive victory of totalitarianism over libertarianism.
Mussolini and Stalin could now exult in the vindication of
their contention that the doctrine of popular sovereignty was
an anachronism and that the new order—whether black,
brown, red, or American pink-Fascism—had proved its pre-
eminence and superior power.
What did it matter that Mussolini's black-shirted minions
overran and conquered Haile Selassie's semicivilized warriors
armed with spears? What did it matter that, in Soviet Russia,
Bolsheviks murdered fellow-Communists with as little com-
punction as American workers slaughtered cattle in an abat-
toir? What did it matter that, in Soviet Russia, Stalin rooted
out fellow-citizens as callously as children swat flies? For
Fascism was “war to the death against liberalism and
democracy.”
Here in the United States it was a miracle that the Republic
had been able to survive so many artificially created indus-
trial tempests called crises and that the “Ship of State” had
not been wrecked by the many “false Liberal lights” on the
shores of the Potomac River. Deception was the order of
the day in the national capital. Bewitched by untrammeled
power, blinded by ceaseless glamor, beguiled at cocktail par-
ties by the charm of their “all-devouring words,” baffled by
the legalistic labyrinths of their own construction, insidiously

betrayed by the underground treason of their own appointees
in key positions everywhere in Government, bloated by the
fiction of the indispensable and invincible qualities of their
“Captain of Humanity,” the Roosevelt regime, ever unmind-
ful of the day of reckoning, daily seemed to chant “Merrily
we roll along,” and the underlying tenor of their attitude
seemed to be summed up in the words of the ancient prince
of Tyre: “I am a god, I sit in the seat of God.” The Roose-
velt statists laughed to scorn the Hoovers, the Smiths, the
Baruchs, and the Tafts, and all who, like them, held fast to
the Constitution, established, above all, “to secure the bless-
ings of liberty.”
One nation, Czechoslovakia, had already been sacrificed
in order that peace might prevail on earth. Under the new
dispensation—Fascism, Communism, and New Dealism—no
single generation, no group of citizens, and, still less, no single
citizen, had the right to militate against the Nation. The
state was the guardian and controlling agent of the Nation.
It could not be at the mercy and whims of politicians, fluctu-
ating from year to year in accordance with the moods of a
few men who happened, through the vicissitudes of universal
suffrage, to be invested with authority. Fascism substituted
the Nation for the individual. Thus spake Benito Mussolini
in 1926!
These were among the thoughts that whirled through the
mind of Rabbi Stern as he sat at the typewriter in his study,
listening, while his sister read aloud from Friedrich Nietzsche's
Thus Spake Zarathustra. Nietzsche was supposedly the oracle
for the Nazi creators of a new race of supermen.
“If Nietzsche were alive today, Dinah,” Stern said grimly,
“he would be the last German to click his heels in salute to a
fascist freebooter. This is one of the ironies of history. The
Nazis are as far removed from Friedrich Nietzsche as glut-
tons are from the philosophy of Epicurus, and American

Communists from the spirit of Thomas Jefferson. Let's go
over that chapter on ‘The New Idol, Dinah, in the first part
of Thus Spake Zarathustra. I want to make sure I’m not one
of those who misunderstand and who misrepresent the teach-
ings of Nietzsche.”
Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us,
my brethren: here there are states.
A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me,
for now will I say unto you my word concerning the death of
peoples.
A state is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth
it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: “I, the state, am
the people.”
It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung
a faith and a love over them: thus they served life.
Destroyers are they who lay snares for many, and call it the
state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.
Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood,
but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.
This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language
of good and evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its lan-
guage hath it devised for itself in laws and customs.
But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and what-
ever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.
False is everything in it.
Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto
you as the sign of the state. Verily, the will to death indicateth
this sign! Verily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!
“On earth there is nothing greater than I; it is I who am the
regulating finger of God”—thus roareth the monster. And not
only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees!
Ah! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy
lies! Ah! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish
themselves!
Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God!
Weary ye became of the conflict, and now your weariness serveth
the new idol!

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 217
Heroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it,
the new idol! Gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good con-
sciences, the cold monster!
Everything will it give you, if ye worship it, the new idol: thus
it purchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your
proud eyes.
It seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many! Yea,
a hellish artifice hath here been devised, a death-horse jingling
with the trappings of divine honours!
Yea, a dying for many hath here been devised, which glori-
fieth itself as life: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers of
death!
The state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good
and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and
the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all—is called “life.”
They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves.
See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one
another, and thus scuffle into the mud and the abyss.
Towards the throne they all strive: it is their madness—as if
happiness sat on the throne! Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne,
—and ofttimes also the throne on filth.
Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too
eager. Badly smelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly
they all smell to me, these idolaters.
My brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and
appetites! Better break the windows and jump into the open air!
Do go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the
idolatry of the superfluous!
Open still remaineth a free life for great souls. Verily he who
possesseth little is so much the less possessed: blessed be mod-
erate poverty!
There, where the state ceaseth—there only commenceth the
man who is not superfluous: there commenceth the song of the
necessary ones, the single and irreplaceable melody.
There, where the state ceaseth—pray look thither, my breth-
ren! Do ye not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the
Superman?
Thus spake Zarathustra.

“Dinah,” exclaimed Stern, “if this is a blueprint for
Fascism, then Marx's Das Kapital is an ecstatic espousal of
American capitalism!”
The rabbi paused. He laid his head on his arm, which
rested on the frame of the typewriter.
“I am not quite sure, Dinah,” he said, reflectively, “that
Nietzsche didn't contradict himself when he wrote in another
part of this book, ‘War and courage have done more great
things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery
hath hitherto saved the victims.’”

CHAPTER XXI
THE FORGOTTEN FINANCIER
EADING aloud is not so commonplace an experience
92 as those forms of social action which we call con-
versation and singing. Many sing. . . . Yet not all
who sing are artists. Those who have won the coveted acco-
lade of artist do not come by that crown as easily as birds
twitter and children prattle. Technical, professional attain-
ments come after years of agonizing concentration on goals
of physical and spiritual perfection. The cultivation of the
voice, whether for conversation, for singing, for public speak-
ing, or for reading aloud, is a glorious enterprise, and success
therein is more gratifying than the accumulation of wealth
or the exercise of power, the love of which is the root of so
much evil.
Reading aloud for the entertainment of children can be
highly exhilarating. But reading aloud to one who is blind
and must therefore rely almost wholly upon the spoken word
for illumination and instruction can be doubly enriching, be-
cause it calls for unusual skill and exertion. Few readers are
so properly primed that they are able to exercise enough of
their imagination and ordinary talents to reanimate the inert,
written thought.
There is no need for dramatization, as though one is on
the stage and before footlights. One need not be didactic.
Nor need the reader assume that he must be eloquent, that
he must orate. Let the intelligent reader simply bring forth
words and thoughts and statistics, as though the composer
himself were speaking, in a conversational tone; but always
with warmth and with exquisite sympathy and understanding
of the strain imposed on the eager auditor who must not
merely hear and be entertained.

The good reader will always be vigilant lest a break in the
rhythm of reading or slovenly speech will first dull, then
deaden, the million nerve fibers leading from the ear to the
brain and ultimately shut off the hundred circuits of sensa-
tion and induce torpor or sleep. The good reader will be
guided by the knowledge that, as he reads, the blind listen-
er's brain cells are humming like generators and turbines in
an electric power plant. Historic movements, philosophic
doctrines, and theological concepts instantaneously are ana-
lyzed and rejected or stored away in the mysterious, mar-
velous chambers of the human mind.
During the twenty years of his deprivation, Rabbi Stern had
many readers. Among them was Frieda Englander, Dinah's
friend and the sister of a Hebrew Union College professor of
biblical exegesis. Frieda Englander was an exemplary reader.
She was an almost perfect medium of communication. She
was as faithful a transmitter of thought as a radioactive beam
of light is of sound. Frieda Englander was a woman who
loved knowledge and pursued it ardently at university, lecture
hall, and library. She read constantly and conscientiously.
For a number of years she was assistant librarian at various
branches of the Cincinnati Public Library. Frieda Englander
perused newspapers and magazines with fidelity and with
veneration for the written word. With all this, she was a
radiant personality, a capable musician, endowed with all the
virtues which mark “the woman of excellence.” She was
devoted to Judaism, and loved to worship at the temple. She
was versed in the long, long annals of the Jew. But Frieda
Englander had never heard of the altruistic, providential
financier of the American Revolution, the Polish immigrant
and Jew, Haym Salomon, whose name, translated from the
Hebrew, would read “Life [and] Peace.”
In his study on the morning of April 12, 1939, Stern
handed an airmail letter to Miss Englander.
“Here is something which may require immediate atten-
tion, Frieda. I believe we may have to put aside Washington

Irving's Life of George Washington and devote the rest of
your time to the life of Haym Salomon.”
“Do you want me to read this letter now?”
“Yes. Let's go over it slowly.”
“It's from the Patriotic Foundation of Chicago and is signed
by Barnet Hodes, as co-chairman. Do you want me to read
the entire letter or just a paragraph here and there?”
“I think we should read it all to be sure we know exactly
what is wanted.”
“On Sunday, May 21st,” she read, “a great evening of
patriotism will be held in Chicago, the occasion being a din-
ner posthumously honoring Haym Salomon. This dinner is
sponsored by the Patriotic Foundation, which is erecting in
Chicago the late Lorado Taft monument showing Haym
Salomon with George Washington and Robert Morris.
“The dinner will be featured by a preview of portions of
the finished monument, by the world premiere of the Warner
Brothers' motion picture based on the life of Salomon en-
titled ‘Sons of Liberty,’ and by addresses to be delivered by
Outstanding representatives of all creeds. Arrangements have
been made for a national broadcast. The plan is to have an
outstanding representative of the Catholic church, of the
Protestant faith, and of the Jewish faith.
“Your name has been suggested as a representative of
American Jewry at the dinner. In my capacity as co-chair-
man of the Patriotic Foundation, I am happy to extend to
you now, by this means, an invitation to make an address at
the dinner and to be one of our guests of honor.
“That you may know more about the activities of the
Foundation, I am enclosing a set of literature which was pre-
pared in connection with the fund raising for the Lorado
Taft monument. . . .”
“This means a speech, Frieda, and an address of this kind
entails considerable research.”
“Isn't it strange, Milton, that nowhere did we come upon
Haym Salomon's name while we were going through Irving's

Life of Washington? It seems to me if Salomon played such
a crucial part in the American Revolution, as I gather from
the enclosed literature, his name would appear somewhere in
the pages of these four volumes of Washington Irving's
biography.”
“In the autumn of 1920, at the Hebrew Union College,
Professor Gotthard Deutsch of the History Department turned
over a few notes to me and directed me to write a report on
Haym Salomon as an American patriot. At that time the
name of Haym Salomon was as strange to me as it is now to
you, Frieda.”
“Did Dr. Deutsch's notes help very much?”
“They were as helpful as a single bone is to an anthro-
pologist in reconstructing a dinosaur.”
“Then how did you get your material?”
“In several ways. I wrote to my very good friend, Harry
Harrison, a high school history teacher in Brooklyn. By a
curious coincidence, a play, The Unwritten Chapter, was
then on Broadway, presenting in heroic style the dramatic
career of Haym Salomon. The actor, Louis Mann, whom I
had met a year before backstage in Shipman and Hoffman's
Friendly Enemies, starred in the role of Haym Salomon.
“My friend Harrison wrote letters to Louis Mann and to
Samuel Shipman, the playwright. At the same time I sent a
telegram to A. H. Woods, the producer of The Unwritten
Chapter.
At Stern's direction, Miss Englander brought out the letters
from Mann, Shipman, and Woods.
“I am happy herewith to give you the necessary data you ask
for,” began the communication from Louis Mann.
“First of all, I acted Haym Salomon because I believed in
altruism and that belated justice should be done to an idealist
who was a great Jew and a great American.
“Both from a literary and a dramatic standpoint, it was the
best thing I had done. Its construction was infinitely better than
any play I have produced. From a literary standpoint, it had

better values in epigrammatic lines, the projection of historic
values, and a great human touch that plumbed the depths.
“The great and valuable experience that was mine, and was of
special interest during the rehearsals and the acting of the play
outside of New York, was to see Mr. Shipman reconstruct and
rewrite an entirely new first act. This was a remarkable achieve-
ment, though most onerous upon the player people.
“The play was unfortunately withdrawn, not because, as I
think, it was a failure, but by reason of sordid management, with
whom both the author and myself differed before we came into
New York, and who had the booking rights to the theatre and
saw an opportunity of making more money by selling those
rights, and hence withdrew the play for the reason that he saw
more immediate pelf than waiting for the future. And so a
grave injustice was done, not only to the memory of a great
patriot, but to the best interests of the theatre. . . .”
“That's quite a blunt statement from Mr. Mann. Now
let's try Mr. Shipman's letter, Frieda.”
“We wrote the play,” Shipman stated, “because Haym Salo-
mon is to my mind one of the noblest figures in American his-
tory. He is also one of the most dramatic figures.
“. . . because we wanted to show that the Jews have made
great sacrifices at a time when America's liberties were at stake,
and that they helped to lay the foundation of this country.
“The play was withdrawn because of a sudden breach between
Mr. Mann and Mr. Woods. Differences arose as to certain lines
which Mr. Mann wanted to read and which Mr. Woods wanted
omitted.
“While we did fairly good business, the play was not supported
by the Gentiles. Ninety per cent of the patronage was Jewish.
It seemed to us that the Christians disliked to learn that the Jews
helped to finance the American Revolution. Apparently there
is plenty of prejudice in this country that is under cover and
shows itself at the first opportunity. This fact alone proves that
such a play was necessary. However, had the Jews themselves
come to our help, we would have been able to run the play, but
they didn't.
“They claimed that we showed the Jew in too good a light.
In other words, the Jews hate to hear themselves extolled. They
have been so accustomed to hearing themselves decried that they
took offense to praise.

“All references relating to the life of Haym Salomon can be
obtained from the Congressional records which are open to the
public, also in Jewish Encyclopedias, and from various speeches
made by some of our statesmen, such as Taft; also from the
diary of Robert Morris, and from a little book by Rev. Dr.
Madison Peters. . . .”
“Mr. Woods’ reply to your telegram is laconic, Milton. He
states that the play, The Unwritten Chapter, with Mr. Mann,
opened the week of September 27th at the Woods Theatre,
Atlantic City, N. J.; the week of October 4th at the Belasco
Theatre, Washington, D.C.; and that it opened at the Astor
Theatre, New York City, October 11th, and closed there on
November 6th.”
“All this is fascinating, Milton. But where did you obtain
more substantial data about Haym Salomon?”
“I kept up a steady stream of correspondence with Nicholas
Longworth, our Congressman from the first district. Mr.
Longworth turned my inquiries over to Mr. H. H. B. Meyer,
Chief Bibliographer of the Library of Congress, from whom
I got a list of about sixteen items—books, pamphlets, and
Sundry articles—on Salomon. Mr. Longworth also sent me
a batch of congressional publications. From these I learned
that Congress, in February, 1893, ordered that a gold medal
be struck off in recognition of services rendered by Haym
Salomon during the Revolutionary War, in consideration of
which the Salomon heirs waived their claims upon the United
States for indemnity.”
“How much money was claimed by the Salomon heirs?”
“Today the figure isn't so staggering—$350,000.”
“Why were the Salomon claims not honored earlier than
1893, more than a hundred and ten years after the victory
at Yorktown?”
“Salomon's vouchers from the government, according to
W. E. Woodward, author of George Washington: The Image
and the Man, were lost by some government official to whom
they had been entrusted for the purpose of verification.”

“I am now looking through the index of Charles and Mary
Beard's The Rise of American Civilization, published as re-
cently as 1927. I find no mention here of Haym Salomon.”
“That is why, no doubt, the Patriotic Foundation of Chi-
cago is unveiling this bronze monument, and also why War-
ner Brothers produced the picture ‘Sons of Liberty.” As for
Robert Morris, who is universally recognized as the financier
of the American Revolution and whose name appears promi-
nently in all American histories, his last days in the country
he served so superbly were far from happy. Because of the
slow development of his large land holdings, Robert Morris
was forced into bankruptcy and spent more than three years
in a debtors’ prison. Haym Salomon may be the unrequited
financial angel of the American Revolution. Yet Robert
Morris' fate is really cause for remorse.”
“What happened to their compatriot, Lieutenant-Colonel
Swan, who helped us liquidate the sum of more than
$2,000,000 which the Continental Congress borrowed from
King Louis XVI of France?”
“That was James Swan, a Boston merchant prince, who
came to this country from Scotland at an early age. He
spent his last thirty years in a debtors’ prison in France
because he refused to pay a commercial judgment which he
thought was unjust.”
“What will be the motif of your Haym Salomon speech?”
“Salomon was in this country scarcely four years when he
plunged into the war for freedom, on the side of the United
States of America. He must have been a man of extraordi-
nary integrity and ability, because the French government
selected him as exchange broker in its financial involvements
with the Thirteen Colonies. My theme will be “The Immi-
grant.” At this very moment, millions of people must be
rescued from the irrepressible sword and war plagues. Only
last month Hitler perfidiously swallowed up Czechoslovakia.”
Stern rose from his chair. He walked over to the filing
cabinet and addressed Frieda Englander as though she were

part of that audience before which he was to stand in Chicago.
“We favor the bringing in of wines and perfumes from
France, Carrara marble from Italy, precision tools from Ger-
many, metals from Russia, silver from China, and gold from
Africa. How, then, dare we deny admittance to the most
precious resources of all nations, the producers of all forms
of wealth, who come not only with their skills and talents,
but also with the ideals of liberty still unquenched in their
Souls?”
“During the most critical part of the American Revolu-
tion,” Stern continued fervidly, “the pages of the Robert
Morris diary contained this ever-recurring entry: “I sent for
Haym Salomon.’ Why plead the cause of the alien? We need
only recall the gifts he brings, the wealth he creates, the
patriotism he revives, the manpower he brings to the nation.
The best reward we can offer Haym Salomon's spirit today
is not to wait until the cry for justice and mercy and hu-
manity reaches Heaven, but to do as Robert Morris did one
hundred fifty years ago: send for the immigrants!”
One month later, Dinah accompanied her brother on the
two-hour American Airlines Flagship flight to Chicago. This
was their second venture in air travel. The first was in the
nature of a ten-minute stunt flight in Omaha, in the spring
of 1925. Traveling at 177 miles per hour, 4,200 feet above
the ground, was still in these days looked upon as hazardous.
But Stern, now a master of agile adaptation to change—
whether on train, boat, bus, or subway, or whether in hotel,
Pullman, or cabin—was enchanted with this new medium for
swift and dramatic shift from city to city. Captain Young
moved down the aisle and surveyed the passengers with a
benign expression. The presence of the hostess was in itself
a brilliant stroke of salesmanship. On train or on steamship,
one rarely encountered a functionary who was not a robust

strength and guarantee of security which the vehicle he
manned avouched to every traveler. But here on this con-

veyance, cruising like a bird along the air waves, was a

The wonder of it all was not that less than half a century
ago all scientists seemed to concur in the conviction that
this winged chariot, the work of the hands of man, was merely
a figment of the wildest hallucinations of non-scientific bicycle
repairmen. The wonder was that so many centuries elapsed
before men invented and perfected this, the most rational of
all forms of transportation, for which neither streams and
rivers need be bridged, nor mountains tunneled, nor trails
and highways enlarged by prodigiously expensive macadam-
ized roadbeds. As in the days of Daniel Boone and his in-
vincible contemporaries, grim-lipped, fierce-voiced men pre-
dominated on the railway trains and subway. But here, in
the will to master the art of aeronautics and to surpass, if
possible, the skill of the eagle and the hummingbird, gentle-
voiced, refined young women accomplished the difficult task
of conquering fear.
The railroad, the telegraph, the steamship, the automobile,
the radio, multiple home electrical appliances, and now this
Chicago-bound American Airlines Flagship, are all signs and
wonders attesting the power of man endowed with a divine
urge to create. Nor will there be an end to such creative
inventions, so long as the inhibitory influence of bureaucratic
government is rigidly limited to its proper task of protecting
equally the life, liberty, and property of each citizen. These
three words—life, liberty, and property—appeared in the
original draft of the Declaration of Independence issued in
July, 1776, and for the enjoyment of life, liberty, and prop-
erty, these three illustrious sons of the Spirit of Liberty—
Washington, Morris, and Salomon—offered their lives, their
fortunes, and their sacred honor.

the window at clouds, earth, and minuscule rivers and towns.
Stewardess Eleanor Rennels made her rounds. Many and
diverse were her offerings: pillow, chewing gum, mints, news-
paper, magazine, aspirin tablets, coffee, adjustment of the
safety belt, and, at lunch time, a repast. Throughout the
trip, Stern continued his reflections.
Washington, Morris, and Salomon were not social workers,
sociologists, professors, emotionally activated humanitarians,
or insensate protagonists of biological purging and racial
“roguing” and restyling. Washington and his co-revolution-
aries were bourgeois, mighty men of wealth. The Harvard
philosopher-historian, John Fiske, had asserted: “It was not
so much that the American people gained an increase of
freedom by their separation from England, as that they kept
the freedom which they had always enjoyed, that freedom
which was the inalienable birth-right of Englishmen, but
which George III had foolishly sought to impair. It was the
most conservative revolution known to history, thoroughly
English in conception from beginning to end. It had no
likeness whatever to the terrible popular convulsion which
soon after took place in France.”
Stern now ran his fingers over the braille copy of his five-
minute ode to Haym Salomon. Every dotted sentiment pro-
voked a spate of relevant data that would confirm and fortify
his utterances. The eight-year-long American Revolution,
“little short of a standing miracle” against so formidable a
power, “through almost every possible suffering and discour-
agement,” was against arbitrary centralization of power,
against government by remote control, and for unobstructed
freedom of trade. To associate the name of Thomas Jefferson,
the chief composer of the Declaration of Independence, with
any Bolshevik-enmeshed school or doctrine is a type of
satanic satire, as though a brewer or distiller would merchan-
dise such names as Carry Nation, William Jennings Bryan,
or Josephus Daniels.

The aristocrat of Monticello, above all things, abhorred
slavery in all its hideous aspects. The founder of the Uni-
versity of Virginia was a devout theist. The third President
of the United States loathed lordship and, perhaps more than
any other public official, despised the military caste. Thomas
Jefferson's acquisition of the stupendous Louisiana Territory
was, in a large measure, motivated by his sincere belief that
the only secure basis of a republic was a body of free, land-
owning, uncollectivized farmers, enjoying the fruits of their
own toil, looking not to the Leader in Washington but to
the sun and rain from heaven and the labor of their own
hands for their support and their independence, acting out
the vision of the prophet Micah that “they shall sit every man
under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make
them afraid.”
The banquet hall at Chicago's Hotel Stevens the evening
of May 21st was effulgent with the forms and faces of about
1,400 of that great city's citizenry who had come to honor
the memory of Haym Salomon, “financier of United States
liberty.” Completed sections of the bronze monument to
Washington, Morris, and Salomon, created by the late Chi-
cago sculptor, Lorado Taft, and to be exhibited later by his
wife, and a flag-draped vacant chair were visible to all the
guests. A military ceremony with patriotic songs formally
opened the meeting and exalted the just pride of patriotism.
The chairman, Corporation Counsel Barnet Hodes, presided
with admirable aplomb. At the speakers’ table were the Most
Rev. Bernard J. Shiel, Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic
Archdiocese of Chicago; the Rev. Duncan H. Browne, Rector
of St. James Episcopal Church; Mrs. Lorado Taft, widow of
the sculptor, who had started work on the new monument
shortly before his death; Gen. Samuel T. Lawton; Postmaster
Ernest J. Kruetgen; Gen. Roy D. Keehne; and Brig. Gen.
John D. Clinnin. Seated to the right of Dinah was the
Honorable Edward J. Kelly, Chicago's mayor, and, next to

him, the Honorable Alben W. Barkley, Senator from Ken-
tucky and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate.
Other notable guests were Margery Meyer of the Chicago
Opera Company and Mark Love of the Chicago City Opera.
In the interstices of table talk, Dinah whispered to her
brother, detail by detail, a delineation of the most publicized
big-city maestro of the Democratic Party. The mayor's con-
versation with the Senate's majority leader was carried on
with a singular degree of restraint. Edward Joseph Kelly was
born in Chicago. He received the LL.D. degree from nearby
Notre Dame University. In physique, he resembled a heavy-
weight boxer. Oddly, his voice, always low-pitched and thin,
was very much like the soft speech of the American cham-
pion among boxers, Jack Dempsey. From the moment the
Sterns shook hands with him at the speakers’ table until they
bade farewell to the mayor before the elevator, there was
never a note of frivolity, never a burst of raucous laughter,
no deviation from the mood of alert, intense awareness of
arduous stewardship. Here was the man who was the corner-
stone of the Democratic Party's seemingly indestructible
political machine. Edward Kelly was the pattern, the matrix,
and the crown of the Franklin D. Roosevelt dynasty. Mayor
Kelly of Chicago represented the inscrutable alliance of old-
fashioned, corrupt ward-politicians with New Deal brain-gods
and the liberal intelligentsia.
In the city of Chicago two out of every five inhabitants
did not speak English in their homes. On the South Side of
the city of Chicago there was an island of nearly half a mil-
lion Negroes, all of whom were under the suffrage-sway of
one man, a vice-chairman of the Democratic National Com-
mittee, and himself a Negro. Many had been wooed away
from the South, where their voting strength was negligible,
to outstrip the numerical strength of the Republican Party in
Cook County. These Negroes augmented the two hundred
square miles of seeming economic and social chaos which
made Michigan Avenue, with her Great Lake eastern sweep

of grandeur and her pile upon pile of industrial edifices and
rows of superb hotels and private dwellings, only picturesque
drapery.
In this immensity of industry, among these millions of
brave, sanguine, intellectually and spiritually animated, pro-
digiously productive and racially commingled people, where
moral delinquents and degenerates were as rampant as roguish
elephants and buffaloes in a jungle, Mayor Edward Kelly was
President Franklin Roosevelt's loyal satrap and cherished
political counselor. For the crux of the Democratic Party's
election operations was to maintain a firm and absolutely
trustworthy reliance upon the Negro and other heterogeneous,
racial elements who could be bribed with timely preferential
treatment and whose news organs were under the control of
cunning propagandists with headquarters at the Executive
Mansion in the national capital.
The Senate's Majority Leader, Alben William Barkley, was
President Roosevelt's adroit right arm in the United States
Senate. He was the son of a Kentucky tenant farmer. Senator
Barkley's surge to political eminence paralleled the robust,
romantic career of Chicago's stalwart chief executive. Bark-
ley and Kelly were virile, rugged individualists. In the realm
of political action they plied their trade and sold their wares
in accordance with the whims and wants of the man with the
ballot. Ideals, ideologies, slogans, reforms, social blueprints,
emotions, prejudices, alien antipathies, and foreign fanati-
cisms were like nostrums in the pharmacist's cabinets, to be
sold but scarcely to be touched by the sagacious and prag-
matic practitioner of the art and science of winning elections.
As Stern watched and listened, it was clear that the re-
porters and the others who greeted the Senate Majority
Leader were concerned not with the past, not with Washing-
ton, Morris and Salomon, but with the clamorous present,
with Adolf Hitler. But Senator Barkley was imperturbable.
He responded to inquiries with Jovian calm. With an air of
insouciance, he distributed copies of his radio oration to the

pressmen and posed for the photographers. By the sincerity,
warmth, and naturalness of his speech, the Senator infused
good will and confidence into the hearts of his auditors, many
of whom, no doubt, were members of the opposition party.
As Senator Barkley mechanically tossed aside page after page
of his oration, it was inconceivable that such men as Barkley
and Kelly could be identified with the Moscow mercenaries
in the Democratic Party seeking to divide the nation into two
classes. As he stood before this audience composed of men
and women of culture and of high social and economic posi-
tion, it was incredible that the son of a Kentucky tenant
farmer and a prodigy of a great city's public school system
would despair of that process of social mobility which held
out to every Pole, Italian, Negro, Jew, Catholic, and Protes-
tant unsurpassed opportunities to follow in their footsteps
and to emulate, through like merit and probity, their spec-
tacular attainment of power, fame, and, no doubt, also a
place with the aristocracy of the mighty men of wealth.
Could it be that the astute Senator from Kentucky was
altogether unaware of the many malodorous manifestations
of the blatant Bolshevik invasion of the national capital?
On this night of sober revaluation and regeneration of patriot-
ism, was it possible that the majority leader of the United
States Senate was unmoved by George Washington's per-
petually cogent admonition that sympathy for the favorite
nation “gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens
(who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to
betray or sacrifice the interest of their own country without
odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding with the
appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commend-
able deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for
public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition,
corruption, or infatuation.”
That night, Rabbi Milton Stern could not sleep.

April 26, 1939
The Honorable Lister Hill
The Senate
Washington, D. C.
Dear Senator:
This afternoon I completed a careful reading of Grover
Hall’s “The Egregious Gentile Called to Account,” which you
incorporated into the official records of January 17, 1939.
I am sure our Jewish fellow countrymen will register your
name in their memories with admiration and gratitude. So
far as I am able to learn, this Grover Hall editorial has been
widely distributed among our Jewish clergymen and Jewish
communal leaders. Undoubtedly it will be read by hundreds
of thousands of sensitive spirits whose love of federation is
exceeded only by their Faith in the Supreme Spirit of the
Universe.
Grover Hall has produced a masterpiece of literary artis-
try. “The Egregious Gentile Called to Account” is more than
a plea for good sportsmanship. Grover Hall has issued a
challenge to Christian men and women with which they
needs must grapple if the soul of America—as well as the
spirit of Christianity—is to be preserved. For in the para-
graphs of “The Egregious Gentile Called to Account” there
is no sentimentality, no cynicism. There is a profound un-
derstanding and presentation of economic, psychologic and
historic argument set forth with superb irony.
Very personally and very sincerely I am glad you under-
took the broadcasting of Grover Hall's editorial. I think you

know why I feel this way about it. Ever since we met you
and Mrs. Hill in Europe, we found ourselves drawing close
to you in respect and in enthusiasm for your public service.
What you are doing in collaboration with Mr. Hall gives us
the right to believe that we have won your esteem as well.
Some weeks ago I read a short article about a Southern
lawyer who never lost an appeal for clemency because he
always referred to his clients as Bill Jones or Tom Brown.
Juries, he claimed, will convict clients or defendants—never
Tom Browns or Bill Joneses. So it must be with all of us.
Life would be sweeter and fewer men would be brutes were
they to think of their neighbors not as Jews or Christians,
Republicans or Democrats, but as Lister Hill, Al Ragor,
Father O’Connor, and Milt Stern.
. . . . May I have the privilege to remain,
Cordially yours,

My dear Milt:
I am just in receipt of your letter of the 26th. . . .
I am proud of your letter and I am particularly proud of
what you say about the editorial of my good friend, Grover
Hall. He is a wonderful man and a gallant writer. I shall
send your letter to him and tell him of you and Mrs. Stern,
our visit to Europe, your soul-stirring prayers, etc. I hope
some day you and Mr. Hall may know one another. You
would find him a kindred spirit. You might be interested to
know that he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize some years ago
for his magnificent editorials against the Ku Klux Klan. He
is one of these fellows who makes you feel proud of your
country. He battles in the good cause.

If you or Mrs. Stern should be in Washington at any time,

Mr. John D. Rockefeller
Riverside Church
New York City
Dear Mr. Rockefeller:
Thank you very much for sending me a reprint of Dr.
Fosdick's sermon, “Dare We Break the Vicious Circle of
Fighting Evil with Evil?”
I should like to help you advance the program sketched
by Dr. Fosdick with every means at my command.
With your indulgence, I shall comment upon certain pas-
sages in the sermon. As a veteran of the World War, I am
particularly interested in Dr. Fosdick's bitter words regarding
our participation. Said Dr. Fosdick: “So we woke up to find
the world less safe for democracy than it had been in genera-
tions.” This confession of disillusionment expresses a com-
mon sentiment.
But for me this is not the whole story. The World War,
with all its evil and with all its terrible destruction of human
life and wealth, has not left mankind without some corre-
spondingly great gains. Foremost among these is the very
thing Dr. Fosdick advocates: “So one may pray and work
for an ultimate international community in which the collec-
tive security of all is the aim of all. . . .” The World War
did for the nations of Europe and North America—and per-
haps also for Asia—precisely that which the Civil War
achieved for our Republic. Thus in Volume II, pages 543

and 544, of Grant's Personal Memoirs (Webster, 1886), we
find this remarkable passage: “In the early days of the coun-
try, before we had railroads, telegraphs and steamboats—in
a word, rapid transit of any sort—the States were each almost
a separate nationality. At that time the subject of slavery
caused but little or no disturbance to the public mind. But
the country grew, rapid transit was established, and trade and
commerce between the States got to be much greater than
before, so that the power of the National government became
more felt and recognized and, therefore, had to be enlisted
in the cause of this institution.
“It is probably well that we had the war when we did. We
are better off now than we would have been without it, and
have made more rapid progress than we otherwise should
have made. The civilized nations of Europe have been stimu-
lated into unusual activity, so that commerce, trade, travel,
and thorough acquaintance among people of different na-
tionalities has become common; whereas, before, it was but
the few who had ever had the privilege of going beyond the
limits of their own country or who knew anything about
other people. Then, too, our Republican institutions were
regarded as experiments up to the breaking out of the re-
bellion, and monarchial Europe generally believed that our
republic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the
slightest strain was brought upon it. Now it has shown itself
capable of dealing with one of the greatest wars that was
ever made, and our people have proven themselves to be the
most formidable in war of any nationality.
“But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the
necessity of avoiding wars in the future.”
May we not think of the World War as a civil war? And
may we not believe that the radio, the telephone, and the
airplane have wrought the same changes in our attitudes as
did the telegraph and railroad in the days of Lincoln and
Grant—on an international scale? Only a casual glance at
the daily headlines of our newspapers should persuade us


## p. 237 (#269) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 237
that what takes place in China or in Germany is as important
to the average American as are the happenings in his own
city. This was not so before 1917.
Why, then, can't we say that what Dr. Fosdick pleads for
is something that actually exists? All that is needed is an
acknowledgment of its existence. We need not “pray and
work for an ultimate international community in which the
collective security of all is the aim of all.” In practically
every sphere of human activity, the “international community”
is a reality.
The World War made it possible for millions of men to
travel and to cultivate and to develop a new, a broader, a
truly cosmopolitan attitude. This, in turn, fostered commerce
and trade on a vaster scale. It encouraged the extension of
radio and aviation to all parts of the world. What we need
to pray and work for is a better understanding of the mean-
ing of such a great change, its responsibilities, its call for
tremendous sacrifice of national, chauvinistic prejudices upon
the altar of universal brotherhood and world fellowship.
There is but one impediment—political provincialism.
Dr. Fosdick is a religionist. He has produced convincing
spiritual evidence to substantiate his appeal for an “interna-
tional community.” At random, I select statements from
three different types of thinkers: a social philosopher, a
statesman, and a scientist. The similarity of thought is in-
escapable, inspiring.
The first, Henry George, writing in his Protection or Free
Trade (1886; Schalkenbach edition, 1935), pages 31-32,
StateS:
“Religion and experience alike teach us that the highest
good of each is to be sought in the good of others; that the
true interests of men are harmonious, not antagonistic; that
prosperity is the daughter of good will and peace; and that
want and destruction follow enmity and strife. The protec-
tive theory, on the other hand, implies the opposition of
national interests; that the gain of one people is the loss of


## p. 238 (#270) ############################################

238 *es R E D POT TA GE
others; that each must seek its own good by constant efforts
to get advantage over others and to prevent others from get-
ting advantage over it. It makes of nations rivals instead of
cooperators; it inculcates a warfare of restrictions and pro-
hibitions and searchings and seizures, which differs in weap-
ons, but not in spirit, from the warfare which sinks ships and
burns cities. Can we imagine the nations beating their swords
into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and yet
maintaining hostile tariffs?
“No matter whether he call himself Christian or Deist, or
Agnostic or Atheist, who can look about him without seeing
that want and suffering flow inevitably from selfishness, and
that in any community the golden rule which teaches us to
regard the interests of others as carefully as our own would
bring not only peace but plenty? Can it be that what is true
of individuals ceases to be true of nations—that in one
sphere the law of prosperity is the law of love; in the other,
that of Strife?”
In a letter dated August 22, 1935, Viscount Philip Snow-
den wrote in part as follows: “At the time I write, Europe is
trembling on the brink of an Imperialist War, the magnitude
and consequences of which no man can calculate. The root
cause of this impending conflict is land acquisition for the
purpose of alien exploitation. All the diabolical machinery
of modern warfare is to be employed to crush the independ-
ence of a defenseless State and to appropriate its land.
“In its saner moments every country admits the ruin which
is being inflicted on world trade by Protection and other
methods of artificially creating hindrances to the free flow of
commerce; but selfish interests and a perverted nationalism
keep the nations in economic bondage.
“Permanent Peace can only be established when men and
nations have realized that natural resources should be a com-
mon heritage, and used for the good of all mankind. It is to
inculcate this fundamental truth that your Congress (the
Henry George Congress, New York City, 1935) is meeting,


## p. 239 (#271) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 2-57" 239
and I hope the day is not far distant when it will be uni-
versally appreciated; and then will be the age of Freedom
based on Eternal Justice.”
Said Dr. Arthur H. Compton, in an address delivered in
New York City, in November, 1938: “Twenty thousand
years ago the family was the social unit. The social unit has
now become the world, in which it may be fairly said that
each person's welfare affects that of every other. In such a
civilization, the importance of good will among men becomes
a matter of unprecedented urgency. If such good will is
absent, as men become more dependent upon each other, we
can only expect more violent strife. Hostilities pile up be-
tween nations and nations, business and government, labor
and capital, union and union. The need for mutual respect
and consideration, both among individuals and organized
groups, has become so evident that only those who will be
blind can fail to see it. With wars and threats of wars all
around us, it has become literally a matter of life and death
that men shall become inspired with the spirit of fellowship.”
And in order to demonstrate the fitness of Dr. Fosdick's
appeal from the standpoint of political philosophy, I include
these lines from Spinoza (Tractatus Theologico-Politicus,
1670): “The last end of the state is not to dominate men,
nor to restrain them by fear; rather it is so to free each man
from fear that he may live and act with full security and
without injury to himself or his neighbor. The end of the
state, I repeat, is not to make rational beings into brute beasts
and machines. It is to enable their bodies and their minds
to function safely. It is to lead men to live by, and to exer-
cise a free reason; that they might not waste their strength
in hatred, anger, and guile, nor act unfairly toward one an-
other. Thus the end of the state is really liberty.”
The very latest, the most timely suggestion toward the
vision of an “international community” is to be found in
Clarence Streit's book Union Now. What he proposes, how-
ever, is as dangerous as it is forward-looking. It is dangerous


## p. 240 (#272) ############################################

240 *S R E D POT TA GE
because it stops with the inclusion of fifteen nations. It is
dangerous also because it advocates the merging of sovereign
nationalities into a kind of loose republic.
Only three comparatively simple steps are required toward
the attainment of an “international community.” These steps
are sound from the point of view of political economy. They
are expedient. They have been widely discussed for many
years. They are in harmony with the fundamental principles
of political philosophy. The first is free trade among all
nations; the second, a universal monetary system; the third,
the revival of the World Court at The Hague, clothed with
power and means to enforce decisions.
Again, with many thanks for the Fosdick sermon, I am,
Respectfully,
Rabbi Milton Stern

CHAPTER XXIII
SUNSET AND A STAR
in Cincinnati sixteen years earlier and had consisted
of one household and six souls, had increased to three
households and twelve souls. Rabbi Stern's family circle in-
cluded two daughters, Ruth and Alice, his wife Leah, his
sister Dinah, and now his son David, born eight months
before. Because of the fiendishly stepped up program of syna-
gogue burning and mass expulsion and spoliation of Jews on
the part of Hitler and his zombies, the rabbi's home had been
enriched by the installation of seventeen-year-old Hannah
Eisner as maid at the then munificent weekly wage of nine
dollars.
Hannah and her brother had lived in a town near Munich.
Their father and mother followed them to Cincinnati soon
after the younger refugees had been well established in that
city. Within the first year of her service to the Stern family,
Hannah proudly had taught Ruth the words and the music
of “America” and “The Star Spangled Banner” during the
time that she herself was acquiring some facility in the use
of the new language.
The burgeoning of the family and the ever-increasing
menace of automobile traffic on Forest Avenue, an Avondale
arterial highway, impelled a change in residence and the
building of a new home in Roselawn, a suburb on the north-
ern corporation boundary of Cincinnati. For the most part,
this portion of Roselawn, five miles beyond Avondale and
nearly ten miles from Fountain Square in downtown Cincin-
nati, was still devoted to pasture land and, in a few instances,
to the large-scale and intensive cultivation of cabbage.
9| N August, 1939, the Stern family, which had settled

It was anticipated that after three months of uninterrupted
labor the new home would be ready for occupancy about the
latter part of September. In the spring there had been pre-
liminary concentration on and discussion of bricks, tiles, elec-
trical fixtures, plumbing, plastering, painting, wallpaper, roof,
furnace, landscaping, garage, the rabbi's study, fireplace,
porch, screening, casement windows, kitchen cabinets, door-
bell, and telephone booth. Stern was keenly interested in
every detail in the process of rearing up a modern residence
complete with almost every known household convenience,
many of which, like thermostatically controlled central gas
heating, instantaneous hot water heater, electric refrigerator,
insulation, and, of course, radio, were scarcely within the
reach of even the very wealthy homeowner when Stern, as a
divinity student, rented a tiny room in Cincinnati less than
a quarter of a century before.
With the advent of the summer of 1939 Stern had rounded
out five years of continuous labor with the Cincinnati branch
of the Henry George School of Social Science, as administra-
tor and teacher. In the autumn of 1938 and in the spring of
1939, Stern's textbook was Henry George's last and uncom-
pleted work, Science of Political Economy, which George
had dedicated to August Lewis, a Jewish friend and one of
his most faithful supporters during his lifetime. The rabbi's
work with the old and the new adherents of America's per-
haps greatest social philosopher had proved immeasurably
profitable, mentally and spiritually, though scarcely so finan-
cially. The writings of this “forgotten man of Anglo-American
civilization” were edifying and enthralling. They set up
standards of thought and expression that were imperious and
irresistible. It was as though Milton Stern were as intimately
associated with the great teacher, walking with him daily and
bowing his ear to him reverently, as it must have been when
Plato and Socrates carried on their dialogues centuries ago.
So Rabbi Stern was overjoyed when Anna George de Mille,
daughter of America's prophet of Liberty, wrote in April and

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 243
asked him to serve as a member of the Honorary Committee
for the proposed August-September International Conference
in New York City, commemorating the centenary of her
father's birth. Affiliated with Rabbi Stern on this centennial
honorary committee were talismanic names, bright jewels in
the treasury of the contemporary history of the United States
of America. These were names which could not be tarnished
by the breath of cynic or doubter, even though educator and
politician and journalist might turn a deaf ear to the name
and the doctrines of the bearded, titleless, academically
spurned, Philadelphia-born Christian seeker after truth and
classic Law-Revealer. For on that Honorary Committee's
list were the names of Harry Gunnison Brown, Harold S.
Buttenheim, John Dewey, Albert Einstein, John Erskine,
Harry Emerson Fosdick, William Lloyd Garrison, Frederic
C. Howe, Arthur Krock, Susanne LaFollette, Walter Lipp-
mann, Walter Mendelson, Broadus Mitchell, Albert Jay Nock,
Charles G. Norris, Kathleen Norris, Eugene O'Neill, Amos
Pinchot, David de Sola Pool, Alice Thacher Post, John A.
Ryan, William Jay Schieffelin, Samuel Seabury, Ralph W.
Sockman, Solomon Solis-Cohen, Frank H. Sommer, Ida M.
Tarbell, Dorothy Thompson, Lawrence Tibbett, Lillian D.
Wald, Harry Weinberger, Franklin H. Wentworth; Lawson
Purdy, Chairman; and Frederic C. Leubuscher, Secretary.
With slight shades of difference in time and circumstance,
the career of each of these in the constellation of the great
was affected, no doubt, by the spirit of Henry George, as was
that of George Bernard Shaw, who wrote: “I went one
night quite casually into a hall in London, and heard a man
deliver a speech which changed the whole current of my life.
That man was Henry George.”
But one month later Milton Stern was once again face to
face with a sorely perplexing predicament. It arose from the
invitation to deliver the principal Henry George Centennial
address at the Commodore Hotel in New York City on the
evening of Wednesday, August 30th. Whatever time might

be required toward the preparation of a twenty-five-minute,
three-thousand-word oration could be found and the accom-
panying travail could be endured, though time was precious
and the same labor could be put to more personal advantage.
Yet neither time nor strenuous exertion was a decisive de-
terrent. The problem was whether money could be spared
for the four- or five-day trip to New York City. All the five
years of labor for the Henry George School had been purely
voluntary. There was never a suggestion of reimbursement,
never a thought of even an honorarium for professional serv-
ices. Payment for the new residence would snare away every
dollar in the bank and a large portion of savings in other
forms. This was not the most propitious occasion for a gen-
erous financial sacrifice for half an hour's appearance at a
meeting more than seven hundred miles away from home.
After considerable and lively exchanges of opinions and pro-
posals, a way was charted. Stern accepted the invitation
extended by the executive secretary of the Henry George
Centenary Committee. At the same time he informed Mr.
Mac Edds, the secretary, that the subject of his address would
be “Farewell to Magic”; that he would travel by car to New
York City with his brother.
Sidney Stern, senior student at the University of Cincinnati
College of Medicine and now twenty-four years old, accepted
his brother's call to service. He, too, could hardly spare the
time. A fourteen-hundred-mile trip behind the steering wheel
would be a severe strain because, in late August, he was sub-
ject to attacks of hay fever which usually robbed him of sleep
and rendered him physically and mentally unfit for such a
task as long-distance driving. Nevertheless, Sidney assured
the rabbi that he would undertake the journey, hoping that
there would be no violent outbreaks of the disagreeable mal-
ady while they were on the road.
Neither Leah nor Dinah had any misgivings concerning
Sidney's qualifications and trustworthiness, though seven
years before the brothers had experienced the ordeal of an

automobile mishap in which neither of them, however, had
been even scratched. All who knew Sidney Stern accorded
him remarkable respect. Sidney was well formed. His speech
was manly. His voice was pleasant. In the company of his
brother, the rabbi, he assumed most naturally the position
of an alert, loyal, and devoted subaltern.
Sidney Stern's choice of the medical profession was made
early in his elementary school days. He never deviated from
that decision. While an undergraduate student at the uni-
versity, he followed his brother's interest in the science of
political economy with enthusiasm, and contributed what-
ever knowledge he acquired as a student of economics to the
classroom discussion of the teachings of Henry George. He
was Milton's constant source of strength. The rabbi was sure
that, wherever they appeared, Sidney would win the respect
and the admiration of all who saw them together.
With all his manliness, with all his fidelity and high sense
of duty, with all his veneration for the traditions and history
of his country, Sidney Stern was not disposed to experience
the military adventures of his brother. Sidney had decided
that he would become a surgeon and a specialist in ophthal-
mology. His aspiration was to restore to use for many “that
one talent which is death to hide.”
George Warriner Hughes, the third member of their party,
born in England more than sixty years before, was the father
of nine children. He was a member of the Church of The
New Jerusalem, a Swedenborgian congregation. The pastor
of this theological Society was also an earnest student and
advocate of the Single Tax program. Hughes had enrolled
in the first Henry George class in 1935, and had rendered
yeoman service to the Cincinnati organization both as or-
ganizer and as part-time instructor. Although he was defi-
cient in systematic scholastic training, Hughes was scarcely
one to be overawed by any display of university-acquired
wisdom. Hughes's training and long-time experience had
been as a traveling salesman, and he was, therefore, too

shrewd to be silenced by well polished phrases and argu-
ments. Even with his associates in the Henry George move-
ment, George Warriner Hughes was wary and skeptical,
dubious that the program set forth by Henry George would
find a ready acceptance either in legislative halls or in acade-
mies of learning.
The eastward journey on Monday, August 28th, began
tardily, almost at noontime. There was some anxiety as to
whether or not the automobile's defective accelerator would
require a skilled mechanic's attention before the trip was con-
cluded. There was also that giant-sized box of paper hand-
kerchiefs on the seat at Sidney's elbow, indicating that the
chauffeur would always be shifting his thoughts from the
road to the box on the seat, and that he would be in constant
misery. Sidney had had little sleep. But the sun was bright
and warm and George Hughes's conversation was scintillat-
ing. He was bent upon making a holiday of this motor ride
to the great city, by way of Washington and Baltimore,
through the historic Shenandoah Valley, the mountain-regal
states of West Virginia and Virginia. Sidney participated but
little in the conversation. Night fell as the car ascended and
rolled along the mountains of West Virginia. Sidney had
little time to gaze to the right hand or to the left, to share
with Hughes the ethereal beauty of these starlit scenes. Be-
fore and behind the car there were monster trucks creeping
and chugging doggedly along and spreading themselves across
the entire width, so it seemed, of the mountain road. It was
close to midnight when they reached a hotel at Winchester,
Virginia.
The early morning ride from Winchester eastward to the
national capital was a repetition of the previous day's excur-
sion, during which Hughes and occasionally Sidney reported
what they saw vividly and frequently with enraptured excite-
ment. Milton Stern's seemingly thousand ears took in every-
thing, and everything they related so graphically was registered
in his memory, as though George Hughes and Sidney were

talking into a wire recording machine. The narration from
Winchester to Washington was doubly fascinating. It seemed
as though there was not one turn on the road without some
historic connotation. There were markers everywhere. So
much of what Milton Stern had only recently read about in
the small volume of General Robert E. Lee's letters and in
the four volumes of Washington Irving's unsurpassed life of
George Washington now had verification and quickening
form. Whenever they parked the car and paused to view an
unusual picture of mountain, valley, stream, and wood, Mil-
ton Stern felt as though he were surrounded by the reanimated
spirits of the men of renown whose love for this portion of
the good earth was so great that even in death they could not
be uprooted from it. This was their paradise, and they
wanted no other heaven.
Here in Virginia, Stern recalled, General Robert E. Lee
had reflected as he, too, rode along these same mountain
roads: “The views are magnificent—the valleys so beautiful,
the scenery so peaceful. What a glorious world Almighty
God has given us. How thankless and ungrateful we are, and
how we labor to mar His gifts.”
Here in Virginia, in May, 1864, at Yellow Tavern, six
miles from Richmond, her beleaguered capital, General Rob-
ert E. Lee's incomparable Chief of Cavalry, General James
E. B. Stuart, was mortally wounded. Rabbi Stern turned
toward his brother, whose eyes could never be diverted from
the road ahead and whose lips were sealed with a deep sense
of responsibility. How apt were the words attributed to Lee
in spontaneous tribute to Stuart, when applied to Sidney:
“He never brought me a piece of false information.”
Shortly before the noon hour, Tuesday, August 29th, the
three travelers rode slowly along Pennsylvania Avenue and
the other famous arteries of the country's political capital.
Sidney and George Hughes were content to gaze momentarily
upon the Capitol, the Executive Mansion, and the Library of
Congress. For Milton Stern, the massive library was the

visible architectural affirmation of the intellectual and cul-
tural grandeur and majesty of the republic.
In Baltimore, as in Washington, all seemed to be quiet on
the thickly populated western side of Chesapeake Bay. North-
ward through the states of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New
Jersey the motor traffic was heavy, and yet everywhere, as in
Washington and Baltimore, peace and prosperity prevailed.
Sidney was perceptibly plagued by fatigue and hay fever
when the automobile thundered furiously through the vehicu-
lar tunnel under the Hudson River and, by a quirk of mis-
calculation, he found himself immeshed in the labyrinth of
Manhattan's Chinatown. It was after midnight when Milton
and Sidney wearily followed the clerk up to their room at
the Hotel President. Sidney would have flung himself upon
the bed as soon as the clerk left them, but the linen, among
other things, was not acceptable. Sidney telephoned and the
hotel manager appeared. His apologies were almost mechani-
cal. This was not the New York City hotel service to which
the rabbi had been accustomed. Was there something astir
in the great city? Why all the confusion? On all previous
occasions, New York City presented an atmosphere of almost
towering tranquility above the millionfold facets of human
life and awesome, human industry.
Perhaps it was Grover C. Whalen's World Fair at Flush-
ing Meadows, Long Island, that made hotel rooms and hotel
service in upper Manhattan startlingly uninviting and hotel
servitors so slipshod. But there had been other fairs, the one
in Chicago in 1933 and another in Paris in 1937. However,
in those years and in their time, neither Paris nor Chicago
was seething, in a state of community hypertension. The men
and the women whom they met at radio station WHON,
which specialized in the broadcast of foreign-language pro-
grams, and the delegates to the Henry George International
Conference were unlike those whom they had met in this
same city four years earlier. Why was everyone shouting?
Why the great urgency?

R E D POT TA GE 25" 249
Rabbi Stern's extemporaneous radio appeal over Station
WHON for world peace and universal justice was warmly
endorsed by the coterie which had escorted him to the broad-
casting station, among them Frank Chodorov, editor of The
Freeman Magazine and director of the Henry George School
of Social Science; Wiss Lissner, of the New York Times; and
Lancaster Greene, Quaker broker and outstanding trustee of
the New York School.
“Milt,” Sidney blurted, almost grumpily, as they walked
back to their hotel, “I don't like some of those people whom
we met at the radio station, those New York Single Taxers.
I don’t like the way they talk so hysterically about freedom.
It sounds too much like college sophomores gone berserk.
Our men in Cincinnati don't act that way.”
“I agree with you. I wish they would all stick to the Single
Tax program as laid down so simply and clearly by Henry
George in his Progress and Poverty. When he was alive and
lived in this city, Sidney, Henry George had his hands full
trying to straighten out those people who thought that by
breaking bottles, thus presumably providing more work for
glass artisans, they were thereby his dedicated disciples.”
“I don’t want you to think that Frank Chodorov, Lancas-
ter Greene, and Will Lissner made the same sort of impres-
sion on me, Milt. These three seem to be standing on more
solid ground.”
“I think that Clarence Streit and his ‘Union Now’ theories
have inveigled many of our good people away from the basic
principles of political economy and led them into the swamps
of emotional humanitarianism.” -
Following a tour of the school building at 30 East 29th
Street, a commodious, remodeled telephone exchange off
Fifth Avenue and near the Empire State Building, Rabbi
Stern conferred with Frank Chodorov in the latter's office.
They were wrestling with the question of how Stern would
be able to broadcast from Cincinnati's radio station WLW
booth at the World's Fair grounds on Long Island and how

later he would deliver his scheduled address at the Commo-
dore Hotel at eight o'clock that evening of Wednesday, Au-
gust 30th. When a satisfactory solution had been evolved,
Chodorov called his secretary, Helen McCarthy, and asked
her to prepare biographical material to be used for the radio
broadcast and also to send a telegram to the rabbi's sister in
Cincinnati apprising her of the hour for the broadcast.
Half an hour later, as Sidney and Milton were about to
step out of the building, Miss McCarthy ran toward them
and asked them please to return to Mr. Chodorov's office.
“Rabbi,” Chodorov began, almost sheepishly, “I had to
ask Miss McCarthy not to send that telegram to your sister
in Cincinnati. It now looks as though all our work in this
office was a waste of time. The Cincinnati broadcasting com-
pany and the National Broadcasting System, over which you
were to speak later, telephoned and informed us that they
were, for some mysterious reason, forced to cancel all pro-
grams. They claimed that something terribly big is going to
break sometime today and they must therefore keep all radio
channels open.”
Neither Milton nor Sidney could offer an explanation for
this astonishing and most erratic cancellation of radio pro-
grams. Where would that big news originate? From the
White House in Washington? From some European capital?
To be sure, in the United States more millions were on the
Federal relief rolls now than when the Great Depression de-
scended like black night upon this same city ten years before.
But this was no portent of another gargantuan, industrial
paralysis.
At the set time, unruffled and unaffected by the unorthodox
radio experience, Stern took his place at the rostrum and
poured forth these thoughts with vigor and enthusiasm:
“Above all other traits and talents, Henry George was
guided by an intellectual love of action. Whatever hero wor-
ship may be his portion is the reward of his courageous denial
of the powers of demons, deities, or demagogues. Pre-

eminently Henry George believed and trusted in the dignity,
divinity, and democracy of strenuous human labor dictated
by the faculty of Reason.
“What is the best tribute we can pay to the memory of this
Poet-Prophet who ‘combined the analysis of the scientist with
the sympathies and aspirations of a great lover of mankind"?
“What was the predominant passion of Henry George? ‘I
propose,' runs his declaration, “to attempt to solve by the
methods of political economy the great problem I have out-
lined. I propose to seek the law which associates poverty
with progress and increases want with advancing wealth.”
“The thought which must overwhelm us at this centenary
celebration is one which will challenge our faith, our courage,
Our love of truth, and our sincerity. Henry George was not,
could not, be satisfied with the comparatively passive methods
of political economy, merely to seek the law which associates
poverty with progress and increases want with advancing
wealth. His genius demanded dynamic action. Henry George
did not wait for the people to come to him to see the law.
He went out to them. And, because he spoke thus openly to
all the world, without benefit of organization or institution,
his words have gone forth to all the ends of the earth and
there is hardly a place in the world where his name is not
known.
“Only after centuries of tragic conflict has astrology given
way to astronomy; alchemy to chemistry; superstition to
medicine; mythology to monotheism. And only step by step
is the mind of man still painfully being emancipated from
the fetters of magic. There is but one enormously important
field wherein the spell of magic has not been dissipated ac-
cording to scientific criteria. That realm is Political Economy.
“Let us not delude ourselves. It has been too well said
that in the progress upward from savagery men in the same
generation do not march abreast. Though we are surrounded
by the wonders of radio, aviation, and surgery, the supreme
faculty of Reason does not hold sway over the emotions and

actions of all men. And while idols and graven images of
deities are not to be seen in our civilized countries, dema-
gogues and dictators of varying species have supplanted
them as vicarious agents of prosperity and peace.
“Millions of men, women and children, pinched and im-
bruted by poverty and the fear of want, have succumbed to
the same impulse that bewitched the contemporaries of Moses,
Isaiah, and Jeremiah. That impulse has been set down by
Henry George as the fundamental principle of human action.
It is that men will seek to gratify their desires with the least
exertion.
“Men have for hundreds of years cherished the notion that
it is easier to worship nature than work with natural laws.
For them it is easier to resort to incantations and pills than
to sanitation and vigorous exercise. It is easier to consult an
Evangeline Adams than to study Progress and Poverty. It is
easier to vote for a Townsend Plan than to wrestle with a
tax bill. It is easier to denounce Wall Street than to define
the function of money. It is easier to bludgeon a banker than
to balance the public budget. And it is vastly less difficult
to pay lip service to a demagogue than to exercise one's own
intelligence.
“If we are to qualify as men and women worthy to wear
the mantle of Henry George, if we are to complete the work
he has so well begun, if we are to reap the harvest of the
seeds he so wisely has sown, we must first discover that line
of least resistance whereby we can demonstrate to the masses
of our fellow-countrymen the sound and sane way their needs
are to be satisfied. We must prove by every method sanc-
tioned by the canons of science that poverty need no longer
be associated with progress. We must convince men that
conformity with the eternal laws of the universe will provide
plenty for all.
“On every hand, at this very moment, from the lips and
pens of harassed men and women in every walk of life, the

cry goes up to simplify and to reform our multiple modes of
taxation. Anyone whose vision is not curtained by political
prejudice knows there is more magic, deception, misunder-
standing, confusion, injustice, corruption, moral degradation,
waste, destruction of industry and commerce, and denial of
economic opportunity in our present methods of taxation
than in any other element of our political and social structure.
“What is the most vulnerable spot at which we can stand
on common ground with our newly won allies in the cause of
preserving American democracy? The answer lies close at
hand. It has been formulated for us by the practical genius
of the prophet of American liberty. ‘By making use of exist-
ing machinery,’ says Henry George, “we may, without jar or
shock, assert the common right to land by appropriating rent
by taxation. We already take some rent in taxation. We
have only to make some changes in our modes of taxation
to take it all.’”
The storm of applause which rounded out Stern's more
than twenty-five-minute centennial oration did not, however,
draw him from the rostrum. Lancaster Greene called for an
encore. He asked that the rabbi repeat a portion of his morn-
ing's radio broadcast, much of which had been excerpted
from an essay entitled “Tithes and Taxes,” which the rabbi
had prepared at the behest of the centennial committee for
a Jewish press syndicate.
When Stern returned to his brother seated in the rear of
the auditorium, he found Sidney weary and uncomfortable.
There was no word of approbation. Even the walk through
the wondrous caverns of Grand Central Station did not
arouse his admiration. Only the ride back to the hotel in a
taxicab was a boon for Sidney. Scarcely anything in this
miracle city seemed to excite his interest. The names of the
men and women with whom he shook hands made no im-
pression on him. The speeches he heard and Walter Fair-
child's slides evoked no comment. Sidney was listless. He

was exhausted through boredom. The Island of Manhattan,
with all its glamor, grandeur, and leviathan-like spread, was
a dull, drab, and dreary monotony of mass.
The trip westward and homeward by way of Pittsburgh,
Thursday, August 31st, was pleasant but not eventful. George
Warriner Hughes remained in New York City as the sole
delegate representing Cincinnati. The noxious hay fever had
not been exorcised from Sidney's system. For the most part,
there was an absence of that convivial colloquy continuously
stoked by George Hughes's amazing loquacity. Two thoughts
were uppermost in the rabbi's mind. Would the message he
brought to the international gathering of Single Taxers at the
Commodore Hotel help to save the peoples of the world and
especially his own fellow countrymen from tumbling down
the brimstone road to perdition? And, secondly, what was
the nature of that “big news” for which the radio broadcast-
ing officials were waiting? The morning newspapers had a
word or two about the rumor that Hitler might invade Poland.
The foreign minister of Soviet Russia had recently concluded
a nonaggression pact with the Third Reich. Such a move by
Hitler, however, might force the British Empire to declare
war on Germany. Britain had given Poland a guaranty of
mutual assistance in the event of an unprovoked attack by
Germany.
Late that evening they reached Wilkinsburg, on the out-
skirts of Pittsburgh. They registered at the hotel for the
night. Wilkinsburg was the hometown of “Deacon” Bill
McKechnie, the redoubtable manager of the Cincinnati Base-
ball Club. Here was something sentimental which would
appeal to Sidney, whose love of big league baseball was
fanatical.
At the crowded, stuffy, little restaurant across the way,
Sidney eagerly purchased a morning newspaper. His initial
impulse was to turn to the sports section and to ascertain
the results of that day's baseball games. The Cincinnati
“Reds” were very strong contenders for the championship of

R E D POT TA GE 25" 255
the National League. But the excited chatter of the other
patrons, the stentorian, rapid-fire reports coming over the
radio, and the strident cries of the news venders on the street
compelled Sidney to revert to the headlines on the front page.
He read them slowly, questioningly. The words formed a
double streamer headline: “EUROPE HOSTILITIES ON
. . . DANZIG TAKEN . . . POLAND BOMBED!”
A few men stood at the desk in the lobby of the hotel
discussing that event for which the radio broadcasting offi-
cials in New York City had been waiting the previous eve-
ning. Sidney and the rabbi stood by respectfully. They
listened gravely to the exchange of opinions, rumors, and
conjectures.
The rest of the night Sidney did not sleep. He tossed
about on his bed vainly striving to subdue the effects of his
oppressive ailment. Again and again he rose from his bed
and paced up and down in the tiny bedroom. But there was
never a word of complaint from Sidney's lips. He pleaded
with the rabbi to ignore him, if possible, and to get some
sleep. The windows of the room were open wide. The
rhythmic hawking of the newsboys below on the street was
mingled with snatches of an all-too-familiar and prescient
song. Over and over again the two men heard the chant:
“You’re in the Army now! You're in the Army now!”
Fully awake and profoundly aroused, Rabbi Milton Stern
almost moaned as he thought of the impact the news of this
invasion of Poland would have upon his mother. Who could
dissuade her from the belief that Hitler's predatory leap into
Poland, in collusion with Bolshevik Russia, would not mean
intervention on the part of the United States?
And then Stern recalled the frequent occasions when, at
the risk of offending his friends and neighbors, he had
pleaded for a realistic attitude toward war. He thought of
the speech he had prepared for the open-air meeting at Eden
Park in Cincinnati on Memorial Day in the previous year:
“The experiences touching the state of the nation in time of

war and during the early period following the close of the
World War should shake us out of our illusion of security
and sanity. Large numbers of our population still clamor
for a reduction of armaments, for a state of national defense-
lessness. They strive to block every attempt on the part of
our trained military and naval authorities to secure the
requisite material and manpower. Officers of the Army and
Navy speak with timorous and apologetic voices of the bare
essentials as though it were a monstrous crime to mention
the presence of war, its actual, positive, realistic nature. War
is an appalling catastrophe. But Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, the
renowned Protestant clergyman, called it a ‘melancholy
necessity.’
“The inevitable conclusion to be drawn is that war ceases
to assume the aspect or character of a circus, or a community
theatre project which can be planned and prepared for over-
night by the simple expedient of a Presidential message and
followed by an act of Congress.
“When early in 1917 William Jennings Bryan fervently
spoke of a million men rising up overnight to defend the
nation, his thoughts were of the men who lived in the days
of Anthony Wayne and Francis Marion, of the men and even
the women who were as familiar with the rifle as they were
with the plow, for whom deadly combat with the Indians was
a common occurrence.”
Sidney Stern and his brother arrived in Cincinnati on the
afternoon of the following day. Nowhere, however, was there
any sign or suggestion of undue alarm. Evidently Hitler's
plunge into Poland was accepted as just another military,
political, and, no doubt, short-lived tantrum whose baleful
ramifications would be confined to Central Europe. Young
Sidney's mother was assured that America would stand firm
on its avowed policy of neutrality.

On the morning of Sunday, September 3rd, the listening
world heard the voice of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.
The voice was that of a strong, courageous, honorable, and
confident statesman. In words devoid of any shade of fear
or distress, the British leader announced that His Majesty's
government, true to its compact, would come to the aid of
Poland.
Thus, after a twenty-one-year armistice, Great Britain
again declared war on Germany. Before the sun of that day
had set, the British steamer Athenia, carrying 1,103 passen-
gers and a crew of 315 men, was torpedoed two hundred
miles off the northwest coast of Ireland. Three hundred
Americans were aboard that ship.
This was grim irony. The name Athenia has its origin in
Greek mythology. More than a century before the despicable
sinking of that ocean liner, the German poet Heinrich Heine
wrote: “France. . . . You know the Olympus. Among the
naked gods and goddesses who are enjoying themselves with
nectar and ambrosia you will see one goddess, who, though
surrounded by joy and revelry, always wears an armor, a
helmet on her head, and carries a spear in her hand. She is
the Goddess of Wisdom.”

CHAPTER XXIV
POLITICS PREFERRED
ARS, like earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and
“(0): eruptions, can be copiously recorded
but rarely foreseen with any degree of accuracy.
Less than one week before Adolf Hitler's formidable
Luftwaffe-supported Panzer divisions blitzed into Poland, the
wife of a University of North Carolina archaeologist penned
this message, on August 25, 1939, on a picture card from
Hotel Eisenhut, Rothenburg, Germany, to Rabbi Milton
Stern in Cincinnati: “We happened to hear the radio broad-
cast from England tonight, and their elaborate preparations
for war. Everybody here is very pleased about the Russian
pact, but everyone here laughs at the idea of war. It seems
strange to listen to Roosevelt and the English all excited
about war, while here in Berlin, Nuremberg, Rothenburg,
there is no sign of it. I wish I could see an American paper
headline. . . .”
On January 19, 1940, the seventy-four-year-old world
statesman, Senator William Edgar Borah, of Idaho, “gave
up the ghost.” As with so many other distinguished Ameri-
can citizens, Senator Borah had complacently assured his
countrymen that Hitler's swift conquest of Poland was in the
nature of a “phony” war. Two weeks before the golden voice
of this classic Republican orator was muffled by death, Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his State of the Nation address,
on the one hand decried “entangling alliances,” and, on the
other, berated those who “wishfully insist . . . that the
United States of America as a self-contained unit can live
happily and prosperously, its future secure, inside a high wall
of isolation.”
259

A conspicuous variation of the President's scorn of isola-
tionists came from the pen of the Indiana-born journalist,
Elmer Davis, who wrote: “Well, it is a war between rival
imperialisms. But it has other aspects too. Lindbergh has
said that this is not a war for democracy, but German and
Russian propaganda makes it clear that it is a war against
democracy. Consider what happened to the Czechoslovak
democracy, which decided in the interest of the peace of
Europe not to fight back; consider also what happened to the
peace of Europe despite this sacrifice.
“‘Modern war,’ said Lindbergh, “is too devastating to be
approached from any but a purely American standpoint.”
I agree. My remarks will have no taint of altruism. It seems
to me that the interest of the American people requires us to
keep out of the war for two sound reasons: we have un-
finished business of our own to solve; and furthermore, past
experience makes it doubtful if we could do Europe much
good. But from a purely American standpoint we are fools
if we refuse to recognize the nature of the world we live in,
if we try to base our national policy on illusions.
“To sit tight; to keep out of this war so long as it keeps
out of us; to do any fighting that we may be forced to do, but
only for the protection of American interests—that seems to
me a sane national policy.”
In the meantime, with the abandon of a hurricane and
other similar elemental agents of destruction, the products of
German and Czechoslovak armament factories imposed a
reign of terror on Central Europe. With the same defiance
—as of an earthquake—of human sentiments, human suffer-
ing, man-made compacts, treaties, and pledges, and the higher
laws of civilization, culture and conscience, Adolf Hitler's
mechanized men, on land, on the Sea, and in the air, spread
themselves around a large part of the world. On April 6,
1940, Norway and Denmark were overrun; France's Maginot
Line was subjected to tests of strength; while Belgium, Hol-

land, and Luxembourg clung to the gossamer thread of Hit-
ler's solemn pledges of nonaggression.
Alexander, Caesar, Hannibal, Napoleon, Robert E. Lee,
and Hindenburg were all mighty men of war. One common
quality shared by all these masters of the business of war was
that each was a soldier by profession. But Conqueror Adolf
Hitler was an amateur in all things. Serving four years under
Kaiser Wilhelm II, he emerged in 1918 a lowly corporal. By
profession or craft, so we are told, Hitler was a painter; an
artist, by aspiration; an artisan, by necessity. But setting
aside, if we dare, the incalculable enormities of his offenses
against Society and his Creator, which the Almighty alone
can measure, we find that Adolf Hitler was a creature of in-
credible accomplishments. Perhaps only a spirit of satanic
dynamics could have wrought such deeds in the face of such
staggering odds. This was a cosmic cinema on the silver
screen of eternity—a titanic graphic demonstration of what
man can do when there are fixity of purpose, singleness of
effort, concentration of energy, and a fanatical will to conquer.
There are some historians who maintain that the core and
essence of Germany's power is this will to victory—in war.
Had not the American Expeditionary Forces under Pershing
struck in time with such totally unexpected audacity, power,
and perseverance, the German army under Field Marshal
von Hindenburg would have crushed the Allies in France in
July, 1918. It was only then, with the cup of victory almost
in her grasp, that Germany reverted to her basest instincts.
Desperate and furious at the success of the derided American
intervention, Germany itself fomented and fostered the Bol-
shevik overthrow of the conservative Kerensky revolution in
Russia.
Later, by another colossal set of circumstances, the British
government took the lead in setting up the Third Reich in
Germany—ironically—in order to preserve Britain's tradi-
tional balance of power against the Bolshevik ruling circle

in Soviet Russia. And the amateur orator and politician,
Adolf Hitler, was selected to crush the Communist party in
Germany, perhaps exceeding numerically, at that time, the
membership of that party in Russia. The enigma and the
grotesquery of the Hitler hallucination were magnified by the
Führer's sordid compact with Soviet Russia in August, 1939.
Yet the German people was not moved by so patent a con-
futation of logic, morality, and political destiny. It was this
amateur political economist who gave employment to mil-
lions of hitherto wretchedly idle Germans so that, once again,
industry and commerce in Germany began to flourish and,
even more, to threaten the trade of both Great Britain and the
United States in the markets of the world. This amateur states-
man had annexed Austria after he had restored to the Reich
her former possessions on the Rhine. This amateur military
leader had smashed the Junker tradition and set in motion a
system of military service embracing even the youth and the
children of the nation. Completely bewitched by the phoenix-
like restoration of the vanquished and bankrupt nation under
the leadership of this amateur administrator who gave free
play to his imagination, to his romanticism, and to his will to
victory, this new nation went forth to war with high confidence
and exaltation of spirit.
This amateur imperator sent the German legions into battle
equipped and trained for a war planned and conducted ac-

drew upon his own tradition-unencumbered imagination. He
discarded many of the ways of the past. He combined the
classic “Stonewall” Jackson pattern of mobility of action with
the De Gaulle concepts of precision-co-ordinated tactics of
mechanized units on land and in the air. The amateur chief
of intelligence utilized every form of psychological warfare
and fifth-column collaboration behind the enemy's battle
lines. Under the spell of this Wagnerian devotee, this rein-
carnation of the fury of Thor and Wodin, the Third Reich's

Wehrmacht swept through Poland and conquered it in less
than thirty days; it rolled through the Scandinavian country
of Norway; by means of a telephone call, it took over Den-
mark. On May 10th the Wehrmacht invaded Holland, Bel-
gium, and Luxembourg; confronted England across the
narrow sea; and was on the border of France skirmishing and
probing the vaunted Maginot Line behind which France's
2,780,000 armed men waited and wondered why their gen-
erals and statesmen vacillated and marked time.
The “Battle of France” terminated on June 6th. The ama-
teur painter, politician, and man of war had dealt France the
greatest disaster of her history since the Hundred Years' War.
France was “conquered, invaded, occupied, pillaged, mauled,
trampled and humiliated” under the direction of a corporal
who had never forgotten the shame of the Treaty of Ver-
sailles, concocted by the victorious Georges Clemenceau of
France. An easygoing people, a nation lacking in self-
discipline, a country politically mined and sapped by its own
cartelists, and whose economic operations had been slowed
down by rebellious labor, ignominiously laid down its arms.
France opened her gates to an enemy whose millions—civil-
ians as well as soldiers—were like robots in the sure grasp
of one man who was, for all the world, the embodiment of
mediocrity.
General Charles de Gaulle's predicted and ridiculed “army
of the future” had taken form in Germany. Under the com-
mand of the “Austrian housepainter,” the Wehrmacht effected
the total capitulation of France twelve days after the miracu-
lous Dunkirk evacuation of 338,000 steel- and fire-encircled
French and English combatants in retreat. In the middle of
June, across the Channel, the newly appointed prime minister,
Winston Churchill, seated among the members of his cabinet,
let it be known that Europe was gone, Russia had signed a
pact with the Nazis, America's neutrality seemed unshakable,
and England was left alone to stem with its shattered forces

the avalanche-like momentum of an army transfigured by
unprecedented victories and poised for invasion only twenty
miles away.
And while the “dumm-schlau” (stupid-smart) utterances
of the German Führer were transforming almost all the Euro-
pean continent into a maelstrom of misery, the President of
the United States pursued his will-o'-the-wisp improvisations
with almost puerile competition for world-wide recognition
and approbation. While Adolf Hitler toppled kings and
queens from off their thrones, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in an-
other precedent-shattering mood, grandiosely sent the indus-
trialist, C. Myron Taylor, to the Vatican to serve as his
ambassador, and filled vacancies on the Supreme Court of
the United States with men grievously lacking in judicial
temperament and experience. While the Leader of the Nazi
Party in Germany was fiendishly engaged in the prosecution
of a mission to crystallize Germany's hegemony from Berlin
to Bagdad, the titular head of the Democratic Party in the
United States was perhaps as furiously absorbed in the forma-
tion of a political machine which, in the November, 1940,
Presidential election, would, of a certainty, crush all opposi-
tion, whether from the Republican Party or from outraged
elements within the Democratic Party itself. And while the
diverse peoples of Europe—including the Germans them-
selves—were confounded by the might and the madness of
Germany's new leaders, the peoples of the Western Hemis-
phere, like the inhabitants of Laish in ancient Canaan, were
relatively quiet and secure because they were far from Europe
and they would have no business with any of the combatants,
since, as they thought, Adolf Hitler was but the archfoe of
Communists and Jews.
Adolf Hitler's agenda of conquest called for the landing of
twenty-five divisions on the British Isles on or about Septem-
ber 21st. The routine process of softening up—the business
of Marshal Hermann Goering and the Luftwaffe (comprising

4,000 planes)—should be concluded in mid-September with
the total destruction of the 500 machines of the Royal Air
Force. For almost a full year, the British, too, were diverted
by the Smoke screen propaganda that only Communists and
Jews were the ultimate targets of the Nazi war machine. It
was only when the bombs dropped on Dover and other coastal
cities early in August that the British shook off the delirium
of security and immunity from the ravages of the Second
World War.
Except for a normal alignment of sympathies among the
multinational elements of the population, the people of the
United States, in a general way, did not find genuine cause
for alarm. The predominant attitude was favorable to the
cause of the Allies: Poland, the Low Countries, Belgium,
France, and Great Britain. The most vigorous expression
was that manifested against adherents of pro-German societies
on American soil. In the national capital, however, Com-
munist control in the highest echelons of the federal govern-
ment was fantastically crucial, while the Democratic Party
itself had slipped into the hands of such crafty labor chief-
tains as David Dubinsky, John L. Lewis, and Sidney Hillman.
The “Battle of the United States” in the early summer of
1940 was in the nature of a bloodless civil war. It was a
conflict between the forces of conservatism, capitalism, and
constitutionalism, on the one hand; and socialism, commun-
ism, and labor, on the other. The contestants were not men
of war. They were, for the most part, rank amateurs in
statecraft. While so much of the world trembled under the
impact of Germany's national resurrection, the United States,
through its organs of articulation, proclaimed to the world
that in the summer of 1940 the game of politics was pre-
ferred above all the other rugged pursuits of man.
One month before the fall of France and three months
before the tragic awakening of Great Britain, Rabbi Milton
Stern wrote to United States Senator Lister Hill of Alabama:

I am tapping out this note to you amid an atmosphere of
almost perfect peace. On one side I hear a broadcast of the
game between Cincinnati and Boston. On another, I hear the
pleasant roar of a tractor. The voices of children and the fra-
grant aroma of lilacs fill out the picture.
For two weeks or more, I have been weighing the question
of whether or not I should send you this note.
Ever since my enlistment, in May, 1917, I have been deeply
interested in military matters. And during the past nine years
I have been spending a lot of time studying and writing about
these things. As you know, I believe, my thoughts are influenced
by a profound conviction of, as George Washington phrased it,
“the singular interpositions of Providence” in the affairs of
nations.
Shortly after our return from European cities in September,
1937, I wrote an article entitled “Who Won the War?” in which
the thesis was that the United States must be more realistic in
her dealings with other nations in time of war and in time of
peace.
On May 30, 1938, at the Galbraith Memorial in Cincinnati,
the theme of my address was “America, Prepare!”
I present these items as a prelude to a confession of great
anxiety on my part. I believe we are not prepared to meet a
challenge which may come all too soon. When William Jennings
Bryan dreamed of a million men rising up overnight with spades
to defend the nation, he was as one who refused to acknowledge
the existence of evil in the world.
If I were asked to point out the writer who most prophetically
and vividly understood conditions as they are today, I should
say: John Milton, in his description of the battle between the
forces of Satan and the angels of Michael and Jesus.
Though we cannot accept the situation as it is in reality, the
fact is that every civilized country in the world is under arms—
all except our own. Of course, this does not apply to Central
and South American nations, since they place their reliance upon
our battleships and our airplanes.
Knowing full well we were not ready in 1917 and possessed
with the feeling that we may be drawn in again, against our will,
I should like to know how you stand on this issue. In the days
of Demosthenes and Alexander the Great, the conflict was be-
tween a man of words and a man of action, and Destiny called
for the man of action to bring order out of chaos.

The sword is abroad in the world. I cannot believe that the
great and wise of our beloved and glorious country cannot see
it and understand its warning. . . .
But the somber correspondence with the Democrat from
Alabama was overshadowed by a series of telegrams from
three officials of the Republican National Committee, includ-
ing one from National Chairman John Hamilton. “The Re-
publican National Committee,” the message ran, “would feel
honored if you were to act as the chaplain for the Republican
National Convention at Philadelphia for the morning session,
Wednesday, June 26th.”
The Republican Party faced the 1940 Presidential election
with fresh confidence and high hope. Franklin D. Roosevelt
had cut down every budding Presidential aspirant in his own
party, during the past two terms. He alone, therefore, could
be counted upon to win. But would Roosevelt dare to shatter
another precious tradition and precedent and seek a third
term? The elimination of Roosevelt from the presidential
race seemed indubitable. The most exalted and esteemed
elders of the Democratic Party, like Bainbridge Colby and
James A. Farley, were adamant in their opposition to a third
term. Certainly, the great American tribunal would not
countenance a break with such a hallowed tradition.
Thus, as Rabbi Stern and his sister Dinah began their
automobile journey to Philadelphia, they were buoyed up by
the almost universal conviction that the nominee of the Re-
publican National Convention in June would also be the
overwhelming choice of the electorate in November.
Occasionally Dinah paused to verify her course along
Philadelphia's maze of streets and avenues to the hotel. One
of her inquiries was addressed to a knot of newspaper boys.
“Say, lady,” one of them shouted, mischievously, “if you're on
your way to the Republican convention, you're just wasting
your gasoline. The Republicans haven't a chance!”
This gratuitous comment stung them to the quick. The
voice of that jeering street merchant was like the shrill, horta-

tory cackling of the fabled sibyl. Four years before, while
marching in a torchlight procession which preceded a politi-
cal rally at Cincinnati's Music Hall, two weeks before the
November election, Dinah and her brother had heard a simi-
larly ominous taunt from the lips of a young downtown
hawker. “Hal” cried that lad. “Why are you marching in
that parade? You're just wasting shoe leather!”
About 17,000 persons were seated in Philadelphia's huge
Convention Hall at every session. In the evenings, the enor-
mous galleries and the capacious main floor could not ac-
commodate the overflowing mass of spectators and delegates.
From their vantage point on the stage, Dinah and her brother
viewed the crowds with immense interest and admiration.
They were encircled by men and women whose names made
news in every part of the country every day. The triangular
platform on which they were seated extended like a pier out
into that ocean of robust, competent, and confident men and
women who were the glory as well as the real wealth of the
great republic. Between the massive stage and the auditorium
proper was the press section for about five hundred journalists
and a large number of radio commentators. Up in one of the
galleries was the organ loft, and space for a large-sized band.
Throughout the hall there were specially constructed booths
for radio and, for the first time, there was a limited television
coverage. The uniformed firemen, policemen, and ushers
maintained a remarkable degree of order amidst the billows
and waves of people surging through the aisles, the doors,
the corridors, and up and down the stairways of Convention
Hall.
Here was an indelible drama of representative government.
More than drama and even more than recorded history, it
was as though one were riding on the wings of the wind,
touching the stars as they ascended and descended from this
point of the firmament. The youth of some of the notable
delegates was indeed startling. Such household radio idols as
Lowell Thomas, H. V. Kaltenborn, and Fulton Lewis, Jr.,

were within easy range of the ear and eye. Martha Taft,
across the aisle, was busy with her knitting needles. The wife
of one of the three major Republican Presidential candidates
was apparently unperturbed, though, no doubt, her brain
throbbed with the same question which cycled furiously up
and down in the minds and on the tongues of the thousands
of delegates in Philadelphia and in the minds and on the
tongues of millions of their fellow citizens over the expansive
continent. That flaming query was whether Wendell L.
Willkie, the reconstructed Democrat from Indiana, rather
than Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, Senator
Robert A. Taft of Ohio, or Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg
of Michigan, would capture the mood of the delegates and
by some strange, mystical power win the nomination over
his Old Guard Republican rivals.
Wendell Lewis Willkie, of New York City, whose grand-
parents were German refugees, was now forty-eight. He was
by profession a lawyer. By occupation he was the president
of Commonwealth and Southern, a utilities holding company.
But in the sphere of political government, Willkie was a
novice. As a liberal Democrat, he found democracy in the
Republican Party, not in Roosevelt’s New Deal aggregation.
Active and serious interest in his candidacy, initiated by one
man, Oren Root, Jr., dated back to April, two months before
the Philadelphia convention. But Willkie's candor, honesty,
fair fighting, and forthrightness in his joustings with the
bureaucrats in the national capital had rocketed him into the
Olympian circles of political leadership. Willkie had no vul-
nerable political record. Here was a Wall Street administra-
tor, a former Democrat, a champion of the American free
enterprise system. He had come out of Roosevelt's den of
ravening, roaring reformers, safe, sound, and sane. It was
in the nature of the miraculous that anyone could have main-
tained his mental and spiritual equilibrium after being ex-
posed to such dialectical drivel as “So, you want the people
to starve!” (the New Deal humanitarians doled out millions

of dollars to farmers for plowing under foodstuffs); “So, you
don't believe in education!” (Roosevelt's new tentacles of
taxation played havoc with the teaching profession); “So,
you don't believe in a living wage!” (Roosevelt's officials per-
secuted a Cleveland manufacturer for paying high wages to
unskilled workers); “You are not opposed to the exploita-
tion of labor!” (under the New Deal, labor-racketeering as-
sumed its vilest form); and “So, you don't believe in good
racial relations!” (Roosevelt's smear-lackies systematically
engendered and fomented the class struggle).
Willkie's promoters, tyros like himself, boldly and unre-
mittingly hammered away on the theme that their candidate
was absolutely the only American capable of carrying the
much maligned and mutilated Republican Party to victory in
the November election.
Apparently, Robert Alphonso Taft, the conservative from
the Middle West, with all his astounding courage, clarity of
speech, and mastery of the most intricate ganglia of govern-
ment, would not be acceptable to the millions of sovereigns
of the ballot. Bob Taft lacked luster. As suffrage specie,
Taft's integrity, intellectual honesty, and abhorrence of bu-
reaucracy and hypocrisy were qualities as spurious as the
defunct gold standard and the relict Federal Constitution.
Towering Governor Harold E. Stassen of Minnesota and
his keynote speech on Monday evening could not produce
that singular spark which is essential in so momentous a
political campaign. Nor did former President Herbert Hoover,
on the following evening at Convention Hall, prove that he
would be able to reactivate by his campaign speeches that
notoriously large number of apathetic, stay-at-home Republi-
cans. Yet in that hour, as the superb Christian and American
statesman stood before that grand, cheering convocation, he
was the object of genuine admiration. The oration continued
on and on. Rabbi Stern and his sister enthusiastically joined
in the demonstration. They exulted not alone in this truly
majestic symbol of the honor and the dignity of American

statesmanship, but also in the audience which so spon-
taneously and so sincerely manifested its pride in and affec-
tion for that sterling Quaker who, with malice toward none,
endured the slings and the arrows of outrageous partisan
politics.
Notwithstanding, as the great man spoke, the rabbi fumed
and fretted inwardly. Herbert Hoover would never yield to
the clear call for vigorous, if not vitriolic, denunciation of
the Roosevelt Administration. Hoover would not transform
himself into another screaming Mussolini or Hitler—or even
a Roosevelt professionally bursting with righteous indigna-
tion. Stern knew only too well that the American masses
would not be moved by statistics or philosophy. For them
there must be dramatic, fiery appeals to their imagination,
their interests, and their emotions. The American people
were ready for a change of administration. But the man whom
they would choose must prove himself a Savonarola on the
hustings. Certainly, the phlegmatic Hoover, with all the
might of his wisdom and prophetic insight, could not, would
not, be a decisive factor in the current campaign. Herbert
Hoover apparently would not yield to the pragmatic principle
that showmanship or salesmanship at such a time as this was
immensely more potent than an academic exhibition of states-
manship of the highest order.
As yet, neither Taft, nor Dewey, nor Willkie had ventured
from their separate headquarters, each of which was a center
of lively music, other forms of entertainment, and generous
refreshments. And still, the leading question was that of
whether the Republicans could at last bring forth a redoubt-
able contender for the crown so tenaciously held by the
country's political heavyweight champion, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.
Eleven clergymen participated in the proceedings of the
1940 Republican National Convention, prominent among
them. His Eminence Dennis Cardinal Dougherty, archbishop
of Philadelphia. The Roman Catholic high priest's voice,

words, posture, sacerdotal attire, low, soft tones, and mel-
lowed, chaste cadences seemed to convert that coliseum into
a cathedral. For at least ten minutes the delirious din was
stanched. The convention chairman's ponderous gavel lay at
rest. The typewriters in the press section ceased their chatter-
ing. Cynicism, cupidity, cavil, and crass rivalry seemed to
ascend as vapor, as the spirit of humility, awe, and transcend-
ing tranquility flowed into the minds and into the hearts of
that great company of enlightened and independent patriots.
It was not until five o'clock Wednesday evening that Chair-
man Joseph W. Martin, Jr., approached the rabbi and said,
“If you will take my arm, Doctor, we'll walk to the podium.
Don't let the television bother you. It's terrifically hot under
those lights.”
When all was in readiness, and Stern stood on the dais
before the thousands in that great congregation, he lifted up
his voice and passionately directed this appeal, first to his
God and then to his fellow countrymen:
“O Thou, who art the ever-present fountain and founda-
tion of all life, open Thou our hearts that Thy glory may
enter. Open Thou our eyes that we may behold the way
everlasting. Thou who hearest prayer, touch my lips that
they who hear my words may turn unto Thee, who art the
source of our strength and our unity.
“Tossed to and fro by a tempest of doubt, this greathearted
nation reels and staggers. We are disquieted and cast down.
Evil days have come upon us because we have not followed
the true course of Liberty and Justice.
“Two things we ask of Thee this day. What answer shall
we give to the world that looks to us for a sign? Shall it be
the sword? And whom shall we anoint as the captain of our
hosts? Fill us with Thy holy spirit as we search our hearts
and minds in solemn meditation.
“Woe unto them that covet lands and take them by vio-
lence. Thou hast poured out Thy wrath against the nations
that broke the covenant of peace with China, Ethiopia, Aus-

tria, and Spain. Though we are not wholly innocent, and
though we have transgressed in our dealings with other na-
tions, in our hearts and in our minds we have striven for
peace and for harmony among all peoples. And now that the
fate of great nations is being concluded, shall we seek again
to alter the course of their destinies? With all our heart, with
all our strength, and with all our talents, we have labored for
a closely knit federation of nations. Yet it profited nothing.
“Shall we not return to the vision of former days: to stand
among the nations as a refuge for the oppressed and as a
master builder of a new civilization under Freedom's holy
light?
“What will it avail us to offer up our sons on the altars of
Moloch? Have we not seen how the nations mock our valor
and spurn our idealism? Have we not battles to wage against
the more hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals in our midst?
Will not the nation forget the heroism of the moment and
contemn the claims of the veteran of the morrow? Let us not,
O Lord, be sucked into the maelstrom of war to become part-
ners in the destruction of life and treasure, when our supreme
role should be that of providing succor for stricken humanity.
“Neither let us transfuse the hatreds, the jealousies, the
quarrels, and the wars of Europe into the blood of our nation.
Rather let us minister to the highest and holiest hopes of
every citizen, giving no thought to ancestral origins, but call-
ing for wholehearted allegiance to the symbols and institutions
of America. If we are so united and knit together as one
people, whose public servants are dedicated solely to the
security and happiness of their fellow countrymen, no weapon
forged against us can prevail.
“Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the
eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. Is not one house-
hold sufficient care for any man? Is not one mighty nation
whose dominion is from sea to sea and from the river to the
ends of the earth enough kingdom for any man? Is not the

Democracy?
“Thou seest not as man seeth; for man looketh on the out-
ward appearance, but Thou lookest on the heart. Let none
say we are lacking in men worthy to guide the nation along
paths of righteousness. Thou hast raised up many whom
Thou hast tried and whom Thou hast not found wanting in
vision, honor, and courage. Out of this assembly Thou wilt
call him, who shall be true to the covenant sanctified by the
wisdom of Washington, consecrated by the love of Lincoln,
and hallowed by memories of valor and sacrifice.
“We ask for no king, but Thee. We seek none but a
patriot statesman. May he love this people and be beloved
of them. May he govern them impartially, and may the
nation be blessed through him.
“Blessed are ye who have come to this shrine of Liberty.
Blessed be ye as ye return to your cities and villages. Be
strong and of good courage—be valiant for the truth, and
prove yourselves men, for our people and for our country;
and the Lord do that which seemeth unto Him good. Amen.”

CHAPTER XXV
- “CLOUDS AND WIND WITHOUT RAIN.”
Stern and his sister reluctantly withdrew from the
stage of Convention Hall in Philadelphia. The Re-
publican delegates to the 1940 national convention were in
the throes of nominating candidates for the offices of Presi-
dent and Vice-President of the United States, and Stern and
his sister were foregoing a close-up of unfolding history in
order to dine with friends in nearby Germantown. Their
host, a cotton broker and a poet, was one who reverently
spoke of Franklin D. Roosevelt as a “philosopher-king.”
At about ten o'clock that night, they returned to Conven-
tion Hall in time to witness the final act of that great drama.
Convention Chairman Joseph W. Martin, Jr., was still pound-
ing away with his gavel. His stentorian voice could even yet
be heard above the roar of the thousands of commingling
voices of the delegates, spectators, and reading clerks. The
rabbi and his sister weaved in and out of the knots and bands
of men and women swarming in the corridors, at the doors,
and over the massive stage. The police, the ushers, and the
firemen seemed to struggle and to strain in their efforts to
regulate the flow of the laughing, shouting people into the
main auditorium and up into the galleries. Again and again,
Stern heard the rhythmic chant resounding through the mam-
moth hall: “We want Willkie! We want Willkie! We want
Willkie!”
“No, no!” Dinah broke in, fiercely. “We want Taft! We
Want Taft!”
As Dinah watched the scores of photographers clambering
like monkeys over rails and chairs, she gasped with astonish-
(9. THE evening of Thursday, June 27th, Rabbi Milton

ment and fear. But soon she, too, was caught up in the
hypnotic frenzy of the contest, as ballot after ballot was
rolled off by the iron-throated and unwearied tongues of the
reading clerks. Telegrams by the thousands, calling for
Willkie's nomination, poured in on the bewildered delegates.
The well-disciplined pro-Willkie claque, concentrated in the
galleries, thundered its approval when state after state de-
clared its stand for the businessman, Wendell L. Willkie.
Three hours later, at about one o'clock, early Friday
morning, June 28th, on the sixth roll call, after the Kansas
delegation, headed by former Governor Alf M. Landon, had
swung into the Willkie camp, the victory of the Wall Street
lawyer was indisputable.
And when the triumphant nominee of the Republican
Party stood before the national convention delegates, in the
early summer of 1940, few would have denied that, if elec-
tion day had been during the first week in July, Franklin D.
Roosevelt would have gone down to ignominious defeat be-
fore the Republican Party's challenger, Wendell L. Willkie.
For, foremost in the minds and in the hearts of the American
people was the fervent hope that the European holocaust
would speedily run its course within the confines of that
wretched continent. The Republican Party, it was confidently
believed, would be true to its platform pledge of opposition
to involving the nation in a foreign war, though it demanded
the immediate and adequate building up of the national de-
fense and the giving of all such aid to the peoples fighting for
liberty which would not be in violation of international law
and would not jeopardize their own national defense.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, however, did not exhibit
either a symptom of despair or the slightest intimation of
defeat. His initial campaign maneuver was swift and auda-
cious. It was staggering in its psychological impact on Re-
publicans as on the general public. Hardly had the dazzling
sun of Wendell L. Willkie appeared above Philadelphia's
Convention Hall when President Roosevelt blithely announced


## p. 277 (#311) ############################################

that Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox had accepted his
invitation to become members of his Cabinet. Both Stimson
and Knox were among the élite of the Republican Old Guard.
The seventy-three-year-old, strongly internationally-minded
Stimson, who had served as President Taft's Secretary of War
and as President Hoover's Secretary of State, would now re-
turn to Washington as Secretary of War. Frank Knox, a
leading Chicago newspaper publisher and the 1936 Republi-
can nominee for Vice-President, would become Secretary of
the Navy.
This was a masterful political stroke. It eclipsed the sig-
nificance of the label conversion of the erstwhile Democrat,
Wendell L. Willkie. The inescapable conclusion to be drawn
from the inclusion of Republicans Stimson and Knox in the
Roosevelt Cabinet was that there would be little or no need
at this crucial time to turn over the administration of the
federal government to the opposition party.
But to the clear-sighted historian, it was only too evident
that the extraordinary action of Republicans Stimson and
Knox could not be called a complete, if temporary, coalition
of parties. For personal reasons, members of the Republican
Party could accept any high post with a Democratic admin-
istration. Yet they could neither represent nor commit the
party. No real coalition or semblance of national unity is
secured by such a combination of partisan statesmen. As
members of the Democratic President's Cabinet, Stimson and
Knox were but glorified clerks, subject always to his whims
and caprices. They were altogether cut off from the Repub-
lican Party. They were utterly powerless to act as its official
representatives.
The Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in mid-
July, 1940, dealt another powerful blow to the inflated hopes
of the Republican Party. In the beginning, the opposition on
the part of patriotic Democrats to the third-term renomina-
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed to be well organized
and sure of victory. The resolute third-term antagonism of

James A. Farley, the party chairman, was eloquent, impres-
sive, and apparently irrefutable. But, at the appropriate
moment, Roosevelt's name was again placed in nomination.
To Rabbi Stern's extreme astonishment and bewilderment,
his steadfast friend, Senator Lister Hill of Alabama, delivered
the nominating speech with amazing sincerity. Then followed
a train of events perhaps unprecedented and unparalleled in
the short history of the republic.
Without official credentials, the President's wife suddenly
appeared before the delegates and unreservedly appealed for
the renomination of her husband. The First Lady's speech
ran the gamut of emotions. And while the delegates fretted,
fumed, and wondered, the President's deputy, in Chicago,
Harry L. Hopkins, wrought in a fantastic way to produce a
synthetic draft of a presumably unwilling and greatly harassed
public servant.
From his hotel suite nearby, Labor Leader Sidney Hillman
and Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago, in the basement of
the convention hall, executed the White House orders relayed
through Hopkins, unerringly and successfully. On July 18th,
these lieutenants of Franklin D. Roosevelt rolled up a ma-
jestic majority vote for him. Once again Roosevelt was the
unvanquished master of his party.
“What an irony!” commented Dinah, ruefully. “It was
National Chairman James A. Farley who paved the way for
Franklin Roosevelt’s capture of the third-term nomination.
Don't you recall, Milt, that in 1936 Farley was largely in-
strumental in abrogating the Democratic Party's 104-year-old
two-thirds rule—rather than a majority—affecting the nomi-
nation of their Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates?
Had the two-thirds rule prevailed in 1940, Roosevelt’s third-
term nomination would most assuredly have been thwarted
by the strong Southern opposition. What a boomerang for
Farley!”
The Democratic Party's 1940 Presidential choice of a
third-term candidate was obviously a delicately fashioned

boomerang. If the Democratic Party's high command wielded
this weapon expertly and convinced the electorate that Roose-
velt was “the indispensable man” and that it was hazardous
to “change horses in the middle of the stream,” it would
crush their Republican opponents. On the other hand, should
the Republican challengers decisively shatter the myth of the
indispensable man, then the third-term presumption could
revert to the disastrous repudiation of the Democratic Party.
Here, indeed, was the prelude to a drama rivaling in interest
and intensity of conflict and suspense—though scarcely in
agony, brutality, inhumanity, and destructiveness—the trag-
edy of Europe. It was a time for superlative action and for
lofty, unexcelled language. But would the words and the
deeds of the American statesmen, Roosevelt and Willkie,
measure up to the June 4th pledge of Britain's heaven-sent
prime minister, Winston Churchill:
“We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall
fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confi-
dence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island,
whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall
fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in
the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender,
and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island,
or a large part of it, were subjugated and starving, then our
Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet,
would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the new
world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue
and the liberation of the old.”
Nevertheless, for the millions of Americans in the new
world, there was no deep urge to step forth to “the rescue
and the liberation of the old.” War was not required to lift
the overwhelming number of Americans out of the deadly
slough of boredom and the monotony of the daily task. The
1940 presidential campaign in itself was enough to absorb
the interest and the thoughts of most men and women during
their waking hours, and often their dreams at night.

Yet, perhaps even more engrossing than the national politi-
cal contest was the annual six-month 154 National and Amer-
ican Leagues championship baseball games in which the
Cincinnati “Reds” performed most promisingly. For incal-
culable thousands—men, women, and children; the old and
the young; the scholar and the unskilled laborer—baseball
was king whose subjects were fanatically loyal. In this sphere
of human entertainment, the ebb and the flow of victory and
defeat were preposterously heart straining. Here also, as in
the case of the political campaign, the exhibition in the base-
ball park, with all its thunder and lightning accentuated by
the blasts of the uninhibited emotions of the narrator, was
transmitted by radio into almost every household, factory,
office, and shop in the United States.
Incomprehensibly the day by day, play-by-play feats of the
Cincinnati baseball athletes seemed to Dinah and to her
brother Sidney more serious and more vital to their welfare
than the remote and bloody deeds of the men on the European
fields of battle. Typically, the prowess and the personalities
of such Cincinnati baseball artists as Ival Goodman, William
(Billy) Werber, Paul Derringer, William (Bucky) Walters,
Ernesto (Ernie) Lombardi, Frank McCormick, and Manager
William (Bill) McKechnie were vastly more meaningful than
the names and the exploits of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini,
and Winston Churchill.
Dinah and her brothers shrank from the ugliness of war
and politics. Their heroes were the men who wielded the
baseball bat in a major league park. The apogee of pro-
ficiency was a team in a World Series baseball game. In con-
trast to this sentiment, the politician who failed to perform
his duties with the same degree of skill, ardor, and patriotic
devotion was a reprehensible individual.
Dinah Stern knew only too well that, unlike baseball, in
the realm of politics there were no umpires, no universally
accepted rules, no revered traditions of fair play, no well-
defined code of honor or of ethics. Often Dinah asked why

the profession of politics was open to those who were not
qualified, not tested. She was baffled by the relative ease with
which any citizen could compete for a place in the upper
levels of public service without a convincing demonstration
of proficiency and mastery of one of the most challenging
and, doubtless, the alpha and omega among the sciences of
civilization.
Again, unlike the winning of a title in the sphere of sport,
the tabulation of ballots cannot be accepted as a certificate
of competence in statecraft. Even in the dawn of victory, the
gloating contestant finds that his campaign oratory has turned
into gravel and that the apples of gold in his trembling hand
are naught but sand.
For a period of six weeks, following the Philadelphia
national convention, Republican politics seemed to be in a
state of suspended animation. Wendell L. Willkie, the Re-
publican candidate, had gone into comparative seclusion at
Colorado Springs, Colorado, limiting himself to modest utter-
ances and to informal sessions with visiting friends and mem-
bers of the party.
In the opposite camp, however, while the Democratic
Party's candidate was apparently consecrated wholeheartedly
to the affairs of state, the party's machine operated with
accelerated momentum. While the publicity department of
the Democratic National Committee surrounded Franklin D.
Roosevelt with an aura of Olympian aloofness from the
shambles of the precinct and the ward, the new joint chiefs
of staff—Hopkins, Hillman, Kelly, and Flynn—labored with
indefatigable zeal and with seemingly inexhaustible funds.
With twenty million citizens receiving relief in one form or
other, the agents of the Democratic Party had little fear of
competition from their Republican rivals, who could offer no
more than a change of administrators and remodeled federal
relief laws. For among the jobless millions, as with econo-
mists, businessmen, and politicians, the dismal doctrine still
prevailed that the increasing use of labor-saving machinery

was responsible for the ten-year-long plight of the unemployed.
During July and half of August, Dinah and her brother
relied upon the radio and the newspapers to help them main-
tain their bonds of loyalty to the Republican Party in its
third attempt to take over the reins of government from
Franklin Roosevelt. Then came this summons:
“The Wendell L. Willkie Arrangements Committee of Indiana
requests the honor of the presence of Rabbi Milton Stern at the
ceremonies attending the notification of Wendell L. Willkie of
his nomination by the Republican National Convention for the
office of President of the United States of America at Elwood,
Indiana, on Saturday afternoon, the seventeenth of August, nine-
teen hundred and forty.”
Wendell L. Willkie was born and reared in Elwood, In-
diana. He attended the Elwood public schools. He worked
in its factories and stores. He started the practice of law in
Elwood's courts. The choice of this small, but thriving, Madi-
son County community, with its large tin can manufacturing
plant, was a routine concession to tradition, as well as to
geopolitical strategy.
About one thousand Republicans—men, women, and chil-
dren—boarded the special Pennsylvania Railway coaches
which left Cincinnati's Union Terminal, bound for Elwood,
Indiana, on Saturday morning, August 17th. Stern and his
companion, Louis Stricker, a Cincinnati attorney, roamed
from coach to coach. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits.
Senator Robert A. Taft was the great light in the constella-
tion of such political luminaries as former Governor Myers
Y. Cooper, Cincinnati's Mayor James Garfield Stewart, the
two congressmen from Hamilton County, and state, county,
and municipal officials. Several hours later, Hamilton County's
one thousand zealous Republicans alighted from the train and
mingled with the more than two hundred thousand other
Republicans from the three thousand or more other counties
of the republic, who swarmed along the two main highways

and the streets of Elwood. Here were bands followed by
marchers with banners bravely unfurled. Here two or three
circus-trained elephants docilely pounded their way through
gaps in the mass of humanity.
Not all the quarter-million Republican emissaries lingered
at the Elwood high school campus to hear their candidate,
Captain Wendell L. Willkie, offer a brief but rhapsodic ex-
planation as to why Elwood had been chosen for this mem-
orable rendezvous. While Captain Willkie spoke, streams of
men and women flowed along the congested road to Calloway
Park to witness the ceremonies of notification.
Calloway Park was about a mile from the Elwood high
school. As the hour drew near for the Republican presiden-
tial candidate to deliver his first formal campaign speech, the
temperature on the platform was nearly 110 degrees. No
protective canopy of any kind had been provided for the
occasion. The sweat ran down into Wendell L. Willkie's eyes
as he stood before the battery of radio microphones and the
loud speakers. It was difficult for him to follow the manu-
script. The tens of thousands of auditors seated and stand-
ing in that small space seemed to be listening with solemn
respect.
When Stern and Stricker arrived at Calloway Park, they
were unable to reach the places assigned to them on the
platform. This was most fortunate. The afternoon sun was
beating down alike on the dignitaries encircling Wendell L.
Willkie and the great assemblage below them. No spot in
the park could escape the shafts of that fierce flame. So they
walked along the road, found a place under a shady tree,
and sat there on upturned peach baskets. The nominee's
voice boomed through the park and out onto the highway. It
was a monotonous, staccato, uninspiring outpouring of words.
The march from the train to the high school and then to
Calloway Park, in the heat of the day and in the dust of the
roads, had been a grueling experience. When the last echo
of Willkie's words faded away, Stern and his companion re-

turned to their train exhausted and somewhat dazed by the
magnitude and the drama of this historic pilgrimage.
Home at midnight, Stern turned on the radio and listened
to the transcribed broadcast of the Willkie speech. In the
stillness and in the cool of the night and within the restful
embrace of an easy chair, he could now discern sincerity and
truth in these restrained utterances of his party's champion:
“. . . . I have more reason than most of you to feel so strongly
about this ſeconomic opportunity for youth] because the United
States gave to my family their first chance for a free life. The
ancestors of both my father and mother, like the ancestors of
millions of Americans, lived in Central Europe. They were
humble people—not members of the ruling or wealthy classes.
Their opportunities were restricted by discriminatory laws and
class distinctions. One was exiled because of his religion, an-
other was persecuted because he believed in the principles of
the French Revolution; and still another was jailed for insisting
on the right of free speech.
“As their descendant, I have fought from boyhood against all
those restrictions, discriminations, and tyrannies. And I am still
fighting.
“My grandparents lived in Germany. They were supporters
of the democratic revolutions in that country, and when the
revolutions failed they fled to the United States. How familiar
that sounds! Today, also, people are being oppressed in Europe.
The story of the barbarous and worse than medieval persecution
of the Jews—a race that has done so much to improve the cul-
ture of these countries and our own—is the most tragic in human
history. Today there are millions of refugees who desire sanc-
tuary and opportunity in America, just as in my grandparents'
time. The protection of our own labor and agriculture prevents
us from admitting more than a few of them. But their misery
and suffering make us resolve to preserve our country as a land
free of hate and bitterness, of racial and class distinction. I
pledge you that kind of America.
“My mother was born in this country. My father was three
or four years old when his parents settled in northern Indiana.
It was then a trackless forest. As a young man he helped to clear
that forest. He worked his way through the Fort Wayne Metho-
dist College, taught school, and became superintendent of schools

here in Elwood. My mother also was a schoolteacher. When-
ever they had time, they both studied law and eventually both
took up the practice of law. I doubt if any two people ever
appreciated or loved this country more than they.
“As you who lived here with them well know, they were
fiercely democratic. They hated oppression, autocracy, or arbi-
trary control of any kind. They believed in the qualities that
have made America great—an independent spirit, an inquiring
mind, a courageous heart. At school they taught those virtues
to many of you who are here today. At home they taught them
to their children.
“It is a tribute to their teaching that when the United States
entered the World War in 1917, three of their four boys were
volunteers, in the uniform of the American forces, within one
month after war was declared. They withheld no sacrifices for
the preservation of the America of 1917. In an even more dan-
gerous world, we must not withhold any sacrifice necessary for
the preservation of the America of 1940.”
That night, before slumber and sleep and before the ra-
tional faculties gave way to unbridled imagination and to
dreams, Rabbi Stern reviewed the epic events at Elwood. He
had been an extra in a marvelous pageant. More than two
hundred thousand persons, during the period of twelve hours,
had flowed in and out of the little Indiana city by bus, by
train, by passenger car and, no doubt, also by airplane, with
scarcely a ripple of confusion or discernible disorder. So
far as Stern could recall, there was no extraordinary deploy-
ment of either civilian or military police. It had been an
awe-inspiring demonstration of the country's most enviable
national trait—the power of spontaneous co-operation.
But only a Rip Van Winkle of the seventeenth century
might have been moved by Wendell L. Willkie's political ora-
tion. Alongside the scenario-perfect and precision-polished
shafts of the nation's most accomplished radio-orator, Will-
kie's heavy phrases—for the most part, the work of his own
hands—were like random shots from a blunderbuss.
The Republican presidential candidate's words of accept-
ance were but sentimental zephyrs. They were well-suited

for halls of academic learning. In contrast to the smear bom-
bardments and the ruthless rant of the opposition campaign-
ers, Willkie's professions would be as scented missives.
One way only was open to this converted Socialist-Democrat
by which to win the wholehearted support of millions of
traditionally “Old Guard” Republicans. From this day and
onward to Election Day in November, Wendell L. Willkie
must carry on a tornado-like attack of blowtorch intensity
against Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his program of “modi-
fied Communism.”
Well might the gentleman-farmer from Indiana ponder
these words from Holy Writ: “And the Lord sent thee on a
journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the
Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.”

CHAPTER XXVI
“NEITHER HATH THE LORD CHOSEN THIS’’
Bout thirty-nine miles southeast of Indiana's me-
cºſtropolis, Indianapolis, stands the more-than-cen-
tury-old community of Rushville. In August, 1940,
just as Hyde Park, in Duchess County, New York, provided
the essential bucolic background for President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, so Rushville was the parallel setting for the Re-
publican presidential candidate, Wendell L. Willkie. Para-
doxically, while the Democratic Party's champion resided on
an expensive estate along the majestic Hudson River, the
Wall Street corporation president's modest farm was situated
alongside the Humble Mud Creek. Moreover, as a sign of
his desire for freedom from the fetters of the “Old Guard”
Republican Party's managers, Wendell L. Willkie had set
up temporary headquarters over the Rexall Drug Store on
Main Street near the Lollis Hotel. For a temporary down-
town residence, Mr. Willkie had rented an eighty-year-old
worn brick house on Harrison Street.
On the morning of Wednesday, August 21st, four days
after the Elwood ceremonies, Rabbi Milton Stern and his
friend, Al N. Jappe of Cleveland, parked their car near the
Lollis Hotel and walked into the lobby. Stern was dumb-
founded as he stepped inside the hotel. Nothing in the lobby,
nothing in the street outside, even remotely indicated that
here in Rushville was the nerve center of the world's most
crucial political campaign. Scarcely more than half a dozen
persons were to be seen on the street. Here in the lobby were
four men who came out from a little side room to meet them.
The first was John D. M. Hamilton, until recently National
Chairman of the Republican National Committee. With him
287

were W. H. Lawrence of the Associated Press, T. F. Koop
of the United Press, and Franklin Waltman, also of the Re-
publican National Committee. As they spoke, their voices
were low and as casual as though they were conversing about
things most commonplace. Here in the Lollis Hotel was a
picture of small-town placidity.
Stern and Jappe had come to Rushville at the request of
Sinclair Weeks, a Massachusetts Republican leader. The im-
mediate purpose of this trip to Rushville was to receive from
Wendell L. Willkie a message which Stern would deliver to
the delegates to the national convention of the Jewish War
Veterans in Boston on August 31st. Al Jappe had been
selected to accompany Stern, first to Rushville and then to
Boston. All the details of this expedition had been carefully
worked out at the New York office of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, directed by James Jappe, Al's brother.
This journey by car to Rushville was a little more than
the start of an exchange of greetings between an American
presidential candidate and a national convention of Ameri-
can citizens. The conference with Wendell L. Willkie was
but a single incident in a strange, country-wide political side
show. As at night, when the crocodile, the leopard, the
python, and the poisonous vipers come forth and seek their
prey—and life is cheap in the jungle—so likewise, in the
night of a political campaign, politicians and their hirelings
revert to the primeval instincts of the jungle; they remorse-
lessly stalk their opponents—for the kill. In the heat of the
political campaign, the conscience of men is stifled by the
savage distortion of the processes of logic, by the ferocity of
the charge and countercharge, and by unspeakable deception.
“They belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips.”
Wendell L. Willkie was the proud offspring of a brave
Indiana family of German ancestry. It did not call for
strenuous dialectical interpretation on the part of professional
and volunteer adherents of the Democratic National Com-
mittee to concoct the base canard that the Republican presi-

dential nominee was pro-Nazi and therefore a rank anti-
Semite.
In the 1936 presidential campaign, similar tactics had been
employed against former Governor Alf M. Landon of Kan-
sas. At that time Al Jappe and Rabbi Stern had wrestled
with that gruesome phantom unsuccessfully. The invidious
charge against Landon stemmed from a comparatively in-
nocuous incident—the discharge of a Jewish physician from
a Kansas state hospital. But the surreptitious assault on
Wendell L. Willkie was the outgrowth of the nebulous
hypothesis that all German-Americans were pro-Nazi.
And now, in 1940, the Cleveland lawyer and the Cincin-
nati rabbi were once again engaged in political jungle war-
fare. Before going to Rushville, Jappe had ordered the print-
ing of thousands of pamphlets containing the photographs
and the statements of American citizens of the Jewish faith
supporting the Indiana-born public utility executive of Ger-
man antecedents. Among the more than two score staunch
Willkie supporters were Joseph M. Proskauer, Lessing J.
Rosenwald, Roger W. Straus, Lewis L. Strauss, Bernard
Flexner, James Marshall, Marcus C. Sloss, Paul Felix War-
burg, William Weiss, James Davis, and Rabbi Abba Hillel
Silver of Cleveland.
As Jappe and Stern, escorted by John Hamilton, walked
past the single sentry on the front lawn of the house on
Harrison Street, they saw Wendell L. Willkie seated on the
front porch conversing with Mrs. Mary Sleeth, his house-
keeper. As they approached, Mr. Willkie came forward and
said, “Hello, John.” The voice that uttered those words was
melodious, golden in tone. It was as different from the voice
Stern had heard at Elwood on the Saturday before as the
timbre of a violoncello is unlike that of a bass drum. “Ah,”
thought Stern, as he grasped the candidate's hand, “if Wen-
dell Willkie could only project that voice over the radio!”
A moment later, Stern sat opposite the great man. John
Hamilton and Jappe walked across the porch to chat with

the candidate's brother. Mr. Willkie and his brother seemed
to be unruffled, completely relaxed. It was a scene of astonish-
ing, even perplexing, tranquility. Hardly a passer-by on the
pavement below! Scarcely the sound of a rolling automobile
over the highway! On this day in August, 1940, a little more
than three thousand miles eastward across the Atlantic Ocean,
Europe's millions were, no doubt, walking along their streets
and highways timorously looking skyward, not for the bene-
ficent rain of heaven, but for the malevolent munitions of
Satan's hosts. But here on the broad veranda of this Indiana
home, in the presence of one of the nation's most illustrious
contemporary figures, Rabbi Stern marveled that he could
think and speak with composure and confidence.
“I am delighted you came from Cincinnati to see me,
Doctor.”
Without waiting for a rejoinder, Mr. Willkie called off,
statistically, the industries and trade of Rushville. Stern
listened respectfully. And when he thought that the presi-
dential challenger was ready for a question, the rabbi said,
“Mr. Willkie, what shall I say to the Jewish War Veterans
in Boston next week about your record as a champion of
minorities?”
Wendell L. Willkie's voice was more arresting than his
words. Now his speech took on the professorial strain and
regal aspects of Harvard University's George Foot Moore or
Columbia University's John Dewey. There was in Wendell
L. Willkie's conversation the same warmth and the same
candor which Stern had noted some years before when he
conversed with those two giants of the intellect.
“I believe, Mr. Willkie,” Stern added quickly, “that if we
are strong economically as well as politically, we need have
no fear of depression, of war, or of anti-Semitism.”
Now Mr. Willkie's words took on wings. They came forth
as in hordes. For a moment Stern imagined that Willkie,
who, he was convinced, would be the next President of the
United States, forgot that he was seated on a porch in com-

munion with one lone clergyman and not, as it seemed, ad-
dressing an acre of auditors.
“I do not wish it to be said,” Mr. Willkie declared, “that
I oppose purveyors of hate only because I have a strong per-
sonal attachment for those who might be called my Jewish
or Catholic friends. Long before anyone ever heard of Wen-
dell Willkie, I fearlessly fought for civil liberty. In the early
20's, when I was still a struggling attorney in Akron, I led
the opposition to the Ku Klux Klan. In those days, the Ohio
courts were dominated by klansmen or their sympathizers.”
“In the summer of 1924,” he continued, “at the Demo-
cratic National Convention in New York City, I stood up
consistently for Al Smith.
“I believe that the greatest danger of minority persecution
lies in the fact that it opens the way to persecution of all
minorities.”
“I believe,” said the rabbi boldly, “that it is not enough to
hate the social evils of bigotry, malice, and religious or racial
slander. They must all be understood in their relation to
millions of adults forced to tramp the streets; in relation to
the millions of young people, educated in our public schools
and then denied the opportunity to earn an honest livelihood.”
As the rabbi spoke, Mr. Willkie listened intently.
“It is not enough,” Stern went on, “that men should vote.
It is not enough that they should be regarded as equal before
the law. Otherwise, as the social philosopher, Henry George,
warned, ‘the nation now mighty in arms and arts, will become
the helpless prey of barbarians.’”
Wendell L. Willkie's vigorous concurrence in these senti-
ments caused Stern's spirit to soar. Under the spell of Will-
kie's candor and confidence, Stern returned to Cincinnati
enkindled with the conceit that he had been under the mystic
sway of a soul on fire and in the presence, at last, of a true
patriot-statesman.
There was something winsome and yet disquieting about
Wendell L. Willkie. There was something in the voice and

292 Tºs R E D POT TA GE
in the utterances of this magnificent American, extraordinary,
rare in both politician and professor. This gentleman from
Indiana spoke with exceptional earnestness, with deep sin-
cerity. Wendell Willkie spoke as a Welshman hymns his
gratitude to the Almighty—as if his heart, too, would break.
He seemed to call every muscle and fiber of his robust frame
into play as he conversed.
This was, indeed, the nub of the Republican presidential
challenger's seemingly inexplicable individuality: he would
always give all of himself, even his life. But he could not, he
would not, be harnessed to traditional techniques of essential
political teamwork—to win an election! By gesture, by lan-
guage, in divers ways, Wendell Willkie had made it clear that
he would not be held in with bit and bridle. Yet, he would
not quit. Willkie would win the respect of cynical pressmen,
because of his bull-like persistence, his obstinate honesty,
and the deep strength of his convictions, which he could not
lay aside each evening as practiced politicians do.
That evening Rabbi Stern pondered these things. He re-
called that Henry George, another eminent and noble Ameri-
can, half a century before Wendell Willkie, had fought the
good fight—in the New York City political arena—and twice
had gone down to defeat. And also similarly, pre-eminent
among the splendid virtues of America's unique political
economist, Henry George, was that very quality which was
the diadem of Wendell Willkie's character—innate sincerity
which, like a transfiguring flame, captivated the minds and
the hearts of millions of sensitive souls.
The pattern of Wendell L. Willkie's presidential campaign
was now discernible. In the main, Wendell L. Willkie would
undertake to repeat the unprecedented record of six hundred
campaign speeches set by the Illinois-born statesman, Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, in 1896. Like Bryan, Willkie would go
forth and sell himself—not his party or his party's program.
Willkie would call for the weighing of his character and
talents and physical fitness in contrast with those of his

opponent. Willkie would sally forth as did Don Quixote in
his crusade against the oppressors of the underprivileged.
Willkie would be the Samson of his generation. With the
jawbone of an ass, singlehandedly, Willkie would storm the
redoubts of the Democratic Party.
What was it that blinded this man to the fact, known, no
doubt, to all the world, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
his cohorts of Communists, Socialists, millionaire playboys,
bragging-jack reformers, Labor-Unionists, and Democrats
would cast almost every standard of ethics and morals to the
winds in the struggle to hold on to the office and the almost
limitless powers of the Presidency?
One week following the conference with Wendell L. Will-
kie at Rushville, Rabbi Stern and his friend, Al Jappe,
traveled by American Airlines from Cincinnati to Boston.
They alighted at the airport late Thursday evening, August
29th. Immediately they were encircled by photographers,
reporters, and a group of men and women representing the
Jewish War Veterans. They were greeted by Harold Seiden-
berg, the president of the convention corporation, and by
William Berman, the secretary of the corporation. The cor-
diality of the reception committee seemed genuine, and the
concern of the newspapermen was professionally eager and
complimentary.
Soon Seidenberg and Berman took up the baggage of their
guests from Ohio and walked toward their car parked on the
Street.
“We’ve got bad news for you, Rabbi Stern,” said Captain
Berman, a past commander of the Jewish War Veterans. “You
and Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver have been dropped from the
Saturday evening program at the Boston Arena.”
Jappe and Stern stopped short. They faced the two men
from Boston.
“What's this? Why weren't we notified before we left

“Gentlemen, the decision was not made until an hour or
so ago. Seidenberg and I fought desperately to keep the two
rabbis on as speakers. But the opposition was too strong.”
“Wasn't Rabbi Silver scheduled to deliver the principal
address? And weren't the speeches of Silver and Stern to be
broadcast nationally over the Mutual Broadcasting System?”
“That's all been changed, Al. United States Senator David
I. Walsh, of Massachusetts, a Democrat and the chairman of
the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, will be the speaker.
His address will be carried on the air.”
“I am sure Rabbi Silver isn't pleased about this, Captain.”
“I understand, Al, that Rabbi Silver has cancelled his trip
to Boston.”
“What shall we do, Harold? You are the president of the
convention corporation. Shall we go back to Cincinnati'?”
Again there was an interlude of silence.
“Milt is prepared to deliver a personal message from Mr.
Willkie in a ten-minute talk. What happened to the copy of
his speech we mailed you several days ago?”
“It's a good speech, Al. But our convention publicity
director, who, by the way, is also employed by the Demo-
cratic National Committee for the duration of the presiden-
tial campaign, pigeonholed that address.”
“That's about the rawest deal I’ve ever experienced, Cap-
tain. Milt and I have an appointment tomorrow afternoon
with Governor Saltonstall and Mr. Sinclair Weeks. I wonder
what they'll say about this mess.”
“Just a minute, Al,” said Seidenberg. “The program com-
mittee has made several concessions. They will permit Bill
Berman to go on the air after Senator Walsh has concluded
his address, and Bill will say that Rabbi Milton Stern of
Cincinnati is attending the convention as the special emissary
of Wendell L. Willkie, and, later, the master of ceremonies
will call on the rabbi for a few words. We expect about
three thousand guests to be at the Arena.”

As they approached Captain Berman's car, two men
stepped toward them. One slunk close to Stern's right side
and whispered in his ear:
“Rabbi, don't you know that Willkie is a dirty Nazi—an
anti-Semite?”
Stern raised his cane menacingly. The slanderer recoiled.
The indignation incited by the colloquy between Jappe and
Berman, in which he had taken no part, now burst into a
flame of wrath. At that moment, Jappe grasped Stern's arm
and guided him into the car.
“Hold it, Milt,” Jappe pleaded. “We can't make a scene
here. Let's go over to the Copley Plaza.”
Jappe and Stern dined disconsolately at the hotel. Soon
after, arm in arm, they trudged along the pavement of Bos-
ton's maze of converted colonial lanes. A light rain cooled
the August atmosphere.
“I believe we'll stay in Boston until Sunday, Milt. We
want to keep our appointment with the governor and Mr.
Weeks. Nor do you want to call off your Saturday afternoon
meeting with your Henry George friend, Mrs. Dorothy Wor-
rell, of the Massachusetts Tax League. And you do want to
see what Bunker Hill looks like. We can go out there Satur-
day morning. So we may have to attend that banquet at the
Arena after all.”
“It is hard for me to believe, Al, that both Seidenberg and
Berman were not able to overcome the opposition of the New
Deal clique in the convention committee. I am sure that
Berman is a solid Republican. And Seidenberg was the
original Willkie-for-President man in Cambridge, Massachu-
setts. Seidenberg is president of the Cambridge Republican
Council. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the
Cambridge Republican City Committee. He wants to serve
with Harry Colmery of the American Legion and James E.
Van Zandt of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on the national
veterans committee for Willkie. Are the overwhelming ma-
jority of JWV members still for Roosevelt?”

“I don't like to admit it, Milt, but the legend that Roose-
velt is ‘good to the Jews' is hard to shatter.”
“Can't our Jewish people understand that Roosevelt is good,
apparently, to all racial and religious so-called minorities in
our country because he wants their votes?”
“We’ve got really bad news, Milt. It's about Willkie. The
high altitude at Colorado Springs has affected his heart and
he may lose his voice. Willkie has called in a famous Holly-
wood voice specialist. The campaign should go into high
gear just at this time. Won't that be something if Wendell
L. Willkie can’t use his voice?” º
“Perhaps it might be well if Mr. Willkie did not talk too
much. Lincoln did little, if any, campaigning in 1860.
Roosevelt hasn’t delivered a major political address as yet.
What is Roosevelt's strategy, Al?”
“Roosevelt doesn't have to do much talking, Milt. I be-
lieve he wants Willkie to talk himself out, and then Roose-
velt will come in at the finish with just two or three smashing
speeches.”
“But how is Mr. Roosevelt going to convince the Ameri-
can people that he really means to keep this country out of
war? His promises certainly don't carry weight any more.
Dinah says that Roosevelt will break his promise about keep-
ing us out of war, no matter how many times he repeats it
or how solemnly he swears to comply with the letter and the
spirit of our neutrality laws. Dinah predicts that if Roosevelt
is not defeated, we'll be swept into the war.
“Most Americans,” Stern went on, passionately, “want no
part in this European conflict. Hitler doesn't want to do
anything that will bring us into war totally on the side of the
Allies.”
“I wonder how long Hitler will respect our position as
neutrals, while we go on giving Britain material aid. I think
that Wendell Willkie himself is for maximum aid to the
Allies—short of war. I assume that means until Hitler's sub-
marines sink too many of our ships carrying war supplies

to the Allies. Then we'll be just where we were in April,
1917, when Woodrow Wilson declared war on the German
Empire, based on his self-fabricated doctrine of ‘strict account-
ability.’”
“How does the American Legion stand on neutrality?”
“The American Legion's policy still calls for noninterven-
tion in foreign wars. What the Legion will do at its conven-
tion here in Boston next month, I don’t know.”
“What about the transfer of the fifty old but badly needed
destroyers from the United States Navy to the British? How
can we reconcile this destroyer deal with neutrality, with
United States statutes, or with international law? This act is
ground enough for a declaration of war on the part of Hitler.”
“How do we stand with the Japanese, Al?”
“Until a month or so ago, we were shipping Japan an
enormous amount of scrap iron and oil.”
“Although the President and the Congress are asking for
billions more for the production of munitions, and while
Roosevelt plans to call out the National Guard, and there is
every indication that we are going to have compulsory mili-
tary training and registration together with the nationaliza-
tion of industry, the emphasis seems to be on national de-
fense—short of war.’ That is the sword of Damocles hanging
over our collective heads—that phrase, “short of war.’”
“Milt, this will be the first time we shall have had peace-
time compulsory military service.”
“Al, the nationalization and total control of industry and
all its forms will be just what the Marxist New Dealers have
been dreaming about: total centralization of power, socializa-
tion of every aspect of our lives, collectivization of farms,
factories, shops, schools, transportation, labor unions, banks
—after the Russian model!”
“We have every reason to believe, Milt, that Wendell L.
Willkie will be the next President of the United States. The
third-term issue should be enough to defeat Roosevelt. The
Democratic Party is split into several factions. Senator Burke,

Senator Byrd, Senator Carter Glass, former Senator Reed of
Missouri, Vice-President John Garner, former National Chair-
man Vance McCormick, former Governor Alfred E. Smith,
Postmaster General Jim Farley, and Lewis Douglas, former
Director of the Budget, have either bolted the party com-
pletely and gone over to Willkie or strenuously oppose Roose-
velt's re-election.”
“Al, if Willkie will stay with the loyal and hard-working
party officials all down the line, from National Chairman
Joseph W. Martin, Jr., to the precinct committeeman, such
teamwork will bring out a very substantial Republican vote.
“But I fear, Al, that Wendell L. Willkie is too much of a
rugged individualist, a stranger to politics.”
“Here's the Copley, Milt. I think we've had enough walk-
ing in Boston tonight.”

CHAPTER XXVII
WHEREIN THE LARYNX IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE LEGS OF A MAN
ENDELL L. WILLKIE, the Republican Party's Presi-
“(0): challenger, came to Cincinnati on Wed-
nesday evening, October 16, 1940. About twenty
thousand awaited him at Crosley Field as his motorcade
rolled regally through the gates and close to the temporary
speaker's stand on that hallowed piece of ground called the
diamond. Twenty thousand auditors is an extraordinary
assemblage when the sole purpose is to observe and to hear
one man for less than one hour. But in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
a city whose population was far below that of Cincinnati,
one month before, at the Tulsa Fair Grounds, fifty thousand
persons had come to see and to hear the Republican Presi-
dential candidate. Also, Cincinnati was perhaps the strong-
hold of the Republican Party.
As Wendell L. Willkie and his entourage took their seats
on the platform, the thousands at Crosley Field stood at their
places and cheered. Dinah and her brother listened anxiously.
Would the thunder of the ovation belie the significance of the
row upon row of unoccupied seats in the grandstand and in
the pavilion? Crosley Field, for such an occasion, could have
accommodated twice twenty thousand.
Eight days before, under the warm October sun, Crosley
Field was indeed the center of the nation's greatest spectacle:
the final and decisive 1940 World Series baseball exhibition,
with the Cincinnati “Reds” and the Detroit “Tigers” as the
contenders for the title of world champion baseball team.
Why should the exquisite motions of Derringer, Lombardi,
McCormick, and Werber quicken the hearts of millions of
299

men, women, and even children of every intellectual, theo-
logical, economic, and political stratum? What was so world-
shaking about the flight of a five-ounce, very compact,
horsehide-covered sphere over a wall or a fence? What was
so immensely momentous about the cryptic crackling of the
umpire’s “Strike!”? Of what historic significance to the
nations of the world would it be if the athletes of the city of
Detroit scored one or more runs more than their Cincinnati
competitors? Why, seemingly, was the managerial wizardry
of “Deacon” Bill McKechnie of more immediate concern to
the nation than the administrative ability of the Republican
Party's presidential challenger?
Perhaps the glory and the glamor of the June victory in
Philadelphia had been irretrievably tarnished four months
later by Willkie's pathetic exhibition of woeful weakness.
Many of Willkie's speeches were poorly prepared. It was said
that Willkie never mustered his facts in advance of his public
utterances, that he was not master of the subjects he treated,
and that he sounded off with half-thought-out opinions.
In one of his addresses, Wendell L. Willkie had committed
the unpardonable indiscretion of slipping into a solecism. In
his Pittsburgh oration, Willkie had spoken rashly concerning
the employment of women in high places in government. In
Detroit, Willkie had been the ignominious target of hoodlums’
missiles.
These incidents were trifles in themselves. Yet they were
inordinately magnified because of the majesty of the Willkie
myth created by the original sponsors of the Republican
Party's presidential candidate. The shadows of the presiden-
tial campaign lessened as Election Day, November 5th, drew
closer and closer. Like wax, the once regal stature of Wendell
L. Willkie, the valiant champion of “Big Business,” melted as
the dazzling sun of Franklin Delano Roosevelt slowly and
imperiously dominated the political firmament.
On this very day, October 16th, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt had again captured the limelight and the attention

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 301
of the whole nation. The moment was the inauguration of
the first peacetime Selective Service Registration. The Presi-
dent's voice had lost none of its marvelous timbre. There
was no indication in his speech that the conscience of Frank-
lin Roosevelt had been in any wise pricked by the wholesale
defections from the ranks of his own party. There was a
grimness in the tone of his voice. Yet in that aspect of high
seriousness one could detect that all-too-familiar undertone
of impish jocularity heightened by the consciousness that he
was demonstrating the courage, the confidence, and the capac-
ity for leadership requisite for a statesman in this hour of
historic jeopardy.
In contrast to that superlatively dramatic pose against the
background of universal urgency, this nocturnal scene at
Cincinnati's Crosley Field was oppressively drab. No doubt
the rude rumblings of displeasure and restlessness on the part
of those seated near Stern and his sister in the grandstand
that bleak October night robbed the campaigner of that mystic
aura so vital to the success of any public speaker. In com-
parison to the ringing and rousing radio pronouncements of
the President, the hoarse utterances of Wendell L. Willkie
sounded like the mutterings of a soothsayer. Who could fail
to be impressed with this uplifting message from the Chief
Magistrate of the nation: “On this day more than sixteen
million young Americans are reviving the three-hundred-year-
old American custom of the muster. They are obeying that
first duty of free citizenship by which, from the earliest
colonial times, every able-bodied citizen was subject to the
call for service in the national defense. It is a program
obviously of defensive preparation and of defensive prepara-
tion only. Such a nation must be devoted to the cause of
peace. And it is for that cause that America arms itself.”
That was precisely what Stern and his sister and the mil-
lions of their fellow countrymen wanted to hear: a promise
of peace and preparations for insular defense only. But with
an amazing shift of strategy, Wendell L. Willkie had cut him-


## p. 302 (#336) ############################################

302 Tºss R E D POT TA GE
self off almost entirely from the party which had created him
as its leader. Willkie was out of touch with the spirit of
America. So engrossed had he become with things inter-
national that his name now stood before the country as a
symbol of internationalism. The country was concerned with
domestic policies and problems. Willkie had failed to under-
stand that with the almost unbroken chain of recent Repub-
lican victories across the country, a political revolution had
taken place, with a definite swing back to the right, back to
“isolationism.”
These reflections were but the rationalizations of journal-
ists. They were not the sober recordings of historians. In his
promise of maximum aid to Britain, “short of war,” Wendell
L. Willkie was no whit more internationalist in spirit than
President Roosevelt, who had practically stripped the nation
of all arms and armaments in his zeal to come to the aid of
the sorely pressed British Empire. And what could have been
more indicative of popular sentiments than the wholly unex-
pected action taken by the 1,451 delegates, representing well
over a million citizens, at the annual convention of the
American Legion in Boston in September? Reversing its
former long-time policy of nonintervention in foreign wars,
in keeping with the national policy of neutrality, the Ameri-
can Legion went on record overwhelmingly in favor of aid
to all nations resisting aggression, and especially advocated
“all practicable aid to Britain.”
Perhaps the columnist Paul Mallon again came closest to
the nub of the mystery of Willkie's vanishing magnetism:
“There are millions of people today whose emotional self-
interest has completely sold them on Roosevelt beyond the
ability of reason to challenge. He could do anything, and
they would still vote for him, because they believe he per-
sonally is responsible for their old age security, their farm
checks, public works, their union, or just simply because they
think he is for the poor man, and they are still poor.”

Stern and his sister listened sorrowfully as Wendell L.
Willkie continued to read from his prepared manuscript.
Suddenly there was a stir in that cold assemblage. Willkie
had finished his peroration. A gasp arose from the throats
of hundreds of listeners simultaneously.
“What's going on, Dinah?” Stern whispered.
“Willkie is standing up on the rail of the temporary
platform.”
“Why?”
“I think, Milt, Willkie wants to show his physical supe-
riority over Roosevelt.”
“That's impossible, Dinah. Wendell Willkie wouldn't stoop
so low as to call attention to his opponent's infirmity.”
“I think that's a very cheap stunt, Milt.”
This was Wendell L. Willkie's unhappy finale in Cincin-
nati, a little more than two weeks before Election Day. The
entire performance was a gloomy intimation of a tragic de-
nouement. Willkie's ghost writers were providing him with
speeches which he could not declaim effectively. Willkie's
own peculiar proclivity for long drawn out sessions with re-
porters in the late hours of the night played havoc with his
strength. About one week before the day of “solemn refer-
endum,” Willkie's campaign bogged down miserably. It took
Willkie one week to travel from Baltimore to New York on
his regal campaign train. Most of that valuable time was
spent in railroad yards. Often Willkie paced up and down
the railroad track, biting his fingernails. And during that
decisive period, President Roosevelt laid down a barrage of
campaign oratory with devastating thoroughness.
At Madison Square Garden, New York City, on the eve-
ning of October 28th, in a speech brilliantly blending witti-
cism with palpable paradox, the Democratic Party's third
term candidate brazenly proclaimed: “Back in 1935, in the
face of growing dangers throughout the world, your Govern-
ment undertook to eliminate certain hazards which in the
past had led us into war.

“By the Neutrality Act of 1935, and by other steps: We
made it possible to prohibit American citizens from traveling
on vessels belonging to countries at war. Was that right?
“We made it clear that American investors, who put their
money into enterprises in foreign nations, could not call on
American warships or American soldiers to bail out their
investments. Was that right?
“We made it clear that we would not use American armed
forces to intervene in affairs of the sovereign republics to the
south of us. Was that right?
“We made it clear that ships flying the American flag could
not carry munitions to a belligerent; and that they must stay
out of war zones. Was that right?
“In all these ways we made it clear to every American,
and to every foreign nation, that we would avoid becoming
entangled through some episode beyond our borders.
“Those were measures to keep us at peace. And through
all the years since 1935, there has been no entanglement and
there will be no entanglement.”
But it was in Boston, two days later, that President Roose-
velt uttered this fantastic pledge: “And while I am talking
to you, mothers and fathers, I give you one more assurance.
I have said this before, and I shall say it again and again and
again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign
wars. They are going into training to form a force so strong
that, by its very existence, it will keep the threat of war far
away from our shores.
“The purpose of our defense is defense.”
And so, as if to impregnate this grotesque guarantee with
the perfume of tranquility, the presidential candidate closed
the Boston campaign address with these words: “I have to
let you in on a secret. It will come as a great surprise to you.
And it's this:
“I’m enjoying this campaign. I’m really having a fine time.”
At Hyde Park, only a few hours before the voting began,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt gravely averred: “We thank God

R E D POT TA GE 22:5" 305
. . . that we are not in war and that we propose and expect
to continue to live our lives in peace.”
At about the time President Roosevelt, at Hyde Park, was
gathered with his friends, neighbors, and political chieftains,
Rabbi Stern and the members of his family were in their
living room with their attention riveted on radio reportings.
“Ah, Leah,” the rabbi said to his wife, “if we could only
take politics as a form of entertainment, as we take baseball
—as a game to be enjoyed for an hour or so, and then
forgotten.”
“Why should we have to concern ourselves so feverishly
with the affairs of our government?” Leah asked. “Why
should we lack faith in the integrity of our elected officials?
We do not question the honesty, nor the ability, of our physi-
cians. They go about their business and we have complete
confidence in their judgment. The same may be said about
those who deliver the bread we eat and the milk we drink,
and about all the food we purchase at the grocery. We do
not suspect that they will sell us anything harmful. When
we are on a train or a bus or an airplane, we do not lose
faith in the skill, the good judgment, and the absolute trust-
worthiness of the engineer, the bus driver, or the pilot of the
airship.”
“That is true, Leah,” said the rabbi. “I wish it were just
as easy for us to take our minds off Mr. Roosevelt and Mr.
Willkie, and politics in general. We have our own work to
do, our own problems to solve.”
“Nor is household management child's play, by any means,
Milt,” said Leah. “Why does Mr. Roosevelt get under our
skin? Why do we have to worry about him every day?”
“Mr. Roosevelt is very much like an incorrigible ado-
lescent,” said Stern. “You can never be sure how long he
will keep out of mischief.”
“I can't understand,” said Leah, “why we must worry
more about the President in the national capital than we do

about our governor in Columbus, or our mayor here in Cin-
cinnati. The President can call in as many experts as he may
require. And we pay him a handsome salary, too.”
“There was a time, Leah, when we seemed to have per-
fect confidence in our federal government. We didn't bother
much then about what was going on in Washington. In those
days, we took it for granted that the President and his Cabi-
net, and the members of Congress, were all doing their best.
We didn't expect them to be supermen. Of course, they made
mistakes. But they were human, just as we are. We expected
them to make mistakes. But, at the same time, we were con-
fident they were giving us the best possible service.”
“I believe there is one explanation for the revolutionary
change in Washington,” said Dinah. “It may be summed up
in the title of a book which appeared about four years ago
—Hell Bent for Election. Franklin Roosevelt is interested
only in winning elections. He begins his campaign for the
Presidency on the very day of his inauguration. And so from
one inauguration to the next, Mr. Roosevelt puts on a stu-
pendous show. He wants to make sure the people will never
forget his name. Worst of all, Mr. Roosevelt is not concerned
with the consequences of his passion for power.”
“Oh, yes,” added Leah, “Mr. Roosevelt has certainly put
on a stupendous, a colossal show. But the cost has been in
billions of dollars.”
“And it will also be in lives, countless lives,” said Dinah.
“Forgive me, Milt and Leah, for saying this: I am afraid
Mr. Roosevelt, if elected, is going to take our country into
the war.”
“Now, Dinah,” said Leah, “you shouldn't talk that way.
In almost all his campaign speeches, Mr. Roosevelt assured
us he is going to keep us out of war and that everything is
being done for defense only.”
“All that I want to say at this moment,” Dinah replied,
slowly, “is I wish we were back in the days of Coolidge and

Harding. Things weren't perfect then, I know. But the world
is in a sorry shape today and Mr. Roosevelt has had a lot to
do with that. During the eight years of his presidency, he
has not been able to straighten out things here at home.
What makes him think that he can reform the world? Mr.
Roosevelt is like all these do-gooders. They tell us how to
manage our homes and how to take care of our children.
Yet their own homes and their own children could stand a
lot of attention and improvement.”
“I am ready for a walk, Dinah,” the rabbi announced.
On the highway, Dinah and her brother resumed their con-
versation.
“I spoke to Sidney this afternoon, Dinah. He told me he
was the only physician at the hospital who is going to vote
for Willkie.”
“They are all New Dealers, Milt. Sidney is in a tough spot.
But he is loyal. He is for Willkie because he trusts your judg-
ment, Milt.”
“Is there anyone at the Hebrew Union College, Dinah,
among the students and professors, courageous enough to
come out against Roosevelt and for Willkie?”
“One or two professors whispered to me that they are
going to cast their votes for Willkie. But I am sure that all
the others are for Roosevelt.”
“When you talk to these men at the College, Dinah, do
you speak calmly?” -
“How can I speak calmly to them, Milt? I almost blow up.
I told Dr. Marcus how many promises Mr. Roosevelt has
failed to keep—I believe the total is sixty-three. I told him
I thought Mr. Roosevelt could not be trusted and that he has
turned the whole world upside down. Of course, he laughed
at me. Then I said that if Mr. Roosevelt is elected, he will
surely drag us into this war.”
It was late at night. Trucks and private cars rolled by
them almost at arm's length. Dinah and her brother were

silent until they reached the sidewalk. Then Dinah resumed
her story.
“Dr. Marcus looked at me. He wasn't laughing now. I
went on. I said the Democrats got us into the first World
War and later Winston Churchill admitted that the world
would have been much better off if we had stayed out of
Europe. I told him that my brother was terribly disabled in
that war. I said, ‘I have another brother. He is an intern at
the Jewish Hospital. He is single. He is twenty-five—of mili-
tary age. I don't want my brother Sidney to fight on foreign
Soil.’”
“What was Marcus' answer, Dinah?”
“He said, “Why, Dinah, didn't you hear the President
promise he would not have our boys fight in foreign wars?
He's made that pledge four times, I believe. In Boston he
came out emphatically and repeated that promise even more
solemnly.”
“Then I said to him, ‘Dr. Marcus, Roosevelt is going to
break that promise, too—as he has broken almost every other
promise he has ever made to the American people.’
“Then he paused. He looked at me and said, ‘Not that
man, Dinah!’”
Early the next morning, Tuesday, November 5, 1940,
Dinah was up early. At half past six, she took up her post
at the precinct polling place. Dinah was the duly elected
Republican precinct committeewoman. For twelve hours she
remained at her post. Prayerfully and often tearfully, she ap-
pealed to every voter to mark the ballot for Wendell L. Willkie
and all the other Republican candidates.
At six o'clock that same evening, Stern left his work in the
study and prepared for an all-night vigil at the radio. In the
afternoon he had tried to complete an address to be delivered
to the Jewish Temple Sisterhood in the neighboring city of
Dayton. For the Dayton discourse, Stern had already sketched
these main arguments:


## p. 309 (#343) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 22.5" 309
“Europe must be permitted to solve her own problems of unity
and uniformity of trade regulations, coinage, passports, etc.
“America's entry into the European War may frustrate that
consummation—just as Napoleon's dream of European unity
was shattered by England.
“We must weigh the total cost of war now when we have the
time to ponder and to calculate.
“America ought to proclaim and adhere to a clear program of
strict neutrality.
“America must prepare for any national emergency through
adequate national defense.
“America must prepare itself to serve as a peace negotiator
when Great Britain and Germany lay down their arms, con-
quered by famine, pestilence, and disillusionment.
“America must be prepared to offer help toward the recon-
struction of Europe, materially, mentally, and spiritually.
“This is not a program of appeasement. It is a program of
world restoration. It is the best means of preserving our own
democracy.”
But now everything had to be laid aside. The fate of hun-
dreds of millions of people around the world would be pro-
foundly affected one way or another by the decision of the
American electorate. The triumph of Wendell L. Willkie, the
Republican Party's candidate, could mean the return to sanity
in government and to an intelligent grappling with global
problems. But a third term victory for Franklin D. Roosevelt
could mean another world war together with the calamitous
usurpation of power by such men as Harry Hopkins, Henry
Wallace, and Sidney Hillman, who were straining at the leash.
This triumvirate, with President Roosevelt's bland acqui-
escence, would exultantly take the nation into the second
world war. With their elaborately prepared blueprints of a
planned economy, a planned society, planned men, women,
and children, molded after the imagination of their mystic
word-webs, another world war would give these professional
benefactors the chance to demonstrate how men of their in-
tellectual stature could speedily bring social justice and social

security to the millions of their fellow countrymen otherwise
“too dumb” to govern themselves.
To Hopkins and to so many of his ilk, Moscow apparently,
and not Washington, was the new Mount Sinai from which
emanated all good laws and all the benign ways and paths to
human happiness. For the minions of Hopkins, Wallace, and
Hillman, it was Stalin—not Roosevelt—who was the only
true “philosopher-king.” For Hopkins and his horde of re-
formers, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was merely their inno-
cent tool and dupe, the wonderful apostle of the new Marxist
dispensation.
Doubtless, neither Hopkins nor Wallace nor Hillman
could be catalogued as American agents of the Russian
politburo. Hopkins, Wallace, and Hillman were possessed of
that “Messianic impatience which gives rise to nihilists and
revolutionaries.” These ambitious, audacious adventurers in
the realm of sociology were so infatuated with the Bolshevik
bombast about the dictatorship of the proletariat that not
even the indisputable evidence of millions of lives fiendishly
snuffed out by Stalin's fear-hounded and fear-besot execu-
tioners could dispel the enchanting image of a workers’ para-
dise which, like a mirage, hovered over Stalin's mammoth,
prison-guardian empire.
The chimes of the clock on the mantle broke in on Stern's
harsh reverie. It was now nine o'clock. No definitive count
had thus far been announced. The telephone summoned him.
His brother Sidney was calling from the Jewish Hospital.
“Milt,” he asked, “what are you doing now?”
“I am listening to a mystery story. Things are rather dull.”
“Milt, do you still believe Willkie will win?”
“Yes, Sidney.”
“I just heard a bulletin over the radio. The New York
Times says Roosevelt is winner again.”
Dinah returned home at midnight. She had spent an hour
at a downtown hotel where Democrats and Republicans had
gathered to hear the official returns. Dinah reported that the

Democrats were sure of victory, but that the Republicans
were still hopeful. The unofficial count from Ohio had not
as yet come in.
Stern remained at the radio until two o'clock in the morn-
ing. He was stunned. He could not believe that the Ameri-
can people had ignored the appeals of the statesman, Bain-
bridge Colby; the clergyman, Norman Vincent Peale; the
labor leader, John L. Lewis; the actor, Bing Crosby; and
other notable citizens, and had swept aside the hitherto un-
broken tradition of no Presidential third term. Would Bain-
bridge Colby's prediction now come to pass? Would the
shattering of the third term precedent be accompanied by a
breakdown in the moral standards of the republic?

CHAPTER XXVIII
FROM GARDEN HOSE TO GLOBAL
HOLOCAUST
vember 5, 1940, 27,241,939 American citizens cast
their presidential choice in favor of a third term for
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Wendell L. Willkie, the Repub-
lican candidate, received 22,327,226 votes from his fellow
countrymen. The big city “machines” had turned the tide in
Roosevelt's direction. The great Middle West farming states'
popular vote was in the Willkie column. Hundreds of thou-
sands of recalcitrant “stay-at-home” Republicans preferred
defeat rather than the elevation of the public utility executive
to the presidency of the United States.
The unprecedented and phenomenal triumph of Franklin
D. Roosevelt must be ascribed to that one paramount prom-
ise which he made during the 1940 campaign: “And while
I am talking to you, mothers and fathers, I give you one
more assurance. I have said this before, but I shall say it
again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be
sent into any foreign wars.”
For the second time within a quarter century, the Ameri-
can electorate had returned to the White House the Demo-
cratic Party's nominee for the presidency, after a pious parade
of professions of peace. In the national campaign in 1916,
Woodrow Wilson rode into office on the vaunt that he had
kept the nation out of the then existing war in Europe.
Almost simultaneously with the Electoral College official
proclamation of Roosevelt's re-election, the thrice victorious
Democratic Party’s “leader” met with several hundred re-
porters in the White House. It was the seventeenth day of
9| N THEIR rendezvous with destiny on Tuesday, No-

December. The President's utterances and the subsequent
professorial-like exchange with the journalists formed a most
astounding exhibition of the dialectic skill of a master
magician.
In his opening remarks, the President said: “I have read
a great deal of nonsense in the last few days by people who
can only think in what we may call traditional terms about
finances. In my memory, and your memory, and in all his-
tory, no major war has ever been won or lost through lack
of money.”
As the President spoke, it was clear that he was bent upon
extricating himself from the fetters of the 1940 campaign
pledges. The major shackle was that of neutrality. How could
he free himself from that ponderous promise with which he
had enchained himself in his Madison Square Garden speech?
Would the people forget his electrifying ode to neutrality?
“Back in 1935,” he had declaimed, “in the face of growing
dangers throughout the world, your Government undertook
to eliminate certain hazards which in the past had led us into
war. By the Neutrality Act of 1935, and by other steps . .
we made it clear that ships flying the American flag could
not carry munitions to a belligerent; and that they must stay
out of war zones. In all these ways we made it clear to every
American, and to every foreign nation, that we would avoid
becoming entangled through some episode beyond our bor-
ders. Those were measures to keep us at peace. And through
all the years since 1935, there have been no entanglements
and there will be no entanglements.”
And now on the seventeenth day of December, seated
comfortably in his wheel chair, President Roosevelt, com-
mingling scorn with wit and the dexterity of a great conjurer,
said to the assembled men and women at his press confer-
ence: “I am not at all sure that Great Britain would care
to have a gift from the taxpayers of the United States. Now,
what I am trying to do is to eliminate the dollar sign. That

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 315
is something brand-new in the thoughts of practically every-
body in this room, I think—get rid of the silly, foolish old
dollar sign.”
Now what was that something “brand-new” in the realm
of which one peace-dedicated nation could harmonize its
policy of strict neutrality with that of all-out aid to the Allies
—short of war? How was President Roosevelt going to “get
rid of the silly, foolish old dollar sign” and thereby preserve
the British Empire, her allies, and all the free world from
the imminent Nazi conquest? In his presidential campaign
of 1932, Roosevelt had promised to balance the budget.
Shortly afterward, Roosevelt had taken the nation off the
gold standard. Throughout the eight years of his adminis-
tration, Roosevelt had preached and practiced John Maynard
Keynes' bizarre program of achieving prosperity through
“pump-priming” or “deficit-spending” of borrowed billions of
dollars. What original trick was the great wizard of finance
now going to offer the world?
“Well,” the President began—and in his voice was the
tone of a fond parent addressing himself to an attentive child
—“let me give you an illustration: Suppose my neighbor's
home catches fire, and I have a length of garden hose four
or five hundred feet away. If he can take my garden hose
and connect it up with his hydrant, I may help him to put
out his fire. Now, what do I do? I don't say to him before
that operation, ‘Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you
have to pay me $15 for it.” What is the transaction that goes
on? I don't want $15—I want my garden hose back after
the fire is over. All right. If it goes through the fire all right,
intact, without any damage to it, he gives it back to me and
thanks me very much for the use of it. But suppose it gets
smashed up—holes in it—during the fire; we don't have too
much formality about it, but I say to him, ‘I was glad to lend
you that hose; I see I can't use it any more, it's all smashed
up.' He says, “How many feet of it were there?' I tell him,


## p. 316 (#350) ############################################

316 *es R E D POT TA GE
“There were 150 feet of it.’ He says, “All right, I will replace
it.” Now, if I get a nice garden hose back, I am in pretty
good shape.”
As though he anticipated the very pertinent inquiry, the
President quickly added: “I can't go into details; and there
is no use asking legal questions about how you would do it,
because that is the thing that is now under study; . . . with
the understanding that when the show was over, we would
get repaid sometime in kind, thereby leaving out the dollar
mark in the form of a dollar debt and substituting for it a
gentleman's obligation to repay in kind.”
In the course of the rapid-fire and remarkably uninhibited
flow of questions and answers between the President and the
White House corps of correspondents, one of the journalists
asked: “Let us leave out the legal phase of it entirely; the
question I have is whether you think this takes us any more
into the war than we are.”
The President answered, “No, not a bit.”
At length, in this “background” presentation, the Presi-
dent was asked: “As long as this is being made to our account
and we are lending it to Great Britain, would we deliver the
goods in Great Britain . . . 2”
The President replied, “Oh, I suppose it would depend on
what flag was flying at the stern of the ship. You can work
it out any way you want. It might be even a Bolivian flag.
That question is a detail.”
“Would it be an American flag?”
“Not necessarily,” answered the President. “That would
bring up another subject. That would bring up a subject
which might be a dangerous one, quite frankly, of American
sailors and American passengers, et cetera, taking the Ameri-
can flag into a war zone. You need not worry about that one
bit, because you don’t have to send an American flag and an
American crew on an American vessel.”
In this manner, in this atmosphere of absolute freedom of
inquiry, and with breath-taking breeziness, Houdini-like, the

President of the United States slipped out of the neutrality
strait jacket. With this press conference, heard almost in-
stantaneously round the world—Germany included—the com-
paratively modest trickle of “defense aid” which, in August,
1940, penetrated the supposedly impervious walls of the
Neutrality Act of 1935 with hardly a whisper of alarm was
suddenly transformed into a deluge. This in the process of
time became not only a deluge of weapons of war, reaching
astronomical proportions in the expenditure of billions of
dollars and in the incalculable waste of natural resources. It
also became a deluge of irredeemable human beings—women
as well as men—numbering about eleven million living souls
—not garden hose. -
That which took place at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, scarcely
one year later, on Sunday, the seventh day of December,
1941, was but a lightning spark. Our major disaster at Pearl
Harbor detonated the train of diplomatic dynamite sedulously
laid by Britain's Winston Churchill and France's Jean Monnet
(originator of the slogan “arsenal of democracy”), working
hand-in-hand with Harry Hopkins, the President's alter ego.
Before Pearl Harbor, there were other potentially explosive
acts of war. There was the transfer of the fifty “veteran”
destroyers on September 3, 1940. There was the American
expedition to Iceland on July 19, 1941. There was the At-
lantic Conference in August, 1941. But, above all, there
was the Lend-Lease Act of March 11, 1941, informally pre-
viewed to the world at the White House press conference in
Washington on December 17, 1940.
On the evening of December 29, 1940, President Roose-
velt sat down before his specially constructed radio micro-
phone in a White House chamber and spoke to his anxious
and perplexed countrymen. Rabbi Stern followed the Presi-
dent's words again, as though he were in a trance. Dinah
and Leah listened with ever-accelerated trepidation. In
truth, “never man spake like this man!” In structure, the
speech was a masterpiece. It was read flawlessly, mellifluously.


## p. 318 (#352) ############################################

318 *es R E D POT TA GE
Now and then the voice of the radio-orator suggested the
grandeur of a Demosthenes hurling his Philippic against the
Macedonian counterpart of Adolf Hitler.
“This is not a fireside chat on war,” the President began.
“It is a talk on national security; because the nub of the
whole purpose of your President is to keep you now, and
your children later, and your grandchildren much later, out
of a last ditch war, for the preservation of American inde-
pendence and all the things that American independence
means to you and to me and to ours.”
Soon the President was delineating the nefarious activities
of Adolf Hitler's agents in the United States.
“Let us no longer blind ourselves to the undeniable fact
that the evil forces which have crushed and undermined and
corrupted so many others are already within our own gates.
Your Government knows much about them and every day is
ferreting them out. Their secret emissaries,” the President
disclosed, “are active in our own and in neighboring coun-
tries. They seek to stir up suspicion and dissension to cause
internal strife. They try to turn capital against labor, and
vice versa. They try to reawaken long slumbering racial and
religious enmities which should have no place in this country.
They are active in every group that promotes intolerance.
They exploit for their own ends our natural abhorrence of
war. These troublebreeders have but one purpose. It is to
divide our people into hostile groups and to destroy our
unity and shatter our will to defend ourselves.”
Rabbi Stern winced. Was the President of the United States
wholly undisturbed by the analogous infiltration and espion-
age program of the Communist conspiracy? And as to this
apparently startling revelation of Nazi infestation, Stern and
other members of his American Legion post in Cincinnati,
seven years before, had been stymied when they sought to
warn their countrymen of the world-wide menace of Hitler's
Third Reich.

Now the President arrayed all the cogent causes for an
all-out participation of the United States on the side of the
Allies—short of war—when he said categorically:
“The people of Europe who are defending themselves do
not ask us to do their fighting. They ask us for the imple-
ments of war, the planes, the tanks, the guns, the freighters
which will enable them to fight for their liberty and for our
security. Emphatically, we must get these weapons to them
in sufficient volume and quickly enough, so that we and our
children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which
others have had to endure. . . . There is no demand for
sending an American Expeditionary Force outside our own
borders. There is no intention by any member of your Gov-
ernment to send such a force. You can, therefore, nail any
talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth.”
Deliberate untruth? Twenty-three years before, another
President, Woodrow Wilson, had also addressed the nation
at a time such as this. He, too, had assured his fellow
countrymen that Britain and her allies wanted only Ameri-
can arms and armaments—and American dollars!
On February 8, 1941, the House of Representatives passed
the Lend-Lease bill. The vote was 260 to 165. The Senate
opened debate on the Lend-Lease bill on February 17th. It
amended and passed the bill on March 8th. The Senate vote
was 60 to 31. The bill was then returned to the House for
concurrence in the Senate amendments, and concurrence was
obtained on March 11th by a vote of 317 to 71.
“I signed the bill (Public No. 11, 77th Congress),” the
President wrote, “on March 11, 1941.”
Japan's triumph at Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941,
proved to be a colossal political and military blunder for
Japan, and for Germany. Had Japan pursued her original
program of co-prosperity for Asia and a kind of Monroe Doc-
trine protectorate for the Asians, she might have profited
prodigiously from her ally's (Germany) formidable penetra-

tion of Soviet Russia in the summer, the autumn, and the
early winter of 1941. But Japan was diverted from this most
favorable course by deliberate provocations covertly insti-
gated and executed by American Communists occupying
vital positions in the Federal Government. It was no mere
fortuitous coincidence that the authors of the Lend-Lease
Act (who themselves were not members of the American
Communist conspiracy) were associated with Harry Dexter
White, Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, and a key
man in the Kremlin underground apparatus. White's influ-
ence on American foreign policy was massive. And he wielded
this power while he served as a topflight agent of the Soviet
Government.
In April, 1942, there were, according to Professor Felix
Morley, one of the nation's keenest students of foreign affairs,
many Americans who did not realize that the attack on Pearl
Harbor was a logical and predictable consequence of our
State Department note of November 26, 1941, which de-
manded that Japan support Chiang Kai-shek and “withdraw
all military, naval, air and police forces from China and from
Indo-China,” as a preliminary to resumption of trade rela-
tions by the United States.
This American ultimatum of November 26th, which ended
all possibility of peaceful negotiation with Japan, was based
on a memorandum issued by Harry Dexter White.
It is only too obvious that the crushing blow dealt the
United States by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor was the con-
summation of Soviet world-wide espionage, curiously aided
and abetted by Germany's parallel proddings of the Japanese
war lords. An easy victory on the part of the Japanese mili-
tary might was envisioned by the German high command as
the sure means of eliminating the United States as a possible
and powerful ally to Great Britain and France. It was con-
fidently believed that the immobilization of the United States
would be followed by the staggering subjugation of Soviet
Russia. Germany, Japan, and the third axis power, Italy,

would then divide up the world among themselves. This was
the promise held out to the Japanese while that Oriental
country was in the process of swallowing up most of China,
including Manchuria.
Had the United States not been drawn into the world war
on the side of Great Britain, France, and Soviet Russia and
had Japan been content with her continental acquisitions in
Asia, Adolf Hitler could have administered the coup de
grace to Marshal Joseph Stalin and the Bolshevik bureaucracy.
That the two war-drunk nations, Germany and Japan, were
decisively foiled must be attributed to the marvelous creative
and co-operative genius of one hundred thirty million Ameri-
cans whose spiritual high priest was not President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt in Washington, but Winston Churchill,
prime minister of the British Empire, speaking out of the
rubble of a city glorified by the sublimity of her suffering.
The faith and courage manifested by Winston Churchill
and the people whom he served were irresistible, challenging,
overwhelming. “Often at night,” reported Ben Robertson, an
American observer, “I went to the public shelters of which
even the best was a sort of hell upon earth—and there I
began to realize the toughness of the British character. They
complained about conditions in the shelters and started a
political campaign demanding improvements; but there was
never any thought of their not enduring shelter life. It was
something they had to face, so they faced it, with discipline
and with order. That quality which made the British soldiers
stand in line on the Dunkirk beach and wait their turn to
board a ship now cropped up again. Londoners placed pieces
of paper with their names on them in certain spaces in the
subway stations, and the public respected those slips of paper
as shelter rights.
“The shelters of London were decent places even if they
were savage. Walking into any of them, you would find peo-
ple laid out in rows with just enough room to stretch—they
did not even have the space corpses are given in graveyards.

I never got accustomed to such sights—to think that this in
my lifetime could happen to the people of London. Here
they were, the people who ruled a fourth of the globe, mas-
ters of the empire on which the sun never sets. Here they
were, forced to live like a primitive savage race beneath the
earth, and demonstrating that they could take it.”
True, Great Britain had played her old diplomatic devices
only too blunderingly. She had coddled Germany's Third
Reich. She had condoned both Japanese and Italian flagrant
violations of treaties. Around the world, the record of British
diplomacy—poignantly in Ethiopia, Czechoslovakia, Palestine,
India, and China—dipped down to perhaps the lowest levels
of vacillation, pusillanimity (most astoundingly in Nanking,
China, in 1937), and baffling intransigeance.
Notwithstanding, all these fateful and baleful diplomatic
delinquencies were swiftly eclipsed and counterbalanced by
Great Britain's supernal stand against Germany's supposedly
invincible air armada. With few exceptions, all the great
capitals of continental Europe had capitulated to Adolf
Hitler. Only London and her more than six million extraor-
dinary British dared to defy Marshal Hermann Goering's
satanic winged wasters. Retribution had come to the British
Isles in full measure. But the British had atoned for the sins
of their statesmen, in the sweat, the tears, the devastation,
the blood, and the degradation of the inhabitants of the
empire's beloved capital.
At about this time, Rabbi Milton Stern wrote to his friend,
Senator Lister Hill, in Washington. Among other things, he
called his attention to this remarkably pertinent passage in
the first chapter of the Book of the Prophet Habakkuk:
“Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder mar-
velously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not
believe, though it be told you.
“For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs.

“They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
dignity shall proceed of themselves.
“Their horses are also swifter than the leopards, and are more
fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread
themselves, and their horsemen shall come from afar; they shall
fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.
“They shall come all for violence: their face shall sup up as
the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
“And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
shall heap dust, and take it.
“Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
offend, imputing this his power unto his god.
“Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy
One? We shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them for
judgment; and O mighty God, thou hast established them for
correction.”

CHAPTER XXIX
LIBERALS ON THE QUICKSANDS OF TIME
HE American road to World War II was thus paved
Øº solid rational and emotional blocks of con-
crete. Nor was President Roosevelt the sole builder
of that fearful causeway to cataclysmic carnage and suffering.
On June 11, 1940, the Cincinnati Times-Star ran the head-
line, “Pittsburgh Bishop Calls for War,” and reported:
“Bishop Alexander Mann of the Pittsburgh Episcopal Dio-
cese heard Premier Mussolini announce war against the
Allies, then declared before a luncheon gathering: “This
brutal attack upon human dignity, human rights, human free-
dom, must be stopped and in this stoppage we must do our
part. The position which to me seems Christian is to take
arms in defense of the liberty and welfare of our fellow
citizens.’”
Bishop Mann's call to arms was indeed of towering sig-
nificance. In the year 1932, before Franklin D. Roosevelt
was entrusted with the administration of the executive gov-
ernment of the United States, a unique survey was conducted
by the publication World Tomorrow. Of the 19,000 Protes-
tant clergymen who responded, sixty-two per cent answered
“yes” to the question: “Do you believe that the churches
of America should now go on record as refusing to sanction
or support ANY future war?” For nearly eight years, with
noteworthy congruity, clergymen of all denominations—
Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish—resolutely and ardently
marched along with the President in the vanguard of pacifism.
Bishop Mann was not as a sparrow twittering alone upon
a housetop. The mighty arm and the powerful voice of
Church and Synagogue, like great and strong winds, rent the
325

326 *ēs R E D POT TA GE
mountains of pacifist resolutions and broke in pieces the
rocks of pious platitudes on nonresistance. In the United
States, other clergymen and many laymen were not content
with individual calls to arms. On the morning of April 20,
1941, the Cincinnati Enquirer carried the headline, “Hitler
Defeat Is Aim of Group,” and out of New York City came
the incredible press release: “Establishment of “The Fight
for Freedom Committee' . . . was announced tonight. Re-
porting a key membership of more than 200 men and women
and headed by Episcopal Bishop Henry W. Hobson, Cincin-
nati, and Senator Carter Glass (Democrat), Virginia, the
committee issued a manifesto, declaring:
“‘Once we accept the fact that we are at war—even
though it may be undeclared—we shall at last find a peace
within ourselves which can never come as long as we seek
safety at the cost of others’ sacrifice. . . . The time has come
for the vigorous use of our full resources. We must win the
battle of production. We must use our shipping, our navy,
and our air force to help safeguard the transportation of vital
supplies across the ocean. We must throw our full weight
now into the fight for freedom, knowing that if this means
war, it also means the surest and swiftest road to peace.”
“Asserting that “troubled Christians have asked me how I
as a minister can urge that we face the fact that we are
involved in war,” Bishop Hobson said: “Force in a moment
of emergency is at times the only weapon which will prevent
evil from triumphing over right when we are faced by one
who has made himself impervious to the action of God's
spirit.”
“‘We believe,” said the bishop, ‘that from the standpoint
of the destruction which war brings, the way of the isola-
tionist will be far more devastating in its effect than the
course we urge. For following the isolationist way, we would
be left alone to face the final onrush of aggression from all
sides in a total war. . . .’”

R E D POT TA GE 22.5" 327
And among the Cincinnatians who, in the spring of 1941,
subscribed to the Fight for Freedom Committee's manifesto
were two rabbis, a Protestant minister, a retired president of
the University of Cincinnati, a physician, and four other
prominent citizens of the community.
Perhaps it was Bishop Eivind Berggrav of Norway who
first propounded the new doctrine. After four months’ ex-
perience with Adolf Hitler's Quisling liberators, the disillu-
sioned churchman sent forth this revelation: “God’s peace
. is not something finished and done with . . . not ours
to keep forever. The peace is won by accompanying God
into the battle. It is then it grows, becomes new and real.
It is in battle we feel the peace.”
Out of Switzerland came forth an epistle of similar light-
ning-like impact. The author was the world's most influential
Protestant theologian, Calvinist Karl Barth. Reversing his
prewar stand, Barth now declared just as solemnly: “We
Christians do not accept this war as a necessary evil. We
approve it as a righteous war, which God commands us to
wage ardently.”
“The Christians who do not realize that they must take
part unreservedly in this war,” wrote the great churchman,
“must have slept over their Bibles as well as over their
newspapers.”
In this letter to the people of Great Britain, Barth added:
“I have been struck, on my side, by the fact that in your
pronouncements various other conceptions have been put
forward as primary and ultimate reasons such as ‘Western
civilization,’ ‘the liberty of the individual,’ ‘freedom of knowl-
edge,’ ‘the infinite value of the human personality,” “the
brotherhood of man,’ ‘social justice,” etc. . . . There is no
need for me to assure you that the terms you use have a very
positive meaning for me also. . . . But do those conceptions
sufficiently indicate the distance between us and Hitler?
Must we not make the gulf much wider? Ought not our
opposition to him be genuinely Christian? Our resistance to

Hitler will be built on a really sure foundation only when
we resist him unequivocally in the name of peculiarly Chris-
tian truth, unequivocally in the name of Jesus Christ. . . .”
From Rome came the voice of Pope Pius XII. To the
3,000 assembled pilgrims, the Bishop of Rome and the head
of the Roman Catholic Church affirmed his acceptance of
the arbitrament of arms: “Although war is horrifying, it
cannot be denied that it reveals the greatness of many heroic
souls, who sacrifice their lives to carry out the duties imposed
by Christian conscience.”
Then, from Los Angeles, Rabbi Stern received another
exposition and rationalization of the Church's conversion. In
a review of a book entitled The Christian Attitude Toward
War, the magazine critic wrote: “The author begins with the
statement that there is such a thing as a just war—just on the
part of those who defend their lives and homes against un-
provoked aggression, but sin on the part of those who press
the attack. If the people of Europe had not resisted the
Mohammedan invasions, Europe would have been conquered
and Christianity stamped out. If, after the time of the Refor-
mation, Protestants had not resisted the Roman Catholic
persecutions, crimes such as were practiced in the Spanish
Inquisition would have been common all over Europe and
Protestantism would have been destroyed. If the American
colonists had not fought for their rights, our country would
not have gained its independence.
“Following through the Old Testament, it is shown that
God many times gave Israel direct command to go into battle
against enemies and He gave them victory. Many of the
Psalms are prayers for guidance in war or hymns of thanks-
giving for victory. Wars were used of God as a means for
gaining righteous ends.”
“The claim that our Lord,” averred the magazine critic,
“forbade the Christian to take part in war is shown to have
no real support and the author emphasizes the stress put by
Christ upon the authority of the Old Testament. The Mas-

ter's teachings having to do with nonresistance are shown to
apply only in cases of personal injustices and furnish no
excuse for dodging obligation to defend others.
“The author shows clearly that while the Christian is com-
manded to love his enemies, this does not imply that he is
not to defend himself when in danger nor does it follow that
he hates one he is compelled to ward off. Christian love is
not necessarily expressed by placing one's self and those un-
der his protection at the mercy of an enemy.
“If there can be a Christian policeman, there can be a
Christian soldier.
“And certainly to offer to render ‘noncombatant service’
in the promotion of war purposes is no way out for a Chris-
tian. It is but a confession of cowardice.”
But the thunder of the clergy did not captivate the hearts
of all Americans. Emotionally, our great continental nation
was overwhelmed by a flood of confusion and discord. The
electric ebb and flow of the waves of war was graphically
centered in the halls of the Congress of the United States.
In an editorial, “The Senate Gives Its Opinion,” the Cincinnati
Times-Star records:
“It is to the credit of the Senate that it put on quite an
uprising Monday in favor of the senior Senator from Mon-
tana. Wheeler has been a member of the Senate since 1923;
his character ought to be fairly well known to members of
the Upper House.”
“Wheeler had just replied,” the editorial continued, “to
Secretary of War Stimson's attack upon him in which he
charged the Montanan with near treason because some anti-
war post cards he had sent out had gone to soldiers. Wheeler
repeated his explanation that the cards were sent to a com-
mercial mailing list of a million names; that the order went
out before the proposal to extend the service of draftees and
national guardsmen had been advanced; and that to the best
of his knowledge and belief only three cards went to soldiers.

“Senators La Follette, Truman, Clark (Missouri), and
Chavez spoke for Wheeler. Tydings called Stimson's state-
ment “an unjust attack on one of the outstanding men of his
time.” “If this country should become involved in war,’ said
Tydings, “no one will work harder to win that war than the
Senator from Montana.”
“‘Senator Wheeler,’ said Vandenberg, ‘represents not the
seeds of treason but the hope of democracy.’”
“The applause at this point,” recounts the editorial, “was
so great that the Vice-President warned that another demon-
stration would cause him to close the galleries. Even Barkley
described Wheeler as ‘one of the ablest and most courageous
men in the United States.”
“Under questioning by Senator Taft, the Administration
leader in the Senate said that he did not believe that Wheeler's
action in sending out the cards justified the charge of treason.
Ellison D. Smith of South Carolina asked the Senate to call
on the Executive Departments “to keep their mouths out of
our business.”
“The most dramatic tribute to Wheeler came from Hiram
Johnson. “Every man in this chamber should be proud of
you. I take my stand for the Senator from Montana. For
God’s sake, have we reached the point in government where
there is no right of petition, where there is no right of free
speech? If Wheeler goes to a concentration camp, I will go
with him.”
“Probably no American,” concluded the editor, “has ever
been subjected to such a smear campaign as has been directed
at Wheeler in recent weeks. They have called this Massa-
chusetts Yankee, transferred to a Montana environment, a
user of subversive methods and an ally of Hitler. Of course,
those who take the trouble to read history know it's all a
part of the usual technique of getting a country into war.
The advocates of war always try to frighten and beat down
the opposition by methods similar to those which have been
used against Wheeler.”

The torrential rain of war and antiwar propaganda cas-
caded over the radio and across the pages of newspapers,
magazines, pamphlets, and books. Dr. George Gallup’s
(American Institute of Public Opinion) nationwide poll in
August, 1940, conclusively indicated that the youth of
America favored compulsory military training, though many
congressmen in the national capital tenaciously clung to the
tradition of no peacetime conscription. New England and
the South seemed to be predominantly internationalist and
interventionist in sentiment.
The swollen waters of dissension were surcharged by the
skepticism, the sober calculations, and the quickened fore-
sight of sagacious political observers, among them William
Hard. Early in February, 1941, Hard published this bold
thesis:
“What will Britain do with that victory? What political
and territorial arrangements, conducive to peace or provoca-
tive of new wars, will she make in Western Europe, in Africa,
in eastern and southern Asia?
“What commercial arrangements, what monetary arrange-
ments, helpful or unhelpful to us, will she proceed to estab-
lish on her trade routes, old and new, all around the globe?
“Will her world commitments and her world activities,
THIS TIME, be any more productive of peace for the world
and of peace for us than they were LAST TIME?
“Will her trade empire, which includes many regions be-
sides her Dominions and her Colonies and Possessions, be
operated to our benefit or to our hurt? Have we any binding
understanding with Britain on these points?
“The answer is: None at all. The victory will have been
won with our resources, but it will be a British victory. We
shall have been stokers and oilers in the boiler room of the
British ship of state with all the deck officers and navigators
British and with a British captain sailing the ship to a
purely British destination.

“More than a century ago, when the formulation of the
Monroe Doctrine was discussed in President Monroe's cabi-
net, the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams remarked
that he did not want to see the United States ‘come in as a
cockboat in the wake of the British man-of-war.”
“Is it possible that the manly self-respect we had in the
days of our weakness shall depart from us in the days of our
strength? Is it possible that we shall be more provincial, more
colonial, more obsequious than we were then? Shall Britain,
our ‘rim of freedom’ and our ‘first defense, both fight the
war and dictate the peace? Besides these parasites on British
valor, shall we also be satellites to British world politics?
“From 1919 to 1933, Britain failed to give democratic
Germany the support that would have enabled it to remain a
democracy. From 1933 onward, Britain failed to give Hit-
ler's Germany the prompt and easy repressions that would
have prevented it from rearming itself into a military menace.
Britain has proved herself to be as incapable of operating the
European Continent as we are ourselves.
“The bargaining power of a joint American-British trad-
ing area would make the bargaining power of the totalized
whole of the European Continent look sick—sick unto
death.”
When William Hard's candid inquiry appeared in the
Reader's Digest of February, 1941, the recrudescence of a
house divided was only as a “little cloud out of the sea, like
a man's hand.” Rabbi Stern first felt the shock of that
national phenomenon on the evening of Saturday, February
15th. He had traveled, unaccompanied, by air from Cincin-
nati to Louisville, Kentucky, in response to an invitation to
attend a regional meeting of the Jewish War Veterans at the
Kentucky Hotel. Speech had followed speech. As Stern
listened, his amazement mounted. What he heard, for the
most part, was a volcanic eruption of sulphuric aspersion
against the character and the record, not of aliens, but of
tried and honored fellow American citizens. Stern could

R E D POT TA GE 25” 333
condone unrestrained condemnation of Nazi atrocities. But
the common standards of fair play, mature judgment, and
practical patriotism could not countenance entangling Nazi
madness with the good name, the integrity, and the loyalty
of Charles A. Lindbergh, General Hugh S. Johnson, Senator
Burton K. Wheeler, and Senator Gerald P. Nye. Why should
Jews, whose religious leaders had been foremost as pacifists,
now excoriate those who claimed the right and the duty to
hold fast to the nation's policy of nonintervention in foreign
wars? Is pacifism a rock-ribbed principle? Or is it merely
an evanescent expedient?
What true liberal, humanitarian, or humanist could make
American isolationism synonymous with anti-Semitism? Hit-
ler had slaughtered and imprisoned Protestants and Catholics
by the hundreds of thousands. Goering's Luftwaffe over War-
saw, Rotterdam, and London had dropped bombs indiscrimi-
nately upon millions of Christians. Hitler's fascist confederate,
Soviet Russia's Joseph Stalin, was no whit less anti-Semitic
than the Socialist Führer.
When Stern began, in his turn, to chide the speakers who
had preceded him, the reaction of the two hundred diners
was unmistakable. The rabbi could feel the consternation
which gripped the audience.
“The Dutch-Jewish philosopher, Spinoza,” Stern said,
“taught that the great obstacle to intelligent behavior is the
superior vividness of present sensations as compared with
those projected memories which we call imagination. The
great need of our twentieth-century generation is for clear,
calm, prudent thinking. The real enemy of civilization is the
regime in Moscow.”
Stern caught the sure signs of irritation and displeasure.
He heard the rumblings of wrathful resentment. But he
would not retreat from his position of reasonable impar-
tiality. Nor would he recant his refutation of the priority of
the German peril.

“War, famine, and political demoralization but play into
the hands of the Bolshevists. America must be vigilant.
America must be sure who are her real enemies. At this
time we would do well to ponder the admonition of George
Washington: ‘The government sometimes participates in the
national propensity and adopts through passion what reason
would reject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the
nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride,
ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The
peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has
been the victim.’”
As Stern sat down, there followed a wild scrambling to
confute the rabbi. The chairman, Percy Friedlander, at
length recognized Charles W. Morris, a Louisville Jewish
elder. Morris' words were acrid. The Louisville elder spoke
contemptuously of Stern's plea for a magnanimous reappraisal
of the words and actions of Lindbergh, Johnson, Wheeler,
and Nye. Other speakers in fiery sequence scoffed at Stern's
prediction of the enduring plague of Communism.
The flood of confusion crested on March 11, 1941, when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt archly affixed his signature
to the Lend-Lease Act.
“This is it, Leah,” Rabbi Stern said, solemnly. “This day
marks the informal entry of the United States into World
War II.”
“You are wrong, Milt,” his wife answered. “President
Roosevelt assures us that all this lend-lease business is to
keep us out of the war—to confine the war to the continent
of Europe.”
“Let’s wait and see what Hitler will do,” said Dinah. “It’s
his move now. He has done everything thus far to keep us
out. He has not forgotten what America did in the first
World War.”
“I am wondering what his next move will be,” said Leah.

“Hitler still has Japan, perhaps his last card. If Hitler
plays that card wisely, he may tie us up in the Pacific so
that we won't be able to countervail his time schedule of
conquests in Europe and Africa. For almost two years now,
Hitler has had everything going his way.”
“I am wondering,” said Dinah, “how many American ships
convoying lend-lease goods to Europe the German subma-
rines will sink before Congress declares war.”
“But,” Leah answered, sharply, “the President came out
flatly and said that convoys do not mean shooting nor does
shooting mean war.”
“How, then,” asked the rabbi, “is Roosevelt going to be
able to keep his campaign promise not to send our boys to
fight in foreign wars?”
“Don’t worry about that, Milt,” Dinah retorted, grimly.
“Mrs. Roosevelt has an answer for that one, too. She says
that the President did not promise he would not go to war
—if we are attacked.”

CHAPTER XXX
FLIGHT FROM THE “SOCIALISM OF LABOR”
HE Fight for Freedom Committee, headed by the
Øº Bishop Henry W. Hobson of Cincinnati
and United States Senator Carter Glass of Virginia,
came into being on April 19, 1941, in New York City. The
Fight for Freedom Committee was patently interventionist,
anti-isolationist, and war-minded. Seven months before
Bishop Hobson and Senator Glass and the committee of two
hundred issued their martial manifesto, General Robert E.
Wood, chairman of the board of Sears, Roebuck and Com-
pany in Chicago, brought forth the noninterventionist Amer-
ica First Committee. This was in September, 1940. General
Wood had every reason to believe that he was embarking
on a “popular and respectable crusade.” Concurrently, Pres-
ident Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his campaign for a third
term, grandiloquently pledged all-out aid to Great Britain
and her allies “short of war.”
The initial campaign of the America First Committee was
“sincere and dignified.” The membership was select. No
adherent of Communism, Nazism, or any form of Fascism
was wittingly admitted. Into the America First organization
came Lessing J. Rosenwald, son of the founder of Sears, Roe-
buck and Company, an intimate friend of General Wood and
one of the country's famed Jewish philanthropists. Also, ac-
cording to the weekly magazine Time, “Eager to speak for
its cause was such an impeccably American woman as Kath-
leen Norris, . . . a sincere and emotional pacifist who hates
war.” Identified with Wood, Rosenwald, and Norris as
“America Firsters” and serving on the national committee
were Chester Bowles, Hanford MacNider (past commander

ton K. Wheeler, Dr. George H. Whipple, Major Alford J.
Williams, and Janet Ayer Fairbank. Likewise, among the
prominent Americans who contributed “literature” and
speeches to the cause was Robert M. Hutchins, president of
the University of Chicago.
At the outset, the members of the America First Com-
mittee confined themselves chiefly to writing to the President.
But in January, 1941, when the Lend-Lease debate began in
the Congress, “like a bean patch under a hot sun, opposi-
tion sprouted up and down the country” and the America
First Committee crusade went into high gear on a national
scale. In April, 1941, Charles A. Lindbergh joined the
movement and soon after became its most vocal and most
controversial advocate.
Early in April, 1941, Rabbi Stern wrote to his Hebrew
Union College schoolmate, Dr. Solomon A. Fineberg, director
of the community service unit of the American Jewish Com-
mittee. One of the vice-presidents of the American Jewish
Committee was Lessing J. Rosenwald of Chicago.
“I am taking the liberty,” Stern stated, “of sending you the
enclosed reprint of a New York Daily News editorial. It
came to me from the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai
B'rith in Chicago.
“Do you remember what I said might happen if such
organizations as the Jewish War Veterans took the lead in
advocating the passage of such acts as H. R. 1776?

“In the same connection, please note that the March 27
issue of the Cincinnati American Israelite carried the reprint
of this Daily News editorial under a first page headline call-
ing attention to the fact that Christians were foremost in
pushing the so-called Lend-Lease bill. You see, this is a
sign of fear.
“Bishop Hobson of our city is brutally frank in his inter-
ventionist statements. But no one is inclined to denounce
the Episcopal Church of which he is one of the most promi-
nent members. Unfortunately—and we must not ostrich on
this axiom—this does not follow when a Jew or a Jewish
organization lets the world know what's on his mind.
“My plea is: Let's first think and then speak as Ameri-
cans and as lovers of our fellow men. The Jewish factor will
be taken care of vastly more satisfactorily, I believe, if we
follow this course.”
Later that month came a telephone call and a letter from
Robert J. Lavell, principal of a Cincinnati elementary school
and also a fellow member of the American Legion. Accom-
panying the letter were copies of speeches and articles pre-
pared by Robert M. Hutchins and John T. Flynn. Would
Stern attend a meeting at the Taft Auditorium, under the
auspices of the Metropolitan Cincinnati Chapter of the
America First Committee? Would he offer the invocation?
Cincinnati's Mayor James Garfield Stewart would introduce
the principal speaker, United States Senator C. Wayland
Brooks of Illinois. Lavell's letter concluded: “We sincerely
hope, through our organization, to be able to prevent the
climax in national disunity which threatens to come to pass.”
The correspondence with Principal Lavell was followed up
with a statement from J. Austin White, chairman of the
metropolitan chapter. “Naturally we hope that your interest
in keeping America out of another ‘war to end all wars’ will
continue active and positive, and that you will use your
influence to enlighten the people of this country of the real
danger to our own democracy if we become actively involved

in a second sentimental effort to save freedom and democracy
for everybody else in the world.”
Whether designedly or merely coincidentally, Bishop
Henry W. Hobson and his equally zealous band in Cincinnati
arranged a mass meeting of the Fight for Freedom Com-
mittee to be held also at the Taft Auditorium, offering as
their champion Colonel William J. Donovan, of New York
City's renowned 69th Regiment of the 27th Division of the
American Expeditionary Force. The Fight for Freedom
Committee's conclave was scheduled for Wednesday evening,
May 14th, one night prior to the meeting of the America
First supporters.
When, therefore, Captain Victor Heintz, Stern's World
War I comrade-in-arms, also telephoned and asked him to
take part in the Donovan rally, the rabbi's predicament was
compounded. Captain Heintz was urgent, almost command-
ing. The Cincinnati attorney, former congressman, and co-
founder of the local City Charter Party, would not accept a
declination. “You must be there, Sergeant,” he importuned.
When Stern returned to his study he reported his conver-
sation with Captain Heintz to his brother.
“I wouldn't go to the America First meeting, Milt,” said
Sidney. “People will assume that you endorse the America
First program. Why not just go to the Fight for Freedom
rally?”
“Sidney,” answered his brother, “I have never turned down
any call for rabbinical or civic service. When I was the
national field representative of the Union of American He-
brew Congregations, among my many activities, I conducted
services at hospitals for the mentally ill and also at prisons.
Some of the men and women who attended those prayer
meetings were serving life terms for murder and other major
crimes. Why should I turn down this invitation from the
America First Committee? Bob Lavell is one of Cincinnati's
finest citizens. Mayor Stewart will be there.

“And what's wrong with Senator Brooks of Illinois, Sid-
ney?” the rabbi continued. “We regard him as one of the
most distinguished veterans of the World War. At the out-
break of the war, Brooks enlisted in the Marine Corps. One
of his three brothers who fought in the last war is buried in
England. The senator's father was a wartime Y.M.C.A.
worker.” -
“But now that you have acceded to Captain Heintz's re-
quest,” Sidney asked, “wouldn't it be rather preposterous to
pray for the America First Committee?”
On the afternoon of May 14, 1941, the Cincinnati Times-
Star reported:
“The unusual experience of being on the platform on two
successive nights at mass meetings representing two opposite
views on the question of American policy in relation to the
World War has fallen to Rabbi Milton Stern who was blinded
in action in the first World War. Wednesday night Rabbi
Stern will be on the stage with Col. William J. Donovan at
a rally sponsored by the Fight for Freedom Committee.
Thursday night he will occupy a seat alongside U. S. Senator
C. Wayland Brooks, of Illinois, at the Taft Auditorium, at
a mass meeting under the auspices of Metropolitan Cincinnati
Chapter, America First Committee.
“Rabbi Stern stated,” the newspaper recounted, “that he
had accepted invitations to both meetings because both
speakers are friends of his. “I regard both men as great
Americans,” Rabbi Stern said. “I believe that by participat-
ing in both meetings I will, in a sense, be dramatizing my
plea that the people listen to both sides of any important
public issue with patience and tolerance.”
“‘I have the conviction that both these men—Col. Dono-
van and Senator Brooks—are Americans first and that they
certainly do not want to be set up as men who are splitting
this nation. They represent two different aspects of an im-
portant vital question, but they both speak as Americans.
There is a tremendous need for unity among us and less need

for name-calling and the hurling of epithets. We want more
of light and less of heat. The people can hear both sides
without the injection of hate or malice or name-calling.’”
Colonel William J. Donovan's address at the downtown
theatre, before an audience of nearly two thousand, was not
a clear-cut call to arms. As a special emissary of President
Roosevelt, Colonel Donovan had traveled thirty-five thou-
sand miles through Europe during the past two years. He was
now convinced that a victorious Germany would dominate
all of Europe and, in time, all of Latin America.
“Behind all this German force of mechanized might and
hundreds of divisions, the colonel declared, “there are cer-
tain to be weaknesses, and if we give to England the means
by which she can carry her battle, these weaknesses will be
revealed.
“We will be harmed if Hitler wins. Our outpost lines will
have been destroyed. If Hitler wins, we will have to redraft
our plans for the future. Our trade, our standard of living,
our concept of human life would all be placed in jeopardy.
We will have to match Germany's military and sea power if
we are to maintain our way of life. The conflict between
the two systems is irreconcilable and inevitable.”
Post cards addressed to President Roosevelt were distrib-
uted among the assembly. The card read: “The danger which
faces America from Nazism is absolute. The time for half
measures is gone. We can win if we fight. We believe a
national emergency must be proclaimed at once. We urge
a break in diplomatic relations with our implacable foes. We
urge the use of our mighty naval force to hold the seas of
the world against the enemies of the world. Let's wait no
longer.”
The morning headlines of the Cincinnati Enquirer sum-
marized the Fight for Freedom Committee rally: “German
army can be smashed by aiding British, says “Wild Bill’
Donovan. Nazis have not yet faced real test on battlefield.”


## p. 343 (#377) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 25” 343
But the next evening, another two thousand enthusiastic
men and women came to hear the senator from Illinois. The
tone of the assembly was akin to that of a religious revival.
In his opening prayer, Rabbi Stern recited lines from Alfred
Lord Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall”:
“For I dipped into the future, far as human eye
could see.
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the
wonders that would be;
Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies
of magic sails,
Pilot of the purple twilight, dropping down
with costly bales;
. . . . Far along the world-wide whisper of
the south-wind rushing warm,
With the standards of the peoples plunging
through the thunder-storm;
Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the
battle-flags were furled
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of
the world.
There the common sense of most shall hold a
fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapped in
universal law.”
In his presentation of the seven-time-wounded and thrice-
decorated Marine Corps veteran, Mayor James Garfield
Stewart vehemently upbraided the labeling of the America
First Committee and their seven thousand local members as
pro-Nazi. The Cincinnati Republican leader pleaded: “In
this day of extreme danger to our country and its free insti-
tutions, it is logic and reason which must prevail—and not
name-calling. It's hate that has caused all of this hell in
Europe and we want friendship in America. We are now
engaged in an intensive campaign for national preparedness
on which there is a unanimity of opinion, because everyone
who loves America wants to see her made so impregnable
that she cannot be attacked from outside or from within.”

Senator Brooks's mood was that of a man acquainted with
travail and with the personal tragedy of war. The senator
told of the poignant part which he and other members of his
family had taken in the first World War. He reported what
he heard at committee hearings in Washington. He was over-
whelmed by the fear that some Americans would accept war
as perhaps the only way out of a seemingly hopeless, crush-
ing economic depression.
“I’ve said all along that I wanted Britain to win this war,”
the senator said gravely. “I wish I knew I was right in want-
ing that to happen, because she didn't do a very good job
with her victory last time.”
This rebuttal of Colonel Donovan's central thesis was
greeted with prolonged applause.
“When we move to that day of convoys”—here again
Senator Brooks challenged the opinion enunciated by Presi-
dent Roosevelt's special emissary at the Wednesday evening
meeting—“that will be our declaration of war. The first time
that flag of ours goes down into the sea, something will surge
up in the American breast—that something that always fol-
lows the American flag. But let us not send that flag where
we will have to follow it again into another bloody, unneces-
sary war.”
The United States Senator from Illinois also confessed his
fear that America's entry into the war would mean giving
the President dictatorial powers. “I hate totalitarianism so
much,” he declared, “that I don’t want to establish it over
here while we go to fight it over there.”
Then Senator Brooks struck out against perhaps the most
sensitive of all arguments.
“During the Lend-Lease debate, Churchill promised the
American people that he would never ask for American boys
—that all England needed was the tools with which to fight
the war. But now Churchill wants convoys, and I say to you
that you don't convoy guns, and tanks, and airplanes, and
munitions with pigeons.”

R E D POT TA GE 22.5" 345
The senator reminded his auditors of the President's
numerous pledges to keep American boys out of foreign
wars. He painted a gloomy picture of the country's prospects
of winning a second world war, with our former allies, France
and Belgium, powerless to render effective aid, and with
Japan and Italy, also our first World War confederates, now
part of Germany's armed might.
“And if I were asked today,” the senator said, earnestly,
“whether I would fight for France again as I did in 1918,
my answer would be ‘no.’ Why should I fight for a country
that has surrendered itself?
“And,” he added, dramatically, “when they say to me that
we ought to fight for England, my answer is: “We’ve already
done that.’”
On the point which served as the cornerstone of Colonel
Donovan's ideological speculation, Senator Brooks boldly
prophesied: “If we can keep our free government and our
free instiutions, I say to you that we can outtrade the world.
But even if we have to sacrifice some of our trade, I'd rather
do that than to sacrifice the lives of our American boys.”
Above the din of these contrasting cataracts of controversy,
Rabbi Stern, from his point of vantage, never lost sight of
the personality of the disputants. Both Donovan and Brooks
were Christians: the former, a Catholic; the latter, a Protes-
tant. Professionally, both were lawyers. Donovan had served
in France with the 69th Regiment of the New York National
Guard, and Brooks had bled in the front lines with the
Marine Corps. Both, exemplars of the American citizen-
soldier, were eminent Republicans.
When the United States Senator from the Middle West
spoke so contemptuously of England and France, perhaps he
remembered that in 1919 the members of the German peace
delegation at Versailles were put in a barbed wire enclosure,
exposed as animals in a zoo, and denied any personal con-
tact with Allied representatives. No doubt, Senator Brooks
had not forgotten that the United States was not a signatory

to the ignoble Versailles Treaty and, consequently, was not
responsible for Germany's naked, neopagan thirst for re-
venge. Perhaps that thrice-decorated hero of the Marine
Corps, who doubtless had seen regiment upon regiment of
fellow Marines decimated on the battlefields of France, could
not now think kindly of Britain's Prime Minister who, in
urging an alliance with Russia, had confided to the Duke of
Windsor: “Sir, I would make a friend of the devil himself,
if it would save England.”
Two things stood out in Colonel Donovan's frigidly aca-
demic discourse at the Taft Auditorium. In rehearsing ex-
cerpts from a speech delivered by one of Adolf Hitler's sub-
ordinates in the Nazi hierarchy, the American President's
special emissary read the phrase “socialism of labor.” So-
cialism of labor! Then, this was the official sublimation of
German Fascism! Socialism of labor! All the terrors of the
concentration camps; all the mass persecution of Protestants,
Catholics, and Jews; all the horrors perpetrated by the Luft-
waffe and the U-boats; all the treachery of the quislings; all
the conquests of the Wehrmacht; and all the collusive cove-
nants with Soviet Russia, Italy, and Japan were all in the
name of and for the triumph of the “socialism of labor”!
Was the phrase “socialism of labor” but a German twist of
the Marx-Lenin mockery of the dictatorship of the proletariat?
Then, and then only, by way of illustration, Colonel Dono-
van referred to a fresh incident which he, with curious
optimism, believed to represent a flight from the thralldom
of the socialism of labor.
Four days before this odd juxtaposition of events at the
Taft Auditorium in Cincinnati, Rudolf Hess, who collabo-
rated with Adolf Hitler in the production of Mein Kampf
and who was at the time the number three man in the Nazi
high command, climaxed an eight-hundred-mile airplane trip
from a point in Germany to a secluded estate in Scotland by
dropping from a parachute. His landing in the darkness was
rough. However, he sustained only a slight injury to his ankle.

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 347
Up to that time, this was perhaps the most publicized use
of the parachute. Hess had come alone in a Messerschmitt,
leaving his wife, baby, and mother in Germany.
Colonel Donovan had interpreted this audacious adven-
ture as a sure sign and symptom of a breakdown in morale
in the Third Reich. According to the American observer,
Rudolf Hess had deserted the Nazi pack of fiendish barbarians.
This was dramatic, powerful proof that the conceit of Ger-
man invincibility, as set forth by “defeatist” Americans, was
but an illusion, a myth.
But Rudolf Hess had not come to seek sanctuary on British
soil. Had Rudolf Hess been successful in his real mission,
the lives of millions of his contemporaries in every part of
the world might have been radically altered. For Rudolf Hess
had come to Winston Churchill to sue for a cessation of
hostilities between Germany and Great Britain.
Nor was this alluring proffer of peace the ultimate goal of
Adolf Hitler. Behind it loomed a drastic shift in military
planning and strategy. Emerging from this envoy's extraordi-
nary aeronautical expedition was the incontrovertible infer-
ence that if Adolf Hitler would not venture to cross the
twenty miles which separated England from the European
continent, how could he, in the wildest moments of his power-
drunk imagination, propose the mammoth movement of
troops and supplies over the three thousand miles of ocean
to a vantage point on the eastern coast of the Western
Hemisphere?

CHAPTER XXXI
HONOR ANSWERETH ALL THINGS
“If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the
period is not far off when we may defy material injury from
external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as
will cause the neutrality, we may at any time resolve upon,
to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under
the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may
choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall
counsel.”
(George Washington, September 17, 1796)
legal holiday of uncommon national potency. Here,
as in the realm of religion, reverence for the dead
strengthens the union of the living. Memorial Day, dedicated
to the earnest and grateful recollection of the valor and sacri-
fice of American soldiers and sailors, must always be accom-
panied by a solemn rededication to the ideals and traditions
of the republic. The simple rites and ceremonies of Memorial
Day are conducive to stirring declarations and bold forecasts,
as the fertile mind and quickened imagination of every ster-
ling patriot reach back into the past and dip into the future.
On the morning of Friday, May 30, 1941, in Detroit, the
Julius Rosenwald Post of the American Legion held its twen-
tieth annual Memorial Day service at the Cloverhill Park
Cemetery, about sixteen miles from the heart of that great
industrial center. About one thousand persons filled the ceme-
tery chapel and the adjacent tent. On the chapel platform
were representatives of the three major veterans' organizations
and the rabbis and the cantor of Detroit's leading Conserva-
tive Jewish congregation.

The cemetery was the property of a section of Detroit's
flourishing Jewish community. For the most part, the audi-
ence was composed of the city's Jewish residents. The Ameri-
can Legion post, cosponsoring the program, was named in
tribute to the memory of the father of Lessing J. Rosenwald,
one of the conspicuous founders of the America First Com-
mittee.
Several months before, Rabbi Milton Stern had accepted an
invitation to deliver the Memorial Day oration at the Clover-
hill Park Cemetery. For Stern, an oration on May 30th had
become a routine assignment. However, in the preparation of
the 1941 Memorial Day address for the assembly in Detroit,
Stern labored like one unusually inspired. He weighed every
phrase prayerfully. The Detroit address was completed more
than a month before the advent of that sacred, commemora-
tive day. It was ready before the rallies of the Fight for Free-
dom Committee and the America First Committee in Cincin-
nati took place.
This spring of 1941 was indeed a critical period in the
life of the republic. For this was a time of war, war on a
mammoth scale. This was an hour which generated prophecy.
As the prophet Amos had declared: “The lion hath roared,
who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who can but
prophesy?” So Rabbi Stern exercised his mental and spiritual
powers in great matters and in things too high for ordinary
discourse. On Memorial Day in Detroit, he would dare to
give America's answer to the world-wide clamor for coura-
geous clarification of the paradoxical American utterance and
action.
In May, 1941, the city of Detroit offered the most appro-
priate stage for an outpouring of patriotic and prophetic
sentiments. Twenty years earlier, in the spring of 1921, the
citizens of Detroit had witnessed the first national convention
of the Disabled American Veterans of the World War. Many
of the delegates had come from hospital wards to arouse the
consciences of their fellow countrymen. They did not form

a terrifying horde of rebellious, obstreperous veterans. Their
deliberations at the Chamber of Commerce auditorium were
orderly. The resolutions which they compounded were rea-
sonable, calling for more and better equipped hospitals in
every part of the country and for more medical personnel.
They asked for more equitable compensation for the men
who, with their brawn, their blood, their bones, their minds,
and their youth, had definitively turned the tide of certain
defeat into victory for nigh-demoralized Great Britain and
France and, indirectly, for Bolshevik Russia.
At that time, Stern was only a divinity student. But as the
national chaplain of these disabled veterans, he was perhaps
the most effective exponent of more generous emoluments
for their patriotic services.
In the spring of 1941, the lofty standards of patriotic citi-
zenship were again subjected to severe tests. Early in March,
Congress had enacted the Lend-Lease Act. By their will, the
American people, through the votes of their elected repre-
sentatives, had made it clear to the world that they were
united at home in the determination to help a brave people
and to resist tyranny. The Lend-Lease bill of March, 1941,
had been swiftly implemented by large Congressional appro-
priations. But while President Roosevelt was pleading for
increased production of war supplies for the country's own
armed services as well as for those of Great Britain, the CIO
(Congress of Industrial Organizations) had tied up 200,000
men at one of the Ford plants in Detroit and stopped work
on $158,700,000 of defense orders.
That which the mighty lords of millions of wage earners
perpetrated in the Michigan metropolis was but an example
of the scandalous chicanery of rival factions and newly-
created barons of industry. Perhaps even more shocking,
even more staggering, was the intimation that much of this
reprehensible sabotage of the national defense program was
engineered by agents of the Kremlin, trained in Moscow to
become experts in treachery and criminal conspiracy. The

nefarious practices of the American Communists were alto-
gether consistent with the avowed and well publicized Com-
munist Party line, embodied in their brash dictum: “The
Yanks are not coming!”
For in the spring of 1941 the Socialist Adolf Hitler of
Germany and the Socialist Joseph Stalin of Russia were asso-
ciated in a joint program of imperialist expansion on a mas-
sive scale.
Equally significant, the name given to the cryptic, mimetic,
satellite front organization was, blasphemously, the American
League for Peace and Democracy. Commenting on this
fraudulently labeled, camouflaged Communist cell, and on
the American Youth Congress and the League of American
Writers, the great liberal, Max Eastman, wrote: “I have taken
these three examples from a list of over one hundred front
organizations dedicated ostensibly to all sorts of noble pur-
poses, but operated by Communist nuclei with but two ends
in view: defense of the Soviet Union and extension of Stalin's
brand of pseudo-socialist totalitarian gang-rule into the
United States.”
“Almost everyone of them,” Mr. Eastman stated, “repre-
sents the drawing into the Communist network of hundreds
of prominent Americans and the use of their names and
money for causes they actually despise. These organizations
have a rank-and-file membership of millions who are equally
innocent of the real purposes behind them.”
“Nothing in our history,” Mr. Eastman warned, “teaches
us how to combat this underground form of attack upon our
society. It is caused, in a world panic-stricken about its un-
solved economic problems, by the spread of a religious mania
—a fanatical belief in an earthly paradise.”
But the apparent anarchy prevalent in America's major
industrial cities was only a part of the general national con-
fusion. It was patent that President Roosevelt would no
longer hold the ship of state with moderation, perseverance,
and firmness to the circuitous course of neutrality. Instead,

in a delirium of messianic illusions, like a high-spirited
Viking, he steered the nation by many and devious ways
toward the maelstrom of war.
By proclamation on May 27th, without specific authoriza-
tion from the Congress, President Roosevelt transformed the
“limited” emergency declared on September 8, 1939, at the
outbreak of the war in Europe, into an “unlimited” national
emergency. The President transferred Coast Guard cutters
to Great Britain for convoy duty. Without warning, he seized
the ships of foreign countries tied up at various American
ports. He signed an agreement permitting the United States
to build air and naval bases on Denmark's vitally strategic
island of Greenland. In May, also, the President ordered
fifty American oil tankers turned over to the British and, if
necessary, to be convoyed through the Mediterranean.
In addition to the formal and formidable opposition of
the America First Committee, with Charles A. Lindbergh
as its spearhead, the voices and pens of other eminent and
revered citizens of the United States were raised in vigorous
protest against the President's prodigal acts of belligerency.
“But even if we assume that the American people will
eventually be persuaded to attempt the conquest of Europe,”
asked Freda Utley, author and lecturer, “what prospect is
there that the full scale participation would defeat Germany?
. . . Wishful thinkers will reply that an American expedi-
tionary force will not be needed, that Germany can be de-
feated by unlimited bombing, until civilian morale is shat-
tered. The answer to this was recently supplied by Bernard
Shaw when he pointed out that the wholesale bombing of
cities, whether in Germany or Britain, does not destroy
morale, but instead improves it, for it makes a people fight-
ing mad.
“Finally, it may be well to recollect that the wishful think-
ers, who now tell us that Germany can be conquered by
these other-than-orthodox military means, have been proved
tragically wrong in their past judgments. When the war

began, they were certain that Germany would soon collapse
from within on account of the hatred of the people for the
Nazi regime. They insisted that the Maginot Line was im-
pregnable, that the German army lacked trained officers, that
Germany lacked oil, iron and supplies, and today they are
confident that Russia will fight on indefinitely.”
“They must learn,” Miss Utley warned, “before it is too
late that this war cannot be won by words, or economic
blockades, or the building of unlimited numbers of bombing
planes; only superior armed might, on the actual field of
battle, can overcome the German war machine.”
“The last war having resulted in the destruction of democ-
racy all over Europe east of the Rhine, there is now an under-
lying distrust among Americans,” concluded this British-born
resident of the United States, “as to the possibility of saving
democracy by once again sacrificing millions of young men
in Europe's wars. The idea was well expressed by the late
Lord Lothian: ‘The lesson of the last war is that we get
neither democracy, nor liberty, nor peace out of a world war,
however noble the end for which it is fought.’”
From the pen of General Hugh Samuel Johnson flowed
these robust sentiments: “In this modern sloganeering day,
when life is too complex for the average layman to think
things through and the truth which he is allowed to hear is
too fragmentary to permit him to form his own sound judg-
ments, the constant repetition of a lie has become the most
frequently used and successful weapon of the propagandists.”
General Johnson's words could not fail to win a receptive
audience. Under President Woodrow Wilson, in 1917, Hugh
S. Johnson had been the chief architect and salesman of
the Selective Service Act. In the early years of the New
Deal, the general had served President Roosevelt as the
Deputy Administrator of both the National Recovery Act and
the Works Progress Administration. He had been Roosevelt’s
most fiery prophet.

“‘Britain Is Fighting Our War' is the slogan that the in-
terventionists repeat most frequently today,” General John-
son admonished. “This leading by the nose of American
public opinion to the opposite of its convictions and interests
is one of the most expert pieces of propaganda in all the
records of publicity—and, from the American standpoint,
one of the most evil.”
But it was the astonishing candor and audacity of Charles
A. Lindbergh's radio talks that fomented the fierce wrath of
the President and his privy council. One year before, Lind-
bergh had said bluntly and fearlessly: “As long as Ameri-
can nations work together, as long as we maintain reasonable
defense forces, there will be no invasion by foreign aircraft.
And no foreign navy will dare to approach within bombing
range of our coast. Our danger in America is an internal
danger. We need not fear a foreign invasion unless Ameri-
can people bring it on through their own quarreling and
meddling with affairs abroad. . . . Let us guard America
today as our forefathers guarded it in the past. They won
this country from Europe with a handful of revolutionary
soldiers. We certainly can hold it now with a population of
130,000,000 people. If we cannot, we are unworthy to have
it. . . . But above all, let us stop this hysterical chatter of
calamity and invasion that has been running rife the last few
days.”
Lindbergh was still not only unalterably opposed to inter-
vention. He was now pleading for an American-negotiated
peace to terminate the war in Europe. This cut to the heart
of the New Deal's neo-Platonic, nebulous speculations. For
these latter-day sophists, war would usher in the most cher-
ished of all their systems of “democracy.” It would facilitate
and accelerate complete control of all industry, commerce,
agriculture, education, transportation, banking, public utili-
ties, and labor unions. It would mean the entire concentra-
tion of political power in the Executive Department. It would
permit the speedy division of the country into nine zones.


## p. 356 (#390) ############################################

356 *es R E D POT TA GE
It would obliterate municipal, county, and state authority.
The advent of war would enable the American collectivist
planners to embalm the Congress, the Federal Constitution,
and the United States Supreme Court. To cap the climax,
the President would be crowned Administrator-in-Chief, the
American Führer or Dictator.
This, then, in capsule form, was the state of the nation in
the spring of 1941, when Rabbi Stern, accompanied by his
wife, sister, and two daughters, motored from Cincinnati to
Detroit. This was the state of affairs in the United States on
the morning of Memorial Day, 1941, when Stern stood be-
fore the assembly in Detroit's Cloverhill Park Cemetery. He
was prepared freely to offer his version of what his country's
answer should be to a nation sorely splintered by multifaceted
loyalties which would “render alien to each other those who
ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.”
As Stern scanned the audience before him in the chapel,
and the overflow in the tent nearby, he was determined not
to break faith with them. He was sure that he had not suc-
cumbed to the malady characteristic of the Roosevelt era
with its almost total absence of candor, with its agonizing
“mischievous madness,” with its brutish contempt for ac-
curacy and veracity, with its appalling proclivity to double-
talk or the use of language to conceal thought, and with its
arrogant rejection of the scriptural high command: “Ye shall
know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” The
attitude of left-wing “liberals” and of the self-anointed mem-
bers of the intelligentsia toward their fellow countrymen was
standardized in the churlish cliché ascribed to Harry Hop-
kins, President Roosevelt's alter ego, “The people are too
dumb to understand . . . .”
But Rabbi Stern's profound respect for the dignity, the
common sense, the intelligence, and the intuitive wisdom of
Americans whom he had met in every part of the country
assured him that where there is correct thinking on the part
of the people, right action will follow. As in the epic exam-

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 357
ple of Abraham Lincoln, the wisdom of great statesmen
“consists in carrying out the good sense of the nation.”
Fortified and spurred on by these flashes of indignation,
Rabbi Stern rapidly projected the drama of his vision on
the marvelous, invisible electrical brain circuits of the myriad
auditors within the range of his voice. With bold and vivid
strokes, he first portrayed the mazes of mental and emotional
traps which seemed to defy extrication and intelligent action.
Three years before the irrepressible conflict between the North
and the South began, Abraham Lincoln said: “If we could first
know where we are and whither we are tending, we could better
judge what to do and how to do it.”
We of this generation are face to face with parallel confusion
of emotions and purposes. We are inclined to employ ways and
means of action adopted through passion, which reason might
otherwise reject. We fail to understand that what we are actually
confronted with is not merely a social revolution but an empire
better prepared and better equipped for war than perhaps any
in the history of the world.
Our tragic indecision is the product of at least three forces.
First, the disillusionment and subsequent disavowal of the last
war. Second, the complete misunderstanding of the centuries-
old problems of European countries. And the third is a dis-
quieting realization of our own national unpreparedness for war.
We are not to be condemned because we do not know where
we are and whither we are tending. We fondly believed that we
did know—that never, never again would we “quit our own to
stand upon foreign ground,” that never, never again would we
“intertwine our destiny with that of any part of Europe and
thereby entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of Euro-
pean ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice.”
We joyfully subscribed to George Washington's doctrine be-
cause our political and economic experts, our specialists in his-
tory and sociology, believed just as sincerely that they had at
last isolated the germ of war, localized it, and thoroughly under-
stood its ways. For nearly a quarter century, our specialists and
experts had been assuring us of our impregnable position among
the nations. Of this they had convinced us so completely that
we were anesthetized against the horrors of the Japanese invasion
of China, against the sadistic triumph of Italy in Ethiopia, against

358
*ēs R E D POT TA GE
the prophetic voice of Haile Selassie appealing for an interna-
tional morality and collective security, against the undisguised
plans and boasts of the resurrected Junker spirit.
These same experts and specialists had dressed up their theo-
ries on the cause and cure of war with scientific trimmings. Some
said a lot about the gross political ambitions of empire builders.
Some said it was brought about by the satanic greed of the
“merchants of death.” Others even stated that it had something
to do with the frustrated love of extraordinary men. There were
some specialists and experts who said that war is a colossal game
or sport and that those who promote it do so to gratify savage
instincts.
If we could be sure that only our political, economic, and
sociological experts and specialists were wrong, then we might
be able to turn to our professional military men for guidance.
But even our military and naval experts have been found want-
ing in accuracy and judgment. They have been no less stunned
by the course of events than has the man in the street. Russia,
France, and Italy have suffered ignominious reverses. The re-
markable, though fruitless, battle victories of the Finns and the
Greeks have pointed a moral which the experts have apparently
ignored. The Maginot Line has become a mocking symbol of
professional standpatism.
Yet we must not be too hard on our experts. In the matter
of war, they are no more and no less efficient than are our ex-
perts and specialists in the fields of weather forecasting, sports
and industry. The wisdom of man is limited. His judgments are
therefore bound to be fallible and abounding in errors. Were
it possible for us to deal with the human factor as with inani-
mate things, our experts and specialists could point with pride
to their list of achievements. As the intellect of man is char-
acterized by its inability to comprehend all of life's manifold
factors, so we must believe that the final outcome of battles and
wars is dependent upon that which is sometimes called the im-
ponderable element.
Up until the middle of May, 1940, when France fell, we had
clung to the hope that America would never again be sucked
into the maelstrom of European political and military conflicts.
Up until a year ago, some of our foremost clergymen and poli-
ticians had reiterated their pledge never again to sanction war.
Today all these hopes and pledges have been flung aside. The
laws we had so firmly enacted to guard against future entangle-
ments in foreign wars have been swept off the statute books

with magical swiftness. The valiant and earnest pacifists, so
many of them, have again succumbed to the arbitrament of arms
as did their forerunners in April, 1917. War has come into the
land; war has come into the souls of peace-loving men and
women everywhere; the sword has been unsheathed—though we
made a covenant with ourselves and proclaimed it to all the
world that never again would we stray from the paths of peace.
Hence we are compelled to believe that the imponderable ele-
ment has more to do with the climax of political and military
events than we are able to perceive or willing to concede. Are
we humble and contrite enough to accept the sublime verdicts
of the past? Our teachers were more reticent about it. They
described it as the “finger of God.”
Nor was Victor Hugo unmindful of it. Waterloo was decided,
according to Hugo, by the God of battles who came down on
the field. And when in March, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was
summoned to interpret the progress of the Civil War, one month
before the surrender of the “invincible” General Lee at Appo-
mattox, he said: “Let us judge not, that we be not judged. The
Almighty has his own purposes. He gave to both North and
South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the
offense [of slavery] came into the world.”
Whatever reaction we may have to the answer given by such
masters as Hugo and Lincoln, we dare not stop there. It is both
blasphemous and degrading to classify all human calamities as
“acts of God.” Our sense of human dignity, our pride in human
power, will not permit us to shift the responsibility from our-
selves to the Almighty. We must confess that here and there,
somewhere along the line of events, we as individuals and as
nations have offended, have transgressed, have sinned against
the decrees of justice and the changeless laws of God.
Until the morning of Tuesday, March 11, 1941, when the
President signed the so-called “Lend-Lease Bill,” I was hoping,
even against hope, that a way might be found to keep at least
this portion of the world free from the plague of war. I had
said America must maintain her position of neutrality so that
when the embattled nations laid down their arms, exhausted and
satiated, America would not only hold aloft the glowing torch
of Liberty but also the outstretched hand of Mercy and Plenty.
I had hoped that America might serve as the friend of all
nations, “with malice toward none and with charity for all.” I
had hoped that the great wealth and productive machinery of
our country might be utilized not to destroy but to feed the

hungry, clothe the naked, and restore the waste places. I had
hoped that we might send an expedition to Europe, armed not
with a two-edged sword of vengeance but with the mightiest in-
strument of civilization—love of fellow men. I had hoped that
America might overwhelm the nations not by the might of mili-
tary strength but by the grandeur of her spirit, so that none
might curse us for our greed, nor bear malice against us because
of breach of neutrality.
Why has such a gentle, happier role been denied us? Why
must we, too, drink of the cup of madness? Why has God loosed
the lightning of His terrible swift sword and once again placed
it in the shrinking hands of America? Why must we, too, tread
“where His grapes of wrath are stored?” For now we must pray
as did Shakespeare's champion of England: “Make us thy minis-
ters of chastisement that we may praise thee in thy victory.”
Let us weigh the recent confession of the famous Englishman,
Sir Norman Angell: “Because the British turned their eyes away
from the blazing homes of China, their own homes are now
shattered rubble heaps. Because they closed their ears to the
cries of the children in Ethiopia and in Spain, they now hear the
cries of their own children. With greater wisdom and with an
earlier moral insight, they could have had half a world standing
with them, standing so that the evil thing perhaps would not
have raised its head at all.”
What will be the ransom we shall offer for the regeneration of
our national honor? Is it enough that we offer ships and tanks,
planes and food? Is it enough that we offer millions borrowed
from the future? Will these atone for our sin against China,
against all the nations whose trade and commerce we ruined by
our tariffs? Whose poverty we aggravated by our tolerance of
British and French imperialism? How shall we atone for our
harsh immigration restrictions? How shall we answer for our
failure to solve the colossal economic waste of millions of idle
men in a civilized society?
Here Rabbi Stern paused. How would his auditors react
to the second, the more bitter dose which he was about to
administer?
No longer will it avail us to say: We hate war. It will not
matter that we are aware of the futility of the last war. What-

ever our abhorrence of war, we cannot now flee from it. What-
ever our hopes and our prayers, we cannot break faith with the
millions who wait for our promised coming. We have openly
taken our stand on the sides of Britain and China. To fail to
match their courage, their love of freedom, and their sacrifice
of life and substance, is to mark America with shame and ever-
lasting perfidy. With toil and sweat, with tears and blood, we,
too, must make atonement for our national soul.
On this day dedicated to the spirit of those who in their
generation gave their lives so that out of the soil enriched with
their faith and their valor there might be born a more enduring,
a more fruitful freedom of the soul, we may well ask: What
would their answer be? Would they counsel submission to the
victorious legions of Germany? Would they be moved by our
plea of unpreparedness? Would they applaud our willingness to
let other nations shed their blood for freedom while we offer
“all aid short of war”? Would they approve of our serving
merely as the arsenal of democracy?
They would remind us how Washington’s “ragged Continen-
tals” met and defeated the well-trained armies of our adversaries.
They would recall how Andrew Jackson's riflemen met and
defeated the veterans of Wellington. They would recite the ex-
ploits of our citizen-soldiers on the fields of Vicksburg and
Gettysburg. They would tell of our two score and more struggles
with the Indians. They would point to the deeds of our half-
trained, half-armed boys at Chateau-Thierry and the Meuse-
Argonne and Flanders. And they might intone in the language
of Scripture: “When thou goest out to battle against thine ene-
mies, and thou seest horses, and chariots, and a people more
than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with
thee.”
Yet we need not turn to the unbroken silence of the past for
standards of heroic suffering and spiritual invincibility. Those
standards have been and are being dramatized for us, hour by
hour, by the unknown, unhonored, common people of China
and the British Empire. Nor is it for us to draw up a declaration
of ideals. That has been done by the mute courage and faith
of the unarmed citizens of Finland, Greece, and Holland, to
name but a few.

‘. . . he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who
enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be
satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth
unto him all people:
“. . . . Shall not all these take up a parable against him,
and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him
that increaseth that which is not his!”
HE bold Memorial Day pronouncements of Rabbi
Øº as an individual and the equally imperious
declarations of both the America First and the
Fight for Freedom Committees were neither unique nor ex-
traordinary incidents. They were the normal reflections of
the genuine democratic tone of American citizenship.
In the republic of the United States of America, the formu-
lation of foreign policy has never been the exclusive occu-
pation of either the President or the Secretary of State. Public
opinion has always been a potent factor in the evolution of
foreign policy. It has always been a decisive force in the
molding of a course of action in foreign affairs.
Patently, therefore, enlightened public opinion is impera-
tive and crucial. Indubitably, enlightened public opinion,
embracing every complex and complicated aspect of foreign
affairs, is utterly unattainable.
Yet there is scarcely an alert citizen of the United States
who is diffident about articulating his views on foreign affairs.
Such daily dabblings may be as innocuous as the widespread
practice of masterminding baseball games from remote ob-
servation towers. But the impact of public opinion, especially
that of journalists like Walter Lippmann, radio criers like

Walter Winchell, clergymen like Father Charles Coughlin,
and educators like Robert M. Hutchins, is of staggering
proportions.
In the year 1941, the world stage had been transformed
into a global circus. The major performers were not those of
one nation, radiating about the personality of one stellar
imperialist like Alexander of Macedonia, striking out for
world mastery. Toward the middle of the twentieth century,
there was not just one imitator of that ancient warrior-
statesman, but four representing Germany, Russia, Japan,
and the United States of America. In the latter country, the
dazzling pattern for earth-circling predominance was not first
delineated by the President of the United States. Nor did
the lofty plans come from the lips or the writings of an emi-
nent general or admiral. The proposition was promulgated
by that Delphic oracle of the American intelligentsia, Dr.
Robert M. Hutchins, then president of the University of
Chicago.
In a radio address on January 23rd, President Hutchins
said: “The path to war is a false path to freedom. A new
moral order for America is the true path to freedom. A new
moral order for America means new strength for America
and new hope for the moral reconstruction of mankind. We
are turning aside from the true path to freedom because it is
easier to blame Hitler for our troubles than to fight for
democracy at home.
“As Hitler made the Jews his scapegoat, so we are making
Hitler ours. But Hitler did not spring full-armed from the
brow of Satan. He sprang from the materialism and paganism
of our times.
“In the long run, we can beat what Hitler stands for only
by beating the materialism and paganism that produced him.
We must show the world a nation clear in purpose, united in
action, and sacrificial in spirit. The influence of that exam-
ple upon suffering humanity everywhere will be more power-
ful than the combined armies of the Axis.”

One might demur as to the apocalyptic quality of Presi-
dent Hutchins’ exquisite exhortation to the American people
in the matter of world hegemony. Yet, consideration of the
contemporary Japanese messianic aspirations is illustrative
and illuminating.
“The Japanese believe they bear a Heaven-dictated com-
mission,” reported the American author, Joseph Hall, “re-
quiring the utmost sacrifice, but promising a final certain
triumph. They are not reticent about it. Their statesman
Matsuoka, American reared and educated, tells us: “Our
mission is to rescue the human race from destruction and
lead it to the world of light. We have a peerless tradition.
Providence calls on Japan to deliver humanity from the im-
passe of modern material civilization.’”
Man's urge to world mastery is an inveterate, perhaps
congenital propensity. This mania for limitless expansion is
also commonly manifested in religion, in industry, and in
the accretion of villages into mammoth cities. Yet this per-
petual craving for magnification by multiplication runs coun-
ter to the hunter's penchant for big game. In the process of
gratifying this form of mischievous madness, the dinosaur
and other dragons and reptiles have become the fabulous
monsters of a very remote yesterday. In the United States,
the buffalo and the eagle are almost extinct specimens of
former natural majesty. In their places have come the mice
and the starlings.
In the great waters, the whale and the walrus may soon be-
come as legendary as the leviathan. The fate of aquatic and
terrestrial monsters is analogous to that of the mighty men
and nations of the ages: Babylonia and Rome, among the
nations; Alexander and Genghis Khan, among the kings of
the earth. The cities of Athens, Jerusalem, and Florence are
more memorable than the empires of Xerxes and Charle-
magne. In the little countries of Denmark, Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Sweden, the standards of living and well-
being transcend the mud-level subsistence of the masses of

people of China, of India, and even of Soviet Russia. The
foulest slums are to be found in London, New York, Cal-
cutta, and Baltimore. Notwithstanding, man's lust for ex-
ternal expansion is still unabated.
Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler's reaction to President Franklin
D. Roosevelt's progressive acts of bold intervention came
with stunning balefulness. On May 21st, a “pirate” sub-
marine sank the American merchant ship “Robin Moor.”
One month later, President Roosevelt sent a special mes-
sage to Capitol Hill. “I am under the necessity,” the Presi-
dent declared, “of bringing to the attention of the Congress
the ruthless sinking by a German submarine on May 21 of
an American ship, the Robin Moor, in the South Atlantic
Ocean . . . while the vessel was on the high seas en route
to South Africa.
“According to the formal depositions of survivors, the ves-
sel was sunk within thirty minutes from the time of the first
warning given by the Commander of the submarine to an
officer of the Robin Moor.
“The submarine did not display its flag, and the Com-
mander did not announce its nationality.
“The Robin Moor was sunk without provision for the
safety of the passengers and crew. It was sunk despite the
fact that its American nationality was admittedly known to
the Commander of the submarine and that its nationality was
likewise clearly indicated by the flag and other markings.
“The sinking of this American ship by a German sub-
marine flagrantly violated the right of United States vessels
freely to navigate the seas, subject only to a belligerent right
accepted under international law. This belligerent right, as
is known to the German Government, does not include the
right deliberately to sink a merchant vessel, leaving the pas-
sengers and crew to the mercies of the elements. On the
contrary, the belligerent is required to place the passengers
and crew in places of safety.


## p. 367 (#401) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 22:5" 367
“The passengers and crew of the Robin Moor were left
afloat in small lifeboats for approximately two to three weeks,
when they were accidentally discovered and rescued by
friendly vessels. This chance rescue does not lessen the bru-
tality of casting the boats adrift in midocean.
“The total disregard shown for the most elementary prin-
ciples of international law and of humanity brands the sinking
of the Robin Moor as the act of an international outlaw. . . .”
The President concluded his comparatively short message
with a ringing declaration: “We must take it that notice has
now been served upon us that no American ship or cargo on
any of the seven seas can consider itself immune from acts of
piracy. Notice is served on us, in effect, that the German
Reich proposes to intimidate the United States that we would
be dissuaded from carrying out our chosen policy of helping
Britain to survive.
“In brief, we must take the sinking of the Robin Moor as
a warning to the United States not to resist the Nazi move-
ment of world conquest. It is a warning that the United
States may use the high seas of the world only with Nazi
COnSent.
“Were we to yield on this, we would inevitably submit to
world domination at the hands of the present leaders of the
German Reich.
“We are not yielding, and we do not propose to yield.”
Thus the torpedoing of this American merchant ship on
the high seas was not construed as an act of war. The “Robin
Moor” disaster had been foreseen by the opponents of the
Lend-Lease Act. It had also been anticipated by those states-
men who believed and said that, at such a time and in such
a zone, vessels with their crews, their passengers, and their
cargo were legitimate war targets. The sinking of the “Robin
Moor” poignantly revived memories of the almost similar
fate of the liner “Lusitania.” On May 7, 1915, the com-
mander of the “U-20° exultingly reported by wireless cipher
to the German Admiralty the sinking of the British liner.

The furor which followed in the wake of the horrendous
drowning of 1,198 men, women, and children did not, how-
ever, catapult America into the conflict on the side of Great
Britain, France, and Czarist Russia.
Rabbi Stern recalled that, in 1936, twenty-one years after
the sinking of the “Lusitania,” one of Britain's highest naval
authorities said to a London audience: “In sinking the Lusi-
tania as an act of war, the German Admiralty was right! If
women and children choose to cruise about in war areas, they
must expect what they get. The Lusitania might have been
used to transport 10,000 American troops on a single voyage
to fight Germany.”
Germany's retaliatory response to President Roosevelt’s
unauthorized and unbridled acts of intervention was, com-
paratively speaking, a mere gesture of defiance and contemp-
tuous scorn of America's war potential. For Reichsfuehrer
Hitler was only too well aware of America's abject state of
military unpreparedness. Hitler was confident that prevailing
public opinion was predominantly against full-scale partici-
pation on the side of the Allies. So, come what might, Ger-
many would not deign to follow up her unrestricted subma-
rine attacks on American shipping with a formal declaration
of war.
The proof of Hitler's Olympian verve came on June 22nd.
It followed by one day President Roosevelt’s grim report of
the sinking of the “Robin Moor.” At 3:00 A.M., on June 22,
1941, the sudden thunder of German artillery exploded all
along the German lines in Poland. It signalled the start of
Adolf Hitler's invasion of Soviet Russia. The blow which
the Reichsfuehrer struck on that morning of June 22nd could
not be interpreted as a puny tap of derision. It was, indeed,
in the nature of a thunderclap which rolled round the world.
It caused all nations to reel in astonishment.
Almost simultaneously, Hitler broadcast as his supreme
objective the overthrow of godless Communism. The propa-
ganda value of such a profession was unquestionably im-

mense. It could have nullified the position taken by the
Congress and implemented by the Lend-Lease Act in the
struggle of democracy against totalitarianism. For, in taking
up arms against Germany and on the side of Soviet Russia,
the United States would be confronted with an insuperable
dilemma. America would be rendering aid not merely to one
dictatorship, but to five: Yugoslavia, Greece, Poland, Al-
bania, and Soviet Russia.
Nevertheless, two days later, on June 24th, President
Roosevelt announced that the United States would give all
possible aid to Soviet Russia. It was not only the unleashed,
wayward spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt, nor was it the un-
scrupulous plotting of the President, that led him to a course
of action against Imperial Japan which would completely
liberate him from the solemn pledge given to the American
people in the 1940 presidential campaign. Nor was it only
the unrelenting hand and the diplomatic skill of Winston
Churchill and of the British propagandists in Washington.
Nor was it the fiery pressure of the interventionists that
ultimately assembled the jigsaw-like parts and parcels of the
American population into a united, unparalleled arsenal and
war machine. -
It was not the idealistic flame of the Fight For Freedom
Committee that transformed the multiple discords of passions
into a force fighting, not primarily for the liberation of Great
Britain and her allies, but wholeheartedly for the preserva-
tion of the appalling despotism of Bolshevik bureaucracy.
By a fantastic turn of events, that which the U-boats and the
Luftwaffe failed to achieve was accomplished by Hitler's long
premeditated invasion of Soviet Russia.
The swift American espousal of Soviet Russia's cause rep-
resented the height, the depth, and the breadth of irony. In
a two-thousand-word letter to the New York Times, the re-
vered American philosopher John Dewey wrote: “Nor is there
in the film [“Mission to Moscow”] even the merest hint that
in France, England, the United States—wherever the Com-

munist Internationale was functioning—the Communist par-
ties systematically sabotaged the Allied cause. One would
never know that the most determined and noisy isolationists
in this country before June 22, 1941, were in the Communist-
led American Peace Mobilization. The film is anti-British,
anti-Congress, anti-democratic, and anti-truth. It deepens
that crisis in morals which is the fundamental issue in the
moral world. It is a major defeat for the democratic cause.”
As Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht penetrated deep into Rus-
sian territory, Stalin's soldiers were slaughtered by the tens
of thousands. At the same time, the Communist political
commissars were powerless to prevent the surrender of entire
units of the Soviet armed forces by the hundreds of thousands.
Face to face with the certain collapse of the Communist
regime, Stalin and his confederates cast away all their bar-
barous Bolshevik fantasies. “Instead,” reported the American
journalist Eugene Lyons, “the dictators invoked the insulted
past and its maligned leaders. Soviet slogans were put aside
in favor of old-style patriotism and traditional Russian values.
The word ‘Socialism' was all but expunged from the propa-
ganda lexicon. With every month, this accent on the past
was more forthright. In Soviet history, there had been other
reluctant retreats from dogma at critical times. But none of
them had been as clear-cut and galling a defeat for the Soviet
leadership as this virtual repudiation of Sovietism.”
Along a two-thousand-mile front from the Arctic to the
Black Sea, Hitler's brilliant, irresistible pincers and giant-like
nutcrackers augured doom for that foulest system of totali-
tarianism. As the conquering hosts of German military might
swept through the Ukraine and on to Stalingrad, Leningrad,
and Moscow, the people of Soviet Russia welcomed them as
liberators. For the millions of enslaved peoples, the destruc-
tion of the Red Army meant freedom from the loathsome
Communist taskmasters.
In Soviet Russia, Communism gave way to the old faith,
to the old traditions, to the old religion, to the old patriotism,

and to Czarist history. But in the United States, the cult of
Marxism or Communism correspondingly soared in dignity
and in strength. Its devotees multiplied. Its adherents were
elevated to high places in the spheres of education, the press,
the church, the federal civil service, and the armed forces.
They penetrated every nook and cranny of the radio industry,
the theatre, the cinema, and the labor unions. The American
prophets of Marxism had their unabashed champion in the
person of the President's wife. The White House was the
Communists’ sure citadel. And every Elijah in the Congress
or in the press who dared to challenge or to thwart the de-
signs of a Communist was hurled back with scorn and
contumely.
As the Red star of Socialism seemed to vanish beyond the
Volga and over the Ural Mountains, almost synchronously
it reappeared above the Potomac and rested over the Execu-
tive Mansion hard by the Capitol in Washington.
The functionaries of the Communist cult were sought out
and fêted by the “best people” in the national capital and
in other great American centers of population. By some
occult process, Hitler's major triumphs over Communist-
controlled Europe were being re-enacted in reverse by the
even more calamitous victories of Communist agents in the
United States.
Only a few brave voices were raised to protest and to
prophesy that failure on the part of Hitler to free Russia
from the Communist cancer would mean the re-enslavement
of millions of innocent human beings and the restoration to
power of a most abhorrent tyranny. One of these voices was
that of former President Herbert Hoover.
“Our tacit alliance with Soviet Russia,” wrote Mr. Hoover,
“spread Communism over the earth. Especially in June,
1941, when Britain was safe from a German invasion, due
to Hitler's diversion to attack on Stalin, I urged that the
gargantuan jest of all history would be our giving aid to the
Soviet government. I urged that we should allow these two

dictators to exhaust each other. I stated that the result of
our assistance would be to spread Communism over the
whole world. I urged that if we stood aside, the time would
come when we could bring lasting peace to the world.”
Adolf Hitler's highly sensational shift of strategy and bat-
tlefield marked Germany's fifth major diplomatic perfidy in
less than a decade. Yet it was conceded that, had circum-
stances been more propitious for the Soviet Union and less
favorable to Germany, Marshal Joseph Stalin would not have
hesitated in the pursuit of his imperialist program of seizing
territory when it was safe to do so. Germany had no monop-
oly on “bloody and deceitful men.”
The confusion wrought in political and military circles on
the European continent was reproduced with only slight
variations in almost every other part of the world. Every-
where there was a reshuffling and a rescrambling of alliances
and alignments. In the United States, the America First
Committee soon stood alone in a vainglorious effort to stem
the tide of retreat from the American redoubts of neutrality.
The trend toward full-scale war was irrepressible. Had Presi-
dent Roosevelt, at that time, but blown with the trumpets of
truth, the already crumbling walls of isolationism would have
come down in a trice. Had the President, on June 24th, but
disclosed his true purposes, there would not have been that
dreadful drama and the hecatomb of heroes at Pearl Harbor
less than six months later.
“The American people have finally made up their minds
about this war,” stated F. D. Pratt, circulation manager of
the magazine Fortune, in a letter received by Rabbi Stern,
dated August 16th. “For almost overnight, ‘It isn't our war'
has become ‘Let’s face the facts. We're in it already.” And
more than this, there now lies in the hearts and in the minds
of the American people the grim realization that this is not
alone a war of planes and ships, of tanks and guns and shells.
This is a war also of politics and economics, of psychologies
and cultures and ideas. It is a war in which the man on the

production line and the man in management and the man in
plain clothes and the woman in her kitchen each plays as
important a role and is as gravely affected as the man in
khaki or blue. It is all out, total war.
“And all up and down the length and breadth of our United
States, the men and women of America are asking what must
we do to win this war? And what will the doing of these
things mean to me?”
Also, at about this time, the middle of August, in Placentia
Bay, Newfoundland, lay anchored the United States cruiser
“Augusta.” Aboard this battleship, the President of the
United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain drew
up a war compact of extraordinary scope and promise to the
world. Significantly, this Atlantic Conference, participated
in by the high-ranking military officials of both countries,
was but one of many violations of the conventions on neu-
trals included in the Hague Conventions of 1907, to which
the United States was a signatory.
On September 29th, a weekly news-journal reported: “The
American Legion struck Isolationism a ruinous blow last
week—a ponderous, powerhouse, meat-ax crusher. The reper-
cussions of the Legion's action in its 23rd annual convention
would echo for many months in Congress, the press, the
homes of U. S. citizens.”
“In convention at Milwaukee,” the magazine Time nar-
rated, “the Legion: Agreed that the present objective of the
U. S. is ‘the defeat of Hitler and what he stands for.” Gave
wholehearted support to the Roosevelt foreign policy. Asked
repeal of the so-called Neutrality Act. Asked removal of the
ban on sending A.E.F. outside the Western Hemisphere. Ap-
proved aid to Russia. The President's foreign policy now
had a mandate, clear and clean, from the veterans of the last
war, one of the most influential single mass organizations of
Americans, an exact cross section of basic U. S. opinion.”


## p. 374 (#408) ############################################

374 *> R E D POT TA GE
And also in that fateful autumn of 1941, America's fore-
most pundit, Walter Lippmann, counseled: “As a matter of
fundamental strategy, our role is on the sea and in the air
and in the factory—not on the battlefields of Europe or Asia.
Our army program should now be made to conform to this
basic American strategy. All popular doubts, all political
confusion, all ambiguity should be removed by a clear deci-
sion to shrink the Army and concentrate our major effort
upon the Navy, the Air Force, and lend-lease. The world
situation justifies this, our fundamental policy requires it, and
the American nation instinctively desires it. Proposed by the
President on the recommendation of his military advisers, it
would be greeted with profound relief and great enthusiasm.”
Notwithstanding this almost overwhelming acquiescence and
acceptance of war, President Roosevelt intractably main-
tained the posture of peace. The action taken by the Ameri-
can Congress in the summer of 1941 was indeed sympto-
matic of this preposterous and no doubt hypocritical position.
After protracted debate on the Selective Training and Service
Act (extending the period of training from one year to
eighteen months), the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 45
to 30. The House of Representatives approved the measure
by a single vote: 203 to 202. At this time, the President
gave no indication that he had veered from his long-planned
purpose to wait until “frank discussion, incidents and turns
in the war would eventually swing public opinion behind a
decision for war.”
In the national capital, there was no desert, or mountain,
or wilderness, or Walden Pond, where one might flee in
search of a true vision or revelation. In 1941, Washington
was very much as it was in the administration of Abraham
Lincoln. It was still a place of “conspiracy, charges, excuses,
perversions, greed for power and favors, gossip filled with
half-truths difficult to sift.” Small wonder that, after an
absence of four years in warring Europe, Demaree Bess, of
the Saturday Evening Post, wrote:

“When I came home in October, 1941, I felt like Alice in
Wonderland. Everyone in Europe knew by that time that
the United States was already deeply involved in the Euro-
pean war, having committed a whole series of warlike actions
against Germany.
“Through Lend-Lease, we had undertaken to supply Ger-
many's enemies with weapons and money and every other
kind of help we could give them; American warships were
convoying supplies through submarine infested seas; some of
our warships already had fought battles with German sub-
marines and warplanes. Time and again, President Roosevelt
had pledged us to “overthrow Hitlerism,’ which could only
mean to defeat Germany, and apparently a majority of the
American people approved that pledge.
“Nevertheless, our Administration refused to concede that
we were at war with Germany, and our people were so con-
fused about the whole situation that, up to the very hour of
the attack on Pearl Harbor, we were still continuing to con-
duct fierce debates about whether we should keep out of
the war.
“The public bewilderment was heightened by a crude and
misleading oversimplification of the nature of the European
war. Fearful lest Americans could not be depended upon to
understand their own interests, our propagandists appealed
to our emotions by portraying the European conflict as a
clear-cut struggle between dictatorship and democracy, or
between totalitarianism and democracy.
“This was such a gross distortion that it irritated many
thinking Americans and diverted public attention from the
real issues of the conflict. . . .”
“Meanwhile,” continued Mr. Bess, “another group of
American propagandists, especially among the so-called
interventionists, was persistently misrepresenting Germany's
strength, in order to appeal to the lowest instincts of those
Americans who shrank from fighting a ‘hard war.” We were
told that we could defeat Germany by half measures, letting

other people shed the blood and tears, and many Americans
applauded and echoed the words of Winston Churchill when
he said, ‘Give us the tools and we will finish the job.' . . .
“This was the atmosphere of make-believe in which we
were living when we finally made our ignominious formal
entrance into the war by being kicked into it at Pearl Harbor.
By that time we were half prepared militarily, but we were
wholly unprepared psychologically, and our mental unpre-
paredness was aggravated by two further misrepresentations
which were then encouraged by our propagandists.”
Under these circumstances, it was not strange that the
America First Committee persisted in its dogged defense of
isolationism. On the radio, Charles A. Lindbergh pounded
away at the British, the Roosevelt Administration, and the
Jews as the three most important groups pressing the coun-
try toward war. Senator Gerald P. Nye came to Cincinnati
to speak at the Taft Auditorium on Thursday, September
18th. At an informal meeting at Cincinnati's Hotel Gibson,
the Senator from North Dakota conferred with Professor
Jacob R. Marcus, of the Hebrew Union College faculty;
Henry Segal, editor of the Cincinnati American Israelite; and
J. Austin White and Robert J. Lavell, of the America First
Committee. Rabbi Stern and his sister listened with amaze-
ment to the Senator's calm responses to the sharp inquiries
of both Marcus and Segal. Only a few years before, Senator
Gerald P. Nye was pre-eminent among American liberals.
Senator Nye had been very much in demand as a forum
speaker. Jewish circles in every part of the country fea-
tured him on their lecture programs. Now, the senator, along
with Lindbergh, was universally denounced as having “cast
aside all but the last veil of pretense, and in pattern estab-
lished by Adolf Hitler years ago sought to make the Jews
a public national issue in the United States.”
Senator Nye offered a long and detailed account of his
good offices in behalf of his Jewish constituents in North
Dakota. The senator argued that Lindbergh was altogether

free of the anti-Semitic virus. Nye averred that, in his refer-
ences coupling the Jews with the British and the Roosevelt
Administration, the great aviator had been actuated only by
fear of rising indignation against the Jews because of their
insistence on intervention and their determined opposition to
such organizations as the America First Committee.
At this juncture, Professor Marcus propounded the policy
adopted by the Central Conference of American Rabbis at
its annual convention a few months before. “Jews must be
regarded as citizens,” Dr. Marcus stated. “They must be
designated either as interventionists or as noninterventionists
—not as Jews.”
Two weeks later, the America First Committee held a third
rally at the Taft Auditorium in Cincinnati, with John T.
Flynn, the most fearless and the most dreaded critic of the
Roosevelt Administration, as the principal speaker. Once
again, Rabbi Stern accepted an invitation to offer the bene-
diction at this assembly of “enlightened and independent
patriots” who were particularly alarmed at the state of the
nation.
But on his return home the evening before the scheduled
rally at the Taft Auditorium, Stern found himself encircled
by a delegation of ten or more fellow members of the Ameri-
can Legion post in Avondale. Like himself, these men had
spent the morning and afternoon of the Day of Atonement
at worship. Their leader pleaded with the rabbi to break his
appointment. He urged Stern not to sanction by prayer the
isolationism of the America First Committee.
Stern informed the delegation that he would appear at the
America First Committee gathering only for the benediction,
after he had participated that same evening in an installation
of officers of the Galbraith Post of the American Legion at
the Hotel Gibson.
On the afternoon of Friday, October 3rd, the Cincinnati
Post carried a front-page story of Rabbi Stern's dual activi-
ties of the previous evening. The newspaper reported that

the rabbi had broken his appointment with the America First
Committee and that in his speech at the Galbraith Post he
had called upon the Congress of the United States imme-
diately to declare war against the Third Reich. “We are
already in the war,” Stern had said, “and this cruel deception
should be ended. It is up to Congress to make a straight-
forward decision.”
“The rabbi said,” the newspaper recounted, “that he first
advocated ‘consideration of measures to stop Hitler' six
months after the Nazi leader took over in Germany. He said
that “only by such measures can we attain national unity,”
adding that he hoped it would end the work of such groups
as the America First Committee and the Fight For Freedom
Committee. A formal declaration of war would leave
Wheeler and Lindbergh with nothing to say.
“He had accepted the invitation to pray at the America
First rally as a professional service he would give to any
group that asked for it. ‘I do not agree with the America
First policy, but I would denounce Jewish people who would
deny Wheeler and Lindbergh the right to express themselves.’”
The Cincinnati Post also reported that Stern had told
J. Austin White of his prior Legion engagement and the
America First chairman had honored his request to be
excused.
The little community of Rising Sun, Indiana, forty miles
west of Cincinnati, also has its roots in the ample waters
of the 981-mile-long Ohio River. In 1941, the publisher of
the weekly Rising Sun Recorder was J. Monty Glatz, a
veteran of the Ohio National Guard. When the Rotary Club
and the American Legion post of Rising Sun planned a joint
Armistice Day dinner for Monday evening, November 10th,
the publisher of the more-than-108-year-old weekly invited
his former sergeant major, Rabbi Milton Stern, to deliver
the principal address.

Among the forty diners at the Marsh Hotel were four
Protestant clergymen, the superintendent of Rising Sun's pub-
lic schools, and the mayor. Publisher Glatz presented his
friend from Cincinnati to his fellow townsmen with great
pride. As Stern unfolded his thoughts, he felt that the men
gathered so closely about him listened with veneration. Here
at the crossroads of the United States of America, the Cin-
cinnati rabbi offered for the nation a course of action which
he embodied in the language of the market place: “Don’t Sell
America Short!”
“You know something about the Atlantic Ferry. It is the
route taken by airmen delivering bombing planes to the
British Isles. There is a point midway between the North
American continent and the British Isles from which it is
impossible to turn back. The aviator must go on to his desti-
nation. Else he will be lost somewhere in the Atlantic for
lack of fuel.
“We have reached such a point in our political affairs.
The passage of the lend-lease bill in March and subsequent
actions on our part have made it impossible for us to retrace
our steps, to resume our position of neutrality. Though we
evade the issue, we are in the war.
“Our sense of honor together with our motives will not
permit us to turn back. The sooner we accept the inevitable,
the better off we shall be. Our great task at this time is to
come to a decision and then it will be comparatively easy for
us to go ahead. Having reached this point, we could then go
on to the attainment of a more difficult goal. This is psycho-
logical. It has something to do with attitude, state of mind.
Some call it morale.
“Attitude is of tremendous importance, whatever the situa-
tion in life. It is attitude which determines the outcome of
any problem. Without the right attitude, or state of mind,
nothing worth-while can be accomplished. In facing such a
thing as war, attitude is the key to victory or defeat. We

must first persuade ourselves that nothing in life can be
gained without pain, without sacrifice, without a price.
“There is a fundamental law that nature's enjoyment by
man is consequent upon his exertion. We find demonstra-
tions of this same principle in the eternal decrees of the
Almighty. It is self-evident that most people want peace
without effort to preserve and to maintain it. None of us
wants earthquakes, droughts, hurricanes, or floods. Yet when
they come, we find it necessary to cope with them. And in
the struggle to master them, we discover that joy of achieve-
ment which makes man a little lower than the angels and pre-
eminent over the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and
the fish of the sea. As with all the highly undesirable foes of
man, war comes to us as a challenge to our mental and spirit-
ual qualities—as well as physical.
“Nor must we expect every member of our society to re-
spond to these challenges with equal heroism, with the same
will to sacrifice and to self-denial. There are mental and
spiritual defects in men as there are physical and intellectual.
To be sure, we are amazed at the large number of our young
men who are rejected, found unfit for military service. Yet
we are not discouraged. In like manner, we cannot anticipate
an all-out demonstration of the patriotic spirit. There will
be many who will hold back.
“We find it difficult to attain the requisite attitude or frame
of mind toward war, because we have been brought up on
the fond hope that the last war really was the last. We were
as sure of that as we were certain of our invulnerability and
our immunity from external invasion. Then we had capped
that conviction by exacting a solemn pledge from the two
chief candidates in the 1940 national election—to keep this
country out of war. In our eagerness to avoid participation,
we had approved of the measures taken ‘short of war,’ though
any clear-thinking person could see that all such measures
must sooner or later carry us into the vortex of war.
“Such was the state of mind of the people of our country.
It was not only pathetic but pathological. So great was the

dread of war, so vivid was the realization of its horrors, that
there was every indication the nation would experience a
kind of mass shell shockism at the moment the fire of war
began to lick the tinder-dry spirits of our people.
“There are two forces working toward our complete entry.
The first is our sins of omission and commission. The second
is our decision to take a prominent part in the settlement of
world affairs at the peace conference. We need not catalogue
those mistakes we have made during the past two decades
following the settlement of the terms of the Armistice. They
have been grievous. They have had much to do with the
course of events leading to the outbreak of war in Europe,
Asia, and America. We must confess that we have contrib-
uted to the world-wide tragedy.
“It must be recognized that if we expect to wield great
influence at the peace table, we must give proof of our rights
of partnership. In a word, we must be ready to make sacri-
fices. If we are to become world leaders, we must share in
the world's sufferings. It will not be enough for us to adopt
and practice measures ‘short of war.’ It will not be enough
for America to become the arsenal of democracy. When
other countries are shedding their blood, when other coun-
tries are sacrificing their cities and their wealth, their total
population, it will not be enough for us to lend and lease the
tools of war.
“That was the indictment made against us at the conclu-
sion of the first World War. Said the Europeans, in effect,
the part you now seek to play in the settlement of world
affairs is wholly out of proportion to the sacrifices made.
That is why Clemenceau could not see eye to eye with Wood-
row Wilson.
“Said the Apostle Paul: “The captain of our salvation
must be made perfect through suffering.’ So it must be with
America. If we are to assume a leading role at the peace
table, we must come with a record of service and sacrifice—
equal, at least, to that of any other nation. Otherwise all our
labors will be in vain. We shall come out of the next peace

conference like a betrayed virgin. Our ideals will be spurned.
Our patterns of peace will be spat upon.
“To come to the Peace Conference unfortified and un-
armed with such credentials of service and sacrifice is to sell
America short. We shall find ourselves no better off at the
end of this second World War. We must come fortified also
with specific suggestions for the improvement of world rela-
tionships: establishment of a universal and uniform currency
modeled after the universal postal system; disarmament of
European countries in order to prevent famine and pestilence
throughout the continent, the United States, Britain, and
Russia providing the police force; union of European coun-
tries outside the U. S. S. R.; liberal immigration opportuni-
ties to relieve pressure of population in European countries,
with Canada and Latin America as outlets.
“So that we can conduct war efficiently and with a mini-
mum of losses in manpower, we must put our own domestic
affairs in order. A chief task is the effective and immediate
mobilization of our forces of production. There must be an
end to labor disputes. All strikes must be outlawed. Dis-
putes must be settled by compulsory arbitration. Insofar as
is wise and prudent, the same discipline which governs the
military and naval arms of the nation shoul be the rule in
factory and mine.
“War expenditures will be spectacular. The burden of
taxation will be very heavy. Now is the time to reduce ordi-
nary expenditures without jeopardizing social gains. Thrift
does not mean niggardliness. But waste at any time and
under any circumstance is deplorable. The farmer and the
producer ought to be relieved of the excessive, unreasonable
burdens of taxation. In order to be equitable, taxation must
be imposed upon the unearned increment: collectors of ground
rent, inheritances, large income, and holders of tax exempt
bonds.
“Modern war is an all-out war. It calls for universal sacri-
fice and service. No one can think oneself exempt. If Free-

dom is a glorious heritage, all that we have and all that we
are must be dedicated to her.”
On this night, marking the twenty-third anniversary of
Armistice Day, the war-blinded Cincinnati rabbi, at Rising
Sun, Indiana, prophesied and prescribed universal service
and sacrifice in an all-out war against Germany's new ruling
power. Stern urged voluntary and immediate intervention on
the side of Great Britain and France in a world-wide struggle
for freedom. Within the past six months, this was the rabbi's
third public call for a forthright declaration of war.
But in the national capital, the President of the United
States still oscillated with stupefying subtilty. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt still pursued the dual role of peace
advocate and warlord.
During the month of November, 1941, in one conference
after another, the Secretary of State and the President, ap-
parently in all sincerity and with considerable grandiloquence,
“explored” with Special Ambassador Saburu Kurusu and Am-
bassador Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura all avenues of trade
and diplomacy by which to promote peaceful relations be-
tween the Empire of Japan and the American republic.
Concurrently, however, within the inner chambers of the
White House, the American Chief Magistrate, through British
Intelligence, day by day, with a chess master's aplomb,
charted the movements across the Pacific Ocean of a twenty-
eight-ship task force whose objective was the presumably im-
pregnable Pearl Harbor.
For the leader of the Democratic Party was only too well
aware that a catastrophic “unprovoked” attack on the Ameri-
can outpost on the Territory of Hawaii by that task force
from the “Land of the Rising Sun” would free him com-
pletely from the chains of that solemn 1940 campaign prom-
ise: “I have said this before, and I shall say it again and
again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any
foreign wars.”

PART THREE
CHAPTER XXXIII
LIBERAL–WITH OTHER MEN'S LIVES
HAT was Pearl Harbor?
Under the caption, “Our Hawaiian Gibraltar,”
Don Wharton graphically reported in the Read-
er's Digest of March, 1938:
“Never in American history have we defended any spot the
way we defend Pearl Harbor.
“The lovely Hawaiian Island of Oahu has been converted into
a fortress to protect one of the great naval bases of all time,
which doubles the reach of our fleet and gives us an advantage
in the Pacific possessed by no other nation.
“I have been through the Army's $2,000,000 ammunition
depot, great galleries blasted out of solid rock and filled with
$20,000,000 worth of bombs, shells and cartridges. Yet I know
perhaps one tenth as much about the place as is known in Tokyo.
“The Pacific has long been recognized as the most likely
theater of America's next war. Without Pearl Harbor, our fleet
could not hope to conduct wartime operations over the huge
distances of the Pacific. Here . . . the entire fleet can lie at
anchor.
“It is the Army's job to protect the naval base, and to do so
it has concentrated on Oahu some 20,000 men, the largest con-
centration of American troops in any area.
“Should an enemy land outside these walls [mountains on two
sides], our troops could probably pin him to the beaches the way
the German-led Turks did the British at Gallipoli.
“At the Pearl Harbor end the Army has concentrated bat-
teries of 16-, 14- and 12-inch guns. Back of the batteries are
concrete and steel observation posts and all about are anti-
aircraft guns, searchlights and sound-locaters. No enemy would
care to waste his capital ships against these fortifications.
385

“To prevent the enemy from reducing the long-range batteries
with planes, we would probably use our air forces to destroy his
aircraft carriers or the airfields he had set up on some near-by
island. Oahu will soon have the largest air base of the entire
Army. Recent additions will give the air force approximately
228 fighting planes, with further increases in prospect.
“No enemy would think of tackling the division at Schofield
with less than 100,000 men. In addition to its geographical
location, its natural defenses, its mobility, fire-power and inten-
sive all-year training, it has splendid morale. It also has two
problems: the Japanese and food.
“Of the 380,000 civilians in the islands, 150,000 are Japanese.
The group giving the real concern consists of 37,000 Japanese
aliens brought over in the 1890's when Hawaii needed laborers.
They are in touch with the 140 consular agents Japan has placed
in the islands; they subscribe to Japanese war funds; they read
their local Japanese papers, which refer to the Japanese army
as “our army.”
“War will come not because Japan dislikes what we are doing
on our side of the Pacific, but because we dislike what Japan
is doing on her side.
“The Army out there thinks of war and understands its job
as being ready not for what is certain, not for what is likely,
but for the worst that could reasonably be expected to happen.”
Don Wharton's treatise on “Our Hawaiian Gibraltar” was
more than an assurance of national preparedness. It was a
setting forth, in crystal-clear language, of where, by whom,
when, and how the prosperous, powerful, and proud Ameri-
can republic would be joined in battle.
Where? “The Pacific has long been recognized as the
most likely theater of America's next war.”
By whom? When? “War will come not because Japan
dislikes what we are doing on our side of the Pacific, but
because we dislike what Japan is doing on her side.”
What would be Japan's modus operandi'? Again Wharton,
in 1938, prophesies: “No enemy would care to waste his
capital ships against these fortifications. To prevent the
enemy from reducing the long-range batteries with planes,
we would probably use our air forces to destroy his aircraft

carriers or the airfields he had set up on some near-by island.
Oahu will soon have the largest air base of the entire Army.”
What indisputable evidence was there as to the precise
manner of assault on our Hawaiian Gibraltar? In this re-
spect also, the words of the prophet Habakkuk have an awe-
some cogency: “Write the vision, and make it plain upon
tables, that he may run that readeth it.”
A little more than a year after Don Wharton published
his story on Pearl Harbor, W. B. Courtney offered his ver-
sion of the prowess of “Brown and Yellow Bombers” in the
Reader's Digest of June, 1939:
“. . . can air power actually win military victories, influence
the course of battles?
“A foreign military observer in China furnished the answer:
‘The democracies are old-fashioned. They came of age with
infantry and dreadnoughts. But have you noticed that the dic-
tatorships are the greatest air powers in Europe, Japan the only
real air power out here? War has gone streamlined while your
country and mine, in a military sense, are still riding in trolley
cars. Air war is more efficient war. Air war is cheaper war.
That's why Japan hasn't gone broke, as economists predicted.
“‘Except for air power, China's sheer weight in men would
have exterminated the Japanese. In the drive on Hankow, for
example, the Japanese had only 180,000 men—opposed by at
least a million Chinese. But the Japanese used their air force
in close co-operation with their troops. They spotted every
Chinese attempt to concentrate for large-scale attacks and blasted
them before they could get under way. They have utterly de-
stroyed the Chinese railroads and highways supplying the front.
“‘With superior air power Japan has been able to make one
foot soldier do the work of ten. If she had to use just men and
guns to conquer this vast land she could not have afforded it.’”
Now, how were the spirits of our trusted public servants
affected by the visions of Wharton and Courtney written
plain upon the pages of the most widely circulated journal
in the world?
The authoritative answer comes from the pen of William
Bradford Huie:


## p. 388 (#424) ############################################

“As early as 1925, the American people were demanding a
powerful Air Force for national defense. Yet when the war
began in 1939—just two years before the Pearl Harbor disaster
—our Air Force's long-range bombing ‘strength' was only 13
experimental B-17's. This was because the War Department
failed to understand the importance of air power. . . .
“[In] 1938 the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Leahy,
asked Congress for 150 million dollars to build two new battle-
ships. He told Congress that battleships were ‘the best of mod-
ern weapons.”
“President Roosevelt told a press conference that a battleship's
anti-aircraft guns were the obvious antidote to the airplane.’
“General Douglas MacArthur, in the Philippines, told a corre-
spondent: ‘Japan will never attack us here as long as our main
fleet is in the Pacific.’
“And in September, 1941, Senator George Norris stood before
Congress and declared: ‘I think a little war with Japan might
not be bad for us. The Navy could blockade the island and the
war would be over in a few weeks. It would train our men for
the more difficult task in Europe.”
“America in 1941,” concluded William Bradford Huie, “had
the same false sense of power that France had in 1939. The
admirals had assured us that as long as we had our battleships
we were safe and powerful. We had no air power because the
vested interests had prevented its development. Our men of
vision were the prisoners of the Maginot minds who, except for
our geographical advantage, would have delivered this nation
into slavery just as France was delivered.”
In September, 1941, the neo-liberal, George W. Norris, as
noted by the writer, William Bradford Huie, in his Reader's
Digest narrative, stood before the Congress of the United
States and said, “I think a little war with Japan might not be
bad for us. The Navy could blockade the island and the war
would be over in a few weeks. It would train our men for
the more difficult task in Europe.”
What were the presumably helpless Japanese doing at the
very time when the United States Senator from Nebraska
emitted this twaddle?
In late September, 1941, Captain Mitsuo Fuchida of the
Imperial Japanese Navy received this laconic and startling


## p. 389 (#425) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 2.5" 389
order: “We want you to lead our air force in the event that
we attack Pearl Harbor.”
“In mid-November, after the most rigorous training,” Cap-
tain Fuchida recounted, “planes were taken on board their
respective carriers, which then headed for the Kuril Islands,
traveling singly and on different courses to avoid attention.
Then, at 0600 on the dark and cloudy morning of November
26, our 28-ship task force, including six carriers, left the
Kuriles.”
Then, most significantly, Captain Fuchida adds: “Vice-
Admiral Nagumo was in command of the Pearl Harbor
Attack Force. “In case negotiations with the United States
reach a successful conclusion,’ he had been instructed, ‘the
task force will return immediately to the homeland.’”
November 26, 1941, was the day of decision. If Ambassa-
dor Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura and Special Ambassador
Saburu Kurusu in Washington, D.C., were successful in their
negotiations with the President and the Secretary of State,
Vice-Admiral Nagumo's task force would return immediately
to the homeland.
But if Nomura and Kurusu failed, Captain Fuchida dis-
closed, “the attack plan called for execution in December.”
Just how consecrated was the President on his part toward
the achievement of peaceful relations between Japan and the
United States? The diary of the President's Secretary of War,
Henry L. Stimson, contains this fantastic entry for Novem-
ber 25th: “General Marshall and I went to the White House,
where we were until nearly half past one. At the meeting
were Hull, Knox, Marshall, Stark, and myself. The President
brought up the event that we were likely to be attacked, per-
haps (as soon as) next Monday, for the Japanese are notor-
ious for making an attack without warning, and the question
was what we should do. The question was how we should
maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot with-
25
-
out allowing too much danger to ourselves. . . .


## p. 390 (#426) ############################################

In this grim global game of chess in which the pawns were
men and machines, and not inanimate pieces of ivory, and
in which the Japanese did not know that they were being
maneuvered into firing the first shot, Captain Fuchida further
reveals: “Strict radio silence was observed throughout, but
we listened for broadcasts from Tokyo or Honolulu to catch
any word about the outbreak of war. In Tokyo a liaison con-
ference between the government and the High Command was
held every day from November 27 to 30 to discuss the U. S.
proposal of the 26th. It was concluded that the proposal was
an ultimatum tending to subjugate Japan and making war
inevitable, but that peace efforts should be continued ‘to the
last moment.’”
What was the nature of that fatal American note of No-
vember 26th which led Captain Fuchida to assume that the
proposal was an ultimatum tending to subjugate Japan and
making war inevitable?
“The American Government,” President Roosevelt re-
ported to the Congress, “in order to clarify the issues, pre-
sented to the Japanese Government, on November 26, a
clear-cut plan for a broad but simple settlement. . . .
“In section one there was outlined a mutual declaration
of policy containing affirmations that the national policies of
the two countries were directed toward peace throughout the
Pacific area, that the two countries had no territorial designs
or aggressive intentions in that area, and that they would give
active support to certain fundamental principles of peace upon
which their relations with each other and all other Nations
would be based. . . .
“In section two there were outlined proposed steps to be
taken by the two Governments. These steps envisaged a situ-
ation in which there would be no Japanese or other foreign
armed forces in French Indo-China or in China. . . .”
And, by a most curious circumstance, this note of Novem-
ber 26th was based on a memorandum drawn up by Harry

Dexter White, at that time Assistant to the Secretary of the
Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, Jr.
As a member of the Bolshevik American underground spy
apparatus, White had achieved practical mastery of the oper-
ations of a vital segment of the Federal Government. And
while the assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury and his
band of Communist agents were thus nefariously engaged,
the American colossus of capitalism, under the provisions of
the Lend-Lease Act, poured her wealth into Soviet Russia
with unmeasured prodigality. Hundreds of American ships,
manned for the most part by members of the American mer-
chant marine, heroically braved the unending perils of Ger-
man submarine and surface raiders, sailed on across the great
seas to Vladivostok, Murmansk, and a secret Persian Gulf
port, that they might bring succor to the miserable Bolshevik
prison-state then staggering under the nigh mortal blows
administered by Adolf Hitler's victorious armies.
Yet Joseph Stalin of Soviet Russia, like Winston Churchill
of the British Empire, was not satisfied with machine tools,
food, planes, and trucks—the American “tools of war.” The
reeling Communist victim of Germany's military might, as
with the similarly tottering British Commonwealth of Nations,
prayed and plotted for all-out American intervention, with
Japan as the bloody bait.
Here we may ask: Were Ambassador Admiral Kichisaburo
Nomura and his colleague, Special Ambassador Saburu
Kurusu, perfidious agents of the Japanese Government? The
diary of Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda
wizard, records this candid comment: “The Fuehrer con-
tinues to have the greatest admiration for the Japs . . .
Kurusu and Nomura negotiated in Washington without hav-
ing the faintest idea what the Japanese war leaders were
planning. . . . Kurusu and Nomura played an exceedingly
ludicrous role. . . . They deserved making fools of them-
selves, for the two diplomats had always been the representa-

tives of Japanese appeasement, now proven entirely senseless
and inimical to Japan.”
“The decision for war,” said Captain Mitsuo Fuchida of
the former Imperial Japanese Navy, “was made at an Im-
perial Conference on December 1. Next day the General
Staff issued the order: ‘X Day will be December 8' (Decem-
ber 7 in Hawaii).
“Now the die was cast. . . . We drove headlong toward
Pearl Harbor.
“Why was that Sunday chosen as X Day?” Captain
Fuchida explains. “Because our information indicated that
the American Fleet returned to Pearl Harbor on week ends
after training periods at sea. Also because the attack was to
be coordinated with our operations in Malaya, where air
raids and landings were scheduled for dawn of that day.
“Intelligence reports on U. S. Fleet activities were relayed
to us from Tokyo,” continues Captain Fuchida.
“‘No balloons, no torpedo-defense nets deployed around
battleships in Pearl Harbor. All battleships are in. No indi-
cations from enemy radio activity that ocean-patrol flights
being made in Hawaiian area. Lexington left harbor yester-
day. Enterprise also thought to be operating at sea.”
“Within 15 minutes 183 fighters, bombers and torpedo
planes had taken off from the six carriers and were forming
up in the still-dark sky, guided only by signal lights of the
lead planes. After circling over the fleet formation, we set
course due south for Pearl Harbor.
“I switched on the radio direction finder to tune in the
Honolulu radio station and soon picked up some music. By
turning the antenna I found the exact direction from which
the broadcast was coming and corrected our course.
“Now I heard a Honolulu weather report. . . . What a
lucky break for us! A more favorable situation could not
have been imagined. There would be openings in the clouds
over the island.

“About 0730 the clouds broke suddenly, and a long white
line of coast appeared. We were over the northern tip of
Oahu. It was time for our deployment.
“. . . . The sky cleared as we moved in on the target, and
I began. . . . The ships were there all right. “Notify all
planes to launch attacks,” I ordered my radioman.
“The first bombs fell at Hickam Field, where heavy bomb-
ers were lined up. The next places hit were Ford Island and
Wheeler Field. In a short time huge billows of black smoke
were rising from these bases.
“. . . . None but Japanese planes were in the air. Ships in
the harbor still appeared to be asleep. The Honolulu radio
broadcast continued normally. We had achieved surprise!
“All ten of my squadrons formed into a single column with
intervals of 200 meters—a gorgeous formation.
“As my group made its bomb run, American anti-aircraft
from shipboard and shore batteries suddenly came to life.
Dark gray bursts blossomed here and there until the sky was
clouded with shattering near misses which made our plane
tremble. I was startled by the rapidity of the counterattack,
which came less than five minutes after the first bomb had
fallen. The Japanese reaction would not have been so quick
—the Japanese character is suitable for offensives but does
not adjust readily to the defensive. Bombs in perfect pattern
plummeted like devils of doom. .
“Pearl Harbor and vicinity had been turned into complete
chaos.
“During the attack many of our pilots noted the brave
efforts of American fliers to get planes off the ground. Though
greatly outnumbered, they flew straight in to engage our
craft. Their effect was negligible, but their courage com-
manded admiration and respect.
“It took the planes of our first attack wave about one hour
to complete their mission.
“In the three hours that my plane was in the area we did
not encounter a single enemy plane.”

Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, in Cincinnati, the
air was pungent and the sun was curtained by clouds. Rabbi
Stern and his sister concluded their five-mile Sunday morn-
ing walk along the roads of Amberley Village in good time.
Many of their neighbors were returning home from Sun-
day morning worship. The three Stern children were at play
on the driveway. One hour before dinner, Dinah turned
page after page of the Cincinnati Sunday Enquirer. “So
much to read!” Her brother was at work now in his study,
preparing a prayer. The Jewish community of the nearby
city of Hamilton, Ohio, that same evening would assemble
at Temple Israel to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the founding of Hamilton's Bene Israel Congregation. Be-
cause Stern had served this group as student rabbi twenty
years before, he had been invited to deliver the invocation.
The jubilee address would be delivered by Dr. David Philip-
son, Cincinnati's renowned rabbi and dean of America's Re-
form Jewish ministers. -
When Stern had completed his composition, Dinah read
the headlines of the news section of the Sunday newspaper

merchant ships now in American ports.” Dinah’s voice was
resolute. The words resounded from her lips like the notes
of a trumpet. “Cincinnatian sought in Florida in slaying of
patrolman. . . . Russian envoy arrives; pleasure voiced by
envoy on impending meeting with Roosevelt. Litvinoff states
gratitude for Yankee aid against ‘common’ foe, Hitler.”
Here Dinah paused. “I wonder if the Russians will still be
grateful after the war is over?” she asked dubiously.
“Six persons killed; car struck by train bound for Cincin-
nati. . . . King Leopold III wed to Belgian commoner. . . .

immediate all-out full dress frontal attack on Japanese em-
pire contemplated. Present Pacific fleet . . . not strong
enough to seek out the Jap fleet, corner it, and try to sink
it all at once in a 1941 Trafalgar. Instead the Pacific fleet
would be used for blockade purposes at long distance, for
sudden attack upon isolated inferior forces. Japan's vital
supplies will be thus cut off from countries on which she is
dependent for raw materials.’”
“And before you go, Milt,” Dinah said, “I want to read
the front page editorial. It is a pre-Christmas appeal for
some of Cincinnati's neediest families. I don’t like to seem
cynical, Milt. But it seems to me that Roosevelt and all his
New Deal promises and alphabetical projects are still very
far from solving the very old dilemma of progress and pov-
erty. Perhaps all of this war drive is his only way of putting
the millions of unemployed to work.”
The telephone bell summoned Stern. Sidney's voice was
startling.
“Have you been listening to the radio, Milt?”
“No,” answered Stern. “Dinah and I have been reading
the Enquirer. What's the news?”
“Milt, the Japs have attacked Pearl Harbor. Does this
mean war? H. V. Kaltenborn is going on the air at two
o'clock over the National Broadcasting Company's Station
WLW. Be sure to listen. Good-bye, I'll be over this after-
noon.”
Stern reported his brother's message to Dinah. Leah came
into the room and listened. They were all stunned. They
spoke haltingly.
“Let’s first hear what Mr. Kaltenborn has to say at the
two o'clock broadcast.” Milton spoke almost in a whisper.
“Do you think they will call off the Hamilton meeting,
Milt?” Leah asked.
“Let’s wait. No doubt we will hear from Dr. Philipson.
He is to call for us at four o'clock this afternoon.”

That afternoon of December 7, 1941, Rabbi Philipson
and his party motored from Cincinnati to Hamilton. The
venerable rabbi's conversation was devoid of his customary
quips. His voice was low. His words were muffled. His
speech was scarcely audible. Over and over again, he mur-
mured: “I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it. I cannot be-
lieve it. Why, I didn't imagine those Japanese would dare to
attack us.”
“What effect, Doctor,” Milton inquired, “did the Presi-
dent's personal message to the Mikado yesterday have on the
Japanese militarists? Is it possible that they were outraged
by the President's audacity in addressing himself to their
deified emperor?”
“I don't know, Milt,” Rabbi Philipson answered, shaking
his head sadly. “The President has my sympathy. I suppose
he did make every effort to prevent our entry into the war.”
A little less than twenty-four hours after Captain Fuchida
and his ten air Squadrons had dealt the United States of
America one of the most crushing defeats in the history of
the republic, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stood before
a joint session of the 77th Congress and said: “Yesterday,
December 7, 1941—a date that will live in infamy—the
United States of America was suddenly and deliberately
attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.”
The President's voice came over the radio with extraordi-
nary power. Never in the ten years that Rabbi Stern had
listened to this perfect radio-orator had the voice seemed
more majestic. Never had the man seemed more transfigured
by lofty sentiments and great conviction. The words ema-
nated from the President's lips as if they had been engraved
by a master goldsmith. But the Circean mood of the radio
artist was not that of “a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief.”
Roosevelt's manner was not grim. It was ineffably calm:
“The United States was at peace with that Nation and, at
the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its

Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance
of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air
squadrons had commenced bombing in the American Island
of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and
his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal
reply to a recent American message. And while this reply
stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplo-
matic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or
of armed attack.
“It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan
makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned
many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time
the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive
the United States by false statements and expressions of hope
for continued peace.
“The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused
severe damage to American naval and military forces. I re-
gret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.
In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on
the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.”
The little-more-than-six-minute message was constantly in-
terrupted by vigorous bursts of applause.
“. . . . The facts of yesterday and today speak for them-
selves. The people of the United States have already formed
their opinions and well understand the implications to the
very life and safety of our Nation.
“As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I have
directed that all measures be taken for our defense.
“But always will our whole Nation remember the char-
acter of the onslaught against us.
“No matter how long it may take us to overcome this pre-
meditated invasion, the American people in their righteous
might will win through to absolute victory.
“I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of
the people when I assert that we will not only defend our-

selves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this
form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
“Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our
people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
“With confidence in our armed forces—with the unbound-
ing determination of our people—we will gain the inevitable
triumph—so help us God.”
And then came the dreadful decree less than twenty-five
years after Woodrow Wilson's “war to end war”:
“I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked
and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941,
a state of war has existed between the United States and the
Japanese Empire.”
Twenty-five years before, the Japanese Empire was a con-
federate nation of the United States of America in a war to
make the world safe for democracy. Today, the Japanese
were allied against the American republic in a fantastic fight
for freedom.
Thirty-three minutes after the completion of the President's
message, the Senate, by a vote of 82 to 0, and the House of
Representatives, by a vote of 388 to 1, passed a joint reso-
lution declaring that a state of war existed between the United
States and the Japanese Empire.
The one uniquely contrary vote was cast by a woman,
Miss Jeannette Rankin of Montana.
With sublime sang-froid the editors of the magazine Time
summarized:
“The Government and People of the United States declared
war on the Japanese Empire at 4:10 P.M. Monday, Decem-
ber 8, 1941. -
“At dawn the day before, the Japanese had attacked
savagely all along the whole great U. S. island-bridge which
stretches to the Orient.
“It was premeditated murder masked by a toothy smile.
The Nation had taken a heavy blow. The casualties crept
from rumor into uglier rumor: hundreds on hundreds of

Americans had died bomb-quick, or were dying, bed slow.
But the war came as a great relief, like a reverse earthquake,
that in one terrible jerk shook everything disjointed, dis-
torted, askew back into place. Japanese bombs had finally
brought national unity to the U. S.
“The war had got off to a bad start; there were military
wise men who thought that the U. S. had suffered the blackest
day in its military history since 1812. But to a nation finally
unified to war's reality, this opening disaster would be of
small account. The U. S. had embarked on the greatest
adventure in its history: to make the world really safe for
democracy.”
Great Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill was as
forthright in his exultation over the way in which American
neutrality had been completely dissolved, to make the United
States a British ally, as he had been fiercely straightforward
in his affirmation that he had not been chosen Prime Minister
to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire. Re-
ferring to the swift and almost unanimous action taken by
the Congress of the United States on the afternoon of De-
cember 8, 1941, Churchill said in a radio broadcast: “. . . is
what I have dreamed of, aimed at, and worked for, and now
it has come to pass.”
And what was the price which Franklin Delano Roosevelt
paid to extricate himself dramatically and chastely from the
bonds of neutrality and the campaign promise of 1940?
“I have been close to the horrors and glories of one of the
most crucial battles in America's history,” wrote Blake Clark
in the Reader's Digest. “Its beginning is a calm, sunny Sun-
day morning in one of the most peaceful spots of the world.
Its ending sees many American planes destroyed, ships dis-
abled, oil burning on the water, men swimming in it, nearly
3,000 lives lost. . . . more damage in one hour than the
U. S. fleet suffered in the entire World War.”
One week later, in a stirring radio broadcast, President
Roosevelt declaimed: “We covenant with each other before

all the world, that having taken up arms in the defense of
liberty, we will not lay them down before liberty is once
again secure in the world we live in. For that security we
pray; for that security we act—now and evermore.”
Would that in this hour of transcendent ecstasy the Presi-
dent of the United States had pored over the two-thousand-
year-old counsel of the Apocryphal sage, Jesus the son of
Sirach:
“Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his
wickedness.
“Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or
any such as come nigh wild beasts?
“So one that goeth to a sinner and is defiled with him in
his sin, who will pity?
“An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart
he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with
his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied
with blood.”

CHAPTER XXXIV
“JUST A DOCTOR IN THE NAVY”
Cincinnati, Ohio
December 12, 1941
The Honorable Lister Hill
Senate Office Building
Washington
Dear Lister:
Now that we are all-in in an all-out war, and now that
votes are coming your way with hardly a murmur of demur,
it seems to me someone like yourself would be interested in
the future of the men who will be called into active service.
There are at least two angles to this problem. The first is
that of the spiritual, social, and economic rehabilitation of
the veterans of this war. The second is that of the financial
burden resulting from the hospitalization and rehabilitation
of the disabled veterans. There is also the question of the
care of the widows, the orphans, and other dependents.
I have already written to you about the matter of hos-
pitalization and rehabilitation centers. Has the Federal Gov-
ernment decided upon any course of action similar to that
carried on by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance in 1917?
However, at this moment I am primarily interested in the
proposition of opening up civil service jobs to all veterans of
this war. This would apply especially to partially disabled
veterans. Permanent, satisfactory appointments for the dis-
abled men might do away with the pension system altogether.
There are thousands of good positions in Federal and State
and Municipal Civil Service that could be very well filled by
the men who have served their fellow-countrymen in the time
of great testing of spirit and ability. Of course, the men must
be qualified to hold the positions.
401


## p. 402 (#438) ############################################

The men so placed will cease to be a problem to the nation
which has been preserved by their valor and sacrifice. These
men will find a grateful country ready to give them the thing
they most desire—an honorable livelihood. Intelligent and
comprehensive planning in this sphere of post-war reconstruc-
tion will bring incalculable blessings to the nation as well as
to the men discharged from the armed forces.
As I see it, the country is, almost without a single excep-
tion, in complete accord with the foreign policy of the Ad-
ministration. For a long time, I believe, you will not be
confronted with legislative headaches. Don't you agree that
this is the time to prepare for the post-war battles?
When it is universally known that you have so wisely and
so intelligently planned for the future, you will have greatly
contributed to the morale of the nation and of our fighting
men. A great philosopher taught: “When we have turned our
experience into foresight, we become the masters of the future
and cease to be the slaves of the past.”
As I have said on other occasions, I hope you will find
some task for me in this emergency, so that when the story
of our country's second great battle for world-wide freedom
is told, my name again shall be among the thousands who
were found faithful in the land.
Fraternally,
MILT.
But in the second great battle for world-wide freedom, it
was not the rabbi, but his brother the physician, for whom
a task was found among the millions in uniform.

The housing situation here is in a terrible mess. San Diego
has normally a population of 120,000. There are over
350,000 people here now, mostly defense workers. Consoli-
dated Aircraft has its factory here. It is immense. In addi-
tion there are over 50,000 marines, almost as many sailors,
and several army camps.
I’ve been assigned to the Dispensary at the Naval Training
Station. The work is not too interesting, but it gives us some-
thing to do. I don't know how long I shall be here.
Love to all, SELMA AND SIDNEY.

. . . . Dr. Tom Levin of the Jewish Hospital [Cincinnati)
is also here. We are seeing a great deal of each other.
I am working at the Main Dispensary at the station, in
charge of a fifty-bed ward. This is considered to be one of
the best medical jobs out here and for that I am grateful.
The officers’ mess here is an awfully nice place. The food
is very cheap and of good quality. Selma plans to cook the
evening meal, and I will take breakfast and lunch at the mess.
The station is immense. It's a complete city in itself.
There is a nine-hole golf course on the grounds, tennis courts,
baseball diamond, stores, gasoline station, barber shops,
restaurants, post-office, etc., etc. I am allowed to purchase
anything I need, from spinach to electric waffle-irons, at con-
siderably below the regular cost. Gasoline is twelve cents a
gallon. Cigarettes, ten cents a pack. Shoes, for which I paid
$9.00 at home, cost $3.50 a pair here.
Patrol planes are constantly circling overhead, and a
flotilla of cruisers and destroyers is constantly in the harbor.
This is one of the most important bases of the Navy and it
is guarded night and day. If the Pacific coast is raided in
retaliation for the bombing of Tokyo, this is probably the
place to be bombed.
Don't worry about us. We're having the thrill of our young
lives. SIDNEY.

We're trying to find a good beach for swimming. None of

I don't get any formal naval training, i. e., I don't tie
knots, climb masts, fire torpedoes, or bomb Jap ships. That's
left to the line officers. I am just a doctor in the Navy. My
rank, Lieutenant, is purely complimentary and is given only
to insure discipline. Personally, I’m very happy in my pres-
ent post, but the way things are going, I may be transferred
at any time, so don't be surprised.
Everyone is excited about the victories in the Coral Sea
and off Midway and so are we. Didn't I tell you in a previous
letter that the Air Force has tremendous striking power? The
accent in the Navy is definitely on air-power. One of the
largest air bases in the country is located just across the bay
from San Diego. Selma and I visited there last Sunday. It
is a tremendous plant. The most frequently seen planes are
Lockheed Interceptors—the P-38, the fastest fighter in the
world—and Consolidated Catalina Flying Boats (a Catalina
sighted the Bismark—remember?).
The sinking of the “Lexington” was an unofficial secret
here for several weeks. The captain of that ship lives just a
few blocks from our apartment.
Yesterday we drove out into the country—in the straw-
berry country—and bought beautiful berries for 15c a quart.
Fruits are rotting in the fields because of a serious shortage
of pickers. The California Fruit Growers have appealed to
Washington for more labor—a real paradox, when you re-

Steinbeck to write his poignant novel The Grapes of Wrath.
Cherry pickers are getting 50c to 60c a bucket. Two years
ago they were lucky to get five cents.
Hurrah for the Republicans! Stassen and Willkie are doing

Don't be surprised if I’m transferred soon. Remember that
this is only a training station and not a permanent assign-
ment. I may be sent anywhere, including ship-duty. Because
of the rapid turnover, I am the ranking Junior Lieutenant on .

The intuition I had about a future transfer was well
grounded, and the future becomes the present. This is my
last day in San Diego. I have been transferred to Pearl

the Japs. I’m surprised to find myself taking the news of my
transfer to active duty as calmly as I have. Now I wonder
how I will stand up under fire. I don't believe I shall be afraid,

I purchased Seversky's Victory Through Air-Power in a
San Francisco bookshop and it helped immeasurably to re-
lieve the monotony. Reading the book reminded me of read-

This is probably the only time in my life when I have
really wanted time to pass.
Managed to read the August Reader's Digest in the last
few days. There is a very thought-provoking article in it
called “Invasion Next Tuesday” by Michie. He certainly
manages to break our bubbles of hope for a second front
soon. But I must admit that what he says is logical enough,
even though I don't want to believe it and even though I
sincerely hope that he's wrong. I have always maintained
that the war will be won or lost in Russia, and at the present
time it appears as though the winning of it will be a terribly
heart-rending job.
Selma writes me that most of the men on the hospital
staff have joined the services. I remember, just before I left,
how sure they all were that their minor ailments would keep
them out. They realize now that we're fighting for keeps,
and if they don't—God help them.
Mom should get herself a medical examination every four
to six months, by a competent physician. . . .
I certainly hope you folks aren't going to stop writing me
letters. The most precious thing to a man far from home is
a letter from home, so please write often.

One of the disadvantages of this type of life is the limited

Sorry I can't answer your questions about the Solomon

We were able to get last month's Time, Life, and The
Saturday Evening Post, today. Apparently, Time believes
that a second front this year is a foregone conclusion. I'm
not so sure about that. I don’t believe the English or our-
selves have sufficient strength really to challenge Germany's
position in Western Europe. Stalingrad and the Volga now
appear to be in German hands. If such was their objective
for the winter, Germany can shift strong forces to the West
to meet any possible invasion threat. I rather imagine that
the second front will be an air front.

Francisco. It hardly seems so long—so much has happened.
It's hard to say just how long I will be away from the States
—probably at least until Spring. When I do get back I'm
going to make every effort to get home, if even only for a
short time. Getting home is the most common topic of con-
versation among everybody—officers and men. We all appre-
ciate, as we never did before, that old saying, “Be it ever so
humble. . . .”
I’m reading Reveille in Washington by Margaret Leech—
a remarkable book. It's surprising to note the similarity
existing then and today in the matter of propaganda, unpre-
paredness, influence of the press, exaggerating victories and
playing down defeats, labor difficulties, politics, etc. But I
imagine it is so in all wars. Incidentally, in reading one ac-
count of World War I, in Bassett's A Short History of the

United States, the phrase “Arsenal of Democracy” is used to
denote our part in the war effort. We were to contribute
guns, not men. Apparently, there is “nothing new under the
sun.”
I’ve been spending a great deal of time thinking of the
future—as who hasn't—my future, I mean. I thought for a
while of going to a Post Graduate school [Northwestern Uni-
versity] for a while, but now I believe I'll try private practice.
Of course, it all depends on economic conditions after the
war is over.

Finally caught up with all your back mail. Thanks a
million—it was a real thrill to hear from you.
Congratulations to Milt on his election [National Chap-
lain, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States]. It may

I believe the war is approaching a critical phase. The Rus-
sians appear to be holding, although the pause of the Ger-
mans may be due only to lack of supplies and not due to the
Russians. However, it is unquestionable that the Germans
have suffered a defeat in spite of apparent victories, because
of their failure to capture any of the strategic supply routes
or oil depots. If the Russians have enough left over to mount
an attack on a large scale, I believe the German defeat will
be disastrous.
I have revised my opinion about Seversky. Air power is
indispensable in modern warfare, but it is not the entire an-
swer. As far as naval power is concerned, the issue will be
decided by the navy with the most and biggest guns, plus
superior air forces. Battleships, contrary to present public
opinion, are still the backbone of the fleet.
You can be proud of our Navy. We have a superb fight-
ing outfit, with the highest morale of any group of men I
have ever seen. Their fighting ability is without question tops,
and we are magnificently led. Our admirals are in the fore

Herbert Hoover's Problems of a Lasting Peace I find to
be a very detailed and provocative study—even though I
don't agree with all that he says.
It seems that most everyone I know is in the service in
some form or other.
We've been very active these few weeks, and as a result
all of us are pretty well tuckered out, including myself. Sev-
eral weeks of rest would help no end, but as I wrote Selma,
with things in their present state, it seems highly doubtful
that we'll get it.
The world is certainly a mad-house. The stories from the
Russian front are almost unbelievable. The ferocity is be-
yond imagination. That's the kind of war we're fighting.
I’m going to be a pacifist when I get out of this.
I'm in a pretty low mood today (as you can probably tell).
It's nothing serious, nothing that good, wholesome sleep
won't cure, or a week or so ashore in some place civilized.
I can understand now why young men must fight a war.

I’m still in the best of health, thank God. My waistline
has shrunk considerably, and I am no longer the buxom lad
who so blithely traipsed off to war. Not that I regret the loss
of avoirdupois, but the fat, which may connote “idle demo-
cratic weakness,” a la Hitler, has been replaced by the more
aggressive leanness of the fighting democracy. We've shown
that we can be tough when necessary. . . .

I'm sorry that I can't tell you where I have been, or what

CHAPTER XXXV
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES
“Bridge Blasted from Battleship by U. S. Destroyer
Off Guadalcanal.”
Press.-At the height of a violent sea battle in the
Solomons, the night of Nov. 12-13 [1942], the huge
gray hulk of a Japanese battleship came slashing through
the darkness, her engines driving her at a speed of close to
25 knots.
In her path was the U. S. S. Laffey, the first of a new
series of swift destroyers. -
The master of the Laffey, Lieut. Comdr. W. E. Hank of
Norfolk, Va., and her crew, were set for a kill that night. A
few minutes earlier they had silenced the guns of a Japanese
cruiser, but this was bigger game.
The report of the Twelfth Naval District told today of that
Sea epic. -
The Laffey rocketed straight at the vast shape of the enemy
battlewagon, her engines racing at “emergency full.” To the
crew of the destroyer it must have appeared that Commander
Hank was hurling his vessel at the enemy battleship in a
head-on suicide thrust. But he had other plans—plans that
had to be correct to the last decimal.
When the range was right, Commander Hank let go with
a salvo of torpedoes. But the Laffey was moving almost as
fast as the torpedoes. It was clear that with both ships head-
ing at full speed for the same square yard of ocean, the
destroyer was going to be there first, but by how much?
Every man held his breath.
& FRANCISCO, JAN. 12, [1943].-By the Associated
417


## p. 418 (#454) ############################################

418 *ēs R E D POT TA GE
The Navy report said, “As the bows crossed, an alert
Japanese on the forward deck could have tossed a hand
grenade onto the deck of the destroyer.” The margin was
just over ten feet. But the racing Laffey got clear in time.
It appeared that two of the torpedoes hit the battleship.
Then, as a parting insult, the Laffey's four 5-inch guns
were turned on the battleship's massive superstructure, focused
on the bridge. The bridge appeared “literally to pulverize
and blow away,” the Navy stated, “It was shot completely
off the ship.”
The battleship started blazing away with secondary guns,
since she could not depress her larger batteries far enough,
as the Laffey widened the range.
The little destroyer then found herself in deeper trouble.
She had separated from her companion ships and was sur-
rounded by the enemy. There was a battleship on her stern,
a second on her port beam, and two large Japanese destroy-
ers on the port bow.
The Laffey and the two enemy destroyers opened fire
simultaneously. The Laffey put one out of action and left
her burning briskly, but the other put a torpedo into the
American ship and got a fair hit on her deck.
The Laffey still had three of her five-inch guns working
and turned them on the remaining Japanese destroyer in a
no-quarter duel at point blank range. Damage to both ships
was tremendous.
One after another the Laffey's guns were silenced. Finally
she was down to a single big gun, but she kept on fighting.
The Japanese destroyer tried to creep away, but she exploded
and sank.
The Laffey was left alone on the darkened sea with all her
guns silenced and a bad fire out of control. Then the Japanese
battleship whose bridge had been shot away straddled the
Laffey with a salvo of 14-inchers. The destroyer was almost
swamped by the splash. The fire was burning without hope
of recovery. The Laffey's wounded were put on life rafts.


## p. 419 (#455) ############################################

R E D POT TA GE 22.5" 419
The rest of her crew donned life jackets. Commander Hank
gave the order to abandon ship.
Commander Hank and three other officers were on deck
forward. A medical officer was bringing up the last wounded
man from the sick bay. A violent explosion ripped the Laffey
apart. The medical officer was trapped below; the skipper
was never seen again. The Laffey sank immediately.
“Death of a Destroyer.” [Editorial, January 14, 1943.]
The hulk of the destroyer Laffey rests quietly under the
sea off the Solomon Islands, but in her last fight she left a
wake of glory that will shine forever in the annals of the
American Navy. Racing bow on, the little vessel met every-
thing the enemy had—cruiser, battleship and lighter craft
alike—pouring her tons of destruction into each before she
herself went down with the explosion of her own magazines.
The record tells a story of heroic sacrifice. The Laffey
could not hope to run the gantlet of heavy Japanese ships
into which she led our squadron of destroyers on the night
of Nov. 12. But her headlong attack helped to win the
victory for our fleet. Her first victim was an enemy cruiser.
Her broadside left it smoking and silent. Then the ghostlike
bulk of a battleship loomed ahead. The Laffey let her have
a salvo of torpedoes, two of which struck home; then cut
across her bows by a ten-foot margin, blowing her bridge
away with five-inch shells. The ships were so close that the
huge enemy craft could not depress her big guns sufficiently
to open fire. The Laffey sped beyond the range of her sec-
ondary battery, but found herself between two Japanese
battleships and surrounded by enemy destroyers. She en-
gaged a pair of these, leaving one out of action and afire, but
receiving a torpedo from the other. Three of the Laffey's
guns were still working. She sank the enemy ship with her
last gun in action. Now, with all her guns silent, she lay

helpless and flaming in the midst of the Japanese fleet. A
salvo from the 14-inch guns of a battleship straddled and
swamped her, but she continued to burn. Commander Hank
got the survivors of his crew into life rafts. He himself was
on his ship when she blew up.
Perhaps no destroyer ever fought against such unequal
odds or left heavier wounds on the enemy. Certainly none
ever fought to her death more gallantly.

CHAPTER XXXVI
“THE HIGHEST TRADITIONS OF THE NAVY”
San Francisco, Calif.
May 30, 1943
INAH, DEAR:
Today I had personal contact with the Chief Gun-
ner from the Laffey. I'm heartsick that my news can-
not be more hopeful, but it may give all of you some degree
of comfort in the knowledge that Sidney, as Milton, was a
real hero of the miserable war.
About two weeks ago I had a letter from the Chaplain
telling me that two of the men from the Laffey were at Oak
Knoll Navy Hospital. Today we went over. The Chief
Gunner told us the story. He knew “the Doctor” well—he
taught him to shoot—often they discussed what they would
do in certain situations. This is how “the Doctor” got his
wounded off the destroyer. He told every man that he had
to carry a wounded man “up”—if he didn't, “the Doctor”
said he would shoot him—and he stood with a pistol in his
hand.
The gunner said of course he was with the guns but had
felt sure that the Commander, the Doctor, and one or two
men were still below when the ship was blown up. He, him-
self, as the lieutenant, was on a raft for six hours and then
was picked up. He was not wounded on ship but while swim-
ming, and as he raised his arm, it was hit. It has been saved,
however, and is healing. He is a regular Navy petty officer.
I'll give you his name and address but do be very cautious
if you write, because his nerves are far from regular. Several
times in speaking the tears came to his eyes. He is one of the

gunners of whom “Pathfinder” spoke in great praise. The
other man had been sent to Santa Cruz (about 100 miles
south) and he had worked right with “the Doctor.” I took
over homemade candy and cigarettes and will send more
with a note to Santa Cruz. Another from the Laffey is there,
but was on leave. I had not known of him.
My heartfelt grief is with all of Sidney's dear ones and I
am more than sorry to convey the sad details.

Dear Sir:
It has been requested by the President of the V. F. W.
here that I write you in regard to a letter that you wrote him
about your brother, Dr. Stern.
I think it would be only my duty to do so. If I can be of
any help, I don't know, as I could not tell you anything that
you don't know already.
I am sure that I was about the last person to see him, as
we were working with the wounded in the sick bay when the
order was given to abandon ship. I carried the man out that
I was working on, and he was still in the sick bay at that
time, and I just made it by a hair, as the magazine of the
ship blew up as I hit the water, and I wouldn't think there
was a chance that he got off at all. I can't say he was killed
as I didn't view the body.
All I can do is extend my sympathy. I enjoyed working
with him and learned to love him the time we served on the
U. S. S. Laffey. And this is about all the help I could be.
Sincerely yours,

to November 13, 1942. Braving hostile fire to rescue sur-
vivors from submarine-infested waters, the LAFFEY, after
fighting effectively in the battle off Cape Esperance, success-
fully repelled an aerial torpedo attack and, although badly
crippled and set afire, inflicted severe damage on Japanese
naval units off Savo Island. Eventually succumbing to her
wounds after the enemy had fled in defeat, she left behind
her an illustrious example of heroic fighting spirit.”

gº E look not at the things which are seen, but at
C(O). things which are not seen. For the things
which are seen are temporal; but the things
which are not seen are eternal.”
We look not at the shattered ships of war. We look not
at the battered bombing planes, twisted tanks, cracked-up
caissons. Nor do we linger near those ragged graves, which,
dug in haste, shall give up their precious bodies in days to
COInc.
The things which are seen—are temporal. Material wreck-
age will be transformed into tractors and typewriters. In-
stead of a ghastly hail from the central blue of the sky, the
pilots of all nations shall drop down with costly bales for
everyone's life and the death of none.
There have been defeats of the body through hunger,
through thirst, through weariness, through disease, and
through emptiness of hands. Men, Americans, by the hun-
dreds; men, Americans, by the thousands, have been led into
captivity. Ships, small and large, have been ingloriously
swept off the seas. Our flag, the banner which once made
tyranny tremble, has been torn down. The ensign of freedom
has been dragged in the dust.
But we look not at the things which are seen. They are
temporal.
Our fathers, too, retreated at Bunker Hill. They fell back
before the enemy at Long Island. They were humbled outside
the hills of Philadelphia—at Valley Forge. But of these
events General Washington said: “The unparalleled perse-

verance of the armies of the United States, through almost
every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of
eight long years, was little short of a standing miracle.”
They who hate us, scorned our manhood. They who de-
spise our system of government, laughed at our capacity to
bear hardship, to accept rigorous discipline, to undergo suf-
fering of body, of mind, and of soul.
They who have cast away the old reverences, despise
honor, mock at compassion, defy us, revile us, taunt us.
But the things which they see, are temporal. They are but
for the moment, the outward edges, not whispers of eternity.
They had not counted upon the fidelity and the valor
which Wake Island revealed to their jaundiced eyes. They
had not imagined the sacrificial spirit which Bataan unfolded,
nor the incredible fortitude of Corregidor. They were con-
founded by the dauntless spirit of Coral Sea and Midway.
They have been overwhelmed by the fury and the skill of
the men of Guadalcanal.
We know that victory on the field of battle does not always
come to the righteous. Virtue and valor are not enough to
turn the tide of battle unless there is a sufficiency of men and
munitions. The conquests of Poland, the Netherlands, Bel-
gium, and even of France, do not in themselves testify to the
triumph of justice. The control of Korea and much of China
today surely do not certify to the high character of their
overlords.
But the qualities of valor, fortitude, perseverance, honor—
the things which are not seen—are of the thunder of omnipo-
tence, before which tyrants and conquerors quail.
When the battle-flags are furled and the war drums throb
no longer, we shall welcome the returning veterans, back to
their homes, to their workshops, to their communities—not
as mighty conquerors of the things which are seen.
We shall hail them as heralds of the things which are not
seen. We shall embrace them as the saviors of our national
soul.

We shall thank them for the regeneration of our hearts
and of our minds. The victory we shall celebrate will not be
the triumph of flesh and steel and military cunning, but the
victory of the spirit of freedom.
We shall not boast of the islands we have overrun. Nor
of the countries we have liberated. We will not glory in the
thousands they have slain. Nor the tens of thousands they
have wounded or captured. We shall not gloat over the
misery of the vanquished. For we look not at the things
which are seen.
With thanksgiving to the Almighty on our lips, with deep
gratitude in our hearts, we bow our heads in humility. For
the things which are not seen: for perseverance, for fidelity
to duty, for love of country which passes understanding, for
the choice of liberty rather than the fleshpots of despotism,
for incorruptible honor, for the watch by day, for the stead-
fastness by night, for the endurance of heat and cold, the
stormy winds, and the jungle terrors; for the perfect faith
which knows no fear, for loyalty to family and friends; we,
your elder comrades in arms, salute you on this first anni-
versary of the tragedy of Pearl Harbor.

[New York City, National Encampment, Veterans of
Foreign Wars, September 28, 1943.]
Counsellor: blessed is the man whose strength is in
Thee; in whose heart are the ways of them who, pass-
ing through the valley of weeping, make it a goodly rain for
increase.
Blessed is the nation whose statesmen are righteous, ruling
in the fear of Thy justice and Thy judgments.
Blessed is the people that love Thy law and who hearken
diligently unto the voice of Thy prophets.
Our frame is but dust. Our days on earth are as a fleeting
shadow. Yet there is a spirit in man which has lifted him
above the beast of the field and made him but a little lower
than the angels, in knowledge, in wisdom, and in power to
order his ways. A spark disturbs our dust. Lo, the wilder-
ness is cultivated, the mountain pierced, the ocean bridged.
The wind, the lightning and the sun, once so terrible to man,
become the instruments of his will and hand.
In the march forward and upward toward freedom and
perfection, in the thousand years of toil and tears and travail,
man has slowly drawn closer to fellowman in mutual aid and
manly association.
Today we stand on the threshold of a more perfect union
of nations. The ancient landmarks have become vanity of
vanities. Man comes nearer to Thee in truth and in brother-
hood. For when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away with.

Now we see as in a mirror, darkly. Then, though there are
diversities of nations, there shall be but one spirit. Then,
though there are differences of administrations, there shall be
but one law. Then, though there shall be diversities of oper-
ations, it shall be the same God working all in all.
And now abideth faith, hope and love: faith in the nobility
of man; hope in the power of righteousness; and love which
beareth all things and faileth not.
Praised be Thou, O Lord, our God, in whose hand are
the spirits of all flesh; lead us in the paths of righteousness,
for Thy Name's sake.
