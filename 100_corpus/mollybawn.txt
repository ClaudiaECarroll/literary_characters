MOLLY BAWN.
CHAPTER I.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder.
Romeo and Julict.
That is the way with you men; you don't understand us-you cannot.
Courtship of Miles Standish.
WHETHER'it is be use of Marcia's demeanour to-
wards Mr. Buscarlet or the unusual excellence of the
weather no one can tell, but to-night Mr. Amherst is
in one of his choicest moods.
Each of his remarks outdoes the last in brilliancy
of conception, whilst all tend in one direction, and
show a laudable desire to touch on open wounds.
Even the presence of his chosen intimate, the lawyer,
who remains to dinner and an uncomfortable evening
afterwards, has not power to stop him, though Mr.
Buscarlet does all in his knowledge to conciliate him,
and fags on wearily through his gossiping conversation
with an ardour and such an amount of staying power
as raises admiration even in the breast of Marcia.
All in vain. The little black dog has settled down
on the old gentleman's shoulders with a vengeance
and a determination to see it out with the guests not
to be shaken.

Poor Mr. Potts is the victim of the hour. Though
why, because he is enraged with Marcia, Mr. Amherst
should expend his violence upon the wretched Plan-
tagenet is a matter for speculation. He leaves no
stone unturned to bring down condemnation on the
head of this poor youth and destroy his peace of
mind; but fortunately Plantagenet has learned the
happy knack of “ducking" mentally, and so letting all
hostile missiles fly harmless over his rosy head.
After dinner Mr. Darley good-naturedly suggests a
game of bézique with his host, but is snubbed, to the
great grief of those assembled in the drawing-room.
Thereupon Darley, with an air of relief, takes up a
book and retires within himself, leaving Mr. Buscarlet
to come once more to the front.
“You have heard, of course, about the Wyburns?”
he says, addressing Mr. Amherst. ' "They are very
much cut up about that second boy. He has turned
out such a failure! He missed his examination again
last week.”
“I see no cause for wonder. What does Wyburn
expect? At sixty-five he weds a silly chit of nineteen
without an earthly idea in her head, and then dreams
of giving a genius to the world! When," says Mr.
Amherst, turning his gaze freely upon the devoted
Potts, “men marry late in life they always beget fools.”
“That's me,” says Mr. Potts, addressing Molly in
an undertone, utterly unabashed. “My father married
at sixty and my mother at twenty-five. In me you
behold the fatal result."
“Well, well,” goes on Mr. Buscarlet hastily, with a
view to checking the storm, “I think in this case it
was more idleness than want of brain.”

“My dear Buscarlet, did you ever yet hear of a
dunce whose mother did not go about impressing upon
people how idle the dear boy was? Idle! Pooh! lack
of intellect.”
“At all events the Wyburns are to be pitied. The
eldest son's marriage with one so much beneath him
was also a sad blow."
“Was it? Others endure like blows and make no
complaint. It is quite the common and regular thing
for the child you have nurtured, to grow up and em-
bitter your life in every possible way by marrying
against your wishes or otherwise bringing down dis-
grace upon your head. I have been specially blessed
in my children and grandchildren.”
"Just so, no doubt—no doubt,” says Mr. Buscarlet
nervously. There is a meaning sneer about the old
man's lips.
“Specially blessed,” he repeats. “I had reason to
be proud of them. Each child as he or she married
gave me fresh cause for joy. Marcia's mother was an
Italian dancer.”
"She was an actress," Marcia interposes calmly,
not a line of displeasure, not the faintest trace of
anger discernible in her pale face; “I do not recollect
having ever heard she danced.”
“Probably she suppressed that fact. It hardly adds
to one's respectability. Philip's father was a spend-
thrift. His son develops day by day a very dutiful
desire to follow in his footsteps.”
“Perhaps I might do worse," Shadwell replies,
with a little aggravating laugh. “At all events he was
beloved.”

MOLLY BAWN,
“So he was—while his money lasted. Eleanor's
father-4"
With a sudden, irrepressible start Molly rises to
her feet and, with a rather white face, turns to her
grandfather.
“I will thank you, grandpapa, to say nothing
against my father,” she says in tones so low, yet so
full of dignity and indignation, that the old man
actually pauses.
“High tragedy,” says he, with a sneer. “Why, you
are all wrongly assorted. The actress should have
been your mother, Eleanor."
Yet it is noticeable that he makes no further at-
tempt to slight the memory of the dead Massereene.
“I shan't be able to stand much more of this,”
says Mr. Potts presently, coming behind the lounger
on which sit Lady Stafford and Molly. “I shall in-
fallibly blow out at that obnoxious old person, or else
do something equally reprehensible.”
“He is a perfect bear,” says Cecil angrily.
“He is a wicked old man,” says Molly, still trem-
bling with indignation.
“He is a jolly old snook,” says Mr. Potts. But as
neither of his listeners know what he means they do
not respond.
“Let us do something," says Plantagenet briskly.
"But what? Will you sing for us, Molly? ‘Music
hath charms to soothe the savage breast.
“It would take a good deal of music to soothe our
bête noire," says Potts. “Besides—I confess it-music
is not what Artemus Ward would call my “forte. I
don't understand it. I am like the man who said he
only knew two tunes in the world: one was ‘God

save the Queen,' and the other—wasn't. No, let us
do something active—something unusual—something
wicked.”
“If you can suggest anything likely to answer to
your description you will make me your friend for
life,” says Cecil with solemnity. “I feel bad.”
“Did you ever see a devil?” asks Mr. Potts in a
sepulchral tone.
“A what?” exclaim Cecil and Molly in a breath.
“A devil," repeats he unmoved. “I don't mean
our own particular old gentleman, who has been be-
having so sweetly to-night, but a regular bonâ fide
one.”
“Are you a spiritualist?” Cecil asks with awe.
"Nothing half so paltry. There is no deception
about my performance. It is simplicity itself. There
is no rapping, but a great deal of powder. Have you
never seen one?”
“A devil? Never.”
“Should you like to?”
“Shouldn't I!” says Cecil with enthusiasm.
"Then you shall.” Much gratified. “It won't be
much, you know, but it has a pretty effect, and any-
thing will be less deadly than sitting here listening to
the honeyed speeches of our host. I will go and
prepare my work, and call you when it is ready."
In twenty minutes he returns and beckons them to
come; and, rising, both girls, quit the drawing-room.
With much glee Mr. Potts conducts them across the
hall into the library, where they find all the chairs and
the centre table pushed into a corner, as though to
make room for one soup-plate which occupies the
middle of the floor.

On this plate stands a miniature hill, broad at the
base and tapering at the summit, composed of blended
powder and water, which Mr. Potts has been carefully
heating in an oven during his absence until according
to his lights it has reached a proper dryness.
“Good gracious, what is it?” asks Molly.
"Powder,” says Potts.
“I hope it won't go off and blow us all to bits,"
says Cecil anxiously.
“It will go off, certainly; but it won't do any
damage," replies their showman with confidence; "and
really it is very pretty while burning. I used to make
'em by hundreds when I was a boy, and nothing ever
happened except once, when I blew the ear off my
father's coachman."
This is not reassuring. Molly gets a little closer
to Cecil, and Cecil gets a little nearer to Molly. They
both sensibly increase the distance between them and
the “devil.”
“Now I am going to put out the lamp," says
Plantagenet, suiting the action to the word and sud-
denly placing them in darkness.
“It don't look any-
thing if there is light to overpower its own brilliancy."
Striking a match, he applies it to the little black
mountain, and in a second it turns into a burning
The sparks fly rapidly upwards. It seems to be
pouring its fire in little liquid streams all down its sides.
Cecil and Molly are in raptures.
“It is Vesuvius,” says the former.
“It is Mount Etna," says the latter, "except much
better, because they don't seem to have any volcanoes
nowadays. Mr. Potts, you deserve a prize medal for
giving us such a treat."

“Plantagenet, my dear, I didn't believe it was in
you," says Cecil. “Permit me to compliment you on
your unprecedented success.”
Presently, however, they slightly alter their senti-
ments. Every schoolboy knows how overpowering is
the smell of burnt powder.
“What an intolerable smell!” says Molly, when the
little mound is half-burned down, putting her dainty
handkerchief up to her nose. “Oh! what is it? Gun-
powder? Brimstone? Sulphur?"
“And extremely appropriate, too, dear," says Cecil,
who has also got her nose buried in her cambric-
"entirely carries out the character of the entertainment.
You surely didn't expect to be regaled with incense or
attar of roses? By-the-by, Plantagenet, is there going
to be much more of it—the smell, I mean?"
“Not much," replies he. “And after all what is it?
If you went out shooting every day you would think
nothing of it. For my part I almost like the smell. It
is wholesome, and-er Oh, by Jove!"
There is a loud report—a crash-two terrified
screams, and then utter darkness. The base of the
hill, being too dry, has treacherously gone off without
warning-hence the explosion.
“You aren't hurt, are you?” asks Mr. Potts a minute
later, in a terrified whisper, being unable to see whether
his companions are dead or alive.
“Not much," replies Cecil, in a trembling tone;
“but, oh! what has happened? Molly, speak.”
“I am quite safe,” says Molly, “but horribly fright-
ened. Mr. Potts, are you all right?”
"I am.” He is ignorant of the fact that one of his
cheeks is black as any nigger's, and that both his

hands resemble it. "I really thought it was all up
when I heard you scream. It was that wretched
powder, that got too dry at the end. However, it don't
matter.”
“Have you both your ears, Molly?” asks Cecil,
with a laugh; but a sudden commotion in the hall out-
side, and the rapid advance of footsteps in their direc-
tion, checks her merriment.
"I hear Mr. Amherst's voice”, says Mr. Potts
tragically. “If he finds us here we are ruined.”
“Let us get behind the curtains at the other end
of the room,” whispers Cecil hurriedly; "they may not
find us there--and-throw the plate out of the win-
dow."
No sooner said than done: Plantagenet with a
quick movement precipitates the soup-plate—or rather
what remains of it—into the courtyard beneath, where
it falls with a horrible clatter, and hastily follows his
two companions into their uncertain hiding-place.
It stands in a remote corner, rather hidden by a
bookcase, and consists of a broad wooden pedestal,
hung round with curtains, that once supported a choice
statue. The statue having been promoted some time
since, the three conspirators now take its place, and
find themselves completely concealed by its falling
draperies.
This recess, having been originally intended for
one, can with difficulty conceal two, so I leave it to
your imagination to consider how badly three fare for
room inside it.
Mr. Potts, finding himself in the middle, begins to
wish he had been born without arms, as he now knows
not how to dispose of them. He stirs the right one,

and Cecil instantly declares in an agonised whisper
that she is falling off the pedestal. He moves the left,
and Molly murmurs frantically in another instant she
will be through the curtains at her side. Driven to
distraction, poor Potts, with many apologies, solves the
difficulty by placing an arm round each complainant,
and so supports them on their treacherous footing.
They have scarcely brought themselves into a re-
tainable position when the door opens and Mr. Am-
herst enters the room, followed by Sir Penthony Stafford
and Luttrell.
With one candlestick only are they armed, which
Sir Penthony holds, having naturally expected to find
the library lighted.
“What is the meaning of this smell?” exclaims Mr.
Amherst, in an awful voice, that makes our three friends
shiver in their shoes. “Has anyone been trying to
blow up the house? I insist on learning the meaning
of this disgraceful affair."
“There doesn't seem to be anything," says Ted-
castle, "except gunpowder, or rather the unpleasant
remains of it. The burglar has evidently flown."
“If you intend turning the matter into a joke," re-
torts Mr. Amherst, "you had better leave the room.”
"Nothing shall induce me to quit the post of
danger,” replies Luttrell, unruffled.
Meantime Sir Penthony, who is of a more suspi-
cious nature, is making an elaborate search. Slowly,
methodically he commences a tour round the room,
until presently he comes to a standstill before the cur-
tains that conceal the trembling trio.
Mr. Amherst, in the middle of the floor, is busily
engaged examining the chips of china that remain

after their fiasco—and that ought to tell the tale of a
soup-plate.
Tedcastle comes to Sir Penthony's side.
Together they withdraw the curtains; together they
view what rests behind them.
Grand tableau!
Mr. Potts, with half his face blackened beyond re-
cognition, glares out at them with the courage of de-
spair. On one side of him is Lady Stafford, on the
other Miss Massereene; from behind each of their
waists protrudes a huge and sooty hand. That hand
belongs to Potts.
Three pairs of eyes gleam at the discoverers,
silently, entreatingly, yet with what different expres-
sions! Molly is frightened, but evidently braced for
action; Mr. Potts is defiant; Lady Stafford is absolutely
convulsed with laughter. Already filled with a keen
sense of the comicality of the situation, it only wanted
her husband's face of indignant surprise to utterly un-
settle her. Therefore it is that the one embarrassment
she suffers from is a difficulty in refraining from an
outburst of merriment.
There is a dead silence. Only the grating of Mr.
Amherst's bits of china mars the stillness. Plantagenet,
staring at his judges, defies them, without a word, to
betray their retreat. The judges-although angry-
stare back at him, and acknowledge their inability to
play the sneak. Sir Penthony drops the curtain--and
the candle. Instantly darkness covers them. Luttrell
scrapes a heavy chair along the waxed borders of the
floor; there is some faint confusion, a rustle of petti-
coats, a few more footsteps than ought to be in the
room, an uncivil remark from old Amherst about some

people's fingers being all thumbs, and then once more
silence.
When, after a pause, Sir Penthony relights his
candle the search is at an end.
Now that they are well out of the library, though
still in the gloomy little anteroom that leads to it,
Molly and Cecil pause to recover breath. For a few
moments they keep an unbroken quiet. Lady Stafford
is the first to speak—as might be expected.
“I am bitterly disappointed," she says, in a tone
of intense disgust. “It is a downright swindle. In
spite of a belief that has lasted for years, that nose of
his is a failure. I think nothing of it. With all its
length and all its sharpness, it never found us out!"
“Let us be thankful for that same," returns Molly
devoutly.
By this time they have reached the outer hall,
where the lamps are shining vigorously. They now
shine down with unkind brilliancy on Mr. Pott's dis-
figured countenance. A heavy veil of black spreads
from his nose to his left ear, rather spoiling the effect
of his unique ugliness.
It is impossible to resist: Lady Stafford instantly
breaks down, and gives way to the laughter that has
been oppressing her for the last half-hour, Molly chimes
in, and together they laugh with such hearty delight that
Mr. Potts burns to know the cause of their mirth, that
he may join in.
He grins, however, in sympathy, whilst waiting im-
patiently an explanation. His utter ignorance of the
real reason only enhances the absurdity of his appear-
ance and prolongs the delight of his companions.
When two minutes have elapsed, and still neither

of them offers any information, he grows grave,
and
whispers, rather to himself than them, the one word,
“Hysterics!”
“You are right,” cries Cecil; “I was never nearer
hysterics in my life. Oh, Plantagenet! your face is as
black as-as-2"
“Your hat!” supplies Molly, as well as she can
speak. “And your hands—you look demoniacal. Do
run away and wash yourself and I hear some-
body coming."
Wereupon Potts scampers upstairs, while the other
two gain the drawing-room, just as Mr. Amherst ap-
pears in the hall.
Seeing them, half an hour later, seated in all quie-
tude and sobriety, discussing the war and the last
new marvel. in bonnets, who would have supposed
them guilty of their impromptu game of “hide and
seek?”
Tedcastle and Sir Penthony, indeed, look much
more like the real culprits, being justly annoyed, and
consequently rather cloudy about the brows. Yet, with
a sense of dignified pride, they abstain from giving
voice to their disapprobation, and make no comment
on the event of the evening.
Mr. Potts is serenity itself, and is apparently
ignorant of having given offence to anyone. His face
has regained its pristine fairness, and is scrupulously
clean; so is his conscience. He looks incapable of
harm.
Bed-hour arrives, and Tedcastle retires to his pipe
without betraying his inmost feelings. Sir Penthony
is determined to follow his lead; Cecil is equally de-
termined he shall not. To have it out with him with-

out further loss of time is her fixed intention, and with
that design she says, a little imperiously:
"Sir Penthony, get me my candle."
She has lingered, before saying this, until almost
all the others have disappeared. The last of the men
is vanishing round the corner that leads to the smok-
ing-room; the last of the women has gone beyond
sight up the staircase in search of her bedroom fire.
Cecil and her husband stand alone in the vast hall.
"I fear you are annoyed about something," she
says, in a maddening tone of commiseration, regarding
him keenly, while he gravely lights her candle.
“Why should you suppose so?"
“Because of your gravity and unusual silence."
"I was never a great talker, and I do not think I
am in the habit of laughing more than other people.”
"But you have not laughed at all-all this evening,
at least”—with a smile—“not since you discovered us
in durance vile."
“Did you find the situation so unpleasant? I
fancied it rather amused you—so much so that you
even appeared to forget the dignity that, as a married
woman, ought to belong to you.”
“Well, but”-provokingly~"you forget how very
little married I am.”
“At all events you are my wife”-rather angrily-
“I must beg you to remember that. And for the future
I shall ask you to refrain from such amusements as
call for concealment and necessitate the support of a
young man's arm."
“I really do not see by what right you interfere
with either me or my amusements," says Cecil hotly,
after a decided pause. Never has he addressed her

with so much sternness. She raises her eyes to his
and colours richly all through her creamy skin. "Re-
collect our bargain."
“I do. I recollect also that you have my name.”
“And you have my money.
That makes us quits.”
"I do not see how you intend carrying out that
argument. The money was quite as much mine as
yours.”
“And
you
could not have had it without me."
“Nor you without me.”
“Which is to be regretted. At least I should
have had a clear half, which I haven't; so you have
the best of it. And I will not be followed about,
and pried after, and made generally uncomfortable by
anyone."
“Who is prying after you?”
“You are.”
"What do you mean, Cecil?" Haughtily.
“Just what I say. And, as I never so far forget
myself as to call you by your Christian name without
its prefix, I think you might have the courtesy to ad-
dress me as Lady Stafford.”
“Certainly, if you wish it."
"I do. Have you anything more to say?"
“Yes, more than
“Then pray defer it until to-morrow, as"_with a
barefaced attempt at a yawn—"I really cannot sit up
any longer. Good night, Sir Penthony."
Sir Penthony puts the end of his long moustache
into his mouth-a sure sign of irritation—and declines
to answer.
“Good night," repeats her ladyship blandly, going
up the staircase, with a suspicion of a smile at the

corners of her lips, and feeling no surprise that her
polite little adieu receives no reply.
When she has reached the centre of the broad
staircase she pauses, and, leaning her white arms upon
the banisters, looks down upon her husband, standing
irresolute and angry in the hall beneath.
“Sir Penthony," murmurs she; “Sir Here
she hesitates for so long a time that when at last the
“Penthony" does come it sounds more familar and
almost unconnected with the preceding word.
Stafford turns, and glances quickly up at her. She
is dressed in some soft-flowing gown of black, caught
here and there with heavy bows and bands of cream-
colour, that contrasts admirably with her fair, soft
skin, her laughing eyes, and pouting, rosy lips. In
her hair, which she wears low on her neck, is a black
comb studded with pearls; there are a few pearls
round her neck, a few more in her small ears; she
wears no bracelets, only two narrow bands of black
velvet caught with pearls, that make her arms seem
even rounder and whiter than they are.
"Good night,” she says for the third time, nodding
at him in a slow, sweet fashion that has some grace
or charm about it all its own, and makes her at the
instant ten times lovelier than she was before.
Stafford, coming forward until he stands right under
her, gazes up at her entranced like some modern
Romeo. Indeed, there is something almost theatrical
about them as they linger, each waiting for the other
to speak; he fond and impassioned, yet half-angry
too; she calm and smiling, yet mutinous. For a full
minute they thus hesitate, looking into each other's

eyes; then the anger fades from Stafford's face, and
he whispers eagerly, tenderly:
“Good night, my--
“Friend," murmurs back her ladyship decisively,
leaning yet a little further over the banisters.
Then she kisses her hand him and drops at his
feet the rose that has lain on her bosom all the even-
ing; and, with a last backward glance and smile,
flits away from him up the darkened staircase and
vanishes.
“I shall positively lose my heart to her if I don't
take care," thinks the young man ruefully, and very
foolishly, considering how long ago it is since that
misfortune has befallen him. But we are ever slow to
acknowledge our own defeats. His eyes are fixed
upon the flower at his feet.
“No, I do not want her flowers,” he says, with a
slight frown, pushing it away from him disdainfully.
“It was a mere chance my getting it. Any other fel-
low in my place at the moment would have been
quite as favoured-nay, beyond doubt more so. I
will not stoop for it.”
With his dignity thus forced to the front he walks
the entire length of the hall, his arms folded de-
terminately behind him, until he reaches a door at the
upper end.
Here he pauses and glances back almost guiltily.
Yes, it is still there, the poor, pretty yellow blossom
that has been so close to her, now sending forth its
neglected perfume to an ungrateful world.
It is cruel to leave it there alone all night, to be
trodden on, perhaps, in the morning by an unap-

“«Who hesitates is lost,'' quotes Stafford aloud,
with an angry laugh at his own folly; and, walking
deliberately back again, picks up the flower and presses
it to his lips.
“I thought that little speech applied only to us
poor women," says a soft voice above him, as, to his
everlasting chagrin, Cecil's mischievous, lovable face
peers down at him from the gallery overhead. “Have
another flower, Sir Penthony? You seem fond of
them.”
She throws a twin blossom to the one he holds
on to his shoulder as she speaks with very accurate
aim.
“It was yours,” stammers Sir Penthony, utterly
taken aback.
“So it was”—with an accent of affected surprise
-“which makes your behaviour all the more astonish-
ing. Well, do not stand there kissing it all night,
or you will catch cold, and then—what should I do?"
“What?”
“Die of grief, most probably." With a little mock-
ing laugh.
“Very probably. Yet you should pity me too, in
that I have fallen so low as to have nothing better
given me to kiss. I am wasting my sweetness on--"
"Is it sweetness?” asks she wickedly.
At this they both laugh-a low, soft laugh, born
of the hour and a fear of interruption, and perhaps a
dread of being so discovered that adds a certain zest
to their meeting. Then he says, still laughing, in an-
swer to her words, "Try.”

“No, thank you.” With a little moue. “Curiosity
is not my besetting sin, although I could not resist
seeing how you would treat my parting gift a moment
ago. Ah!”—with a little suppressed laugh of the very
fullest enjoyment—"you cannot think what an interest-
ing picture you made-almost tragic. First you stalked
away from my unoffending rose with all the dignity of
a thousand Spaniards; and then, when you had gone
sufficiently far to make your return effective, you re-
lented, and, seizing upon the flower as though it were
-let us say, for convenience sake—myself, devoured
it with kisses. I assure you it was better than a play.
Well," --with a sigh-"I won't detain you any longer.
I'm off to my slumbers.”
“Don't go yet, Cecil. Wait one moment. I-have
something to say to you.”
“No doubt. A short time since you said the same
thing. Were I to stay now you might, perhaps, finish
that scolding, instinct told me was hanging over me;
and—I hate being taken to task.”
“I will not. I swear I will never again attempt to
scold you about anything, experience having taught
me the futility of such a course. Cecil, stay."
“Lady Stafford, if you please, Sir Penthony." With
a tormenting smile.
“Lady Stafford, then-anything, if you will only
stay."
"I can't, then. Where should I be without my
beauty sleep? The bare idea fills me with horror.
Why, I should lose my empire. Sweet as parting is,
I protest I, for one, would not lengthen it until to-
morrow. Till then farewell. And—Sir Penthony--be

“By whom?"
“My slaves," returns this coquette of all coquettes,
with a last lingering glance and smile. After which
she finally disappears.
“There is no use disguising the fact any longer-
I have lost my heart," groans Sir Penthony in despair,
and straightway carries off both himself and his
cherished flowers to the shelter of his own room.

CHAPTER II.
I'll tell thee a part
Of the thoughts that start
To being when thou art nigh.
SHELLEY.
The next day is Sunday, and a very muggy, dis-
agreeable one it proves.
There is an indecision about
it truly irritating. A few drops of rain here and there,
a threatening of storm, but nothing positive. Finally,
at eleven o'clock, just as they have given up all hope
of seeing any improvement, it clears up in a degree
—against its will—and allows two or three depressed
and tearful sunbeams to straggle forth, rather with a
view to dishearten the world than to brighten it.
Sunday at Herst is much the same as any other
day. There are no rules, no restrictions. In the
library may be found volumes of sermons waiting for
those who may wish for them. The covers of those
sermons are as clean and fresh to-day as when they
were placed on their shelves, now many years ago,
showing how amiably they have waited.
play billiards if you like; you need not go to church
if you don't like. Yet somehow when at Herst people
always do go-perhaps because they needn't, or per-
haps because there is such a dearth of amusements.
Molly, who as yet has escaped all explanation
with Tedcastle, coming down stairs, dressed for
church, and looking unusually lovely, finds almost all

the others assembled before her in the hall, ready to
start.
Laying her prayer-books upon a table, while with
one hand she gathers up the tail of her long gown,
she turns to say a word or two to Lady Stafford.
At this moment both Luttrell and Shadwell move
towards the books. Shadwell, reaching them first, lays
his hand upon them.
“You will carry them for me?” says Molly, with a
bright smile, to him; and Luttrell, with a slight con-
traction of the brow, falls back again and takes his
place beside Lady Stafford:
As the church lies at the end of a pleasant path-
way through the woods they elect to walk it; and so
in twos and threes they make their way under the
still beautiful trees.
"It is cold, is it not?" Molly says to Mrs. Darley
once, when they come to an open part of the wood,
where they can travel in a body. “Wonderfully so
for September."
"Is it? I never mind the cold, or—or anything,"
rejoins Mrs. Darley, affectedly, talking for the benefit
of the devoted Mottie, who walks beside her “laden
with golden grain" in the shape of prayer-books and
hymnals of all sorts and sizes, “if I have anyone
with me that suits me; that is, a sympathetic person.”
“A lover you mean?” asks uncompromising Molly.
“Well, I don't know; I think that is about the time, of
all others, when I should object to feeling cold. One's
nose has such an unpleasant habit of getting beyond
one's control in the way of redness; and to feel that
one's cheeks are pinched and one's lips blue is mad-
dening. At such times I like my own society best."

how and
“And at other times too," says Philip, disagreeably;
“this morning, for instance.” He and Molly have
been having a passage of arms, and he has come off
second best.
"I won't contradict you,” says Molly calmly; "it
would be rude; and, considering how near we are to
church, unchristian.”
“A pity you cannot recollect your Christianity on
other occasions,” says he sneeringly.
“You speak with feeling. How have I failed to-
wards you in Christian charity?"
“Is it charitable, is it kind to scorn a fellow-
creature as you do, only because he loves you?”
Philip says in a low tone.
Miss Massereene is first honestly surprised, then
angry. That Philip has made love to her
again when opportunity occurred is a fact she does
not seek to deny, but it has been hitherto in the care-
less, half-earnest manner young men of the present
day affect when in the society of a pretty woman, and
has caused her no annoyance.
That he should now, without a word of warning
(beyond the slight sparring match during their walk,
and which is one of a series), break forth with so
much vehemence and apparent sense of injury, not
only alarms but displeases her; whilst some faint idea
of treachery on her own part towards her betrothed in
listening to such words fills her with distress.
There is a depth, an earnestness about Philip not
to be mistaken. His sombre face has paled, his eyes
do not meet hers, his thin nostrils are dilated, as
though breathing were a matter of difficulty-all prove
him genuinely disturbed.

To a man of his jealous, passionate nature to love
is a calamity. No return, however perfect, can quite
compensate him for all the pains and fears his passion
must afford. Already Philip's torture has begun, al-
ready the pangs of unrequited love have seized upon
him.
“I wish you would not speak to me like-as-in
such a tone," Molly says pettishly and uneasily. “Lat-
terly I hate going anywhere with you, you are so ill-
tempered; and now to-day-- Why cannot you be
pleasant and friendly, as you used to be when first I
came to Herst?”
“Ah, why indeed?" returns he bitterly.
At this inauspicious moment a small rough terrier
of Luttrell's rushes across their path almost under
their feet, bent on some mad chase after a mocking
squirrel; and Philip, maddened just then by doubts
and the coldness of her he loves, with the stick he
carries strikes him a quick and sudden blow; not
heavy, perhaps, but so unexpected as to draw from
the pretty brute a sharp cry of pain.
Hearing a sound of distress from his favourite,
Luttrell turns, and, seeing him shrinking away from
Molly's side, casts upon her a glance full of the live-
liest reproach, that reduces her very nearly to the
verge of tears.
To be so misunderstood, and all
through this tiresome Philip, it is too bad! As, under
the circumstances, she cannot well indulge her grief,
she does the next best thing, and gives way to
temper.
“Don't do that again," she says, with eyes that
flash a little through their forbidden tears.

MOLLY BAWN,
“Why?” Surprised in his turn at her vehemence.
“It isn't your dog; it's Luttrell's.”
“No matter whose dog it is; don't do it again. I
detest seeing a poor brute hurt, and for no cause, but
merely as a means to try and rid yourself of some of
your ill-temper."
“There is more ill-temper going than mine. I beg
your pardon, however.
I had no idea you were a
member of the Humane Society. You should study
the bearing-rein question, and vivisection, and that.”
With a sullen laugh.
“Nothing annoys me so much as wanton cruelty
to dumb animals."
“There are other—perhaps mistakenly termed-
superior animals on whom even you can inflict torture,”
he says, with a sneer. “All your tenderness must be
reserved for the lower creation. You talk of brutality:
what is there in all the earth so cruel as a woman?
A lover's pain is her joy."
"You are getting out of your depth-I cannot
follow you," says Molly coldly. “Why should you
and I discuss such a subject as lovers? What have
we in common with them? And it is a pity, Philip,
you should allow your anger to get so much the better
of you. When you look savage, as you do now, you
remind me of no one so much as grandpapa. And do
recollect what an odious old man he makes."
This finishes the conversation. He vouchsafes her
no reply. To be considered like Mr. Amherst, no
matter in how far off a degree, is a bitter insult. In
silence they continue their walk-in silence reach the
church and enter it.
It is a gloomy, antiquated building, primitive in

size, and form, and service. The rector is well-mean-
ing, but decidedly Low. The curate is unmeaning,
and abominably slow. The clerk does a great part of
the duty.
He is an old man, and regarded rather in the light
of an institution in this part of the county. Being
stone deaf, he puts in the responses anyhow, always
in the wrong place, and never finds out his mistake
until he sees the clergyman's lips set firm and on his
face a look of patient expectation, when he coughs
apologetically and says them all over again.
There is an “Amen” in the middle of every prayer,
and then one at the end. This gives him double
trouble, and makes him draw his salary with a clear
conscience. It also creates a lively time for the school-
children, who once at least on every Sunday give way
to a loud burst of merriment, and are only restored to
a sense of duty by a severe blow administered by the
sandy-haired teacher.
It is a good old-fashioned church too, where the
sides of the pews are so high that one can with diffi-
culty look over them, and where the affluent man can
have a real fire-place all to himself, with a real poker
and tongs and shovel to incite it to a blaze every now
and again.
Here, too, without rebuke the neighbours can seize
the opportunity of conversing with each other across
the pews, by standing on tiptoe, when occasion offers
during the service, as, for instance, when the poor-box
is going round. And it is a poor-box, and no mis-
take: flat, broad, and undeniable pewter, at which the
dainty bags of a city chapel would have blushed with
shame.

When the clergyman goes into the pulpit everyone
instantly blows his or her nose and cough their loudest
before the text is given out, under a mistaken im-
pression that they can get it all over at once, and not
have to do it at intervals farther on. This is a com-
pliment to the clergyman, expressing their intention of
hearing him undisturbed to the end, and, I suppose,
is received as such.
It is an attentive congregation-dangerously so, for
what man but blunders in his sermon now and then?
And who likes being twitted on weekdays for opinions
expressed on Sundays, more especially if he has not
altogether acted up to them? It is a suspicious con-
gregation too (though perhaps not singularly so, for I
have perceived others do the same), because whenever
their priest names a chapter and verse for any text
he may choose to insert in his discourse, instantly and
with avidity each and all turn over the leaves of their
Bibles, to see if it be really in the identical spot men-
tioned, or whether their pastor has been lying. This
action may not be altogether suspicion; it may be also
thought of as a safety-valve for their ennui, the rector
never letting them off until they have had sixty good
minutes of his valuable doctrine.
All the Herst party conduct themselves with due
discretion save Mr. Potts, who, being overcome by the
novelty of the situation and the length of the sermon,
falls fast asleep, and presently, at some denunciatory
passage, pronounced in a rather distinct tone by the
rector, rousing himself with a precipitate jerk, sends
all the fireirons with a fine clatter to the ground, he
having been most unhappily placed nearest the grate.
“The ruling passion strong in death,'” says Lut-

trell, with a despairing glance at the culprit; where-
upon Molly nearly laughs outright, while the school-
children do so quite.
Beyond this small contretemps, however, nothing of
note occurs; and, service being over, they all file de-
corously out of the church into the picturesque porch
outside, where they stand for a few minutes inter-
changing greetings with such of the county families as
come within their knowledge.
With a few others too who scarcely come within
that aristocratic pale, notably Mrs. Buscarlet. She is
a tremendously stout, distressingly healthy woman, quite
capable of putting her husband in a corner of her
capacious pocket, which, by-the-by, she insists on
wearing outside her gown, in a fashion beloved of
our great-grandmothers, and which, in a modified form,
last year was much affected by our own generation.
This alarming personage greets Marcia with the
utmost bonhomie, being apparently blind to the cold-
ness of her reception. She greets Lady Stafford also,
who is likewise at freezing-point, and then gets intro-
duced to Molly. Mrs. Darley, who even to the un-
initiated Mrs. Buscarlet appears a person unworthy of
notice, she lets go free, for which favour Mrs. Darley
is devoutly grateful.
Little Buscarlet himself, who has a weakness for
birth, in that he lacks it, comes rambling up to them
at this juncture, and tells them, with many a smirk, he
hopes to have the pleasure of lunching with them at
Herst, Mr. Amherst having sent him a special invita-
tion, as he has something particular to say to him.
Whereupon Molly, who is nearest to him, laughs, and

tells him she had no idea such luck was in store for
her.
“You are the greatest hypocrite I ever met in my
life," Sir Penthony says in her ear, when Buscarlet,
smiling, bowing, radiant, has moved on.
“I am not indeed; you altogether mistake me,”
Molly answers. “If you only knew how his anxiety to
please, and Marcia's determination not to be pleased,
amuses me, you would understand how thoroughly I
enjoy his visits.”
“I ask your pardon. I had no idea we had a
student of human nature amongst us. Don't study me,
Miss Massereene, or it will unfit you for further exer-
tions—I am a living mass of errors.”
“Alas that I cannot contradict you!” says Cecil,
with a woful sigh, who is standing near them.
Mr. Amherst, who never by any chance darkens
the doors of a church, receives them in the drawing-
room on their return. He is in an amiable mood and
pleased to be gracious. Seizing upon Mr. Buscarlet,
he carries him off with him to his private den, so that
for the time being there is an end of them.
“For all small mercies," begins Mr. Potts solemnly,
when the door has closed on them; but he is inter-
rupted by Lady Stafford.
“Small' indeed," grumbles she.
“What do you
mean? I shan't be able to eat my lunch if that odious
little man remains, with his 'Yes, Lady Stafford;' 'No,
Lady Stafford;' 'I quite agree with your ladyship, and
Oh that I could drop my title!” This with a
glance at Sir Penthony; "at all events while he is pre-
sent." This with another and more gracious glance
at Stafford. “Positively I feel my appetite going al-

ready, and that is a pity, as it was an uncommonly
good one."
“Cheer up, dear,” says Molly; "and remember
there will be dinner later on. Poor Mr. Buscarlet!
There must be something wrong with me, because I
cannot bring myself to think so disparagingly of him
as you all do."
“I am sorry for you. Not to know Mr. Buscarlet's
little peculiarities of behaviour argues yourself un-
known," Marcia says, with a good deal of intention.
“And I presume they cannot have struck you, or you
would scarcely be so tolerant."
"He certainly sneezes very incessantly and very
objectionably," Molly says thoughtfully. “I hate a
man who sneezes publicly. And his sneeze is so un-
pleasant—so exactly like that of a cat. A little wriggle
of the entire body, and then a little soft-splash!”
“My dear Molly!” expostulates Lady Stafford.
“But is it not?” protests she.
“Is it not an ac-
curate description?”
"Yes, its accuracy is its fault-I almost thought
the man was in the room."
“And then there is Mrs. Buscarlet: I never saw
anyone like Mrs. Buscarlet,” Maud Darley says plain-
tively; "did you? There is so much of her, and it is
all so nasty. And, oh! her voice, it is like wind
whistling through a keyhole."
"Poor woman," says Luttrell regretfully, “I think I
could have forgiven her, had she not worn that very
verdant gown.”
“My dear fellow, I thought the contrast between it
and her cheeks the most perfect thing I ever saw. It

is evident you have not got the eye of an artist,” Sir
Penthony says rather unfeelingly.
“I never saw anyone so distressingly healthy,” says
Maud, still plaintively. “Fat people are my aversion.
I don't mind a comfortable-looking body, but she is
much too stout.”
“Let us alter that last remark and say she has had
too much stout, and perhaps we shall define her,” re-
marks Tedcastle. “I hate a woman who shows her
food."
“The way she traduced those Sedleys rather amused
me," Molly says, laughing. "I certainly thought her
opinion of her neighbours very pronounced.”
“She shouldn't have any opinion,” says Lady Stafford
with decision. “You, my dear Molly, take an entirely
wrong view of it.
Such people as the Buscarlets,
sprung from nobody knows where or cares to know,
should be kept in their proper place, and be sat upon
the very instant they develop a desire to progress.”
“How can you be so illiberal?” exclaims Molly,
aghast at so much misplaced vehemence. “Why should
they not rise with the rest of the world?”
"Eleanor has quite a penchant for the Buscarlets,"
says Marcia, with a sneer; "she has quite adopted
them, and either will not, or perhaps does not, see
their enormities."
Nobody cares to notice this impertinence, and Mr.
Potts says gravely:
“Lady Stafford has never forgiven Mrs. Buscarlet
because once, at a ball here, she told her she was
looking very 'distangy. Is that not true?”
Cecil laughs.
“Why should not everyone have an opinion.”


## p. 35 (#41) ##############################################

MOLLY BAWN.
35
Molly persists. “I agree with the old song that ‘Bri-
tons never shall be slaves;' therefore why should they
not assert themselves? In a hundred years hence they
will have all the manners and airs of we others.”
“Then they should be locked up during the inter-
mediate stage," says Cecil, with an uncompromising
nod of her blonde head. “I call them insufferable;
and if Mr. Buscarlet when he comes in again makes
himself agreeable to me-me!—I shall insult him
that's all! No use arguing with me, Molly—I shall in-
deed.” She softens this awful threat by a merry, sweet-
tempered little laugh,
“Let us forget the little lawyer and talk of some-
thing we all enjoy-to-day's sermon, for instance. You
admired it, Potts, didn't you? I never saw anyone so
attentive in my life," says Sir Penthony.
Potts tries to look as if he had never succumbed
during service to "Nature's sweet restorer;" and Molly
says apologetically:
“How could he help it? The sermon was
long."
“Yes, wasn't it?” agrees Plantagenet, eagerly. “The
longest I ever heard. That man deserves to be sup-
pressed or excommunicated; and the parishioners ought
to send him a round robin to that effect. Odd, too,
how much at sea one feels with a strange prayer-book.
One looks for one's prayer at the top of the page,
where it always used to be in one's own particular edi-
tion, and, lo! one finds it at the bottom. Whatever
you may do for the future, Lady Stafford, don't lend
me your prayer-book. But for the incessant trouble it
caused me, between losing my place and finding it

never
again, I don't believe I should have dropped into that
gentle doze."
“Had you ever a prayer-book of your own?" asks
Cecil unkindly. “Because if so it is a pity you don't
air it now and again. I have known you a great many
years—more than I care to count and never,
have I seen you with the vestige of one. I shall send
you a pocket edition as a Christmas-box.”
“Thanks awfully. I shall value it for the giver's
sake. And I promise you that when next we meet--
such care shall it receive—that even you will be un-
able to discover a scratch on it.”
“Plantagenet, you are a bad boy," says Cecil.
“I thought the choir rather good,” Molly is saying;
“but why must a man read the service in a long, slow,
tearful tone? Surely there is no good to be gained by
it; and to find oneself at ‘Amen' when he is only in
the middle of the prayer has something intolerably
irritating about it. I could have shaken that curate."
“Why didn't you?” says Sir Penthony. “I would
have backed you up with the greatest pleasure. The
person I liked best was the old gentleman with the
lint-white locks who said “Yamen' so persistently in
the wrong place all through; I grew quite interested at
last, and knew the exact spot where it was likely to
come in. I must say I admire consistency."
“How hard it is to keep one's attention fixed,"
Molly says, meditatively, "and to preserve a properly
dismal expression of countenance! To look solemn al-
ways means to look severe, as far as I can judge. And
did you ever notice when a rather lively and secular
set of bars occur in the voluntary, how people cheer
up and rouse themselves, and give way to a little sigh

37
or two? I hope it isn't a sigh of relief. We feel it's
wicked, but we always do it."
“Still studying poor human nature," exclaims Sir
Penthony. “Miss Massereene, I begin to think you a
terrible person, and to tremble when I meet your
gaze."
“Well, at all events no one can accuse them of
being High Church," says Mrs. Darley, alluding to her
pastors and masters for the time being. “The service
was wretchedly conducted; hardly any music, and not
a flower to speak of.”
“My dear! High Church! How could you expect
it? Only fancy that curate intoning!” says Cecil, with
a laugh.
"I couldn't," declares Sir Penthony; "so much
exertion would kill me.”
"That's why he isn't High Church," says Mr. Potts
of the curate, speaking with a rather sweeping air of
criticism. “He ain't musical; he can't intone. Take
my word for it half the clergy are Anglicans merely
because they think they have voices, and feel what a
loss the world will sustain if it don't hear them.”
“Oh, what a malicious remark!” says Molly, much
disgusted.
Here the scene is further enlivened by the reap-
pearance of Mr. Amherst and the lawyer, which effec-
tually ends the conversation and turns their thoughts
towards the dining-room.

CHAPTER III.
Trifles light as air. -Othello.
WHEN luncheon is over Sir Penthony Stafford retires
to write a letter or two; and half an hour afterwards.
returning to the drawing-room, finds himself in the
presence of Mr. Buscarlet, unsupported.
The little lawyer smiles benignly; Sir Penthony
responds, and, throwing himself into a lounging-chair,
makes up his mind to be agreeable.
“Well, Mr. Buscarlet, and what did you think of
the sermon?” he says briskly, being rather at a loss
for a congenial topic. “Tedious, eh? I saw you talk-
ing to Lady Elizabeth after service was over. She is
a fine woman, all things considered.”
“She is indeed--remarkably so: a very fine pre-
sence for her time of life.”
“Well, there certainly is not much to choose be-
tween her and the hills in point of age," allows Sir
Penthony absently—he is inwardly wondering where
Cecil can have gone to—"still, she is a nice old lady."
“Quite so-quite so—very elegant in manner, and
in appearance decidedly high-bred.”
“Hybrid !” exclaims Sir Penthony, purposely mis-
understanding the word. “Oh! by Jove, I didn't think
you so severe. You allude, of course, to her ladyship’s
mother, who, if report speaks truly, was a good cook
spoiled by matrimony. 'Hybrid! Give you my word,
Buscarlet, I didn't believe you capable of anything half

so clever. I must remember to tell it at dinner to the
others. It is just the sort of thing to delight Mr.
Amherst."
Now, this old lawyer has a passion for the aristo-
cracy. To be noticed by a lord—to press "her lady-
ship’s” hand-to hold sweet converse with the smallest
scion of a noble house, is as honey to his lips; there-
fore to be thought guilty of an impertinence to one of
this sacred community, to have uttered a word that, if
repeated, would effectually close to him the doors of
Lady Elizabeth's house, fills him with horror.
“My dear Sir Penthony, pardon me," he says
hastily, divided between the fear of offending the
baronet and a desire to set himself straight in his own
eyes, "you quite mistake me. 'Hybrid'--such a word,
such a thought never occurred to me in connection
with Lady Elizabeth Eyre, whom I hold in much re-
verence. Highly bred I meant. I assure you you alto-
gether misunderstand. I-1-never made a joke in
my life.”
“Then let me congratulate you on your maiden
effort—you have every reason to be proud of it,” laughs
Sir Penthony, who is highly delighted at the success
of his own manoeuvre. “Don't be modest. You have
made a decided hit; it is as good a thing as ever I
heard. But how about Lady Elizabeth, eh? should she
hear it? Really you will have to suppress your wit, or
it will lead you into trouble.”
“But-but-if

testations, he relates to the new-comers his version of
the lawyer's harmless remark, accompanying the story
with an expressive glance—that closely resembles a
wink—at Lady Stafford. “I must go,” he says when
he has finished, moving towards the door, “though I
hardly think I do wisely, leaving you alone with so
dangerous a companion.”
“I assure you, my dear Lady Stafford,” declares
Mr. Buscarlet, with tears in his eyes and dew on his
brow, “it is all a horrible, an unaccountable mistake-
a mere connection of ideas by your husband—no more,
no more, I give you my most sacred honour."
“Oh, sly Mr. Buscarlet!” cries her ladyship lightly,
"cruel Mr. Buscarlet! Who would have thought it of
you? And we all imagined you such an ally of poor
dear Lady Elizabeth. To make a joke about her
parentage, and such a good one too! And Sir Penthony
found you out? Clever Sir Penthony."
"I swear, my dear lady, I-4
“Ah, ha! wait till she hears of it. How she will
enjoy it! With all her faults she is good-tempered. It
will amuse her. Molly, my dear, is not Mr. Buscarlet
terribly severe?”
“Naughty Mr. Buscarlet!” says Molly, shaking a
reproachful dainty-white finger at him. “And I believed
you so harmless!"
At this they both laugh so immoderately that pre-
sently the lawyer loses all patience, and, taking up his
hat, rushes from the room in a greater rage than he
could have thought possible, considering one of his
provocators bears a title.
They are still laughing when the others enter the
room and insist on learning the secret of their mirth.

Tedcastle alone fails to enjoy it. He is distrait and
evidently oppressed with care. Seeing this, Molly takes
heart of grace, and, crossing to his side, says sweetly:
“Do you see how the day has cleared? That lovely
sun is tempting me to go out. Will you take me for
a walk?"
“Certainly-
1-if
you want to go.” Very coldly.
“But of course I do; and nobody has asked me to
accompany them; so I am perforce obliged to thrust
myself on you. If”—with å bewitching smile—"you
won't mind the trouble just this once, I will promise
not to torment you again.”
Through the gardens, and out into the shrubberies
beyond, they go in silence, until they reach the open;
then Molly says, laughing: “I know you are going to
scold me about Mr. Potts. Begin at once and let us
get it over."
Her manner is so sweet, and she looks so gay, so
fresh, so harmless, that his anger melts as dew beneath
the sun.
“You need not have let him place his arm round
you," he says jealously.
"If I hadn't I should have slipped off the pedestal;
and what did his arm signify in comparison with that?
Think of my grandfather's face; think of mine; think
of all the horrible consequences. I should have been
sent home in disgrace, perhaps-who knows?-put in
prison, and you might ‘never, never, never see your
darling any more.'
She laughs.
“What a jealous fellow you are, Ted!”
“Am I?” Ruefully. “I don't think I used to be.
I never remember being jealous before."

“No? I am glad to hear it.”
“Why?"
“Because”—with an adorable glance and a faint
pressure of his arm -"it proves to me you have never
loved before.”
This tender insinuation blots out all remaining
vapours, leaving the atmosphere clear and free of clouds
for the rest of their walk, which lasts till almost even-
ing. Just before they reach the house Luttrell says,
with hesitation:
“I have something to say to you; but I am afraid
if I do say it you will be angry."
“Then don't say it,” says Miss Massereene, equably.
“That is about the most foolish thing one can do. To
make a person angry unintentionally is bad enough,
but to know you are going to do it, and to say so, has
something about it rash, not to say impertinent. If
you are fortunate enough to know the point in the
conversation that is sure to rouse me to wrath why not
carefully skirt round it?"
“Because I lose a chance if I leave it unsaid; and
-you differ so widely from most girls—it may not
provoke you."
“Now you compel me to it,” says Molly, laughing.
“What! do you think I could suffer myself to be con-
sidered a thing apart? Impossible. No one likes to
be thought odd or eccentric except rich old men, and
Bohemians, and poets; therefore I insist on following
closely in my sisters' footsteps and warn you I shall
be in a furious passion the moment you speak, whether
or not, I am really annoyed. Now go on if you
dare!”

“Well, look here,” begins Luttrell, in a conciliating
tone,
“There is not the slightest use in your beating
about the bush, Teddy,” says Miss Massereene calmly.
"I am going to be angry, so do not waste time in
diplomacy."
“Molly, how provoking you are!"
“No! Am I? Because I wish to be like other
women?"
"A hopeless wish, and a very unwise one."
“ Hopeless?' And why, pray?” With a little uplift-
ing of the straight brows and a little gleam from under
the long curled lashes.
"Because," says her lover with fond conviction,
"you are so infinitely superior to them, that they would
have to be born all over again before you could bring
yourself to fall into their ways.”
“What! every woman in the known world?”
"Every one of them, I am eternally convinced.”
“Teddy,” says Molly, rubbing her cheek in her old
caressing fashion against his sleeve, and slipping her
fingers into his, "you may go on. Say anything you
like-call me any name you choose—and I promise
not to be one bit angry. There!”
When Luttrell has allowed himself time to let his
own strong brown fingers close upon hers, and has
solaced himself still further by pressing his lips to
them, he takes courage and goes on, with a slightly
accelerated colour:
“Well, you see, Molly, you have made the subject
a forbidden one, and-er-it is about our engagement
I want to speak. Now, remember your promise,
darling, and don't be vexed with me if I ask you to

shorten it. Many people marry and are quite come
fortable on five hundred pounds a year—why should
not we? I know a lot of fellows who are doing un-
commonly well on less."
“Poor fellows!” says Molly, full of sympathy.
“I know I am asking you a great deal”-rather
nervously—“but won't you think of it, Molly?"
"I am afraid I won't just yet," replies that lady,
suavely. "Be sensible, Teddy-remember all we said
to John--and think how foolish we should look going
back of it all. Why should things not go on safely
and secretly, as at present, and let us put marriage
out of our heads until something turns up? I am like
Mr. Micawber, I have an almost religious belief in the
power things have of turning up."
“I haven't," says Luttrell, with terse melancholy.
“So much the worse for you. And besides, Teddy,
instinct tells me you are much nicer as a lover than
you will be as a husband. Once you attain to that
position, I doubt I shall be able to order you about as
I do at present."
“Try me.”
“Not for awhile. There, don't look so dismal, Ted;
are we not perfectly happy as we are?”
“You may be, perhaps.”
“Don't say 'perhaps;" you may be certain of it,"
says she gaily. “I haven't a doubt on the subject.
Come, do look cheerful again. Men as fair as you
should cultivate a perpetual smile."
"I wish I was a nigger," says Luttrell impatiently.
“You have such an admiration for blackamoors, that
then, perhaps, you might learn to care for me a degree

more than you do just now. Shadwell is dark enough
for you.”
"Yes; isn't he handsome?” With much inno-
cent enthusiasm. "I thought last night at dinner,
when-4"
“I don't in the least want to know what you thought
last night of Shadwell's personal appearance," Luttrell
interrupts her angrily.
“And I don't in the least want you to hold my
hand a moment longer," replies Miss Massereene with
saucy retaliation, drawing her fingers from his with a
sudden movement, and running away from him up the
stone steps of the balcony into the house.
All through the night, both when waking and in
dreams, the remembrance of the slight cast upon her
absent mother by Mr. Amherst, and her own silent ac-
ceptance of it, has disturbed the mind of Marcia. “A
dancer!” The word enrages her.
Molly's little passionate movement and outspoken
determination to hear no ill spoken of her dead father
showed Marcia even more forcibly her own cowardice
and mean policy of action. And be sure she likes
Molly none the more in that she was the one to show
it. Yet Molly cannot possibly entertain the same
affection for a mere memory that she feels for the
mother on whom she has expended all the really pure
and true love of which she is capable.
It is not, therefore, towards her grandfather, whose
evil tongue has ever been his own undoing, she cher-
rishes the greatest bitterness, but towards herself, to-
gether with a certain scorn that, through moneyed

motives, she has tutored herself to sit by and hear the
one she loves lightly mentioned.
Now, looking back upon it, it appears to her gross-
est treachery to the mother whose every thought she
knows is hers, and who, in her foreign home, lives
waiting, hoping, for the word that shall restore her to
her arms.
A kind of anxiety to communicate with the injured
one, and to pour out on paper the love she bears her,
but dares not breathe at Herst, fills Marcia. So that
when the house is silent on this Sunday afternoon-
when all the others have wandered into the open air
-she makes her way to the library, and, sitting down,
commences one of the lengthy, secret, forbidden mis-
sives that always find their way to Italy in spite of
prying eyes and all the untold evils that so surely wait
upon discovery
To anyone acquainted with Marcia her manner of
commencing her letter would be a revelation. To one
so cold, so self-contained the weaker symptoms of
affection are disallowed; yet this is how she begins:-
“My own Beloved,-As yet I have no good news
to send you, and little that I can say—though ever as
I write to you my heart is full.
The old man grows
daily more wearisome, more detestable, more inhuman,
yet shows no sign of death. He is even, as it seems
to me, stronger and more full of life than when last
I wrote to you, now three weeks ago. At times I feel
dispirited, almost despairing, and wonder if the day
will ever come when we two shall be reunited--when
I shall be able to welcome you to my English home,
where, in spite of prejudices, you will be happy, be.
cause you will be with me.”

Here, unluckily, because of the trembling of her
fingers, a large spot of ink falls heavily from her pen
upon the half-written page beneath, destroying it.
With an exclamation expressive of impatience
Marcia pushes the sheet to one side and hastily com-
mences again upon another. This time she is more
successful, and has reached almost the last word in
her final tender message, when a footstep approaching
disturbs her. Gathering up her papers, she quits the
library by its second door, and, gaining her own room,
finishes and seals her packet.
Not until then does she perceive that the blotted
sheet is no longer in her possession that by some
untoward accident she must have forgotten it behind
her in her flight!
Consternation seizes her. Whose were the foot-
steps that broke in upon her quietude? Why had she
not stood her ground? With a beating heart she runs
downstairs, enters the library once more with cautious
steps, only to find it empty. But, search as she may,
the missing paper is not to be found.
What if it has fallen into her grandfather's keep-
ing! A cold horror falls upon her. After all these
weary years of hated servitude to be undone! It is
impossible even fickle fortune should play her such a
deadly trick!
Yet the horror continues until she finds herself
again face to face with her grandfather. He is more
than usually gracious-indeed, almost marked in his
attentions to her—and once more Marcia breathes
freely. No; probably the paper was destroyed; even
she herself in a fit abstraction may have torn it up
before leaving the library.

MOLLY BAWN,
The evening, being Sunday, proves even duller than
usual. Mr. Amherst, with an amount of consideration
not to be expected, retires to rest early. The others
fall insensibly into the silent, dozy state. Mr. Darley
gives way to a gentle snore. It is the gentlest thing
imaginable, but effectual. Tedcastle starts to his feet
and gives the fire a vigorous poke. He also trips
very successfully over the footstool that goes far to
make poor Darley's slumbers blest, and brings that
gentleman into a sitting posture.
“This will never do,” Luttrell says, when he has
apologised profusely to his awakened friend. “We are
all growing sleepy. Potts, exert your energies and tell
us a story."
“Yes, do, Plantagenet,” says Lady Stafford, rousing
herself resolutely, and shutting up her fan with a lively
snap.
"I will,” says Potts obligingly, without a moment's
hesitation.
"Potts is always equal to the occasion,” Sir Pen-
thony remarks admiringly. “As a penny showman he
would have been invaluable and died worth any money.
Such energy, such unflagging zeal is rare. That pretty
gunpowder plot he showed his friends the other night
would fetch a large audience.”
“Don't ask me to be the audience a second time,”
Lady Stafford says unkindly. “To be blown to bits
once in a lifetime is, I consider, quite sufficient.”
“«Well, if ever I do a ky-ind action again,” says
Mr. Potts—who is brimful of odd quotations, chiefly
derived from low comedies—posing after Toole. “It is
the most mistaken thing in the world to do anything

for anybody. You never know where it will end. I
once knew a fellow who saved another fellow from
drowning, and hanged if the other fellow didn't cling
on to him ever after and make him support him for
life.”
“I'm sure that's an edifying tale," says Sir Penthony,
with a deep show of interest. “But-stop one moment,
Potts. I confess I can't get any further for a minute
or two. How many fellows were there? There was
your fellow and the other fellow—and the other
fellow's fellow-was that three fellows or four? I can't
make it out. I apologise all round for my stupidity,
but would you say it all over again, Potts, and very
slowly this time, please, to see if I can grasp it?”
“Give you my honour I thought it was
nundrum," says Henry Darley.
Plantagenet laughs as heartily as anyone, and evi-
dently thinks it a capital joke.
“You remind me of no one so much as Sothern,"
goes on Sir Penthony, warming to his theme. "If you
went on the stage you would make your fortune. But
don't dream of acting, you know; go in for being your-
self, pure and simple-plain, unvarnished Plantagenet
Potts—and I venture to say you will take London by
storm. The British public would go down before you
like corn before the reaper.”
“Well, but your story-your story, Plantagenet,”
Lady Stafford cries impatiently.
“Did you ever hear the story about my mother

"Potts," interrupts Stafford mildly but firmly, “if
you are going to tell the story about your mother and
the auctioneer I shall leave the room. It will be the

twenty-fifth time I have heard it already, and human
patience has a limit. One must draw the line some-
where."
“What auctioneer?" demands Potts, indignant. "I
am going to tell them about my mother and the auc-
tion-I never said a word about an auctioneer--there
mightn't have been one for all I know.”
“There generally is at an auction,” ventures Lut-
trell mildly. “Go on, Potts; I like your stories im-
mensely, they are so full of wit and spirit. I know
this one, about your mother's bonnet, well; it is an
old favourite-quite an heirloom—the story, I mean,
not the bonnet. I remember so distinctly the first
time you told it to us at mess; how we did laugh to
be sure! Don't forget any of the details. The last
time but four you made the bonnet pink, and it must
have been so awfully unbecoming to your mother!
Make it blue to-night.”
“Now do go on, Mr. Potts; I am dying to hear all
about it," declares Molly.
“Well, when my uncle died,” begins Potts, “all his
furniture was sold by auction. And there was a mirror
in the drawing-room my mother had always had a
tremendous fancy for-
“And my mother was always in the habit of
wearing a black bonnet,'” quotes Sir Penthony gravely.
"I know it by heart.”
“If you do you may as well tell it yourself,” says
Potts, much offended.
“Never mind him, Plantagenet, do go on," ex-
claims Cecil impatiently.
“Well, she was in the habit of wearing a black
bonnet, as it happens," says Mr. Potts, with suppressed

ire; "but just before the auction she bought a new
one, and it was pink.”
“Oh, why on earth don't you say blue?" expostu-
lates Luttrell, with a groan.
“Because it was pink. I suppose I know my
mother's bonnets better than you?”
"But, my dear fellow, think of her complexion!
And at first, I assure you, you always used to make it
blue."
"I differ with you," puts in Sir Penthony politely.
“I always understood it was a sea-green.”.
“It was pink," reiterates Plantagenet firmly. “Well,
we had a cook who was very fond of my
mother-
"I thought it was a footman. And it really was
a footman you know,” says Luttrell reproachfully.
“The butler, you mean, Luttrell,” exclaims Sir
Penthony, with exaggerated astonishment at his friend's
want of memory.
“And she, having most unluckily heard my mother
say she feared she could not attend the auction, made
up her mind to go herself and at all hazards secure
the coveted mirror for her-4"
“And she didn't know my mother had on the
new sea-green bonnet,'” Sir Penthony breaks in with
growing excitement.
“No, she didn't,” says Mr. Potts, growing excited
too. “So she started for my uncle's——the cook, I mean
and as soon as the mirror was put up began bidding
away for it like a steam-engine. And presently some
one in a pink bonnet began bidding too, and there
they were bidding away against each other, the cook
not knowing the bonnet, and my mother not being
able to see the cook, she was so hemmed in by the

crowd, until presently it was knocked down to my
mother—who is a sort of person who would die rather
than give in—and, would you believe it?” winds up
Mr. Potts, nearly choking with delight over the mis-
fortunes of his maternal relative, “she had given
exactly five pounds more for that mirror than she need
have done!”
They all laugh, Sir Penthony and Luttrell with a
very suspicious mirth.
“Poor Mrs. Potts!” says Molly.
“Oh, she didn't mind. When she had relieved
herself by blowing up the cook she laughed more than
any of us. But it was a long time before the 'governor'
could be brought to see the joke. You know he paid
for it," says Plantagenet naïvely.
“Moral: never buy a new bonnet,” says Sir Pen-
thony.
"Or keep an affectionate cook," says Luttrell."
“Or go to an auction,” says Philip. “It is a very
instructive tale—it is all moral.”
“The reason I so much admire it. I know no
one such an adept at pointing a moral and adorning
a tale as our Plantagenet.”
Mr. Potts smiles superior.
“I think the adornment rested with you and Lut-
trell," he says, with cutting sarcasm, answering Sir
Penthony.
“Potts, you aren't half a one. Tell us another.
Your splendid resources can't be yet exhausted,” says
Philip.
“Yes, do, Potts, and wake me when you come to
the point," seconds Sir Penthony warmly, sinking into

an armchair and gracefully disposing an antimacassar
over his head.
“A capital idea,” murmurs Luttrell. “It will give
us all a hint when we are expected to laugh."
“Oh, you can chaff as you like,” exclaims Mr.
Potts, much aggrieved; "but I wonder, if I went to
sleep in an armchair, which of you would carry on the
conversation?"
“Not one of them," declares Cecil, with conviction;
"we should all die of mere inanition were it not for
you."
"I really think they're all jealous of me," goes on
Plantagenet, greatly fortified. “I consider myself by
far the most interesting of them all, and the most-

“Say it, Potts; don't be shy," says Sir Penthony,
raising a corner of the antimacassar, so as to give
his friend the full encouragement of one whole eye.
" Fascinating,' I feel sure, will be the right word in
the right place here."
“It would indeed. I know nobody so really enter-
taining as Plantagenet," says Cecil, warmly.
“Your ladyship's judgment is always sound. I sub-
mit to it,” returns Sir Penthony, rising to make her a
profound bow.

CHAPTER IV.
“Why come you drest like a village maid
That are the flower of the earth ?”
“If I come drest like a village maid
I am but as my fortunes are."
LADY CLARE.
It is close on October. Already the grass has as-
sumed its sober garb of brown; a general earthiness is
everywhere. The leaves are falling---not now in care-
ful couples or one by one, but in whole showers-
slowly, sorrowfully, as though loath to quit the sighing
branches, their last faint rustling making their death-
song.
Molly's visit has drawn to an end. Her joyous
month is over. To-day a letter from her brother re-
minding her of her promise to return is within her hand;
recalling all the tender sweets of home life, all the calm
pleasure she will gain, yet bringing with it a little
sting, as she remembers all the gay and laughing hours
that she must lose. For indeed her time at Herst has
proved a good time.
“I have had a letter from my brother, grandpapa;
he thinks it is time I should return,” she says, accost-
ing the old man as he takes his solitary walk up and
down one of the shaded paths.
“Do you find it so dull here?” asks he sharply,
turning to read her face.
“Dull? No indeed. How should I? I shall always
remember my visit to you as one of the happy events
of my life.”

“Then remain a little longer," he growls un-
graciously. “The others have consented to prolong
their stay, why should not you? Write to your-to
Mr. Massereene to that effect. I cannot breathe in an
empty house. It is my wish, my desire that you
shall
stay," he finishes irritably, this being one of his painful
days.
So it is settled. She will obey this crabbed
veteran's behest and enjoy a little more of the good
the gods have provided for her before returning to her
quiet home.
“You will not desert us in our increased calamities,
Molly, will you?” asks Cecil, half an hour later, as
Molly enters the common boudoir, where Lady Stafford
and Marcia sit alone, the men being absent with their
guns, and Mrs. Darley consequently in the blues.
“Where have you been? We quite fancied you had
taken a lesson out of poor dear Maudie's book and re-
tired to your couch. Do you stay on at Herst?” She
glances up anxiously from her painting as she speaks.
“Yes. Grandpapa has asked me to put off my
departure for awhile. So I shall. I have just written
to John to say so, and to ask him if I may accept this
second invitation."
"Do you think it likely he will refuse?" Marcia
asks unpleasantly.
“He may. But when I represent to him how ter-
ribly his obduracy will distress you all, should he in-
sist on my return, I feel sure he will relent,” retorts
Molly nonchalantly.
“Now that Mr. Amherst has induced us all to stay,
don't you think he might do something to vary the
entertainment?” says Cecil in a faintly injured tone.

“Shooting is all very well, of course, for those who like
it; and so is tennis; and so are early hours; but tou-
jours perdrix. I confess I hate my bed until the
small hours are upon me. Now, if he would only
give a ball, for instance! Do you think he would,
Marcia, if he was asked?"
“How can I say?"
“Would you ask him, dear?”
“Well, I don't think I would,” replies Marcia, with
a rather frugal laugh; “for this reason, that it would
not be of the slightest use. I might as well ask him
for the moon. If there is one thing he distinctly ab-
hors it is a ball.”
“But he might go to bed early, if he wished,” per-
sists Cecil; “none of us would interfere or find fault
with that arrangement. We would try and spare him,
dear old thing. I don't see why our enjoyment should
put him out in the least, if he would only be reason-
able. I declare I have a great mind to ask him my-
self.”
"Do,” says Molly eagerly, who is struck with ad-
miration at the entire idea, having never yet been to
a really large ball.
“I would rather somebody else tried it first,” con-
fesses Cecil, with a frank laugh. "A hundred times
I ave ade up my mind to ask a favour of him, but
when I found myself face to face with him, and he
fixed me with his eagle eye, I quailed. Molly, you
are a new importation: try your luck.”
“Well, I don't mind if I do," says Molly valiantly.
“He can't say worse than 'No.' And here he is, com-
ing slowly along under the balcony. Shall I seize the
present opportunity and storm the citadel out of hand?

I am sure if I wait I shall be like Bob Acres, and find
my courage oozing out through my fingers.”
“Then don't,” says Cecil. "If he molests you
badly I promise to interfere."
Molly steps on to the balcony, and, looking down,
awaits the slow and languid approach of her grand-
father. Just as he arrives beneath her she bends over
until he, attracted by her presence, looks up.
She is laughing down upon him, bent on conquest,
and has a blood-red rose in one hand. She waves it
slightly to and fro, as though uncertain, as though
dallying about giving utterance to some thought that
pines for freedom.
The old man, pausing, looks up at her, and, look-
ing, sighs-perhaps for his dead youth, perhaps be-
cause she so well resembles her mother, disowned and
forgotten.
"Have a rose, grandpapa?” says Molly, stooping
still further over the iron railings, her voice sweet and
fresh as the dead and gone Eleanor's. As she speaks
she drops the flower, and he dexterously, by some
fortuitous chance, catches it.
“Well done!" cries she, with a gay laugh, clapping
her hands, feeling half-surprised, wholly amused at his
nimbleness. “Yet stay, grandpapa, do not go so soon.
I-have a favour to ask of you.”
“Well?"
“We have been discussing something delightful for
the past five minutes—something downright delicious;
but we can do nothing without you. Will you help us,
grandpapa-will you?”
She asks all this with the prettiest grace, gazing
down undaunted into the sour old face raised to hers.

“Why are you spokeswoman?" demands he, in a
tone that makes the deeply attentive Cecil within groan
aloud.
“Well --because-I really don't believe I know
why, except that I chose to be so. But grant me this,
my first request. Ah! do, now, grandpapa.”
The sweet coaxing of the Irish “Ah!” penetrates
even his withered old heart.
“What is this wonderful thing you would have me
do?” asks he, some of the accumulated verjuice of
years disappearing from his face; while Lady Stafford,
from behind the curtain, looks on, trembling with fear
for the success of her scheme, and Marcia listens and
watches with envious rage.
“We want you to-give a ball,” says Molly, boldly,
with a little gasp, keeping her large eyes fix
eager anxiety upon his face, while her pretty parted
lips seem still to entreat. “Say "Yes' to me, grand-
in
papa."
How to refuse so tender a pleading? How bring
the blank that a “No” must cause upon her riante,
lovely face?
“Suppose I say I cannot?” asks he; but his tone
has altered wonderfully, and there is an expression
that is almost amiable upon his face. The utter ab-
sence of constraint, of fear, she displays in his pre-
sence has charmed him, being so unlike the studied
manner of all those with whom he comes in contact.
“Then I shall cry my eyes out,” says Molly, still
lightly, though secretly her heart is sinking.
There is a perceptible pause. Then Mr. Amherst
'says slowly, regretfully:
“Crying will come too soon, child. None escape.

Keep your eyes dry as long as your heart will let you.
No, you shall not fret because of me. You shall
have your ball, I promise you, and as soon as ever
you please.”
So saying, and with a quick movement of the
hand that declines all thanks, he moves away, leaving
Molly to return to the boudoir triumphant, though
somewhat struck and saddened by his words and
manner.
"Let me embrace you," cries Cecil tragically, fling-
ing herself into her arms. “Molly—Molly, you are a
siren!”
Without a word or a look Marcia rises slowly and
quits the room.
The invitations are issued, and unanimously ac-
cepted. A ball at Herst is such a novelty that the
county to a man declare their intention of being
present at it. It therefore promises to be a great
success.
As for the house itself it is in a state of delicious
unrest. There is a good deal of noise but very little
performance, and everyone gives voice now and then
to the most startling opinions. One might, indeed,
imagine that all these people--who, when in town
during the season, yawn systematically through their
two or three balls of a night—had never seen one, so
eager and anxious are they for the success of this
solitary bit of dissipation.
Lady Stafford is in great form, and becomes even
more débonnaire and saucy than is her wont. Even
Marcia seems to take some interest in it, and lets a
little vein of excitement crop up here and there

through all the frozen placidity of her manner; while
Molly, who has never yet been at a really large affair
of the kind, loses her head and finds herself unable to
think or converse on any other subject.
Yet in all this beautiful but unhappy world where
is the pleasure that contains no sting of pain? Molly's
is a sharp little sting that pricks her constantly and
brings an uneasy sigh to her lips. Perhaps in a man's
eyes the cause would be considered small, but surely
in a woman's overwhelming. It is a question of dress,
and poor Molly's mind is much exercised thereon.
When all the others sit and talk complacently of
their silks and satins, floating tulles and laces, she,
with a pang, remembers that all she has to wear is a
plain white muslin. It is hard. No doubt she will
look pretty—perhaps prettier and fairer than most-
in the despised muslin; but as surely she will look
poorly attired, and the thought is not inspiriting.
No one but a woman can know what a woman
thinks on such a subject; and although she faces the
situation philosophically enough, and by no means
despises herself for the pangs of envy she endures
when listening to Maud Darley's account of the
triumph in robes to be sent by Worth for the Herst
ball, she still shrinks from the cross-examination she
will surely have to undergo at the hands of Cecil Staf-
ford as to her costume for the coming event.
One day, a fortnight before the ball, Cecil does
seize on her, and, carrying her off to her own room
and placing her in her favourite chair, says abruptly:
“What about your dress, Molly?”
"I don't know that there is anything to say about
it," says Molly, who is in low spirits. “The only thing

61
I have is a new white muslin, and that will scarcely
astonish the natives."
“Muslin! Oh, Molly! Not but that it is pretty
always-I know nothing more so— but for a ball-
dress—terribly rococo. I have set my heart on seeing
you resplendent; and if you are not more gorgeous
than Marcia I shall break down. Muslin won't do
at all.”
“But I'm afraid it must.”
“What a pity it is I am so much shorter than
you!” says Cecil regretfully. “Now, if I was taller we
might make one of my dresses suit you."
"Yes, it is a pity-a dreadful pity," says Molly
mournfully. "I should like to be really well dressed.
Marcia, I suppose, will be in satin, or something else
equally desirable."
“No doubt she will deck herself out in Oriental
splendour, if she discovers you can't,” says Cecil
angrily.
There is a pause
-a decided one. Cecil sits frown-
ing and staring at Molly, who has sunk into an atti-
tude expressive of the deepest dejection. The little
ormulu clock, regardless of emotion, ticks on undis-
turbed until three full minutes vanish into the past.
Then Cecil, as though suddenly inspired, says eagerly:
“Molly, why not ask your grandfather to give you
a dress?"
“Not for all the world- nothing would induce me.
If I was never to see a ball I would not ask him for
sixpence. How could you think it of me, Cecil?”
“Why didn't I think of it long ago, you mean? I
only wish he was my grandfather, and I would never
cease persecuting him, morning, noon, and night,

MOLLY BAWN.
What is the use of a grandfather if it isn't to tip one
every now and then?"
“You forget the circumstances of my case."
"I do not indeed. Of course, beyond all doubt
he behaved badly; still- I really think," says
Cecil, in a highly moralising tone, “there is nothing
on earth so mistaken as pride. I am free from it. I
don't know the meaning of it, and I know I am all
the happier in consequence."
"Perhaps I am more angry than proud.”
"It is the same thing, and I wish you weren't. Oh,
Molly! do ask him. What can it signify what he
thinks?”
"Nothing; but a great deal what John thinks. It
would be casting a slight upon him, as though he
stinted me in clothes or money, and I will not do it.”
“It would be such a simple way,” says Cecil, with
a melancholy sigh. Dear Molly is so obstinate and
old-fashioned; then follows another pause, longer and
more decided than the last. Molly, with her back
turned to her friend, commences such a dismal tattoo
upon the window-pane as would be sufficient to de-
press anyone without further cause. Her friend is
pondering deeply
“Molly," she says presently, with a fine amount of
indifference in her tone-rather suspicious, to say the
least of it—"I feel sure you are right—quite right. I
like you all the better for--your pride, or whatever
you may wish to call it. But what a pity it is your
grandfather would not offer you a dress or a cheque
to buy it! I suppose" - quietly-"if he did, you
would take it?"
“What a chance there is of that!” says Molly, still

gloomy. "Yes, if he offered it I do not think I could
bring myself to refuse it. I am not adamant. You
see"—with a faint laugh—"my pride would not carry
me very far."
“Far enough. Let us go down to the others," says
Cecil, rising and yawning slightly. “They will think
we are planning high treason, if we absent ourselves
any longer."
Together they go downstairs and into the drawing-
room, which they find empty.
As they reach the centre of it Cecil stops abruptly,
and, saying carelessly, “I will be back in one moment,'
turns and leaves the room.
The apartment is deserted. No sound penetrates
to it. Even the very fire in a fit of pique has de-
generated into a dull glow.
Molly, with a shiver, rouses it, throws on a fresh
log, and amuses herself trying to induce the tardy
flames to climb and lick it until Lady Stafford returns.
So busy has she been, it seems to her as though only
a minute has elapsed since her departure.
“This does look cosy," Cecil says, easily sinking
into a lounging-chair. "Now, if those tiresome men
had not gone shooting we should not be able to cuddle
into our fire as we are doing at present. After all, it
is a positive relief to get them out of the way-some-
times.”
“You don't seem very hearty about that sentiment.”
“I am for all that. With a good novel I would
now be utterly content for an hour or two. By the
by, I left my book on the library table. If you were
good-natured, Molly, I know what you would do."
“So do 1- I would get it for you. Well, taking

into consideration all things, your age and growing
infirmities amongst them, I will accept your hint.” And,
rising, she goes in search of the missing volume.
Opening the library door with a little bang and a
good deal of reckless unconsciousness, she finds her-
self in Mr. Amherst's presence.
"Oh!” cries she, with a surprised start.
"I beg
your pardon, grandpapa. If”-pausing on the thres-
hold—“I had known you were here I would not have
disturbed you.”
“You don't disturb me,” replies he, without look-
ing up; and, picking up the required book, Molly com-
mences a hasty retreat.
But just as she gains the door her grandfather's
voice once more arrests her.
“Wait,” he says. “I want to ask you a question
that—that has been on my mind for a considerable
time.”
To the commonest observer it would occur that
from the break to the finish of this little sentence is
one clumsy invention.
“Yes?” says Molly.
“Have you a dress for this ball—this senseless
rout that is coming off?” says Mr. Amherst, without
looking at her.
“Yes, grandpapa.” In a tone a degree harder.
“You are my granddaughter: I desire to see you
dressed as such. Is”—with an effort—"your gown a
handsome one?"
“Well, that greatly depends upon taste,” returns
Molly, who, though angry, finds a grim amusement in
watching the flounderings of this tactless old person.
"If we are to believe that beauty unadorned is adorned

the most, I may certainly flatter myself I shall be the
best dressed woman in the room. But there may be
some who will not call white muslin 'handsome.'
“White muslin up to sixteen is very charming,"
Mr. Amherst says, in the slow tone of a connoisseur
in such matters, “but not yond. And you are,
I
think-
“Nineteen."
Quite so. Then in your case I should condemn
the muslin. You will permit me to give you a dress,
Eleanor, more in accordance with your age and
position."
"Thank you very much, grandpapa," says Molly,
with a little ominous gleam in her blue eyes. “You
are too good. I am deeply sensible of all your kind-
ness, but I really cannot see how my position has
altered of late. As you have just discovered, I am
now nineteen, and for so many years I have managed
to look extremely well in white muslin.”
As she finishes her modest speech she feels she
has gone too far. She has been almost impertinent,
considering his age and relationship to her; nay, more,
she has been ungenerous.
Her small taunt has gone home. Mr. Amherst
rises from his chair; the dull red of old age comes
painfully into his withered cheeks as he stands gazing
at her, slight, erect, with her proud little head upheld
so haughtily.
For a moment anger masters him; then it fades,
and something as near remorse as his heart can hold
replaces it.
Molly, returning his glance with interest, knows he
is annoyed. But she does not know that, standing as

she now does, with uplifted chin and gleaming eyes,
and just a slight in-drawing of the lips, she is the very
image of the dead-and-gone Eleanor—that, in spite of
her Irish father, her Irish name, she is a living, breath-
ing, defiant Amherst.
In silence that troubles her she waits for the next
word. It comes slowly, almost entreatingly.
“Molly," says her grandfather, in a tone that
trembles ever such a little—it is the first time he has
ever called her by her pet name—“Molly, I shall take
it as a great favour if you will accede to my request
and accept—this."
As he finishes he holds out to her a cheque, re-
garding her earnestly the while.
The “Molly” has done it. Too generous even to
hesitate, she takes the paper, and, going closer to him,
lays her hand upon his shoulder.
“I have been rude, grandpapa-I beg your par-
don—and I am very much obliged to you for this
money."
So saying she bends and presses her soft sweet
lips to his cheek. He makes no effort to return the
caress, but long after she leaves the room sits staring
vaguely before him out of the dreary window on to
the still more dreary landscape outside, thinking of
vanished days and haunting actions that will not be
laid, but carry with them their sure and keen revenge,
in the knowledge that to the dead no ill can be un-
done.
Molly, going back to the drawing-room, finds Cecil
there, serene as usual.
“Well, and where is my book?” asks that inno-
cent. "I thought you were never coming."

“Cecil, why did you tell grandpapa to offer me a
dress?" demands Molly abruptly.
“My dearest girl _” exclaims Cecil, and then
has the grace to stop and blush a little.
“You did. There is no use your denying it."
“You didn't refuse it? Oh, Molly, after all my
trouble!”
"No"—laughing, and unfolding her palm, where
the paper lies crushed—“but I was very near it. But
that his manner was so kind, so marvellously gentle,
for him, I should have done so. Cecil, I couldn't help
thinking that perhaps long ago before the world hard-
ened him, grandpapa was a nice young man.”
"Perhaps he was, my dear-there is no knowing
what any of us may come to—though you must ex-
cuse me if I say I rather doubt it. Well, and what
did he say?"
“Very little indeed, and that little a failure. When
going about it you might have given him a few lessons
in his rôle. So bungling a perfomance as the lead-
ing up to it I never witnessed; and when he wound
up by handing me a cheque ready prepared beside
him on the desk I very nearly laughed.”
“Old goose! Never mind; "they laugh who win?
-I have won.”
“So you have."
“Well, but look Molly, look. I want to see how
far his unwonted “gentleness' has carried him. I am
dying of curiosity. I do hope he has not been shabby."
Unfolding the paper, they find the cheque has
been drawn for a hundred pounds.
“Very good,” says Cecil, with a relieved sigh. “He
is not such a bad old thing, when all is told.”

“It is too much,” says Molly, aghast. “I can't take
it indeed. I would have thought twenty pounds a
great deal, but a hundred pounds! I must take it back
to him.”
“Are you mad,” exclaims Cecil, “to insult him?
He thinks nothing of a hundred pounds. And to give
back money—that scarce commodity-how could you
bring yourself to do it?" In tones of the liveliest re-
proach. “Be reasonable, dear, and let us see how we
can spend it fast enough.”
Thus adjured Molly succumbs, and, sinking into a
chair, is soon deep in the unfathomable mysteries of
silks and satins, tulle and flowers.
“And, Cecil, I should like to buy Letitia a silk
dress like that one of yours upstairs I admire so
much.”
“The navy blue?”
“No, the olive-green; it would just suit her. She
has a lovely complexion, clear and tinted like your
own.”
“Thank you, dear. It is to be regretted you are
of the weaker sex. So delicately veiled a compliment
would not have disgraced a Chesterfield.”
“Was it too glaring? Well, I will do away with it.
I was thinking entirely of Letty. I was comparing her
skin very favourably with yours. That reminds me I
must write home to-day. I hope John won't be of-
fended with me about this money. Though after all
there can't be much harm in accepting a present from
one's grandfather."
“I should think not indeed. I only wish I had a
grandfather; and wouldn't I utilise him! But I am an
unfortunate-alone in the world.”

Even as she speaks the door in the next drawing-
room opens, and through the folding-doors, which stand
apart, she sees her husband enter and make his way
to a davenport.
“That destroys your argument," says Molly, with a
low laugh, as she runs away to her own room to write
her letters.
For a few minutes Cecil sits silently enjoying a
distant view of her husband's back. But she is far
too much of a coquette to let him long remain in
ignorance of her near proximity. Going softly up to
him, and leaning lightly over his shoulder, she says, in
a half-whisper, “What are you doing?”
He starts a little, not having expected to see so
fair an apparition, and lays one of his hands over hers
as it rests upon his shoulder.
“Is it you?” he says. “I did not hear you con-
ing."
“No? That was because I was farthest from your
thoughts. You are writing? To whom?”
“My tailor, for one. It is a sad but certain fact,
that sooner or later one's tailor must be paid.”
“So must one's modiste." With a sigh.
“It is
that sort of person who spoils one's life.”
“Is
your
life spoiled?”
“Oh, yes, in many ways.”
"Poor little soul!" says he, with a half-laugh, tighten-
ing his fingers over hers. “Is your dressmaker hard-
hearted?"
“Don't get me to begin on that subject, or I shall
never leave off. The
wrongs
I have suffered at that
woman's hands! But then why talk of what cannot
be helped?"

“Perhaps it may. Can I do nothing for you?"
“I am afraid not.” Moving a little away from him.
“And yet, perhaps, if you chose, you might. You are
writing; I wish”—throwing down her eyes, as though
confused (which she isn't), and assuming her most
guileless air—"you would write something for me."
“What a simple request! Of course I will—any-
thing."
"Really? You promise?”
"Faithfully."
“It is not, perhaps, quite so simple a request as it
appears. I want you, in fact, to-write me -a cheque!”
Sir Penthony laughs, and covers the white and
heavily-jewelled little hand that glitters before him on
the table once more with his own.
“For how much?” he asks.
“Not much-only fifty pounds. I want to buy
something particular for this ball; and"-glancing at
him—"being a lone woman, without a protector, I
dread going too heavily into debt.”
“Good child,” says Sir Penthony. "You shall have
your cheque."
Drawing the book towards him as it lies before
him on the davenport, he fills up a cheque and hands
it to her.
“Now, what will you give me for it?" asks he,
holding the edge near him as her fingers close upon
the other end.
“What have I to give? Have I not just acknow-
ledged myself insolvent? I am as poor as a church
mouse.”
“You disparage yourself. I think you as rich as

Croesus. Will you-give me a kiss?” whispers her hus-
band softly.
There is a decided pause. Dropping the cheque
and colouring deeply, Cecil moves back a step or two.
She betrays a little indignation in her glance-a very
little, but quite perceptible. Stafford sees it.
“I beg your pardon," he says hastily, an expression
of mingled pain and shame crossing his face. "I was
wrong, of course. I will not buy your kisses. Here,
take this bit of paper, and—forgive me.”
He closes her somewhat reluctant fingers over the
cheque. She is still blushing, and has her eyes fixed
on the ground, but her faint anger has disappeared.
Then some thought-evidently a merry one-occurs
to her; the corners of her mouth widen, and finally she
breaks into a musical laugh.
"Thank you very much," she says.
“You are
very good. It is something to have a husband after
all. And-if you would really care for it-I-don't
mind letting you have one Oh! here is some-
body coming."
“There always is somebody coming when least
wanted," exclaims Sir Penthony wrathfully, pushing
back his chair with much suppressed ire, as the door
opens to admit Mr. Potts.
“I hope I don't intrude,'” says Potts, putting his
comfortable face and rosy head round the door; “but
I've got an idea, and I must divulge it or burst. You
wouldn't like me to burst, would you?” This to Lady
Stafford, pathetically.
“I would not-here," replies she with decision.
“For fear you might, I shall take my departure,"
says Sir Penthony, who has not yet quite recovered

either his disappointment or bis temper, walking through.
the conservatory into the grounds beyond.
"I really wish, Plantagenet," says Lady Stafford,
turning upon the bewildered Potts with most unac-
countable severity, "you could manage to employ your
time in some useful way. The dreadful manner in
which you spend your days, wandering round the house
without aim or reason, causes me absolute regret. Do
give yourself the habit of reading or-or doing some-
thing to improve your mind, whenever you have a spare
moment."
So saying she sweeps past him out of the room,
without even making an inquiry about that priceless
idea, leaving poor Potts rooted to the ground, striving
wildly, but vainly, to convict himself of some unpar-
donable offence.

CHAPTER V.
Love, thou art bitter. -Elaine.
MR. AMHERST, having in a weak moment given his
consent to the ball, repays himself by being as unami-
able afterwards as he can well manage.
“You can have your music and the supper from
London, if you wish it,” he says to Marcia one day,
when he has inveighed against the whole proceeding
in language that borders on the abusive; “but if you
think I am going to have an army of decorators down
here, turning the house into a fancy bazaar, and mak-
ing one feel a stranger in one's own rooms, you are
very much mistaken."
“I think you are right, dear," Marcia answers with
her customary meekness; “people of that kind are
always more trouble than anything else.
And no
doubt we shall be able to do all that is necessary quite
as well ourselves."
“As to that you can, of course, please yourself.
Though why you cannot dance without filling the rooms
with earwigs and dying flowers I can't conceive."
Mr. Amherst's word being like the law of the Medes
and Persians, that altereth not, no one disputes it.
They couple a few opprobrious epithets with his name
just at first, but finally, putting on an air of resolution,
declare themselves determined and ready to outdo any
decorators in the kingdom.
“We shall wake up the morning after the ball to

find ourselves famous," says Lady Stafford. “The county
will ring with our praises. But we must have help-
we cannot depend upon broken reeds." With a re-
proachful glance at Sir Penthony, who is looking the
picture of laziness. “Talbot Lowry, of course,
will
assist us—he goes without saying.”
“I hope he will come without saying," puts in Sir
Penthony; "it would be much more to the purpose.
Any smart young tradesmen among your fellows,
Mottie?"
“Unless Grainger. You know Grainger, Lady Staf-
ford?"
“Indeed I do. What! is he stationed with you
now? He must have rejoined very lately.”
“Only the other day. Would he be of any use to
you?”
“The very greatest."
“What! Spooney?" says Tedcastle, laughing. "I
don't believe he could climb a ladder to save his life.
Think of his pretty hands and his sweet little feet.”
“And his lisp and his new eyeglass," says Staf-
ford.
“Never mind; I will have him here," declares Cecil
gaily. “In spite of all you say I positively adore that
Grainger boy."
“You seem to have a passion for fools,” says Sir
Penthony, a little bitterly, feeling some anger to-
wards her.
“And you seem to have a talent for incivility,” re-
torts she, rather nettled. This ends the conversation.
Nevertheless Mr. Grainger is asked to come and
give what assistance he can towards adorning Herst,
which, when they take into consideration the ladylike

whiteness of his hands and the general imbecility of
his countenance, is not set at a very high value.
He is a tall, lanky youth, with more than the usual
allowance of bone, but rather less of intellect; he is,
however, full of ambition, and smiles, and is amiability
itself all round. He is also desperately addicted to
Lady Stafford. He has a dear little moustache, that
undergoes much encouragement from his thumb and
first finger, and he has a captivating way of saying
“How charming!” or “Very sweet” to anything that
pleases him. And, as most things seem to meet his
approbation, he makes these two brilliant remarks with
startling frequency.
To Cecil he is a joy. In him she evidently finds
a fund of amusement, as, during the three days it
takes them to convert the ballroom, tea-room, etc., into
perfumed bowers she devotes herself exclusively to his
society.
Perhaps the undisguised chagrin of Sir Penthony
and Talbot Lowry as they witness her civility to
Grainger, goes far to add a zest to her enjoyment of
that young man's exceedingly small talk.
After dinner on the third day all is nearly com-
pleted. A few more leaves, a few more flowers, a
wreath or two to be distributed here and there, is all
that remains to be done.
“I hate decorating in October," Cecil says. “There
is such a dearth of flowers, and the gardeners get so
greedy about the house-plants. Every blossom looks
as if it had been made the most of.”
“Well, I don't know," replies Mr. Grainger, squeez-
ing his glass into his eye with much difficulty, it being
a new importation and hard to manage. When he has

altered all his face into an appalling grin, and com-
pletely blocked the sight of one eye, he goes on affably:
“I think all this-er-very charming."
“No? Do you? I'm so glad. Do you know I
believe you have wonderful taste? The way in which
you tied that last bunch of trailing ivy had something
about it absolutely artistic."
"If it hadn't fallen to pieces directly afterwards,
which rather spoiled the effect," says Sir Penthony,
with an unkind smile.
“Did it? How sad! But then the idea remains,
and that is everything. Now, Mr. Grainger, please
stand here—(will you move a little bit Sir Penthony?
Thanks)--just here—while I go up this ladder to
satisfy myself about these flowers. By-the-by”-paus-
ing on one of the rungs to look back—"suppose I were
to fall? Do you think you could catch me?”
“I only wish you would give me the opportunity of
trying,” replies he weakly.
“Beastly puppy!” mutters Sir Penthony under his
breath.
“Perhaps I shall, if you are good. Now look. Are
they straight? Do they look well?" asks Cecil.
“Very sweet," replies Mr. Grainger.
“Potts, hand me up some nails,” exclaims Lowry
impatiently, who is on another ladder close by, and
has been an attentive and disgusted listener; address-
ing Potts, who stands lost in contemplation of Grainger.
“Look sharp, can't you? And tell me what you think
of this.” Pointing to his design on the wall. “Is it
"all your fancy painted iť? Is it ‘lovely' and 'divine'?
Answer."
“Very sour, I think," returns Mr. Potts, hitting

off Grainger's voice to a nicety, while maintaining a
countenance sufficiently innocent to border on the im-
becile.
Both Sir Penthony and Lowry laugh immoderately,
while Cecil turns away to hide the smile that may be-
tray her. Grainger himself is the only one wholly
unconscious of any joke. He smiles, indeed, genially,
because they smile, and happily refrains from inquiry
of any sort.
Meantime in the tea-room—that opens off the
supper-room, where the others are engaged-Molly and
Philip are busy arranging bouquets chosen from amongst
a basket full of flowers that has just been brought in
by one of the under-gardeners.
Philip is on his knees--almost at Molly's feet-
while she bends over him searching for the choicest buds.
“What a lovely ring!" says Philip presently, staying
in his task to take her hand and examine the diamond
that glitters on it. "Was it a present?”
“Of course. Where could such a 'beggar-maid' as
I am get money enough to buy such a ring?”
“Will you think me rude if-I ask you the every-
day name of your King Cophetua?"
“I have no King Cophetua."
“Then tell me where you got it.”
“What a question!” Lightly. “Perhaps from my
own true love. Perhaps it is the little fetter that seals
my engagement to him. Perhaps it isn't.”
“Yet you said just now
“About that eccentric king? Well, I spoke truly.
Royalty has not yet thrown itself at my feet. Still”.
coquettishly—“that is no reason why I should look
coldly upon all commoners."

"Be serious, Molly-for one moment," he entreats;
the look of passionate earnestness she so much dis-
likes coming over his face, darkening instead of
brightening it. “Sometimes I am half-mad with doubt.
Tell me the truth-now-here. Are you engaged? Is
there anything between you and—Luttrell?”
The spirit of mischief has laid hold of Molly. She
cares nothing at all for Shadwell. Of all the men she
has met at Herst he attracts her least. She scarcely
understands the wild love with which she has inspired
him; she cannot sympathise with his emotion.
“Well, if you compel me to confess it,” she says,
lowering her eyes, "there is.”
“It is true, then!” cries he, rising to his feet
and turning deadly pale. “My fears did not deceive
me."
“Quite true. There is a whole long room 'between
me' and Mr. Luttrell and” — dropping her voice-
“you.” Here she laughs merrily and with all her heart.
To her it is a jest-no more.
“How a woman- the very best woman-loves to
torture!” exclaims he, anger and relief struggling in his
tone. “Oh that I dared believe that latter part of your
sentence—that I could stand between you and all the
world!”
“Fain would I climb, but that I fear to fall,'
quotes Molly, jestingly. “You know the answer? If
thy heart fail thee, do not climb at all.'”
“Is that a challenge?” demands he eagerly, going
nearer to her.
“I don't know.” Waving him back. “Hear the
oracle again. I feel strong in appropriate rhyme to-
night:

'He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts are small,
Who fears to put it to the touch
To win or lose it all.'
>>
They are quite alone. Some one has given the
door leading to the adjoining apartment a push that
has entirely closed it. Molly, in her white evening
gown and pale blue ribbons, with a bunch of her
favourite roses at her breast, is looking up at him, a
little mocking smile upon her lips. She is cold-
perhaps a shade amused-without one particle of sen-
timent.
“I fear nothing," cries Philip, in a low, impassioned
tone, made unwisely bold by her words; seizing her
hands and pressing warm, unwelcome kisses on them;
“whether I win or lose, I will speak now. Yet what
shall I tell you that you do not already know? I love
you—my idol-my darling! Oh, Molly! do not look
so coldly on me.”
"Don't be earnest, Philip," interrupts she, with a
frown, and a sudden change of tone, raising her head,
and regarding him with distasteful hauteur; "there is
nothing I detest so much; and your earnestness espe-
cially wearies me. When I spoke I was merely jesting,
as you must have known. I do not want your love. I
have told you so before. Let my hands go, Philip; your
touch is hateful to me.”
He drops her hands as though they burned him;
and she, with flushed cheeks and a still frowning brow,
turns abruptly away, leaving him alone—angered, hurt,
but still adoring.
Ten minutes later her heart-a tender one-mis-
gives her. She has been unjust to him-unkind. She

will return and make such reparation as lies in her
power.
“With a light step she returns to the tea-room,
where she left him, and, looking gently in, finds he
has neither stirred nor raised his head since her cruel
words cut him to the heart. Ten minutes La long time
--and all consumed in thoughts of her! Feeling still
more contrite, she approaches him.
“Why, Philip!” she says, with an attempt at play-
fulness, "still enduring ‘grinding torments'? What
have I said to you? You have taken my foolish
words too much to heart. That is not wise. Some-
times I hardly know myself what it is I have been
saying.”
She has come very near to him-so near that, gaz-
ing up at him appealingly, she brings her face in
dangerously close proximity to his. A mad desire to
kiss the lips that sue so sweetly for a pardon fills him,
yet he dares not do it. Although a man not given to
self-restraint where desire is at his elbow urging him
on, he now stands subdued, unnerved, in Molly's pre-
sence.
“Have I really distressed you?” asks she softly, his
strange silence rendering her still more remorseful.
“Come”- laying her hand upon his arm~"tell me
what I have done.”
“ Sweet, you have trod on a heart,'” quotes Philip,
in so low a tone as to be almost unheard. He closes
his hand tightly over hers for an instant; a moment
later, and it is she who—this time-finds herself
alone.
In the next room success is crowning their efforts.
When Molly re-enters she finds the work almost com-

pleted. Just a finishing touch here and there, and all
is ended.
"I suppose I should consider myself in luck: I have
still a little skin left," says Sir Penthony, examining his
hand with tender solicitude, “I don't think I fancy
decorating-I shan't take to the trade.”
“Yes--should have put on gloves, you know, and
that,” says Grainger, who is regarding his dainty fingers
with undisguised sadness—something that is almost an
expression on his face.
“But isn't it awfully pretty?” says Lady Stafford,
gazing round her with an air of pride.
“Awfully nice," replies Molly.
“Quite too awfully awful,” exclaims Mr. Potts
with exaggerated enthusiasm, and is instantly sup-
pressed.
"If you cannot exhibit greater decorum, Potts, we
shall be obliged to put your head in a bag,” says Sir
Penthony severely. "I consider awfully' quite the
correct word. What with the ivy and the gigantic size
of those paper roses the rooms present quite a startling
appearance."
"Well, I'm sure they are far prettier than Lady
Harriet Nitemair's; and she made such a fuss about
hers last spring,” says Cecil, rather injured.
“Not to be named in the same day,” declares
Luttrell, who has not been at Lady Harriet Nite-
mair's.
“Why, Tedcastle, you were not there; you were on
your way home from India at the time.”
“Was I? By Jove! so I was. Never mind, I take
your word for it, and stick to my opinion," replies
Luttrell, unabashed.

MOLLY BAWN,
“I really think we ought to christen our work,” Mr.
Potts puts in dreamily, being in a thirsty mood; and
christened it is in champagne.
Potts himself, having drank his own and everyone
else's health many times, grows gradually gayer and
gayer. To wind up this momentous evening without
making it remarkable in any way strikes him as being
a tame proceeding. "To do or die" suddenly occurs
to him, and he instantly acts upon it.
Seeing his two former allies standing rather apart
from the others, he makes for them, and thus addresses
them:
“Tell you what," he says, with much geniality, “it
feels like Christmas, and crackers, and small games,
don't it? I feel up to anything. And I have a capital
idea in my head. Wouldn't it be rather a joke to
frighten the others?"
“It would,” says Cecil, decidedly.
“Would it?” says Molly, diffidently.
“I have a first-rate plan: I can make you both look
so like ghosts that you would frighten the unsuspecting
into fits."
“First, Plantagenet, before we go any further into
your ghastly schemes answer me this: is there any
gunpowder about it?”
“None.” Laughing. “You just dress yourselves
in white sheets or that and hold a plate in your hands
filled with whisky and salt, and—there you are. You
have no idea of the tremendous effect. You will be
more like a corpse than anything you can imagine.”
“How cheerful!” murmurs Cecil. “You make me
long for the "sheets and that.''

“Do the whisky and the salt ever blow up?” asks
Molly, cautiously. “Because if so-2"
“No, they don't; of course not. Say nothing about
it to the others, and we shall astonish them by and
by. It is an awfully becoming thing, too,” says Potts,
with a view to encouragement; "you will look like
marble statues.”
“We are trusting you again,” says Cecil regarding
him fixedly. “Plantagenet, if you should again be our
undoing—~"
“Not the slightest fear of a fiasco this time,” says
Potts, comfortably.

CHAPTER VI.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
SHAKSPEARE.
As eleven o'clock strikes, anyone going up the
stairs at Herst would have stopped with a mingled
feeling of terror and admiration at one particular spot,
where, in a niche, upon a pedestal, a very goddess
stands.
It is Molly, clad in white from head to heel, with
a lace scarf twisted round her head and shoulders, and
with one bare arm uplifted, while with the other she
holds an urn-shaped vase beneath her face, from which
a pale blue flame arises.
Her eyes, larger, deeper, bluer than usual, are fixed
with sad and solemn meaning upon space. She scarcely
seems to breathe; no quiver disturbs her frame, so
intensely does she listen for a coming footstep. In
her heart she hopes it may be Luttrell's.
The minutes pass. Her arm is growing tired, her
eyes begin to blink against her will; she is on the
point of throwing up the game, descending from her
pedestal, and regaining her own room, when a footfall
recalls her to herself and puts her on her mettle.
Nearer it comes-still nearer, until it stops alto-
gether. Molly does not dare turn to see who it is. A
moment later, a wild cry, a smothered groan, falls
upon her ear, and, turning her head, terrified, she sees

her grandfather rush past her, tottering, trembling,
until he reaches his own room, where he disappears.
Almost at the same instant the others who have
been in the drawing-room, drawn to the spot by the
delicate machinations of Mr. Potts, come on the scene;
while Marcia, who has heard that scared cry, emerges
quickly from amongst them and passes up the stairs
into her grandfather's room.
There follows an akward silence. Cecil, who has
been adorning a corner farther on, comes creeping to-
wards them, pale and nervous, having also been a wit-
ness to Mr. Amherst's hurried flight; and she and
Molly, in their masquerading costumes, feel, to say the
least of it, rather small.
They cast a withering glance at Potts, who has
grown a lively purple; but he only shakes his head,
having no explanation to offer, and knowing himself
for once in his life to be unequal to the occasion.
Mrs. Darley is the first to break silence.
“What is it? What has happened? Why are you
both here in your night-dresses?" she asks unguardedly,
losing her head in the excitement of the moment.
“What do you mean?” says Cecil angrily. “Night-
dresses'! If you don't know dressing-gowns when you
see them I am sorry for you. Plantagenet, what has
happened?”
“It was grandpapa,” says Molly, in a frightened
tone. “He came by, and I think was upset by my-
appearance. Oh, I hope I have not done him any
harm! Mr. Potts, why did you make me do it?”
“How could I tell?” replies Potts, who is as white
as their costumes. “What an awful shriek he gave!

I thought such a stern old card as he is would have
had more pluck."
“I was positive he was in bed," says Cecil, “or I
should never have ventured.”
“He is never where he ought to be," mutters Potts
gloomily.
Here conversation fails them. For once they are
honestly dismayed, and keep their eyes fixed in anxious
expectation on the bed-chamber of their host. Will
Marcia never come?
At length the door opens and she appears, looking
pale and distraite. Her eyes light angrily as they fall
on Molly
“Grandpapa is very much upset. He is ill. It was
heartless—a cruel trick,” she says, rather incoherently.
“He wishes to see you, Eleanor, instantly. You had
better go to him.”
“Must I?” asks Molly, who is quite colourless, and
much inclined to cry.
“Unless you wish to add disobedience to your
other unfeeling conduct,” replies Marcià coldly.
“No, no; of course not. I will go," says Molly
nervously.
With faltering footsteps she approaches the fatal
door, whilst the others disperse and return once more
to the drawing-room--all, that is, except Lady Stafford,
who seeks her own chamber, and Mr. Potts, who in an
agony of doubt and fear lingers about the corridor,
awaiting Molly's return.
As she enters her grandfather's room she finds him
lying on a couch, half-upright, an angry, disappointed
expression on his face, distrust in his searching eyes.
“Come here," he says harshly, motioning her with

one finger to his side, “and tell me why you, of all
others, should have chosen to play this trick upon me?
Was it revenge?"
“Upon you, grandpapa! Oh, not upon you,” says
Molly, shocked. “It was all a mistake-a mere foolish
piece of fun; but I never thought you would have been
the one to see me.”
“Are you lying? Let me look at you. If so, you
do it cleverly. Your face is honest. Yet I hear it
was for me alone this travesty was enacted.”
“Whoever told you so spoke falsely," Molly says,
pale but firm, a great indignation towards Marcia rising
in her breast. She has her hand on the back of a
chair, and is gazing anxiously but openly at the old
“Why should I seek to offend you, who have
been so kind to me—whose bread I have eaten? You
do not understand-you wrong me.”
“I thought it was your mother," whispers he, with
a quick shiver, "from her grave returned to reproach
me—to remind me of all the miserable past. It was
a senseless thought. But the likeness was awful-ap-
palling. She was my favourite daughter, yet she of
all creatures was the one to thwart me most; and I
did not forgive. I left her to pine for the luxuries to
which she was accustomed from her birth, and could
not then procure. She was delicate. I let her wear
her heart out waiting for a worthless pardon. And
what a heart it was! Then I would not forgive; now-
now I crave forgiveness. Oh that the dead could speak!”
He covers his face with his withered hands, that
shake and tremble like October leaves, and a troubled
sigh escapes him. For the moment the stern old man
has disappeared-only the penitent remains.


## p. 88 (#94) ##############################################

MOLLY BAWN,
“Dear grandpapa, be comforted,” says Molly, much
affected, sinking on her knees beside him. Never be-
fore, by either brother or grandfather, has her dead
mother been so openly alluded to. "She did forgive.
So sweet as she was, how could she retain a bitter
feeling? Listen to me. Am I not her only child?
Who so meet to offer you her pardon? Let me com-
fort you."
Mr. Amherst makes no reply, but he gently presses
the fingers that have found their way around his neck,
"I too would ask pardon," Molly goes on, in her
sweet, low, traînante voice, that has a sob in it here
and there. “How shall I gain it after all that I have
done-to distress you so, although unintentionally?
And you think hardly of me, grandpapa? You think
I did it to annoy you?”
“No, no, not now."
“I have made you ill,” continues Molly, still cry-
ing; “I have caused you pain. Oh, grandpapa! do say
you are not angry with me."
“I am not. You are a good child, and Marcia
wronged you. Go now and forget all I may have said.
I am weak at times, and-and Go, child; I am
better alone.”
In the corridor outside stands Mr. Potts, with pale
cheeks and very pale eyes. Even his hair seems to
have lost a shade and looks subdued.
“Well, what did he say to you?” he asks in what
he fondly imagines to be a whisper, but which would
be distinctly audible in the hall beneath. “Was he
awfully mad? Did he cut up very rough? I wouldn't
have been in your shoes for a million. Did he-did
he-say anything about-me?"

"I don't believe he remembered your existence,"
says Molly, with a laugh, although her eyelids are still
of a shade too decided to be becoming. “He knew
nothing of your share in the transaction.
Whereupon Mr. Potts declares himself thankful for
so much
mercy in a devout manner, and betakes him-
self to the smoking-room.
Here he is received with much applause and more
congratulations.
“Another of Mr. Potts' charming entertainments,"
says Sir Penthony, with a wave of the hand. “Extra-
ordinary and enthusiastic reception! Such success has
seldom before been witnessed! Last time he blew up
two young women; to-night he has slain an offensive
old gentleman! Really, Potts, you must allow me to
shake hands with you."
“Was there ever anything more unfortunate?” says
Potts in a lachrymose tone. He has not been in-
attentive to the requirements of the inner man since
his entrance, and already, slowly but surely, the brandy
is doing its work. “It was all so well arranged, and I
made sure the old boy was gone to bed.”
“He is upset," murmurs Sir Penthony, with touch-
ing concern, “and no wonder. Such tremendous exer-
tion requires the aid of stimulants to keep it up. My
dear Potts, do have a little more brandy-and-soda.
You don't take half care of yourself."
“Not a drop-not a drop,” says Mr. Potts, drawing
the decanter towards him, “It don't agree with me.
Oh, Stafford! you should have seen Miss Massereene
in her Greek costume. I think she is the loveliest
creature I ever saw. She is,” goes on Mr. Potts with

unwise zeal, “by far the loveliest, and the same I
would rise to maintain.'"
“I wouldn't if I were you," says Philip, who is
indignant. “There is no knowing what tricks your
legs may play with you."
“She was just like Venus, or-or some of those
other goddesses," says Mr. Potts vaguely.
“I can well believe it,” returns Stafford; “but don't
let emotion master you. “There's naught, no doubt,
so much the spirit calms as rum and true religion.'
Try a little of the former.”
“There is nothing in life I wouldn't do for that
girl-nothing, I declare to you, Stafford, goes on
Potts, who is quite in tears by this time; “but she
wouldn't look at me.”
Luttrell and Philip are enraged, Stafford and the
others are in roars.
“Wouldn't she, Potts?” says Stafford, with a fine
show of sympathy. “Who knows? Cheer up, old boy,
and remember women never know their own minds at
first. She may yet become alive to your many perfec-
tions and know her heart to be all yours. Think of
that. And why should she not?” says Sir Penthony,
with free encouragement.
“Where could she get a
better fellow? 'Faint heart, you know, Potts. Take
my advice and pluck up spirit, and go in for her
boldly. Throw yourself at her feet.”
"I will,” says Mr. Potts ardently.
“To-morrow," advises Sir Penthony with growing
excitement.
“Now," declares Potts with wild enthusiasm, mak-
ing a rush for the door.
"Not to-night; wait till to-morrow," Sir Penthony

says, who has not anticipated so ready an acceptance
of his advice, getting between him and the door. “In
my opinion she has retired to her room by this; and
it really would be rather sketchy you know-eh?”
“What do you say, Luttrell?" asks Potts uncertainly.
“What would you advise?"
“Bed,” returns Luttrell curtly, turning on his heel.
And finally the gallant Potts is conveyed to his
room, without being allowed to lay his hand and for-
tune at Miss Massereene's feet.
About four o'clock the next day-being that of the
ball—Sir Penthony, strolling along the western cor-
ridor, comes to a standstill before Cecil's door, which
happens to lie wide open.
Cecil herself is inside, and is standing so as to be
en, clad in the memorable white dressing-gown of
the evening before, making a careful choice between
two bracelets she holds in her hands.
“Is that the garment in which you so much dis-
tinguished yourself last night?” Sir Penthony cannot
help asking; and, with a little start and blush, she
raises her eyes.
"Is it you?" she says, smiling. “Yes, this is the
identical robe. Won't you come in, Sir Penthony?
You are quite welcome. If you have nothing better
to do you may stay with and talk to me for a little.”
“I have plenty to do"-coming in and closing the
door—"but nothing I would not gladly throw over to
accept an invitation from you."
"Dear me! What a charming speech! What a
courtier you would have made! Consider yourself
doubly welcome-I adore pretty speeches, when ad-

dressed to myself. Now, sit there while I decide on
what jewellery I shall wear to-night.”
“So this is her sanctum," thinks her husband,
glancing round. What a dainty nest it is, with its in-
numerable feminine fineries, its piano, its easel, its
pretty pink-and-blue crétonne, its wealth of flowers,
although the season is of the coldest and bleakest.
A cosy fire burns brightly. In the wall opposite is
on open door, through which one catches a glimpse of
the bedroom beyond, decked out in all its pink-and-
white glory. There is a very sociable little clock, a
table strewn with wools and coloured silks, and mirrors
everywhere.
As for Cecil herself, with honest admiration her
husband carefully regards her. What a pretty woman
she is! full of all the tender graces, the lovable caprices
that wake the heart to fondness.
How charming a person to come to in grief or
trouble, or even in one's gladness! How full of gaiety
yet immeasurable tenderness is her speaking face!
Verily there is a depth of sympathy to be found in a
pretty woman that a plain one surely lacks.
Her white gown becomes her à merveille, and fits
her to perfection. She cannot be called fat, but as
certainly she cannot be called thin.
When people
speak of her with praise they never fail to mention
the "pretty roundness” of her figure.
Her hair has partly come undone, and hangs in a
fair loose coil, rather lower than usual, upon her neck.
This suits her, making still softer her soft though
piquante face.
Her white and jewelled fingers are busy in the case
before her as, with puckered brows, she sighs over the

difficulty of making a wise and becoming choice in
precious stones for the evening's triumphs.
At last—a set of sapphires having gained the
day—she lays the casket aside and turns to her hus-
band, while wondering with demure amusement on
the subject of his thoughts during these past few
minutes.
He has been thinking of her, no doubt. Her snowy
wrapper, with all its dainty frills and bows, is eminently
becoming. Yes, beyond question he has been indulg-
ing in sentimental regrets.
Sir Penthony's first remark rather dispels the illu-
sion.
“The old boy puts you up very comfortably down
here, don't he?” he says, in a terribly prosaic tone.
Is this all? Has he been admiring the furni-
ture during all these eloquent moments of silence in-
stead of her and her innumerable charms? Insuffer-
able!
"He do," responds she drily, with a careful adapta-
tion of his English.
Sir Penthony raises his eyebrows in affected aston-
ishment, and then they both laugh.
“I do hope you are not going to say rude things
to me about last night,” she says, still smiling.
“No. You may remember once before on a very
similar occasion I told you I should never again scold
you, for the simple reason that I considered it language
thrown away. I was right, as the sequel proved. Be-
sides, the extreme becomingness of your toilette alto-
gether unarmed me. By-the-by, when do you return
to town?"
"Next week. And you?"

"I shall go-when you go. May I call on you there?”.
“Indeed you may.
I like you quite well enough,”
says her ladyship, with unsentimental and therefore
most objectionable frankness, “to wish you for my friend.”
“Why should we not be more than friends, Cecil?”
says Stafford, going up to her and taking both her
hands in a warm, affectionate clasp. "Just consider
how we two are situated: you are bound to me for
ever,
until death shall kindly step in to relieve you of
me, and I am bound to you as closely. Why, then,
should we not accept our position, and make our lives
one?"
“You should have thought of all this before."
“How could I? Think what a deception you prac-
tised on me when sending me that miserable picture.
I confess I abhor ugliness. And then, your own con-
ditions—what could I do but abide by them?”
“There are certain times when a woman does not alto-
gether care about being taken so completely at her word.”
“But that was not one of them.” Hastily. “I do
not believe you would have wished to live with a man
you neither knew nor cared for."
"Perhaps not.” Laughing. “Sometimes I hardly
know myself what it is I do want. But are we not very
well as we are? I dare say, had we been living together
for the past three years, we should now dislike each other
as cordially as—as do Maud Darley and her husband.”
“Impossible. Maud Darley is one person, you are
quite another; while I-well” --with a smile—"I
honestly confess I fancy myself rather more than poor
Henry Darley.”
“He certainly is plain,” says Cecil pensively, “and
-he snores—two great points against him. Yes, on

consideration, you are an improvement on Henry Dar-
ley." Then, with a sudden change of tone, she says,
“Does all this mean that you love me?"
“Yes. I confess it, Cecil," answers he gravely,
earnestly. "I love you as I never believed it possible
I should love any woman. I am twenty-nine, and—
think me cold if you will—but up to this I never
yet saw the woman I wanted for my wife except you.”
“Then you ought to consider yourself the happiest
man alive, because you have the thing you crave.
As
you reminded me just now, I am yours until death us
do part."
“Not all I crave, not the best part of you, your
heart," replies he tenderly. "No man loving as I do
could be contented with a part.”
“Oh, it is too absurd,” says Cecil, with a little ag-
gravating shake of the head. “In love with your own
wife in this prosaic nineteenth century! It savours of
the ridiculous. Such mistaken feeling has been tabooed
long ago. Conquer it-conquer it.”
“Too late. Besides, I have no desire to con-
quer it. On the contrary, I encourage it, in hope of
some return. No, do not dishearten me. I know
what you are going to say; but at least you like me,
Cecil?"
“Well, yes; but what of that? I like so many
people."
“Then go a little farther, and say you-love me."
“That would be going a great deal farther, because
I love so few."
“Never mind. Say, ‘Penthony, I love you.''
He has placed his hands upon her shoulders, and
is regarding her with anxious fondness

“Would you have me tell you an untruth?”
“I would have you say you love me.”
"But supposing I cannot in honesty?"
“Try.”
“Of course I can try. Words without meaning are
easy things to say. But then—a lie; that is a serious
matter."
“It may cease to be a lie, once uttered.”
“Well—just to please you, then, and as an experi-
ment-and You are sure you will not despise
me for saying it?"
“No."
“Nor accuse me afterwards of deceit?”
“Of course not."
“Nor think me weak-minded?"
“No, no. How could I?”
"Well, then-Penthony-I-don't love you the least
bit in the world!” declares Cecil, with a provoking,
irresistible laugh, stepping backwards out of his reach.
Sir Penthony does not speak for a moment or two;
then “Sweet is revenge, especially to women,'
says quietly, although at heart he is bitterly chagrined.
To be unloved is one thing—to be laughed at is an-
other. “After all, you are right. There is nothing in
this world so rare or so admirable as honesty. I am
glad you told me no untruth even in jest.”
Just at this instant the door opens and Molly
enters. She looks surprised at such an unexpected
spectacle as Cecil's husband sitting in his wife's boudoir,
tête-à-tête with her.
“Don't be shy, dear," says Cecil mischievously,
with a little wicked laugh; "you may come in—it is
only my husband.”

The easy nonchalance of this speech, the only half-
suppressed amusement in her tone, angers Sir Pen-
thony more than all that has gone before. With a
hasty word or two to Molly, he suddenly remembers a
pressing engagement, and, with a slight bow to his
wife, takes his departure.

CHAPTER VII.
Take, oh! take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn;
And those eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn:
But my kisses bring again,
Seals of love, but seal'd in vain.
SHAKSPEARE.
The longed-for night has arrived at last; so has
Molly's dress, a very marvel of art, fresh and pure as
newly-fallen snow. It is white silk with tulle, on which
white water-lilies lie here and there, as though care-
lessly thrown, all their broad and trailing leaves gleam-
ing from amongst the shining folds.
Miss Massereene is in her own room, dressing, her
faithful Sarah on her knees beside her. She has almost
finished her toilette, and is looking more than usually
lovely in her London ball-dress.
“Our visit is nearly at an end, Sarah; how have
you enjoyed it?" she asks in an interval, during which
Sarah is at her feet sewing on more securely one of
her white lilies.
“Very much indeed, miss. They've all been ex-
cessive polite though they do ask a lot of questions.
Only this evening they wanted to know if we was
estated, and I said 'Yes,' Miss Molly, because after
all, you know, miss, it is a property, however small;
and I wasn't going to let myself down. And then
that young man of Captain Shadwell's ast me if we
was "county people, which I thought uncommon im-

perent. Not but what he's a nice young man, miss,
and very affable.”
“Still constant, Sarah?” says Molly, who is deep
in the waves of doubt, not being able to decide some
important final point about her dress.
“Oh, law! yes, miss, he is indeed. It was last
night he was saying as my accent was very sweet.
Now, there isn't one of them country bumpkins, miss,
as would know whether you had an accent or not. It's
odd how travelling do improve the mind.”
“Sarah, you should pay no attention to those Lon-
don young men-(pin it more to this side)--because
they never mean anything."
“Law, Miss Molly, do you say so?" says her hand-
maid, suddenly depressed. “Well, of course, miss,
you—who are so much with London gentlemen-ought
to know. And don't they mean what they say to you,
Miss Molly?”
“Eh?” says Molly, rather taken aback; and then
she bursts out laughing. "Sarah, only I know you
to be trustworthy, I should certainly think you sar-
castic.”
“What's that, miss?”
“Never mind-something thoroughly odious. You
abash me, Sarah. By all means believe what each
one tells you.
It may be as honestly said to you as
to me. And now, how do I look, Sarah? Speak,”
says Molly, sailing away from her up the room like
a “white, white swan," and then turning to confront
her and give her a fair opportunity of judging of her
charms.
“Just lovely," says Sarah, with the most flattering

“Oh,
sincerity of tone. “There is no doubt, Miss Molly, but
you look quite the lady."
“Do I really? Thank you, Sarah,” says Molly
humbly.
“I agree with Sarah,” says Cecil, who has entered
unnoticed. She affects blue as a rule, and is now at-
tired in palest azure, with a faint pink blossom in her
hair, and another at her breast.
“Sarah is a person
of much discrimination--you do look 'quite the lady.'
You should be grateful to me, Molly, when you re-
member I ordered your dress—it is almost the pret-
tiest I have ever seen, and with you in it the effect is
maddening."
“Let me get downstairs, at all events, without hav-
ing my head turned,” says Molly, laughing.
Cecil, I feel so happy! To have a really irreproach-
able ball-dress, and to go to a really large ball, has
been for years the dream of my life.”
"I wonder, when the evening is over, how you
will look on your dream?” Cecil cannot help saying.
“Come, we are late enough as it is. But first turn
round and let me see the train. So-that woman is
a perfect artist where dresses are concerned. You
look charming."
“And her neck and arms, my lady!” puts in Sarah,
who is almost tearful in her admiration. “Surely Miss
Massereene's cannot be equalled. They are that white,
Miss Molly, that no one could be found fault with for
comparing them to the dribbling snow."
"A truly delightful simile," exclaims Molly merrily,
and forthwith follows Cecil to conquest.
They find the drawing-rooms still rather empty.
Marcia is before them, and Philip and Mr. Potts; also

Sir Penthony. Two or three determined ball-goers
have arrived, and are dotted about-looking over
albums, asking each other how they do, and thinking
how utterly low it is of all the rest of the county to
be so late. “Such beastly affectation you know; and
such a putting on of side, and general straining after
effect.”
“I hope, Miss Amherst, you have asked a lot of
pretty girls," says Plantagenet, "and only young ones.
old maids make awful havoc of my temper."
“I don't think there are lots' of pretty girls any-
where; but I have asked as many as I know. And
there are amongst them at least two acknowledged
belles.”
“You don't say so!” exclaims Sir Penthony. “Miss
Amherst, if you wish to make me eternally grateful
you will point them out to me. There is nothing so
distressing as not to know. And once I was intro-
duced to a beauty, and didn't discover my luck until
it was too late. I never even asked her to dance!
Could you fancy anything more humiliating? Give
you my honour I spoke to her for ten minutes and
never so much as paid her a compliment. It was too
cruel-and she the queen of the evening, as I was
told afterwards."
“You didn't admire her?” asks Cecil, interested.
“Never saw her beauty?"
“No. She was tall, and had arched brows, two
things I detest.”
The ball is at its height. Marcia, dressed in pale
maize silk—which suits her dark and glowing beauty
—is still receiving a few late guests in her usual
stately but rather impassive manner. Old Mr. Amherst,

standing beside her, gives her an air of importance.
Beyond all doubt she will be heavily dowered-a
wealthy heiress, if not exactly the heir.
Philip, as the supposed successor to the house and
lands of Herst, receives even more attention; while
Molly, except for her beauty, which outshines all that
the room contains, is in no way noticeable. Though,
when one holds the ace of trumps, one feels almost
independent of the other honours.
The chief guest—a Marquis, with an aristocratic
limp and only one eye-has begged of her a square
dance. Two Lords--one very young, the other dis-
tressingly old-have also solicited her hand in the
“mazy dance." She is the reigning belle—and she
knows it.
Beautiful, sparkling, bțilliant, she moves through
the rooms.
A great delight, a joyous excitement-
born of her youth, the music, her own success—fills
her. She has a smile, a kindly look for everyone.
Even Mr. Buscarlet in the blackest of black clothes
and rather indifferent linen, venturing to address her
as she goes by him, receives a gracious answer in
return. So does Mrs. Buscarlet, who is radiant in
pink satin and a bird-of-paradise as a crown.
"Ain't she beautiful?” says that substantial matron,
with a beaming air of approbation, as though Molly
was her bosom friend, addressing the partner of her
joys. "Such a lovely turned jaw! She has quite a
look of my sister Maryanne when a girl. I wish, my
dear, she was to be heiress of Herst, instead of that
stuck-up girl in yellow.”
“So do I--so do I,” replies Buscarlet, following
the movements of Beauty as she glides away, smiling,

dimpling on my Lord's arm. “And_ahem!"_with a
meaning and consequential cough—"perhaps she may.
Who knows? There is a certain person who has often
a hold of her grandfather's ear! Ahem!”
Meantime the band is playing its newest, sweetest
strains; the air is heavy with the scent of flowers.
The low ripple of conversation and merry laughter
rises above everything. The hours are flying all too
swiftly.
“May I have the pleasure of this waltz with you?”
Sir Penthony is saying, bending over Lady Stafford, as
she sits in one of the numberless small, dimly-lit apart-
ments that branch off the hall.
“Dear Sir Penthony, do you think I will test your
good nature so far? You are kind to a fault, and I
will not repay you so poorly as to avail myself of your
offer. Fancy condemning you to waste a whole dance
on your-wife!”
The first of the small hours has long since sounded,
and she is a little piqued that not until now has he
asked her to dance. Nevertheless she addresses him,
with her most charming smile.
“I, for my part, should not consider it a dance
wasted,” replies he stiffly.
“Is he not self-denying?” she says, turning languidly
towards Lowry, who as usual stands beside her.
“You cannot expect me to see it in that light,” re-
plies he politely,
“May I hope for this waltz?” Sir Penthony asks
again, this time very coldly.
“Not this one-perhaps a little later on."
“As you please, of course," returns he, as,
with a

frown and an inward determination never to ask her
again, he walks away.
In the ballroom he meets Luttrell, evidently on the
look-out for a missing partner.
“Have you seen Miss Massereene?” he asks in-
stantly. "I am engaged to her, and can
see her
nowhere."
“Try one of those nests for flirtation," replies
Stafford bitterly, turning abruptly away, and pointing
towards the room he has just quitted.
But Luttrell goes in a contrary direction. Through
one conservatory after another, through ballroom, sup-
per-room, tea-room, he searches without success. There
is no Molly to be seen anywhere.
“She has forgotten our engagement,” he thinks,
and feels a certain pang of disappointment that it
should be so. As he walks, rather dejectedly, into a
last conservatory he is startled to find Marcia there
alone, gazing with silent intentness out of the window
into the garden beneath.
As he approaches she turns to meet his gaze. She
is as pale as death, and her dark eyes are full of fire.
The fingers of her hand twitch convulsively.
“You are looking for Eleanor?" she says intuitively,
her voice low, but vibrating with some hidden emotion.
“See, you will find her there."
She points down towards the garden through the
window where she has been standing, and moves
away.
Impelled by the strangeness of her manner, Luttrell
follows her direction, and, going over to the window,
gazes out into the night.
It is a brilliant moonlight night; the very stars shine

with redoubled glory; the chaste Diana, riding high in
the heavens, casts over “tower and stream” and spread-
ing parks “a flood of silver sheen”-the whole earth
seems bright as gaudy day.
Beneath, in the shrubberies, pacing to and fro, are
Molly and Philip Shadwell, evidently in earnest con-
versation. Philip at least seems painfully intent and
eager. They have stopped, as though by one impulse,
and now he has taken her hand. She hardly rebukes
him; her hand lies passive within his; and now—now
with a sudden movement he has placed his arm around
her waist.
“Honour or no honour," says Luttrell fiercely, “I
will see it out with her now."
Drawing a deep breath, he folds his arms and leans
against the window, full of an agonised determination
to know the worst.
Molly has put up her hand and laid it on Philip's
chest, as though expostulating, but makes no vehement
effort to escape from his embrace. Philip, his face lit
up with passionate admiration, is gazing down into the
lovely one so near him, that scarcely seems to shrink
from his open homage. The merciless, cruel moon
betrays them all too surely.
Luttrell's pulses are throbbing wildly, while his heart
has almost ceased to beat. Half a minute—that is a
long hour-passes thus; a few more words from Philip,
an answer from Molly. O that he could hear! And
then Shadwell stoops until from where Luttrell stands
his face seems to grow to hers.
Tedcastle's teeth meet in his lip as he gazes spell-
bound. A cold shiver runs through him, as when one
learns that all one's dearest, most cherished hopes are

trampled in the dust. A faint moisture stands on his
brow. It is the bitterness of death!
Presently a drop of blood trickling slowly down-
the sickly flavour of it in his mouth-rouses him. In-
stinctively he closes his eyes, as though, too late, to
strive to shut out the torturing sight, and, with a deep
curse, he presses his handkerchief to his lips and
moves away as one suddenly awakened from a ghastly
dream.
In the doorway he meets Marcia-she too has been
a witness of the garden scene—and as he passes her
she glances up at him with a curious smile.
“If you wish to keep her you should look after
her," she whispers, with white lips.
“If she needs looking after-I do not wish for her,"
he answers bitterly, and the next moment could kill
himself, in that he has been so far wanting in loyalty
to his most disloyal love.
With his mind quite made up he waits through
two dances silently, almost motionless, with his back
against a friendly wall, hardly taking note of anything
that is going on around him, until such time as he can
claim another dance from Molly.
It comes at last; and, making his way through the
throng of dancers, he reaches the spot where, breath-
less, smiling, she sits fanning herself, an adoring
partner dropping little honeyed phrases into her will-
ing ear.
“This is our dance,” Luttrell says in a hard tone,
standing before her, with compressed lips and a pale
face.
“Is it?" With a glance at her card.
“Never mind your card. I know it is ours," he

says; and, offering her his arm, leads her, not to the
ballroom, but on to a balcony, from which the garden
can be reached by means of steps.
Before descending he says—always in the same
uncompromising tone:
“Are you cold? Shall I fetch you a shawl?”
And she answers:
"No, thank you. I think the night warm." Being
for the moment carried away by the strangeness and
determination of his manner.
When they are in the garden, and still he has not
spoken, she breaks the silence.
“What is it, Teddy?” she asks lightly. “I am all
curiosity. I never before saw you look so angry.”
“Angry'-no-I hardly think there is room for
anger. I have brought you here to tell you—I will
not keep to my engagement with you—an hour longer."
Silence follows this declaration-a dead silence,
broken only by the voices of the night and the faint,
sweet, dreamy sound of one of Gungl's waltzes as it
steals through the air to where they stand.
They have ceased to move, and are facing each
other in the narrow pathway. A few beams from the
illumined house fall across their feet; one, more ad-
venturous than the rest, has lit on Molly's face, and
lingers there, regardless of the envious moonbeams.
How changed it is! All the soft sweetness, the
gladness of it, that characterised it a moment since, is
gone. All the girlish happiness and excitement of a
first ball has vanished. She is cold, rigid, as one
turned to stone. Indignation lies within her lovely
eyes.
“I admit you have taken me by surprise,” she says

slowly. “It is customary—is it not?—for the one who
breaks an engagement to assign some reason for so
doing?"
“It is. You shall have my reason.
Half an hour
ago I stood at that window"-pointing to it—"and saw
you in the shrubberies—with-Shadwell!”
“Yes? And then?"
“Then—then!” With a movement full of passion
he lays his hands upon her shoulders and turns her
slightly, so that the ray which has wandered once
more rests upon her face. “Let me look at you," he
says; “let me see how bravely you can carry out your
deception to its end. Its end, mark you;
for
you
shall
never again deceive me. I have had enough of it. It
is over. My love for you has died.”
"Beyond all doubt it had an easy death," replies
she calmly. “There could never have been much life
in it. But all this is beside the question. I have yet
to learn my crime. I have yet to learn what awful
iniquity lies in the fact of my being with Philip Shad-
well.”
“You are wonderfully innocent.” With a sneer.
“Do you think, then, my sight failed me?"
“Still I do not understand," she says, drawing her-
self
up,
with a little proud gesture.
“What is it to me
whether you or all the world saw me with Philip? Ex-
plain yourself.”
"I will.” In a low voice, almost choked with pas-
sion and despair. “You will understand when I tell
you I saw him with his arms around you--you sub-
mitting-you-- And then--I saw him-kiss you!
That I should live to say it of you!”

“Did you see him kiss me?" Still calmly. “Your
eyesight is invaluable.”
"Ah! you no longer deny it? In your inmost heart
no doubt you are laughing at me, poor fool that I have
been. How many other times have you kissed him, I
wonder, when I was not by to see?”
“Whatever faults you may have had, I acquitted
you of brutality," says she, in a low, carefully sup-
pressed tone.
“You never loved me. In that one matter at least
you were honest: you never professed affection. And
yet I was mad enough to think that after a time I
should gain the love of a flirt-a coquette.”

he, unheeding, “determined not to see what all the

there was between you and Shadwell. But I am blind
no longer. I am glad—yes, thankful,” cries the young
man, throwing out one hand, as though desirous of
proving by action the truth of his sad falsehood-
“thankful I have found you out at last—before it was
too late."
"I am thankful too; but for another reason. I feel
grateful that your suspicions have caused you to break
off our engagement. And now that it is broken -
irremediably so--let me tell you that for once your

as you would have it); I admit he stooped to kiss me;

pale as an early snowdrop, "I do not admit he kissed

me, I have not yet fallen so low as to let one man kiss

Be it so. I forgive you. But, for the future, let

be possible."
“Molly, if what you now—_"
“Stand back, sir," cries she, with an air of majesty
and with an imperious gesture raising one white arm,
that gleams like snow in the dark night, to wave him
to one side. “From henceforth remember-I am deaf
when you address me!”
She sweeps past him into the house, without further
glance or word, leaving him, half-mad with doubt and
self-reproach, to pace the gardens until far into the
morning.
When he does re-enter the ballroom he finds it
almost deserted. Nearly all the guests have taken
their departure. Dancing is growing half-hearted;
conversation is having greater sway with those that
still remain.
The first person he sees—with Philip beside her-
is Molly, radiant, sparkling, even more than usually
gay. Two crimson spots burn upon either cheek, mak-
ing her large eyes seem larger, and bright as gleaming
stars.
Even as Luttrell with concentrated bitterness stands
transfixed at some little distance from her, realising
how small a thing to her is this rupture between them,

that is threatening to break his heart, she, looking up,
sees him.
Turning to her companion, she whispers something
to him in a low tone, and then she laughs a soft,
rippling laugh, full of mirth and music.
“There go the chimes again,” says Mr. Potts, who
has just come up, alluding to Molly's little cruel out-
burst of merriment. "I never saw Miss Massereene in
such good form as she is in to-night. Oh!”—with a
suppressed yawn—“.what a day we're 'aving! I wish
it were all to come over again.”
“Plantagenet, you grow daily more dissipated,” says
Cecil Stafford severely. “A little boy like you should
be in your bed hours ago; instead of which you have
been allowed to sit up until half-past-four, and—-"
“And still I am not 'appy?' How could I be
when
you
did me out of that solitary dance you pro-
mised me? I really believed when I asked you with
such pathos in the early part of the evening to keep
that one green spot in your memory for me, you would
have done so."
“Did I forget you?" Remorsefully. “Well, don't
blame me.
Mr. Lowry would keep my card for me,
and, as a natural consequence, it was lost. After that
how was it possible for me to keep to my engage-
ments?"
“I think it was a delightfull ball,” Molly says, with
perhaps a shade too much empressement. “I never in
all my life enjoyed myself so well."
“Lucky you," says Cecil. "Had I been allowed I
should perhaps have been happy too; but”—with a
glance at Stafford, who is looking the very personifica-
tion of languid indifference—“when people allow their

tempers to get the better of them-
Here she
pauses, with an eloquent sigh.
“I hope you are not alluding to me,” says Lowry,
who is at her elbow, with a smile that awakes in Staf-
ford a mild longing to strangle him.
"Oh, no!" Sweetly. “How could you think it?
I am not ungrateful; and I know how carefully you
tried to make my evening a pleasant one."
“If I succeeded it is more than I dare hope for,"
returns he in a low tone, intended for her ears alone.
She smiles at him, and holds out her arm, that he
may re-fasten the eighth button of her glove that has
mysteriously come undone. He rather lingers over the
doing of it. He is, indeed, strangely awkward, and
finds an unaccountable difficulty in inducing the re-
fractory button to go into its proper place.
“Shall we bivouac here for the remainder of the
night, or seek our beds?” asks Sir Penthony, im-
patiently. "I honestly confess the charms of that eldest
Miss Millbanks have completely used me up. Too much
of a good thing is good for nothing—and she is tall.
Do none of the rest of you feel fatigue? I know
women's passion for conquest is not easily satiated”-
with a slight sneer—“but at five o'clock in the morn-
ing one might surely call a truce."
They agree with him, and separate, even the tardiest
guest having disappeared by this time, with a last
assurance of how intensely they have enjoyed their
evening; though when they reach their chambers a
few of them give way to such despair and disappoint-
ment as rather gives the lie to their expressions of
pleasure.

mask the wounded pride, the new sensation of blank-
ness that fills her with dismay-flings herself upon her
bed and cries away all the remaining hours that rest
between her and her maid's morning visit-
Alas! how easily things go wrong:
A sigh too much or a kiss too long.
For how much less—for the mere suspicion of a kiss
-have things gone wrong with her! How meagre is
the harvest she has gathered in from all her anticipated
pleasure, how poor a fruition has been hers!
Now that she and her lover are irrevocably sepa-
rated she remembers, with many pangs of self-reproach,
how tender, and true, and honest he has proved him-
self in all his dealings with her; and though she cannot
accuse herself of actual active disloyalty towards him
a hidden voice reminds her how lightly and with what
persistent carelessness she accepted all his love, and
how indifferently she made return.
With a desire to ease the heartache she is en-
during, she tries—in vain—to encourage a wrathful
feeling towards him, calling to mind how ready he was
to believe her false, how easily he flung her off, for
what, after all, was but a fancied offence. But the
very agony of his face as he did so disarms her, re-
collecting as she does every change and all the pas-
sionate disappointment of it.
O that she had repulsed Philip on the instant when
first he took her hand, as it had been in her heart to
do!—but for the misery he showed that for the mo-
ment softened her. Mercy on such occasions is only
cruel kindness So she now thinks—and has been
her own undoing. And besides, what is his misery to
hers?

An intense bitterness, a positive hatred towards
Shadwell, who has brought all this discord into her
hitherto happy life, grows within her, filling her with
a most unjust longing to see him as wretched as he
has unwittingly made her; while yet she shrinks with
ever increasing reluctance from the thought that soon
she must bring herself to look again upon his dark but
handsome face.
Luttrell, too—she must meet him—and, with such
swollen eyes and pallid cheeks—the bare idea brings
a little colour into her white face.
As eight o'clock strikes she rises languidly from
her bed, dressed as she is, disrobing hurriedly, lest
even her woman should guess how wakeful she has
been, throws open her window, and lets the pure cold
air beat upon her features.
But when Sarah comes she is not deceived. So
distressed is she at her young mistress's appearance
that she almost weeps aloud, and gives it as her
opinion that balls and all such nocturnal entertain-
ments are the invention of the enemy.

At breakfast Molly is very pale, and speaks little.
She toys with her toast, but cannot eat. Being ques-
tioned, she confesses herself fatigued, not being ac-
customed to late hours.
She neither looks at Luttrell nor does he seek to
attract her attention in any way.
“A good long walk will refresh you more than
anything," says Talbot Lowry, who has been spending
the past few days at Herst. He addresses Molly, but
his eyes seek Cecil's as he does so, in the fond
hope that she will take his hint and come with him
for a similar refresher to that he has prescribed for
Molly.
Cecil's unfortunate encouragement of the night be-
fore--displayed more with a view to chagrining Sir
Penthony than from a mere leaning towards coquetry
-has fanned his passion to a very dangerous height.
He is consumed with a desire to speak, and madly
flatters himself that there is undoubted hope for him.
To throw himself at Lady Stafford's feet, declare
his love, and ask her to leave, for him, a husband
who has never been more to her than an ordinary
acquaintance, and to renounce a name that can have
no charms for her, being devoid of tender recollections
or sacred memories, seems to him, in his present

overstrained condition, a very light thing indeed. In
return, he argues feverishly, he can give her the entire
devotion of a heart, and, what is perhaps a more
practical offer, a larger income than she can now
command.
Then, in the present day, what so easily, or quietly,
or satisfactorily arranged as a divorce in high life,
leaving behind it neither spot nor scar, nor anything
unpleasant in the way of social ostracism? And this
might—nay, should follow.
Like Molly he has lain awake since early dawn
arranging plans and rehearsing speeches; and now,
after breakfast, as he walks beside the object of his
adoration through the shrubberies and outer walks
into the gardens beyond, carried away by the innate
vanity of him, and his foolish self-esteem, and not
dreaming of defeat, he decides that the time has come
to give voice to his folly.
They are out of view of the windows, when he
stops abruptly and says rashly—with a pale face, it is
true, but a certain amount of composure that bespeaks
confidence: “Cecil, I can keep silence no longer.
Let me speak to you, and tell you all that is in my
heart."
“He has fallen in love with Molly," thinks Cecil,
wondering vaguely at the manner of his address, he
having never attempted to call her by her Christian
name before.
“You are in love?" she says kindly, but rather
uncertainly, not being able at the moment to call to
mind any tender glances of his cast at Molly or any
suspicious situations that might confirm her in her
fancy.

“Need you ask?” says Lowry, taking her hand,
feeling still further emboldened by the gentleness with
which she has received his first advance. “Have not
all these months, nay, this year past, taught you so
much?”
“This year past?!” Cecil repeats, honestly at sea,
and too much surprised by the heat of his manner to
grasp at once the real meaning of his words. Though
I think a second later a faint inkling of it comes to
her, because she releases her hand quickly from his
clasp and her voice takes a sharper tone. “I do not
understand you,” she says. “Take care you under-
stand-yourself.”
But the warning comes too late. Lowry, bent on
his own destruction, goes on vehemently:
“I do—too well. Have I not had time to learn
it?” he says passionately. “Have I not spent every
day, every hour, in thoughts of you? Have I not
lived in anticipation of our meeting? While you,
Cecil, surely you, too, were glad when we were to-
gether. The best year I have ever known has been
this last, in which I have grown to-love you."
"Pray cease,” says Cecil hurriedly, stepping back
and raising her hand imperiously. “What can you
mean? You must be out of your senses to speak to
me like this.”
Although angry she is calm, and, indeed, scarcely
cares to give way to indignation before Lowry, whom
she has always looked upon with great kindness, and
rather in the light of a boy. She is a little sorry for
him too that he should have chosen to make a fool of
himself with her, who, she cannot help feeling, is his
best friend. For to all the moodiness and oddity of

his nature she has been singularly lenient, bearing
with him when others would have lost all patience.
And this is her reward.
For a full minute Lowry seems confounded. Then
“I must indeed be bereft of reason," he says, in a low,
intense voice, “if I am to believe that you can receive
like this the assurance of my love. It cannot be alto-
gether such a matter of wonder—my infatuation for
you—as you would have me think, considering how
you”-in a rather choked tone—“led me on.”
“ Led you on!' My dear Mr. Lowry, how can
you talk so foolishly? I certainly thought I knew you
very well, and”-docketting off each item on her
fingers—“I let you run my messages now and then;
and I danced with you; and you sent me the loveliest
flowers in London or out of it; and you were ex-
tremely kind to me on all occasions; but then so
many other men were kind also, that really beyond
the flowers” —going back to her second finger-
“(which were incomparably finer than those I ever re-
ceived from anyone else), I don't see that you were
more to me than the others.”
“Will you not listen to me? Will you not even
let me plead my cause?”
“Certainly not, considering what a cause it is.
You must be mad."
“You are cold as ice," says he, losing his head.
“No other woman but yourself would consent to live
as you do. A wife, and yet no wife!”
“Mr. Lowry,” says Lady Stafford with much dignity
but perfect temper, "you forget yourself. I must really
beg you not to discuss my private affairs. The life I
lead might not suit you or any single one of your ac-

quaintance, but it suits me, and that is everything.
You say I am "cold,' and you are right—I am. I
fancied (wrongly) my acknowledged coldness would
have prevented such a scene as I have been forced to
listen to, by you, to-day. You are the first who has
ever dared to insult me. You are, indeed, the first
man who has ever been at my feet, metaphorically
speaking or otherwise; and I sincerely trust,"
Lady Stafford, with profound earnestness, "you may
be the last, for anything more unpleasant I never ex-
perienced.”
"Have you no pity for me?” cries he passionately.
“Why need you scorn my love? Every word you
utter tears my heart, and you—you care no more than
if I were a dog! Have you no feeling? Do you never
wish to be as other women are, beloved and loving,
instead of being, as now--
“Again, sir, I must ask you to allow my private
life to be private,” says Cecil, still with admirable
temper, although her colour has faded a good deal,
and the fingers of one hand have closed convulsively
upon a fold of her dress. “I may, perhaps, pity you,
but I can feel nothing but contempt for the love you
offer, that would lower the thing it loves!”
“Not lower it,” says he quickly, grasping eagerly
at what he vainly hopes is a last chance. “Under the
circumstances a divorce could be easily obtained. If
you would trust yourself to me there should be no
delay. You might easily break this marriage tie that
can scarcely be considered binding.”
"And supposing-I do not wish to break it? How
then? But enough of this. I cannot listen any longer.

an old
I have heard too much already. I must really ask you
to leave me. Go."
"Is this how your friendships end!” asks he bit-
terly. “Will you deny I was even so much to you?”
“Certainly not. Though I must add that had I
known my friendship with you would have put me in
the way of receiving so much insult as I have received
to-day you should never have been placed upon my
list. Let me pray you to go away now, to leave Herst
entirely for the present, because it would be out of
the question my seeing you again--at least until time
has convinced you of your folly. You are
friend, Talbot, and I would willingly try and forget all
that has happened to-day, or at all events to remember
it only as a passing madness.”
“Am I a boy, a fool, that you speak to me like
this?” cries he, catching her hand to detain her as
she moves away. “And why do you talk of 'insult'?
I only urge you to exchange indifference for love-
the indifference of a husband who cares no more for
you than for the gravel at your feet.”
“And pray, sir, by what rule do you measure the
amount of my regard for Lady Stafford?” exclaims Sir
Penthony, walking through an open space in the privet
hedge that skirts this corner of the garden, where he
has been spellbound for the last two minutes. A
short time, no doubt, though a great deal can be said
in it.
He is positively livid, and has his eyes fixed, not
on his enemy, but on his wife.
Lowry changes colour, but gives way not an inch;
he also tightens his grasp on Cecil's unwilling hand,
and throws up his head defiantly.

“Let my wife's hand go directly,” says Stafford, in
a low but furious tone, advancing.
By a quick movement Cecil wrenches herself free
and gets between the two men. She does not fling
herself, she simply gets there, almost-as it seems—
without moving.
“Not another word, Sir Penthony," she says quietly.
“I forbid it. I will have no scene. Mr. Lowry has
behaved foolishly, but I desire that nothing more be
said about it. Go”-turning to Lowry, who is frown-
ing ominously, and pointing imperiously to a distant
gate—“and do as I asked you a few moments since
-leave Herst without delay.”
So strong is her determination to avoid an esclandre,
and so masterly is her manner of carrying out her
will, that both men instinctively obey her. Sir Pen-
thony lowers his eyes and shifts his aggressive posi-
tion; Lowry, with bent head, and without another
word, walks away from her down the garden-path out
of the gate, and disappears—for years.
When he has quite gone Sir Penthony turns
to her.
“Is this the way you amuse yourself?” he asks in
a compressed voice.
“Do not reproach me," murmurs she hurriedly;
“I could not bear it now.” She speaks clearly, but her
tone has lost its firmness, because of the little tremor
that runs through it, while her face is white as one of
the pale blossoms she holds within her hand. “Be-
sides, it is not deserved. Were you long here before
you spoke?"
“Long enough.” With a world of meaning in his
tone.

“Then you heard my exculpation. “Cold as ice,'
he called me. And he was right. As I am to you,
Sir Penthony, so am I to all men. No, one yet has
touched my heart.
“For myself I can answer," replies he bitterly;--
“but for the others-2"
“Not another word," she breaks in vehemently.
“Do not say-do not even hint at what I might find
it impossible to forgive. Not even to you will I seek
to justify myself on such a point. And you," she
says, tears of agitation, arising from all she has under-
gone, mingled with much pent-up wounded feeling,
coming thickly into her eyes, “you should be the last
to blame me for what has happened, when you re-
member who it was placed me in such a false position
as makes men think they may say to me what they
choose."
“You are unjust," he answers, nearly as white as
herself. “I only followed out your wishes. It was your
own arrangement; I but acceded to it."
“You should not have done so,"
,” cries she, with
subdued excitement. “You were a man of the world,
capable of judging; I was a foolish girl, ignorant of
the consequences that must follow on such an act.
Our marriage was a wretched mistake.”
“Cecil, you know you can escape from your false
position as soon as you choose. No one loves you as
I do."
“Impossible.” Coldly. “In this world a thing
once done can never be undone. Have
you
lived so
long without learning that lesson?”
As she speaks she turns from him, and, walking
quickly away, leaves him alone in the garden. Mucb

as he has grown to love her, never until now has the
very tenderness of affection touched him-now, when
the laughter-loving Cecil has changed for him into the
feeling, accusing woman; although a woman dead
to him, with a heart locked carefully, lest he should
enter in.
How can he tell, as she goes so proudly along the
garden-path, that her bosom is heaving with shame
and unconfessed longing, and that down her cheeks-
so prone to dimple with joyous laughter--the bitter
tears are falling?
Almost as she reaches the house she encounters
Tedcastle, and turns hastily aside, lest he should mark
the traces of her recent weeping. But so bent is he
on his own dismal thoughts that he heeds her not, but
follows aimlessly the path before him that leads to the
balcony from which the smaller drawing-room may be
reached
He is depressed and anxious, the night's vigil hav-
ing induced him to believe himself somewhat hasty in
his condemnation of Molly. As he gains the boudoir
he starts, for there in the room, with the light flashing
warmly on her, stands Molly Bawn alone.
She is dressed in a long trailing gown of black
velveteen; an inexpensive dress, but one that suits her
admirably, with its slight adornments of little soft lace
frillings at the throat and wrists.
Pausing irresolutely, Luttrell makes as though he
would retrace his steps.
“Do not go,” says Molly's voice, clear and firm.
“As you are here I wish to speak to you.”
She beckons him to come a little nearer to her,
and silently he obeys the gesture. There is a small

round table between them, upon which Molly is lean-
ing rather heavily. As he approaches, however, and
waits, gazing curiously at her for her next word, she
straightens herself and compels her eyes to meet his.
“Here is your ring,” she says, drawing the glitter-
ing treasure from her finger and placing it before
him.
There is not the extremest trace of excitement or
feeling of any kind in her tone. Luttrell, on the con-
trary, shrinks as though touched by fire.
“Keep it,” he says involuntarily, colouring darkly,
“No-no.”
“Why?” he urges. “It will not hurt you, and”-
with a quickly suppressed sigh—“it may perhaps
compel you to think of me now and then.”
“I have neither wish nor desire ever to think of
you again,” returns she, still in the same cold, even
tone, pushing the ring still closer to him with her first
finger. There is something of contempt in the action.
A ray from the dancing sun outside falls through the
glass on to the diamonds, making them flash and
sparkle in their gold setting.
“That admits of no answer," says Luttrell with low
but passionate bitterness; and, taking up the ring, he
flings it lightly into the very heart of the glowing fire.
With a sudden loss of self-restraint Molly makes a
movement forward as though to prevent him; but too
late—already the greedy flames have closed upon it.
Not all the agitation, not all his angry words of the
night before, have affected her so keenly as this last
act. She bursts into a very storm of tears.
“Oh! what have you done?” cries she. “You
have destroyed it; you have burned it-my pretty ring!”


## p. 125 (#131) ############################################

MOLLY BAWN.
125
She clasps her hands together and gazes with
straining eyes into the cruel fire. Something within
her heart feels broken. Surely some string has
snapped. The ring, in spite of all, was a last link
between them; and now too it has gone.
“Molly!" says he, taking a step towards her, and
holding out his hands, softened, vanquished by her
tears, ready to throw himself once more an abject slave
at her feet.
“Do not speak to me," returns she, still sobbing
bitterly. “Have you not done enough? I wish you
would leave me to myself. Go away. There is no-
thing more that you can do."
Feeling abashed, he scarcely knows why, he silently
quits the room.
Then down upon her knees before the fire falls
Molly, and with the poker strives with all her might to
discover some traces of her lost treasure. So diligent
is her search that after a little while the ring, blackened,
disfigured, altered almost beyond recognition, lies within
her hand. Still it is her ring, however changed, and
some small ray of comfort gladdens her heart.
She is still, however, weeping bitterly, and examin-
ing sadly the precious relic she has rescued from utter
oblivion, and from which the diamond soiled, but still
brilliant, has fallen into her palm, when Philip enters.
“Molly, what has happened?” he asks, advancing
towards her, shocked at her appearance, which evinces
all the deepest signs of woe. “What has distressed
you?"
“You have,” cries she, with sudden vehement pas-
sion, all her sorrow and anger growing into quick life
as she sees him. “You are the cause of all my misery.

Why do you come near me? You might at least have
grace enough to spare me the pain of seeing you.”
“I do not understand," he says, his face very pale.
“In how have I offended-I, who would rather be dead
than cause you any unhappiness? Tell me how I have
been so unfortunate.”
"I hate you," she says, with almost childish cruelty,
sobbing afresh. “I wish you had died before I came
to this place. You have come between me and the
only man I love. Yes"-smiting her hands together in
a very agony of sorrow—"he may doubt it if he will,
but I do love him—and now we are separated for ever.
Even my ring"_with a sad glance at it—“is broken,
and so is—my heart.”
“You are alluding to—Luttrell?” asks he—his
earliest suspicions at last confirmed-speaking with
difficulty, so dry his lips have grown.
"I am.
“And how have I interfered between you and-
him?"
“Why did you speak to me of love again last
night,” retorts she, “when you must know how detest-
able a subject it is to me? He saw you put your arm
around me; he saw-ah! why did I not tell you then
the truth (from which through a mistaken feeling of
pity I refrained), that your mere touch sickened me?
Then you stooped, and he thought-you know what he
thought-and yet,” cries Molly, with a gesture of
aversion, “how could he have thought it possible that
I should allow you of all men to~kiss me?"
“Why speak of what I so well know?” interrupts
he hoarsely, with bent head and averted eyes. “You
seldom spare me. You are angered, and for what?

She pauses.
Because you still hanker after a man who flung you
away-you, for whose slightest wish I would risk my
all. For a mere chimera, a fancy, a fear only half-
developed, he renounced you."
"Say nothing more," says Molly, with pale lips and
eyes large and dark through regretful sorrow; “not
another word. I think he acted rightly. He thought
I was false, and so thinking he was right to renounce.
I do not say this in his defence or because-
or for
any reason only—-"
“Why not continue? Because you-love him still.”
“Well, and why not?” says Molly. “Why should I
deny my love for him? Can any shame be connected
with it? Yes," murmurs she, her sweet eyes filling with
tears, her small clasped hands trembling, “though he
and I can never be more to each other than we now
are, I tell you I love him as I never have and never
shall love again."
“It is a pity that such love as yours should have
no better return,” says he, with an unlovely laugh.
“Luttrell appears to bear his fate with admirable
equanimity.”
"You are incapable of judging such a nature as
his," returns she disdainfully. “He is all that is gentle,
and true, and noble; while you--"
abruptly, causing a pause that is more eloquent than
words, and, with a distant bow, hurries from the

room.
Philip's star to-day is not in the ascendant. Even
as he stands crushed by Molly's bitter reproaches,
Marcia, with her heart full of a settled revenge towards
him, is waiting outside her grandfather's door for per-
mission to enter.

That unlucky shadow of a kiss last night has done
as much mischief as a half a dozen real kisses. It
had convinced Marcia of the truth of that which for
weeks she has been vainly struggling to disbelieve,
namely, Philip's mad infatuation for Molly.
Now all doubt is at an end, and in its place has
fallen a despair more terrible than any uncertainty.
All the anguish of a heart rejected, that is still
compelled to live on loving its rejector, has been hers
for the past two months, and it has told upon her
slowly but surely. She is strangely altered. Dark hollows
lie beneath her eyes, that have grown almost unearthly
in expression, so large are they, and so sombre is the
fire that burns within them. There is a compression
about the lips that has grown habitual; small lines mar
the whiteness of her forehead, while amongst her raven
tresses, did any one mark them closely enough, fine
threads of silver may be traced.
Pacing up and down her room the night before,
with widely-opened eyes, gazing upon the solemn black-
ness that surrounds her, all the wrongs and slights she
has endured come to her with startling distinctness.
No sense of weariness, no thought of a necessity for
sleep disturbs her reverie or breaks in upon the
monotonous misery of her musings. She is past all
that. Already her death has come to her-
-a death
to her hope, and joy, and peace- even to that poor
calm that goes so far to deceive the outer world.
O the cold, quiet night, when speech is not and
sleep has forgotten us; when all the doubts, and fears,
and jealousies that in the blessed daylight slumber,
rise up to torture us! when even the half-suspected
sneer, the covert neglect that some hours ago were but

as faintest pinpricks, now gall and madden as a poi-
soned thrust!
A wild thirst for revenge grows within her breast
as one by one she calls to mind all the many injuries
she has received. Strangely enough—and unlike a
woman--her anger is concentrated on Philip, rather
than on the one he loves, instinct telling her he is not
beloved in return.
She broods upon her wrongs until, as the first
bright streak of yellow day illumes the room, flinging
its glories profusely upon the wall and ceiling, pretty
nicknacks that return its greeting, and angry, unthank-
ful creature alike, a thought comes to her that pro-
mises to amply satisfy her vengeful craving. As she
ponders on it a curious light breaks upon her face-a
smile, half-triumph, half-despair.
Now, standing before her grandfather's room, with
a folded letter crushed within her palm, and a heart
that beats almost to suffocation, she hears him bid her
enter.
Fatigued by the unusual exertions of a ball, Mr.
Amherst is seated at his table in a lounging-chair,
clad in his dressing-gown, and looking older, feebler
than is his wont.
He merely glances at his visitor as she approaches
without comment of any description.
“I have had something on my mind for some time,
grandpapa," begins Marcia, who is pale and worn,
through agitation and the effects of a long and hopeless
vigil. "I think it only right to let you know. I have
suppressed it all this time, because I feared distressing
you, but now—now—will you read this?”

She hands him as she speaks the letter received
by Philip two months before relative to his unlucky
dealings with some London Jews.
In silence Mr. Amherst reads it; in silence re-reads
it; and finally, folding it up again, places it within his
desk.
“You and Philip have quarrelled?” he says pre-
sently, in a quiet tone.
“No, there has been no quarrel.”
“Your engagement is at an end?”
“Yes."
“And is this the result of last night's vaunted plea-
sures?" asks he keenly. “Have you snatched only
pain and a sense of failure from its fleeting hours?
And Eleanor, too-she was pale at luncheon, and for
once silent-has she too found her coveted fruit rotten
at its core? It is the universal law,” says the old man
grimly, consoling himself with a pinch of snuff taken
with much deliberation from an exquisite Louis Quinze
box that rests at his elbow, and leaning back languidly
in his chair. “Life is made up of hopes false as the
ignis fatuus. When with the greatest sense of security
and promise of enjoyment we raise and seek to drain
the cup of pleasure, while yet we gaze with longing
eyes upon its sparkling bubbles, and, stooping thirstily,
suffer our expectant lips at length to touch it, lo! it is
then, just as we have attained to the summit of our
bliss, we find our sweetest draught has turned to ashes
in our mouth.”
He stops and drums softly on the table for a mo-
ment or two, while Marcia stands before him silently
pondering

“So Philip is already counting on my death,” he
goes on meditatively, still softly tapping the table.
“How securely he rests in the belief of his succession!
His father's son could scarcely fail to be a spendthrift,
and I will have—no-prodigal—at Herst—to hew-and
cut-and scatter. A goodly heritage truly, as Buscarlet
called it. Be satisfied, Marcia—your revenge is com-
plete. Philip shall not inherit Herst.”
“I do not seek revenge,” says Marcia unsteadily,
now her wish is fulfilled and Philip hopelessly crushed,
a cold, troubled faintness creeping round her heart.
An awful sense of despair, a fruitless longing to recall
her action, makes her tremble. “Only I could not bear
to see you longer deceived—you, after all the care-
the trouble—you bestowed upon him. My conscience
compelled me to tell you all.”
“And you, Marcia”- with an odd smile she is
puzzled to explain—"you have never deceived me,
have you? All your pretty speeches and tender cares
have been quite sincere?”
“Dear grandpapa-yes.”
“You have not wished me dead, or spoken, or
thought evilly of the old tyrant at Herst, who has so
often crossed and thwarted you?”
“Never, dear—how could I—when I remem-
ber--
“Ay, quite so. When one remembers! And grati-
tude is so common a thing. Will you oblige me by
sending a line to Mr. Buscarlet asking him to come to
me without delay?”
“You are going to alter your will?” she asks faintly,
shocked at the speedy success of her scheme.

“Yes." Coolly. “I am going to cut Philip out
of it.”
“Grandpapa, do not be too hard on him," she
says putting her hand across her throat, and almost
gasping. "He is young. Young men sometimes-
“I was once a young man myself, you seem to
forget, and I know all about it. Why did you give me
that letter?” he asks grimly. "Are you chicken-hearted,
now you have done the deed, like all women? It is
too late for remorse to be of use; you have done it.
Let it be your portion to remember how you have wil-
fully ruined his prospects.”
A choking sigh escapes her as she quits the room.
Truly she has bought her revenge dearly. Not the
poorest trace of sweetness lingers in it.
By this time it will be perceived that the house is
in a secret turmoil. Everyone is at daggers drawn
with everyone else. Molly and Lady Stafford have as
yet exchanged no confidences, though keenly desirous
of doing so, each having noticed with the liveliest sur-
misings the depression of the other.
Mr. Potts alone, who is above suspicion (being
one of those cheerful people who never see anything
—no matter how closely under their noses—until it is
brought before them in the broadest language), con-
tinues blissfully unconscious of the confusion that
reigns around, and savours his conversation throughout
the evening with as many embarrassing remarks as he
can conveniently put in.
“Eaten bread is soon forgotten,” says he senten-
tiously during a pause. “You all seem strangely oblivi-
ous of the fact that last night there was a ball in this

house. Why shirk the subject? I like talking," says
Mr. Potts superfluously, "and surely you must all have
something to communicate concerning it. Thanks to
our own exertions, I think it was as good a one as
ever I was at; and the old boy”—I need scarcely say
Mr. Amherst has retired to rest)—"was uncommon de-
cent about giving us the best champagne.”
“You took very good care to show him how you
appreciated his hospitality," says Sir Penthony mildly.
“Well, why shouldn't I do honour to the occasion?
A ball at Herst don't come every day. As a rule, an
affair of the kind at a country house is a failure, as
the guests quarrel dreadfully amongst themselves next
day; but ours has been a brilliant exception."
“Brilliant indeed,” says Lady Stafford demurely.
“But what became of Lowry?” demands this
wretched young man, who has never yet learned that
silence is golden. “He told me this morning he in-
tended staying on until the end of the week, and off
he goes to London by the mid-day train without a
word of warning. Must have heard some unpleasant
news, I shouldn't wonder, he looked so awfully cut up.
Did he tell you anything about it?” To Lady Staf-
ford.
“No.” In a freezing tone. “I see no reason why
I in particular should be bored by Mr. Lowry's private
woes.”
“Well, you were such a friend, you know, for one
thing," says Potts, surprised, but obtuse as ever.
“So I am of yours; but I sincerely trust the fact
of my being so will not induce you to come weeping
to me whenever you chance to lose your heart or place
all your money on the wrong
horse."

“Did he lose his money, then?”
“Plantagenet, dancing has muddled your brain.
How should I know whether he lost his money or not?
I am merely supposing. You are dull to-night. Come
and play a game at ecarté with me, to see if it may
rouse you."
They part for the night rather earlier than usual,
pleading fatigue-all except Mr. Potts, who declares
himself fresh as a daisy, and proposes an impromptu
dance in the ballroom. He is instantly snubbed, and
retires gracefully, consoling himself with the reflection
that he has evidently more “go” in his little finger
than they can boast in their entire bodies.
Sir Penthony having refused to acknowledge his
wife's parting salutation—meant to conciliate-Cecil
retires to her room in a state of indignation and sor-
row that reduces her presently to tears.
Her maid, entering just as she has reached the
very highest pinnacle of her wrongs, receives anything
but a warm reception.
“How now, Trimmins? Did I ring?" asks she
with unwonted sharpness, being unpleasantly mindful
of the redness of her eyes.
“No, my lady; but I thought--"
“Never think," says Cecil, interrupting her with
unreasoning irritation.
“No, my lady. I only thought perhaps you would
see Miss Massereene," persists Trimmins meekly. “She
wishes to know, with her love, if you can receive her
now.”
“Miss Massereene? Of course I can.
you not say so before?”
“Your ladyship scarcely gave me time,” says Trim-

mins demurely, taking an exhaustive survey of her
cambric apron.
“True; I was hasty," Cecil acknowledges in her
impulsive, honest, haughty way. “Tell Miss Massereene
I shall be delighted to see her at once.”
Presently Molly enters, her eyelids pink, the corners
of her mouth forlornly curved—a general despondency
in her whole demeanour.
Cecil, scarcely more composed, advances to meet
her.
"Why, Molly!" she says, pathetically.
“You have been crying!” says Molly, in the same
breath, throwing herself into her arms.
"I have indeed, my dear," confesses Cecil, in a
lachrymose tone, and then she begins to cry again, and
Molly follows suit, and for the next five minutes they
have a very comfortable time of it together.
Then they open their hearts to each other and
relate fluently, as only a woman can, all the intolerable
wrongs and misjudgments they have undergone at the
hands of their lovers.
“To accuse me of anything so horrible!” says Molly
indignantly. “Oh, Cecil! I don't believe he could
care for me one bit and suspect me of it."
“Care for you!' Nonsense, my dear, he adores
you. That is precisely why he has made such a fool
of himself. You know-
Trifles, light as air,
Are, to the jealous, confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ.
I like a man to be jealous—in reason. Though when

Talbot at a bite, I confess I could gladly have dis-
pensed with the quality in him. You should have
seen his face—for once I was honestly frightened.”
“Poor Cecil! it must have been a shock. And
all because that tiresome young man wouldn't go
away."
“Just so. All might have been well had he only
seen things in a reasonable light. Oh, I was so angry!
The most charming of your charms, Molly," says Cecil
warmly, “is your ability to sympathise with one. You
can feel so thoroughly with and for one; and you
never season your remarks with unpalatable truths.
You 'never say, 'I told you so,' or 'I knew how it
would be,' or 'Didn't I warn you?' or anything else
equally objectionable. I really would rather a person
boxed my ears outright than give way to such phrases
as those, pretending they know all about a catastrophe,
after it has happened. And," says her ladyship, with
a pensive sigh, "you might perhaps (had you so
chosen) have accused me of flirting a leetle bit with
that stupid Talbot."
“Well, indeed, perhaps I might, dear," says Molly
innocently.
“What, are you going to play the traitor after all
that flattery? And if so, what am I to say to you
about your disgraceful encouragement of Captain Shad-
well?”
“I wonder if I did encourage him?” says Molly
contritely. “At first, perhaps, unconsciously, but lately
I am sure I didn't. Do you know, Cecil, I positively
dislike him? he is so dark and silent, and still per-
sistent. But when a man keeps on saying he is miser-

able for love of you, and that you are the cause of all
his distress, and that he would as soon be dead as
alive, because you cannot return his affection, how can
one help feeling a little sorry for him?"
“I don't feel in the least sorry for Talbot. I
thought him extremely unpleasant and impertinent,
and I hope with all my heart he is very unhappy to-
night, because it will do him good.”
“Cecil, how cruel you are!"
“Well, by what right does he go about making
fierce love to married women, compelling them to
listen to his nonsense whether they like it or not, and
getting them into scrapes? I don't break my heart
over Sir Penthony, but I certainly do not wish him to
think badly of me."
“At least," says Molly, relapsing again into the
blues, "you have this consolation-you cannot lose Sir
Penthony."
“That might also be looked on as a disadvantage.
Still, I suppose there is some benefit to be gained
from my position,” says Cecil meditatively. “My lover
(if, indeed, he is my lover) cannot play the false
knight with me; I defy him to love—and to ride away.
There are no breakers ahead for me. He is mine
irrevocably-no matter how horribly he may desire to
escape.
But
you need not envy me; it is sweeter to
be as you are to know him yours without the shadow
of a tie. He is not lost to you.”
"Effectually. What! do you think I would submit
to be again engaged to a man who could fling me off
for a chimera, a mere trick of the imagination? If he
were to beg my pardon on his knees--if he were to

acknowledge every word he said to me a lie~I would
not look at him again.”
“I always said your pride would be your bane,"
says Cecil reprovingly. “Now, just think how far
happier you would be if you were friends with him
again, and think of nothing else. What is pride in
comparison with comfort?
"Have you forgiven Sir Penthony?"
“Freely. But he won't forgive me.”
"Have you forgiven him the first great crime of all
-his indifference towards his bride?"
“N-0," confesses her ladyship, smiling, "not yet."
“Ah! then don't blame me. I could have killed
myself when I cried,” says Molly, referring again to the
past, with a little angry shiver, “but I felt so sorry for
my poor, pretty, innocent ring. And he looked so
handsome, so determined, when he flung it in the fire,
with his eyes quite dark, and his figure drawn up; and
-and-I could not help wondering," says Molly, with
a little tremble in her tone, “who next would love
him—and who-he-would love."
“I never thought you were so fond of him,
dearest,” says Cecil, laying her hand softly on her
friend's.
“Nor I-until I lost him," murmurs poor Molly,
with a vain attempt at composure.
Two tears fall
heavily into her lap--a sob escapes her.
“Now you are going to cry again," interposes
Cecil, with hasty but kindly warning. “Don't. He is
not going to fall in love with anyone so long as you
are single, take my word for it. Nonsense, my dear,
cheer yourself with the certainty that he is at this very
moment eating his heart out, because he knows better

than I do that though there may be many women
there is only one Molly Bawn in the world.”
This reflection, although consolatory, has not the
desired effect. Instead of drying her eyes and declar-
ing herself glad that Luttrell is unhappy, Molly grows
more and more afflicted every moment.
“My dear girl," exclaims Lady Stafford, as a last
resource, "do pray think of your complexion. I have
finished crying-I shall give way to crying no more,
because I wish to look my best to-morrow, to let him
see what a charming person he has chosen to quarrel
with. And my tears are not so destructive as yours,
because mine arise from vexation-yours from feel-
ing.”
"I hardly know," says Molly, with an attempt at
nonchalance she is far from feeling, “I really think I
cried more for my diamond than for-my lover. How-
ever, I shall take your advice: I shall think no more
about it. To-morrow"-rising and running to the
glass, and pushing back her disordered hair from her
face, that is lovely in spite of marring tears—“to-
morrow I shall be gayer, brighter than he has ever yet
What! shall I let him think I fret because
of him? He saw me once in tears; he shall not see
me so again.”
“What a pity it is grief should be so unbecoming!”
says Cecil, laughing. “I always think what a guy
Niobe must have been if she was indeed 'all tears.'
“The worst thing about crying, I think," says Molly,
“is the fatal desire one feels to blow one's nose-that
is the horrid part of it. I knew I was looking odious
all the time I was weeping over my ring, and that
added to my discomfort. By-the-by, Cecil, what were
seen me.

MOLLY BAWN,
you doing at the table with a pencil just before we
broke up to-night? Sir Penthony was staring at you
fixedly all through-wondering, I am sure, at your oc-
cupation, as, to tell the truth, was I.”
“Nothing very remarkable. I was inditing a 'son-
net to your eyebrow,' or rather to your lids, they were
so delicately tinted, and were so much in unison with
the extreme dejection of your entire bearing. I con-
fess, unkind as it may sound, they moved me to
laughter. Ah! that reminds me," says Cecil, her ex-
pression changing to one of comical terror, as she
tsarts to her feet, “Plantagenet came up at the mo-
ment, and lest he should see my composition I hid it
within the leaves of the blotting-book. There it is
still, no doubt. What shall I do if anyone finds it in
the morning? I shall be read out of meeting, as I
have an indistinct idea that, with a view to making
you laugh, I rather caricatured everyone in the room
more or less."
“Shall I run down for it?” says Molly. “I won't
be a moment, and you are quite undressed. In the
blotting-book, you said? I shan't be any time.”
“Unless the ghosts detain you."
“Or, what would be much worse, any of our
friends."

CHAPTER IX.
A single stream of all her soft brown hair
Pour'd on one side.
Half light, half shade
She stood, a sight to make an old man young.
Gardener's Daughter.
THRUSTING her little bare feet into her slippers,
she takes up a candle and walks softly down the stairs,
past the smoking and billiard rooms, into the drawing-
room, where the paper has been left.
All the lamps have been extinguished, leaving the
apartment, which is immense, steeped in darkness.
Coming into it from the brilliantly lighted hall outside,
with only a candle in her hand, the gloom seems even
greater, and overcomes her sight to such a degree that
she has traversed at least one half its length before
she discovers she is not its only occupant.
Seated before a writing-table, with his hand, in-
deed, upon the very blotting-book she seeks, and with
only another candle similar to hers to lend him light,
sits Luttrell.
As her eyes meet his she starts, colours violently,
and is for the moment utterly abashed.
Involuntarily she glances down at the soft blue
dressing-gown she wears, over which her hair
brushed and arranged for the night — falls in soft,
rippling, gold-brown masses, and from thence to the
little naked feet that peep out shamelessly from their
blue slippers

The crimson blood rises to her face. Covered with
a painful though pretty confusion she stands quite still
and lets her telltale eyes seek the ground.
Luttrell has risen, and without any particular
design has advanced towards her. Perhaps the force
of habit compels him to do so, perhaps intense and
not altogether welcome surprise. For the future to see
her is but to add one more pang to his intolerable
regret.
“I was writing to you," he says, indicating, with a
slight movement of the hand, the chair on which he
has been sitting, and thus breaking the awful silence
which threatens to last until next day, so mute has
Molly grown.
With a delicate sense of chivalry he
endeavours to appear oblivious of her rather scanty
and disconcerting-however becoming--costume. “But
as it is perhaps I may as well say to you what is on
my mind—if you will permit me.'
"I cannot forbid your speech." Coldly.
“I will not keep you long.
But”-with a slight,
almost imperceptible, glance at her dressing-gown-
"perhaps you are in a hurry?”
"I am-rather.” At this juncture, had they been
friends, Molly would undoubtedly have laughed. As
it is she is profoundly serious. “Still, if it is anything
important I will hear you.”
“Can I do anything for you?” asks he, hesitating,
evidently fearing to approach the desired subject.
“Nothing, thank you. I came only for a paper-
left in the blotting-book. If you wish to speak do so
quickly, as I must go.” Then, as he still hesitates,
“Why do you pause?”
"Because I fear incurring your displeasure once

again; and surely the passages between us have been
bad enough already."
“Do not fear.” Coldly. “It is no longer in your
power to wound me.”
“True. I should not have allowed that fact to
escape me. Yet hear me. It is my love urges me on.”
“Your-love!” With slow and scornful disbelief.
“Yes—mine. In spite of all that has come and
gone you know me well enough to understand how
dear you still are to me. No, you need not say a
word: I can see by your face that you will never
pardon. There is no greater curse than to love a
woman who gives one but bare tolerance in return.”
“Why did you not think of all this while there was
yet time?"
“One drifts-until it is too late to seek for re-
medies. My heaviest misfortune lies in the fact that
I cannot root you from my heart.”
“A terrible misfortune, no doubt"-with a little
angry flash from her azure eyes—“but one that time
will cure.”
“Will it?” Wistfully. "Shall I indeed learn to
forget you, Molly—to look back upon my brief but
happy past as an idle dream? I hardly hope so
much.”
“And would you waste all your best days?” asks
she, in tones that tremble ever such a little, “in think-
ing of me? Remember all you said—all you meant-
how, 'thankful you were to find me out in time.""
“And will you condemn for ever because of a few
words spoken in a moment of despair and terrible dis-
appointment?” pleads he. “I acknowledge my fault.
I was wrong—I was too hasty. I behaved like a brute,

if you will; but then I believed I had grounds for fear.
When once I saw your face, heard your voice, looked
into your eyes, I knew how false my accusations were;
but it was then too late."
“Too late indeed.”
“How calmly you can say it!” With exquisite
reproach. “Have five minutes blotted out five months?
Did you know all the anguish I endured on seeing
you with Shadwell—I think you might forgive."
“I might. But I could not forget. Would I again
consent to be at the mercy of one who without a
question pronounced me guilty? A thousand times
no!”
“Say at once you are glad to be rid of me,” breaks
he in bitterly, stung by her persistent coldness.
“You are forgetting your original purpose," she
says, after a slight pause, declining to notice his last
remark. “Was there not something you wished to say
to me?"
“Yes.” Rousing himself with an impatient sigh.
“Molly”_blanching a little, and trying to read her
face, with all his heart in his eyes—"are you going to
marry Shadwell?”
Molly colours richly (a rare thing with her), grows
pale again, clasps and unclasps her slender fingers
nervously, before she makes reply. A prompting to-
wards mischief grows within her, together with a sense
of anger that he should dare put such a question to
her under existing circumstances.
“I cannot see by what right you put to me such
a question-now," she says at length haughtily. “My
affairs can no longer concern you.”

trell, wishing with all his heart he knew something vile

of your insinuations."
“You defend him?” cries Luttrell vehemently.
“Does that mean that you already love him? It is
impossible! In a few short weeks to forget all the
vows we interchanged, all the good days we spent at
Brooklyn, before ever we came to this accursed place!
There at least you liked me well enough—you were

"I shall tell you nothing. You have no right to

you-jilted me?” She speaks bitterly, and turns from
him with an unlovely laugh.

MOLLY BAWN,
"Let my
go,
“Molly,” cries the young man in low tones, full of
passion, catching her hand, all the violent emotion he
has been so painfully striving to suppress since her
entrance breaking loose now, “listen to me for one
moment. Do not kill me. My whole heart is bound
up in you. You are too young to be so cruel. Dar-
ling, I was mad when I deemed I could live without
you. I have been mad ever since that fatal hour last
night. Will you forgive me? Will you?”
hand Mr. Luttrell,” says the girl, with
a quick, dry sob. Is it anger, or grief, or pride? “You
had me once, and you would not keep me. You shall
never again have the chance of throwing me over-be
assured of that."
She draws her fingers from his burning clasp and
once more turns away, with her eyes bent carefully
upon the carpet, lest he shall notice the tears that
threaten to overflow them. She walks resolutely but
slowly past where he is standing, with folded arms,
leaning against the wall, towards the door.
Just as her fingers close on the handle she be-
comes aware of footsteps on the outside coming lei-
surely towards her.
Instinctively she shrinks backward, casts a hasty,
horrified glance at her dressing-gown, her bare feet,
her loosened hair; then, with a movement full of con-
fidence mingled with fear, she hastens back to Luttrell
(who too has heard the disconcerting sound) and
glances up at him appealingly.
“There is somebody coming,” she breathes in a
terrified whisper.
The footsteps come nearer-nearer still; they reach

the very threshold, and then pause. Will their owner
come in?
In the fear, and agony, and doubt of the moment
Molly lays her two white hands upon her bosom and
stands listening intently, with wide-open gleaming eyes,
too frightened to move or make any attempt at con-
cealment; while Luttrell, although alarmed for her,
cannot withdraw his gaze from her lovely face.
Somebody's hand steals along the door as though
searching for the handle. With renewed hope Luttrell
instantly blows out both the candles near him, reduc-
ing the room to utter darkness, and draws Molly be-
hind the window-curtains.
There is a breathless pause.
The door opens
slowly-slowly. With a gasp that can almost be heard
Molly puts out one hand in the darkness and lays it
heavily upon Luttrell's arm. His fingers close over it.
“Hush! not a word,” whispers he.
“Oh, I am so frightened!” returns she.
His heart has begun to beat madly. To feel her
so close to him, although only through unwished-for
accident, is dangerously sweet. By a supreme effort
he keeps himself from taking her in his arms, and giv-
ing her one last embrace—but honour, the hour, the
situation, all alike forbid. So he only tightens his
clasp upon her hand and smothers a sigh between
his lips.
Whoever the intruder may be, he, she, or it is
without light. No truth-compelling ray illumines the
gloom; and presently, after a slight hesitation, the door
is closed again, and they can hear the footsteps go
lightly, cautiously away through the hall, leaving them

once more alone in the long, dark, ghostly drawing-
room.
Molly draws her hand hurriedly away and, moving
quietly from Luttrell's side, breathes a sigh, half-relief,
half-embarrassment; while he, groping his way to the
writing-table, finds a match, and, striking it, throws
light upon the scene again.
At the same moment Molly emerges from the cur-
tains, with a heightened colour, and eyes, sweet but
shamed, that positively refuse to meet his.
“I suppose I can trust you—o—say nothing of all
this?” she murmurs unsteadily.
“I suppose you can." Haughtily.
His heart is still throbbing passionately; almost,
he fears, each separate beat can be heard in the op-
pressive stillness.
“Good night,” says Molly slowly.
“Good night.”
Shyly, and still without meeting his gaze, she holds
out her hand. He takes it, softly, reverently, and,
emboldened by the gentleness of her expression, says
impulsively:
"Answer me a last question, darling-answer me.
Are you going to marry Philip?"
And she answers, also impulsively:
"No."
His face changes; hope once more shines within
his blue eyes.
Involuntarily he draws up his tall,
slight figure to its full height, with a glad gesture that
bespeaks returning confidence; then he glances long-
ingly first at Molly's downcast face, then at the small
hand that lies trembling in his own.
“May I?” he asks; and, receiving no denial, stoops

and kisses it warmly once, twice, thrice with fervent
devotion.
“My dear, how long you have been!” says Cecil,
when at length Molly returns to her room. “I thought
you were never coming. Where have
you
been?”
“In the drawing-room; and, oh, Cecil! he was there.
And he would keep me, asking me question after
question."
"I daresay," says Cecil, looking her over. “That
blue négligé is tremendously becoming. No doubt
he has still a good many more questions he would
like to put to you. And you call yourself a nice,
decorous, well-behaved-"
“Don't be silly. You have yet to hear the 'de-
corous' and thrilling part of my tale. Just as we were
in the middle of a most animated discussion what do
you think happened? Somebody actually came to the
door and tried to open it. In an instant Tedcastle
blew out both our candles and drew me behind the
curtains."
66“Curiouser and curiouser," said Alice.' I begin
to think I'm in Wonderland.
The plot
thickens; the impropriety deepens. It grows more
interesting at every word.”
“The 'somebody,' whoever it was, opened the door,
looked in—fortunately without a light, or we might
have been discovered-and-2"
“You fainted, of course?" says Cecil, who is con-
sumed with laughter.
“No indeed,” answers Molly; “I neither fainted nor
screamed.”
Go on.

“Tut! nonsense. I think nothing of you. Such a
golden opportunity thrown away! In your place I
should have been senseless in half a minute in Ted-
castle's arms."
"Forgive my stupidity. I only turned and caught
hold of Teddy's arm, and held him as though I never
meant to let him go.”
"Perhaps that was your secret wish, were the truth
known. Molly, you are wiser than I am. What is a
paltry fainting fit to the touch of a soft, warm hand?
Go on.”
“Well, the invader, when he had gazed into space,
withdrew again, leaving us to our own devices. Cecil,
if we had been discovered! I in my dressing-gown!
Not all the waters of the Atlantic would have saved
me from censure. I never was so terrified. Who
could it have been?"
“Oh! 'twas I, love;
Wandering by, love,”
declares Cecil, going off into a perfect peal of laughter.
“Never, never have I been so entertained! And so I
frightened you? Well, be comforted. I was terrified
in my turn by your long absence; so much so that,
without a candle, I crept down stairs, stole along the
hall, and looked into the drawing-room. Seeing no
one, I retreated, and gained my own room again as
fast as I could. Oh, how sorry I am I did not know!
Consider your feelings had I stolen quietly towards
your hiding-place step by step! A splendid situation
absolutely thrown away.”
“You and Mr. Potts ought to be brother and sister,

Molly, laughing too.
And then Cecil, declaring it is all hours, turns her
out of her room, and presently sleep falls and settles
upon Herst and all its immates.

Death is here, and death is there;
Death is busy everywhere;
All around, within, beneath,
Above is death-and we are death.
Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar
Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight
No more, O never more.-SHELLEY.
It is just two o'clock, and Sunday. They have all
been to church. They have struggled manfully through
their prayers. They have chanted a depressing psalm
or two to the most tuneless of ancient ditties. They
have even sat out an incomprehensible sermon with
polite gravity and many a weary yawn.
The day is dull. So is the Rector. So is the
Curate—unutterably so.
Service over, they file out again into the open air
in solemn silence, though at heart glad as children who
break school, and wend their way back to Herst through
the dismantled wood.
The trees are nearly naked; a short, sad, consumptive
wind is soughing through them. The grass—what re-
mains of it—is brown, of an unpleasant hue. No flowers
smile up at them as they pass quietly along. The sky
is leaden. There is a general air of despondency over
everything. It is a day laid aside for dismal reflection;
a day on which hateful "might have beens” crop up,
for "melancholy has marked it for its own."

Yet just as they come to a turn in the park two
magpies (harbingers of good when coupled; messengers
of evil when apart) fly past them directly across their
path.
“Two for joy,'” cries Molly gaily, glad of any in-
terruption to her depressing thoughts. “I saw them
first. The luck is mine."
"I think I saw them first,” says Sir Penthony, with
no object beyond a laudable desire to promote argu-
ment.
“Now, how could you?” says Molly. “I am quite
twenty yards ahead of you, and must have seen them
come round this corner first. Now, what shall I get, I
wonder? Something worth getting, I do hope."
“ "Blessed are they that expect nothing, for they
shall not be disappointed,'” says Mr. Potts moodily,
who is as gloomy as the day. “I expect nothing.”
“You are jealous,” retorts Molly. “Sour grapes.”
Making a small moue at him. “But you have no claim
upon this luck; it is all my own. Let nobody for a
moment look upon it as his or hers.”
“You are welcome to it—I don't envy you,” says
Cecil, little thinking how prophetic are her words.
They continue their walk and their interrupted
thoughts—the latter leading them in all sorts of contrary
directions—some to love, some to hate; some to cold
game-pie and dry champagne.
As they enter the hall at Herst one of the foot-
men steps forward and hands Molly an ugly yellow
envelope.
“Why, here is my luck, perhaps!” cries she gaily.
“How soon it has come! Now, what can be in it?
Let us all guess.”

She is surprised, and her cheeks have flushed a
little. Her face is full of laughter. Her sweet eyes
wander from one to another, asking them to join in
her amusement. No thought, no faintest suspicion of
the awful truth occurs to her, although only a thin
piece of paper conceals it from her view.
"A large fortune, perhaps," says Sir Penthony;
while the others close round her, laughing too. Only
Luttrell stands apart, calmly indifferent.
“Or a proposal. That would just suit the rapid
times in which we live."
“I think I would at once accept a man who pro-
posed to me by telegraph,” says Molly with pretty
affectation. “It would show such flattering haste-
such a desire for a kind reply. Remember" —with her
finger under the lap of the envelope—"if the last sur-
mise proves correct I have almost said yes.”
She breaks open the paper, and, smiling still,
daintily unfolds the enclosure.
What a few words!-two or three strokes of the
pen. Yet what a change they make in the beautiful,
dibonnaire countenance! Black as ink they stand out
beneath her stricken eyes. O cruel hand that penned
them so abruptly!
“Come home at once. Make no delay. Your
brother is dead."
Grey as death grows her face; her body turns to
stone. So altered is she in this brief space, that when
she raises her head some shrink away from her, and
some cry out.
"Oh, Molly! what is it?" asks Lady Stafford,
panic-stricken, seizing her by the arm; while Luttrell,

scarcely less white than the girl herself, comes uncon-
sciously forward.
Molly's arms fall to her sides—the telegram flutters
to the floor.
“My brother is dead," she says in a slow, un-
meaning tone.
“He is dead," she says again, in a rather higher,
shriller voice, receiving no response from the awed
group that surrounds her. Their silence evidently
puzzles her. Her large eyes wander helplessly over
all their faces, until at length they fall on Luttrell's.
Here they rest, knowing she has found one that loves
her.
"Teddy-Teddy!” she cries, in an agonised tone
of desolation; then, throwing up her arms wildly to-
wards heaven as though imploring pity, she falls for-
ward senseless into his outstretched arms.
All through the night Cecil Stafford stays with her,
soothing and caressing her as best she can. But all
her soothing and caressing falls on barren soil.
Up and down the room throughout the weary
hours
walks Molly, praying, longing for the daylight; asking
impatiently every now and then if it “will never come."
Surely on earth there is no greater cross to bear than
the passive one of waiting when distress and love call
loudly for assistance.
Her eyes are dry and tearless, her whole body
burns like fire with a dull and throbbing heat. She
is composed but restless.
“Will it soon be day?" she asks Cecil almost every
half-hour with a fierce impatience-her entire being

full of but one idea, which is to reach her home as
soon as possible.
And again:
“If I had not fainted I might have been there now.
Why did I miss that train? Why did you let me
faint?"
In vain Cecil strives to comfort --no thought comes
to her but a mad craving for the busy day.
At last it comes, slowly, sweetly. The grey dawn
deepens into rose, the sun flings abroad its young and
chilly beams upon the earth. It is the opening of a
glorious morn. How often have we noticed in our
hours of direst grief how it is then Nature chooses to
deck herself in all her fairest and best, as though to
mock us with the very gaiety and splendour of her
charms!
At half-past seven an early train is starting. Long
before that time she is dressed, with her hat and
jacket on, fearful lest by any delay she should miss it;
and when at length the carriage is brought round to
the door she runs swiftly down the stairs to meet it.
In the hall below, awaiting her, stands Luttrell,
ready to accompany her.
“Are you going too?” Cecil asks, in a whisper,
only half-surprised.
“Yes, of course, I will take her myself to Brooklyn.”
"I might have known you would," Cecil says
kindly, and then she kisses Molly, who hardly returns
the caress, and puts her into the carriage; and, press-
ing Luttrell's hand warmly, watches them until they
are driven out of her sight.
During all the long drive not one word does Molly
utter. Neither does Luttrell, whose heart is bleeding

for her. She takes no notice of him, expresses no
surprise at his being with her.
At the station he takes her ticket through bribery
obtains an empty carriage-and, placing a rug round
her, seats himself at the farthest end of the compart-
ment from her-so little does he seek to intrude upon
her grief. And yet she takes no heed of him. He
might, indeed, be absent, or the veriest stranger, so
little does his presence seem to affect her. Leaning
rather forward, with her hands clasped upon her knees,
she scarcely stirs or raises her head throughout the
journey, except to go from carriage to train—from train
back again to carriage.
Once, during their last short drive from the station
to Brooklyn, moved by compassion, he ventures to ad-
dress her.
“I wish you could cry, my poor darling," he says
tenderly, taking her hand and fondling it between his
own.
“Tears could not help me,” she answers. And then
as though roused by his voice, she says uneasily: "Why
are you here?”
“Because I am his friend and—yours," he returns
gently, making allowance for her small show of irrita-
tion.
“True,” she says, and no more. Five minutes after-
wards they reach Brooklyn.
The door stands wide open. All the world could
have entered unrebuked into that silent hall. What
need now for bars and bolts? When the Great Thief
has entered in and stolen from them their best, what
heart have they to guard against lesser thefts?
Luttrell follows Molly into the house, his face no

whit less white than her own. A great pain is tugging
at him—a pain that is almost an agony. For what
greater suffering is there than to watch with unavailing
sympathy the anguish of those we love?
He touches her lightly on the arm to rouse her, for
she has stood stock-still in the very middle of the hall
---whether through awful fear, or grief, or sudden bitter
memory her heart knoweth.
“Molly," says her lover, “let me go with you."
“You still here?” she says, awaking from her
thoughts, with a shiver. “I thought you gone. Why
do you stay? I only ask to be alone."
“I shall go in a few minutes,” he pleads, “when I
have seen you safe with Mrs. Massereene. I am afraid
for you. Suppose you should-suppose—you do not
even know-the room," he winds up desperately. "Let
me guard you against such an awful surprise as that.”
"I do," she answers, pointing, with a shudder, to
one room farther on that branches off the hall. “It-
is there. Leave me -I shall be better by myself.”
“I shall see you to-morrow?” he says diffidently.
“No-I shall see no one to-morrow."
“Nevertheless I shall call to know how you are,”
he says persistently; and, kissing one of her limp little
hands, departs.
Outside on the gravel he meets the old man who
for years has had care of the garden and general out-
door work at Brooklyn.
“It is a terrible thing, sir," this ancient individual
says, touching his hat to Luttrell, who had been rather
a favourite with him during his stay last summer. He
speaks without being addressed, feeling as though
the sad catastrophe that has occurred has levelled

some of the etiquette existing between master and
man.
“Terrible indeed.” And then, in a low tone: “How
did it happen?”
“'Twas just this,” says the old man, who is faith-
ful, and has understood for many years most of John
Massereene's affairs, having lived with him from boy
to man: "'twas money that did it. He had invested
all he had, as it might be, and he lost it, and the
shock went to his heart and killed him. Poor soul
poor soul!”
“Disease of the heart. Who would have sus-
pected it? And he has lost all. Surely something
remains?”
"Only a few hundreds, sir, as I hear-nothing to
signify-for the poor mistress and the wee bits. It is
a fearful thing, sir, and bad to think of. And there's
Miss Molly too. I never could abide them spickila-
tions, as they're called.”
“Poor John Massereene!” says Luttrell, taking off
his hat. “He meant no harm to anyone—least of all
those who were nearest to his kindly heart.”
“Ay, ay-man and boy I knew him. He was al-
ways kind and true was the master—with no two ways
about him. When the letter came as told him all was
gone, and that only beggary was afore him, he said
nothing, only went away to his study dazed like, an’
read it, an' read it, and then fell down heartbroken
upon the floor. Dead he was—stone dead-afore any
of us came to him. The poor missis it was as found
him first."
"It is too horrible," says Luttrell, shuddering. He
nods his head to the old man and walks away from

him down to the village inn, depressed and sad-
dened.
The gardener's news has been worse than even he
had anticipated. To be bereft of their dearest is bad
enough, but to be thrown penniless on the mercies of
the cold and cruel-nay, rather thoughtless—world is
surely an aggravation of their misery. Death at all
times is a calamity; but when it leaves the mourners
without actual means of support how much sadder a
thing it is! To know that one's comforts shall remain
unimpaired after the loss of one's beloved is-in
spite of all indignant denial—a solace to the most
mournful.

CHAPTER XI.
As the earth when leaves are dead,
As the night when sleep is sped,
As the heart when joy is fled,
I am left lone-alone.--SHELLEY.
MEANTIME Molly, having listened vaguely and with-
out interest, yet with a curious intentness, to his part-
ing footfalls, as the last one dies away draws herself
up and, with a sigh or two, moves instinctively to-
wards the door she had pointed out to Luttrell.
No one has told her, no hint has reached her
ears. It is not his usual bedroom, yet she knows that
within that door lies all that remains to her of the
brother so fondly loved.
With slow and lagging steps, with bent head and
averted eyes, she creeps tardily near, resting with her
hand upon the lock to summon courage to meet what
must be before her. She feels faint-sick with a
bodily sickness—for never yet has she come face to
face with Death.
At last, bringing her teeth firmly together, and
closing her eyes, by an immense effort she compels
herself to turn the handle of the door and enters.
Letitia is seated upon the ground beside the bed,
her head lowered, her hands folded tightly in her lap.
There is no appearance of mourning so far as gar-
ments are concerned. Of course, considering the short-
ness of the time, it would be impossible, yet it seems
odd, out of keeping, that she should still be wearing

that soft blue serge, which is associated with so many
happy hours.
She is not weeping; there are no traces, however
faint, of tears. Her cheeks look a little thinner, more
haggard, and she has lost the delicate, girlish colour
that was her chief charm; but though black circles
surround her eyes—so black as to suggest the ap-
pliance of art—there is an unnatural brilliancy in her
eyes that utterly precludes the possibility of crying.
Some one has pulled a piece of the blind to one
side, and a fitful gleam of sunlight, that dances in a
heartless manner, flickers in and out of the room-
nay, even strays in its ghastly mirth across the bed
where the poor body lies.
As Molly walks, or rather drags her limbs after her,
into the chamber (so deadly is the terror that has
seized upon her) Letitia slowly raises her eyes.
She evinces no surprise at her sister's home-
coming.
“There is all that is left you,” she says, in a hard,
slow voice, that makes Molly shiver, turning her head
in the direction of the bed, and opening and shutting
her hands with a peculiarly expressive, empty gesture.
Afterwards she goes back to her original position,
her face bent downwards, her body swaying gently to
and fro.
Reluctantly, with trembling steps and hidden eyes,
Molly forces herself to approach the dreaded spot.
For the first time she is about to look on our undying
foe—to make acquaintance with the last great change
of all.
A cold hand has closed upon her heart, she is
consumed by an awesome, unconquerable shrinking.

She feels a difficulty in breathing—almost she thinks
her senses are about to desert her.
As she reaches the side of the bed opposite to
where Letitia crouches she compels herself to look, and
for the moment sustains a passionate feeling of relief,
as the white sheet that covers all, alone meets her
gaze.
And yet not all. A second later, and a dread
more awful than the first overpowers her; for there,
beneath the fair, pure linen shroud, the features are
clearly marked; the form can be traced; she can as-
sure herself of the shape of the head—the nose—the
hands folded so quietly—so obediently—in their last
eternal sleep upon the cold breast. But no faintest
breathing stirs them. He is dead!
Her eyes grow to this fearful thing. To steady
herself she lays her hand upon the back of a chair.
Not for all the world contains, would she lean upon
that bed, lest by any chance she should disturb the
quiet sleeper. The other hand she puts out in trembling
silence to raise a corner of the sheet.
"I cannot,” she groans aloud, withdrawing her
fingers shudderingly. But no one heeds. Three times
she essays to throw back the covering, to gaze upon
her dead, and fails; and then at last the deed is ac-
complished, and Death in all its silent majesty lies
smiling before her.
Is it John? Yes, it is, of course. And yet—is
it? O the changeless sweetness of the smile—the
terrible shading—the moveless serenity!
Spellbound, heartbroken, she gazes at him for a
minute, and then hastily, though with the tenderest
reverence, she hides away his face. A heavy, burst-

all-my
ing sigh escapes her; she raises her head, and be-
comes conscious that Letitia is upon her knees and is
staring at her fixedly across the bed.
There is about her an expression that is almost
wild in its surprise and horror.
“You do not cry either," she says in a clear, in-
tense whisper. "I thought I was the only thing on
earth so unnatural. I have not wept. I have not lost
my senses. I can still think. I have lost
my
husband-John!—and yet I have not shed one single
tear. And you, Molly—he loved you so dearly, and I
fancied you loved him too—and still you are as cold,
as poor a creature as myself.”
There is no reply. Molly is regarding her speech-
lessly. In truth she is dumb from sheer misery and
the remembrance of what she has just seen. Are
Letitia's words true? Is she heartless?
There is a long silence-how long neither of them
ever knows—and then something happens that achieves
what all the despair and sorrow has failed in doing.
In the house, through it, awakening all the silence,
rings a peal of childish laughter. It echoes; it trembles
along the corridor outside; it seems to shake the very
walls of the death-chamber.
Both the women start violently. Molly, raising her
hands to her head, falls back against the wall nearest
to her, unutterable horror in her face. Letitia, with a
quick, sharp cry, springs to her feet, and then, running
to Molly, flings her arms around her.
"Molly-Molly," she exclaims wildly, "am I going
mad? That cannot_it cannot be his child.”
Then they cling to each other in silent agony,
until at length some cruel band around their hearts

gives way, and the sorrowful, healing, blessed tears
spring forth.
The last sad scene is over-the curtain has fallen.
The final separation has taken place. Their dead has
been buried out of their sight.
The room in which he lay has been thrown open,
the blinds raised, the windows lifted. Through them
the sweet, fresh wind comes rushing in. The heart-
less sun—now grown cold and wintry--has sent some
of its rays to peer curiously where so lately the body
lay.
The children are growing more demonstrative-
more frequently, and with less fear of reproof, the
sound of their mirth is heard throughout the silent
house. Only this very morning the boy Lovett—the
eldest born, his father's idol-went whistling through
the hall. No doubt it was in a moment of forgetful-
ness he did it; no doubt the poor lad checked himself
an instant later, with a bitter pang of self-reproach;
but his mother heard him, and the sound smote her
to the heart.
Mr. Buscarlet (who is a kind little man in spite of
his “ways and his manners” and a few eccentricities
of speech) at a word from Molly comes to Brooklyn;
and, having carefully examined letters, papers, ind
affairs generally, turns their fears into unhappy cer-
tainty. One thousand pounds is all that remains to
them on which to live or starve.
The announcement of their ruin is hardly news to
Letitia. She has been prepared for it. The letter
found crushed in her dead husband's hand, although
suppressing half the truth, did not deceive her. Even

at that awful moment she quite realised her position.
Not so Molly. With all the unreasoning trust of youth
she hoped against hope until it was no longer possible
to do so, trying to believe that something forgotten
would come to light, some unremembered sum, to re-
lieve them from absolute want. But Mr. Buscarlet's
search has proved ineffective.
Now, however, when hope is actually at an end, all
her natural self-reliancy and bravery returns to her;
and in the very mouth of despair she makes a way
for herself and for those whom she loves to escape.
After two nights' wakeful hesitation, shrinking,
doubt, and fear, she forms a resolution, from which
she never afterwards turns aside, until compelled to do
so by unrestrainable circumstances.
“It is a very distressing case," says Mr. Buscarlet,
blowing his nose oppressively—the more so that he
feels for her very sincerely; "distressing indeed: I don't
know one half so afflicting. I really do-not-see
what is to be done."
“Do not think me presumptuous if I say I do,”
says Molly. “I have a plan already formed; and if it
succeeds I shall at least be able to earn bread for
us all.”
“My dear young lady, how? You, with-ahem!
you must excuse me if I say—your youth and beauty,
how do you propose to earn your bread?”
“It is my secret as yet”-with a faint, wan smile
-"let me keep it a little longer. Not even Mrs.
Massereene knows of it. Indeed, it is too soon to pro-
claim my design. People might scoff it; though for all
that I shall work it out. And something tells me I
shall succeed.”

“Yes, yes, we all think we shall succeed when
young," says the old lawyer sadly, moved to keenest
compassion at sight of the beautiful, earnest face be-
fore him. “It is later on, when we are faint and weary
with the buffetings of fortune, the sad awakening
comes.”
“I shall not be disheartened by rebuffs—I shall
not fail,” says Molly, intently. “However cold and un-
generous the world may prove, I shall conquer it at
last. Victory shall stay with me."
“Well, well, I would not discourage anyone. There
are none so worthy of praise as those who seek to
work out their own independence, whether they live or
die in the struggle. But work—of the sort you mean
-is hard for one so young. You have a plan. Well
so have I. But have you never thought of your grand-
father? He is very kindly-disposed towards you; and
if he-4"
"I have no time for 'buts' and ifs,'” she interrupts
him gently. “My grandfather may be kindly-disposed
towards me, but not towards mine, and that counts for
much more. No, I must fall back upon myself alone.
I have quite made up my mind,” says Molly, throwing
up her small proud head, with a brave smile, "and the
knowledge makes me more courageous.
I feel so
strong to do, so determined to vanquish all obstacles,
that I know I shall neither break down nor fail.”
“I trust not, my dear; I trust not. You have my
best wishes at least."
“Thank you,” says Molly, pressing his kind old
hand.

CHAPTER XII.
I fain would follow love, if that could be. —TENNYSON.
LETITIA in her widowed garments looks particularly
handsome. All the "trappings and the signs” of
woe suit well her tall, full figure, her fair and placid
face.
Molly looks taller, slenderer than usual in her
mourning robes. She is one of those who grow slight
quickly under affliction. Her rounded cheeks have
fallen in and show sad hollows; her eyes are larger,
darker, and show beneath them great purple lines born
of many tears.
She has not seen Luttrell since her return home-
although Letitia has—and rarely asks for him. Her
absorbing grief appears to have swallowed up all other
emotions. She has not once left the house. She works
little, she does not read at all; she is fast falling into
a settled melancholy.
“Molly," says Letitia, “Tedcastle is in the drawing-
room. He particularly asked to see you. Do not
refuse him again. Even though your engagement, as
you say, is at an end, still remember, dearest, how
kind, how more than thoughtful he has been in many
ways since-of late-
Her voice breaks.
“Yes, yes, I will see him,” Molly says wearily, and,
rising, wends her way slowly, reluctantly to the room
which contains her lover.

At sight of him some chords that have lain hushed
and forgotten in her heart for many days come to life
again. Her pulses throb, albeit languidly, her colour
deepens; a something that is almost gladness awakes
within her. Alas! how human are we all, how short-
lived our keenest regrets! With the living love so near
her she for the first time (though only for a moment)
forgets the dead one.
In her trailing, sombre dress, with her sorrowful
white cheeks, and quivering lips, she goes up to him
and places her hand in his; while he, touched with a
mighty compassion, stares at her, marking with a
lover's careful eye all the many alterations in her face.
So much havoc in so short a time!
“How changed you are! How you must have
suffered!” he says tenderly.
“I have,” she answers; and then, grown nervous,
because of her trouble and the fluttering of her heart,
and, that tears of late are so ready to her, she covers
her face with her hands, and, with the action of a
tired and saddened child, turning, hides it still more
effectually upon his breast.
“It is all very miserable,” he says, after a pause,
occupied in trying to soothe.
“Ah! is it not? What trouble can be compared with
it? To find him dead, without a word—a parting sign!"
She sighs heavily. “The bitterest sting of all lies in
the fact that but for my own selfishness I might have
seen him again. Had I returned home as I promised
at the end of the month I should have met my brother
living; but instead I lingered on, enjoying myself”—
with a shudder_"while he was slowly breaking his
heart over his growing difficulties. It must all have

happened during this last month. He had no care on
his mind when I left him-you know that. You re-
member how lighthearted he was, how kindly, how
good to all."
"He was indeed, poor poor fellow!"
“And some have dared to blame him," she
says,
in a pained whisper. “You do not?"
“No-no."
“I have been calculating,” she goes on, in a dis-
tressed tone, "and the very night I was dancing so
frivolously at that horrible ball he must have been
lying awake here waiting with a sick heart for the news
that was to—kill him. I shall never go to a ball again
-I shall never dance again,” says Molly, with a pas-
sionate sob, scorning, as youth will, the power of time
to cure.
“Darling, why should you blame yourself? Such
thoughts are morbid," says Luttrell, fondly caressing
the bright hair that still lies loosely against his arm.
“Which of us can see into the future? And, if we
could, do you think it would add to our happiness?
Shake off such depressing ideas. They will injure not
only your mind but your body.”
“I do not think I should feel it all quite so much,”
says Molly, in a low, miserable, expressionless voice,
“if I could only see him now and then. No, not in
the fleshI do not mean that—but if I could only
bring his face before my mind I might be content.
For hours together I sit, with my hands clasped before
my eyes, trying to conjurę him up, and I cannot. Al-
most every casual acquaintance I possess, all the people
whose living or dying matters to me not at all, rise at
my command; but he never. Is it not curious?"

"Perhaps it is because your mind dwells too much
upon him. But tell me of your affairs," says Luttrell,
abruptly but kindly, leading her to a sofa and seating
himself beside her, with a view to drawing her from
her unhappy thoughts. “Are they as bad as Mrs.
Massereenę says?”
“Quite as bad.”
“Then what do they mean to do?” In a tone of
the deepest commiseration.
“They?' We, you mean. What others, I sup-
pose, have learned to do before us—work for our daily
bread."
An incredulous look comes into his eyes, but he
wisely subdues it.
“And what do you propose doing?” he asks calmly,
meaning in his own mind to humour her.
“You are like Mr. Buscarlet-he would know every-
thing,” says Molly, with a smile; “but this is a ques-

perhaps I had better say an idea; and until it is con-
firmed or rejected I shall tell no one of it. No, not
even you.”
“Well, never mind. Tell me instead when you in-
tend leaving Brooklyn?”
“In a fortnight we must leave it. Is it not a little
while?-only two short weeks in which to say good-
bye for ever to my home-(how much that word com-
prises!)—to the place where all my life has been spent
-where every stone, and tree, and path is endeared to
me by a thousand memories."
“And after?"
“We go to London. There I hope to work out my
idea."

“You have forgotten to tell me," says Luttrell
slowly, “my part in all these arrangements.”
“Yours? Ah, Teddy, you put an end to our en-
gagement in good time. Now it must have been
broken, whether we liked it or not.”
“Meaning that I must not throw in my lot with
yours? Do you know what folly you are talking?”
says Luttrell almost roughly. “Ours, I am assured, is
an engagement that cannot be broken. Not all the cruel
words that could be spoken—that have been spoken"
--in a low tone of reproach—"have power to separate
You are mine, Molly, as I am yours, for ever. I
will never give you up. And now—now~in the hour
of your trouble--" Breaking off, he gets up from
his seat and commences to pace the room excitedly.
She has risen too, and is standing with her eyes
fixed anxiously upon him. At length, “Let us put an
end now to all misconceptions and doubts," he says,
stopping before her. “Your manner that last evening
at Herst, your greeting to-day, have let me to hope
again. I would know without further delay whether I
am wrong in thinking you care more for me than for
any other man. Am I? Speak, Molly, tell me now
here-if
you
love me?"
"I do—I do," cries she, bursting into tears again,
and flinging herself in an abandonment of grief into
his longing arms. “And that is what makes my task
so hard. That is why I have not allowed myself to
see you all these past days. It was not coldness,
Teddy, it was love. I dared not see you, because all
must be at an end between us."
“Do you think, with you in my arms like this, with
the assurance of your love fresh upon your lips, and

nowº-stooping—"upon mine, I can do anything but
laugh at such treason as that?"
“Nay, but you must listen, Teddy, and believe that
I am earnest in all that I say. For the future I shall
neither see you nor hear from you; I must even try to
forget you, if I would succeed in what lies before me.
From henceforth I shall do my best to regard you as
a stranger--to keep you at arm's length."
"Never," says Luttrell emphatically, tightening his
arms around her, as though to enforce the meaning of
the word and show the absurdity of her last remark.
“You talk as though you meant to convince me, but
unhappily you don't. The more you say the more
determined I am to marry you at once, and put a stop
to all such nonsense as your trying to work.”
“And are you going to marry Letitia also, and
Lovett, and the two little girls, and the baby?” asks
she quietly. “Who is talking nonsense now? You
seem to forget that they and I are one.”
"Something must be done,” says Luttrell, wretch-
edly.
“I quite agree with you; but who is going to do
it?”
"I will”-decidedly—“I shall cut the army. My
father has been a Member and a staunch Conservative
for years, and surely we must have some interest. I
have heard of posts under Government where one has
little or nothing to do, and gets a capital salary for
doing it—why should not I drop into one of them?
Then we might all live together, and perhaps you might
be happy."
"But in the meantime”-sadly—“we poor folks
must live."

"I cannot indeed, and you must not ask me. If I
did tell you probably you would scoff at it, or perhaps
be angry, and I will not let myself be discouraged. It
is quite useless your pressing me about this matter. I
will not tell.”
“And do you mean to tell me you purpose going
alone into the great London world to seek your fortune
-without a protector? You must be mad.”
“I have Letitia."
"Letitia"-indignantly—“is very
handsome
woman, not more than ten years older than yourself.

“I can't help that.”
“Yes, you can; but your-obstinacy—won't allow
you. Do you, then, intend to let no one know of your
affairs?"
“I shall confide in Cecil Stafford-because I can't
avoid it. But I know she will keep my secret until I
give her leave to speak.”
"It comes to this, then—that you consider every-
one before me. It is nothing to you whether I eat my
heart out in ignorance of whether you are alive or
dead.”
“Cecil”-hastily—“may tell you so much.”
"Thank you—that is a wonderful concession."
“Why should I concede at all, when (as I have
said) you are no longer bound to me?”

insist, I desire you, Molly, to let me know what it is
you intend doing.”
He looks sterner than one would have conceived
possible for him-Miss Massereene evidently thinks
him inhumanly so.
“Don't speak to me like that,” she ys,
with
quivering lips. “You should not. I have made a vow
not to disclose my secret to you of all people, and
would you have me break it?"
“But why?” Impatiently.
“Because—have I not told you already?—because"
—with a little dry sob—"I love you so dearly, that to
encourage thoughts of you would unfit me for
my
work.
And it is partly for your own sake I do it, for some-
thing tells me we shall never marry each other; and
why should you spend your life dreaming of a
shadow?"
“It is the cruellest resolution a woman ever formed,”
replies he, ignoring as beneath notice the latter part
of her speech; and, putting away her hands, takes once
more to his irritable promenade up and down the
Molly is crying, silently, exhaustedly. “My burden
is too heavy for me,” she murmurs faintly.
“Then why not let me help you to bear it?”

months. I ask you to wait till then. Is it too long?
If so-remember you are free-believe me it will be
better so—and I perhaps shall be happier in the
thought--" And here incontinently she breaks
down.
“Don't,” says Luttrell hurriedly, whose heart grows
room.

faint within him at the sight of her distress. “Molly,
I give in. I am satisfied with your last promise. I
shall wait for ever, if that will please you. Who am I
that I should add one tear to the many you have
already shed? Forgive me, my own love."
“Yes, but do not say anything more to me to-day-
I am tired,” says Molly, submitting to his caresses,
though still a little sore at heart.
“Only one thing more," says this insatiable young
man, who evidently holds in high esteem the maxim
to “strike while the iron is hot.” “You agree to a
renewal of our engagement?"
“I suppose so.
Although I know it is an act of
selfishness on my part. Nothing can possibly come
of it."
“And if it is selfishness in you what is it in me?"
asks he humbly. “You know as well as I do I am no
match for you, who, with your face, your voice”.
(Molly winces perceptibly) -"your manner, might marry
whom you choose. Yet I do ask you to wait”-
eagerly—“until something comes to our aid, to be true
to me, no matter what happens, until I can claim you.”
“I will wait; I will be true to you," she answers,
with dewy eyes uplifted to his and a serene, earnest
face. As she gives her promise a little sigh escapes
her, more full of content, I think, than any regret.
After coming to this conclusion they talk more
rationally for an hour or som(a lover's hour, dear
reader, is not as other hours—it never drags--it is not
full of
yawns 5—it does not make us curse the day we
were born)—and then Luttrell, by some unlucky chance,
discovers he must tear himself away.

As Molly rises to bid him good-bye, she catches
her breath, and presses her hand to her side.
“I have such a pain here," she says.
“You don't go out,” says her lover, severely; "you
want air. I shall speak to Letitia if you won't take
more care of yourself.”
“I have not been out of the house for so long, I
quite dread going.”
“Then go to-morrow.
If
you
will walk to the wood
nearest you—where you will see no one—I will meet
you there."
“Very well,” says Molly, obediently; and when they
have said good-bye for the fifth time, he really takes
his departure.
How to reveal her weighty secret to Letitia troubles
Molly much; an intimate acquaintance with her sister-
in-law's character causing her to know its disclosure
will be received, not only with discouragement but
actual disapproval. And yet-disclose it she must.
But how to break it happily. Having thought of
many ways and means, and rejected them all, she
decides, with a sigh, that plain speaking will be best.
“Letitia," she says, this very evening-Luttrell
having been gone some hours—"do you know Signor
Marigny's address?”
She is leaning her elbows on the writing table,
and has let her rounded chin sink into her palms'
embrace; while her eyes fix themselves steadily upon
the pen, the paper, anything but Letitia.
“Signor Marigny! Your old singing master? No.
Why do you ask, dear?”
“Because I want to write to him.”

“Do you, and what -? No, I have not got his
address—I don't believe I ever had it. How shall you
manage?"
"I daresay I have it somewhere myself-don't
trouble,” says Molly, knowing guiltily it lies just
beneath her hand within the table-drawer. She is glad
of a respite—Letitia having forborne to press the
question.
Not for long, however-human nature can stand a
good many things, but curiosity conquers most.
“Why are you writing to Signor Marigny?” Letitia
asks, in a gentle tone of indifference, after a full five
minutes' pause, during which she has been devoured
with a desire to know.
“Because I believe he will help me," says Molly,
slowly. “I have been thinking, Letty—thinking very
seriously-and I have decided upon making my fortune
-our fortune-out of
my
voice."
“Molly!"
“Well dear, and why not? Do not dishearten me,
Letty; you know we must live, and what other plan
can you suggest?”
“In London I thought perhaps we might get some-
thing to do”—mournfully—"and there no one would
hear of us. I have rather a fancy for millinery, and
one of those large establishments might take me, while
you could go as a daily governess," regarding her sister
doubtfully.
“Governess-oh, no! The insipidity, the drudgery
of it, would kill me. I should lose sight of the fact
that I was my own mistress in such genteel slavery.
Besides, as a concert singer, (and I can sing), I should

earn as much in one night, probably, as I should other-
wise in a year.”
“Oh, Molly!” clasping her hands, “I cannot bear
to think of it. It is horrible; the publicity—the
dreadful ordeal. And you of all others, my pretty
Molly—~"
“It is well I am pretty," says Molly, with a supreme
effort at calmness; “they say a pretty woman with a
voice takes better.”
“Every word you say only convinces me more and
more how cruel a task it would be. And Molly darling
-I know-he would not wish it.”
“I think he would wish me to do my duty," says
Molly, gazing with great tearless eyes through the win-
dow into space, while her slender fingers meet and
twine together nervously. “Letitia, why cannot you be
thankful, as I am, that I have a voice. A sure and
certain provision—because I know I can sing as very
few can. (I say this gratefully, and without any vanity.)
Why, without it we might starve.”
“And what will Tedcastle say? For in spite of all
your arguments, Molly, I am sure he is devoted to you
still."
“That must not matter. Our engagement, to all
intents and purposes, is at an end, because”—sighing-
"we shall never marry. He is too poor, and I am too
poor, and besides”--telling her lie bravely—“I do not
wish to marry him.”
“I find it hard to believe you,” says Letitia, examin-
ing the girl's face critically. “Do you mean to tell
me you have ceased to care for him?"
“How do I know?"--pettishly, her very restlessness
betraying the truth. “At times I am not sure myself.

At all events, everything is at an end between us,
which is the principal thing, as he cannot now inter-
fere with my decision.”
“Do not think you can deceive me,” says Letitia,
in a trembling tone. "Ah, how cruel it all is. Death
when it visits most homes, leaves at least hope behind,
but here there is none. Other women lose fortune, or
perhaps position, or it may be love—but I have lost
all. While you—with all your young life before you-
would sacrifice yourself for us. I am not wholly self-
ish, Molly; I refuse to accept your offer. I refuse to
take your happiness at your hands.”
“My happiness is yours," returns Molly, tenderly;
“refuse to let me help you, and the little shred of com-
fort that still remains to me vanishes with the rest.
Letitia, you are my home now, do not reject me.”
Two sad little tears run down her pale cheeks un-
checked. Letitia, unable to bear the sight, turns away;
and presently, two kindred drops steal down her face,
and fall with a faint splashing sound upon her heavy
crape.
“It would be such a hateful life for you," she says,
with a sigh.
“I don't think so. I like singing; and the know-
ledge that by it I was actually helping you—who all
my life have been my true and loving sister-would
make my task sweet. What shall I say to Signor
Marigny, Letty?” with a sudden air of business. “He
has a great deal to do with concerts and that—and I
know he will assist me in every way.”
“Tell him you are about to sacrifice your love,
your happiness, everything that makes life good, for
your family," says Letitia, who has begun to cry bitterly,

"and ask him what will compensate you for it; ask
him if gold or fame, or praise, will fill the void that
already you have begun to feel.”
“Nonsense, my dear-he would justly consider me
a lunatic, were I to write to him in such a strain. I
shall simply tell him that I wish to make use of the
talent that has been given me, and ask him for his
advice how best to proceed. Don't you think some-
thing like that would answer? Come now, Letty,"
cheerfully and coaxingly, kneeling down before Mrs.
Massereene, "say you are pleased with my plan, and
all will be well.”
“What would become of me without you?” says
Letitia, irrelevantly, kissing her; and Molly, taking
this for consent, enters into a long and animated dis-
cussion on the subject of her intended début as a
public singer.

CHAPTER XIII.
Who ne'er have loved, and loved in vain,
Can neither feel nor pity pain. --BYRON.
TRUE to her promise, the next day Molly wraps
herself up warmly and takes her way towards the wood
that adjoins but does not belong to Brooklyn.
At first, from overmuch inactivity and spiritless
brooding, a sort of languor--a trembling of the limbs
-oppresses her; but presently, as the cold, crisp air
creeps into her young blood, she quickens her steps,
and is soon walking with a brisk and healthy motion
towards the desired spot.
Often her eyes fill with unbidden tears, as many
a well-remembered place is passed, and she thinks of
a kindly word or a gay jest uttered here by lips now
cold and mute.
There is a sadness in the wood itself that har-
monises with her thoughts. The bare trees, the fast
decaying leaves beneath her feet—all speak of death
and change. Swinburne's exquisite lines rise involun-
tarily in her mind.
Lo the summer is dead, the sun is faded,
Even like as a leaf the year is withered.
All the fruits of the day from all her branches
Gathered, neither is any left to gather.
All the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms,
All are taken away; the season wasted
Like an ember among the fallen ashes.

Seating herself upon a little grassy mound, with
her head thrown back against the trunk of a gnarled
but kindly beech, she waits her lover's coming. She
is very early-almost by her own calculation half an
hour must elapse before he can join her. Satisfied
that she cannot see him until then, she is rapidly fall-
ing into a gentle doze, when footsteps behind her cause
her to start into a sitting posture.
“So soon,” she says, and, rising, finds herself face
to face with-Philip Shadwell.
"You see, I have followed you," he says, slowly.
He does not offer to shake hands with her; he gives
her no greeting; he only stands before her suffering
his eyes to drink in hungrily her saddened but always
perfect beauty.
"So I see," she answers, quite as slowly.
“You have been in trouble. You have grown thin,"
he says, presently, in the same tone.
“Yes."
She is puzzled, dismayed at his presence here,
feeling an unaccountable repugnance to his society,
and a longing for his departure, as she notes his un-
wonted agitation-the unknown, but evident purpose
in his eyes.
"When last we met," says Philip, with a visible
effort at calmness, and with his great dark moody eyes
bent upon the ground, "you told me you—hated me.”
“Did I? The last time? How long ago it seems
--years-centuries. Ah!"-clasping her hands in a
very ecstasy of regret—"how happy I was then! and
yet-I thought myself miserable. That day I spoke
to you" (gazing at him as one gazes at something
outside and beyond the question altogether), "I ab-

solutely believed I knew what unhappiness meant; and
now-
“Yes. You said you hated me,” says
the
young
man, still bent upon his own wrongs to the exclusion
of all others. He is sorry for her, very sorry; but what
is her honest grief for her beloved dead compared with
the desperate craving for the unattainable that is con-
suming him daily-hourly.
“I hardly remember," Molly says, running her
slender fingers across her brow. “Well”—with a sigh
-"I have fallen into such low estate since then that
I think I have no power within me now to hate any-
one."
"You did not mean it, perhaps?” still painfully
calm, although he knows the moments of grace are
slipping surely, swiftly, trying vainly to encourage hope.
“You said it, perhaps, in an instant of passion? One
often does. One exaggerates a faint feeling at such
times, until it attains giant proportions. Afterwards one
knows how falsely one has aggravated a small offence.
Is it not so?"
“Yes.” With her thoughts as far from him as the
earth is from the heavens—“It may be so."
“You think so? You did not mean it?” with a
sudden gleam of misplaced confidence. “Oh! if you
only knew how I have suffered since that fatal word
passed your lips—but you did not mean it. In time
--who knows-you may even bring yourself to care
for me a little. Molly"-seizing her hand—“speak-
speak, and say it will be so."
"No, no," exclaims she at last, coming back to the
present, and understanding him. “Never. Why do
you so deceive yourself? Do not think it; do not try

to believe it. And”—with a quick shudder—"to speak
to me so now-at this time-
"Perhaps, had I known you first, you might have
loved me," persists he.
“I am sure not,” replies she, gently but decidedly.
“Your dark looks, your vehemence—all—frighten
me.”
"Once assured of your love, I could change all
that,” he perseveres unwisely in a low tone, his pas-
sionate, gloomy eyes still fixed upon the ground, his
foot uneasily stirring the chilled blades of grass be-
neath him. "In such a case, what is it I could not do?
Molly, will you not take pity on me? Will you not
give me a chance?"
“I cannot. Why will you persist? I tell you, if we
two were to live for ever, you are the very
ast man I
should ever love. It is the kindest thing I can do for
you to speak thus plainly.”
“Kind!"_bitterly—“can you be kind? With your
fair, soft face, and your angel eyes, you are the most
bitterly cruel woman I ever met in my life. I curse
the day I first saw you!
You have ruined my hap-
piness.
“Philip, do not speak like that. You cannot mean
it. In a few short months you will forget you have
ever uttered such words—or felt them. See now”.
laying the tips of her fingers kindly upon his arm-
"put away from you this miserable fancy, and I will
be your friend-if you will."
“Friend!" retorts he, roughly. “Who that had seen
and loved you could coldly look upon you as a friend?

you mixed up in it. Your face is burned into my

brain. I live but in recollection of
you,
and
you speak
to me of friendship! I tell you," says Philip, almost
reducing himself again to calmness through intensity
of emotion, “I am fighting for my very existence. I
must and will have you."
“Why will you talk so wildly”-turning a little pale,
and retreating a step-"you know what you propose,
to be impossible.”
“There is nothing impossible, if you will only try
to look upon me more kindly.”
"Am I to tell you again," she says, still gently, but
with some natural indignation, “that if I knew you for
ever and ever, I could not feel for you even the faint-
est spark of affection of the kind you mean. I would
not marry you for all the bribes you could offer. It is
not your fault that it is so, nor is it mine. You say
'try' to love you.
Can love be forced? Did ever
anyone grow to love another through trying? You
know better. The more one would have to try the
less likely would one be to succeed. Love is free and
yet a very tyrant. Oh, Philip, forget such vain thoughts.
Do not waste your life hoping for what can never be.”
"It shall be," cries he, vehemently, suddenly, with
an unexpected movement catching her in his arms;
“Molly, if I cannot buy your love, let me at least buy
yourself. Remember how you are now situated. You
do not yet know the horrors of poverty—real poverty;
and I-at least, I have prospects. Herst will be mine
beyond all doubt (who can be preferred before me),
and that old man cannot live for ever.
Think of your
sister and all her children; I swear I will provide for
all; not one but shall be to me as my own, for your
sake. You shall do what you like with me. Body

and soul I am yours for good or evil. Let it be for
good.”
"How dare you speak to me like this!” says Molly,
who has tried vainly to escape from his detested em-
brace during the short time it has taken him to pour
forth his last words. “Let me go instantly. Do you
hear me, Philip ?-release me.”
Her blue eyes have turned almost black with a
little fear and unlimited anger, her lips are white but
firm, her very indignation only making her more fair.
“I will, when you have given me some ground for
hope. Promise you will consider my words.”
“Not for a single instant. When a few moments
ago I hinted how abhorrent you are to me I spoke
truly; I only lied when I tried to soften my words. I
would rather ten thousand times be dead than your
wife. Now I hope you understand. Your very touch
makes me shudder."
She ceases, more from want of breath than words,
and a deep silence falls between them. Even through
the bare and melancholy trees the wind has forgotten
to shiver. Above, the clouds, rain-filled, scud hur-
riedly. A storm is in the air. Upon Philip's face a
deadlier storm is gathering.
"Have you anything more to say?” he asks, an
evil look coming into his eyes. Not for a second has
he relaxed his hold.
Molly's heart sinks a little lower. Oh! if Tedcastle
would only come—yet with a certain bravery she com-
pels herself to return without flinching the gaze of the
dark passionate face bent above hers. She knows
every limb in her body is trembling, that a deadly

sickness is creeping over her, yet by a supreme effort
she maintains her calmness.
“Nothing," she answers quietly, with just a touch
of scorn.
"I should have thought I had said enough
to convince any man. Now will you let me go home.
You cannot want to keep me here after what I have
said.”
“I wonder you are not afraid of me," says Shadwell,
who is absolutely beside himself with anger. “Do not
put unlimited faith in my forbearance. A worm you
know will turn. Do you think you can goad a man to
desperation and leave him as cool as when you began?
I confess I am not made of such stuff. Do you know
you are in my power? What is to prevent my killing
you, here, now, this moment?”
He speaks slowly, as though his breath comes with
difficulty, so much has anger overmastered him; yet
her eyes have never fallen before his, and he knows in
spite of his words he has not the smallest mastery over
her, he has gained no triumph.
“I wish you were dead," he goes on, in a com-
pressed tone, "and myself too. To be sure that if you
were not mine you would never be another's, has in it
a sweetness that tempts me. They say extremes meet.
I hardly know, now, where my love for you ends, or
where my hatred begins."
His violence terrifies Molly.
“Philip, be generous," she says, laying her hand
against his chest with a vain attempt to break from
him; "and-and-try to be calm. Your eyes have
madness in them. Even if you were to kill me, what
good would it do you? And think of the afterwards:

Oh, what have I ever done to you that
you should seek
to-to-unnerve me like this?"
“What have you done?' Shall I tell you? You
have murdered me as surely as though your knife had
entered my heart. You have killed every good thought
in me, every desire that might perhaps have had some
element of nobleness in it. I was bad enough before
I met you, I daresay; but you have made me ten times
worse.”
“It is all false. I will not listen to you"-covering
her ears with her hands. But he takes them down
again, gently but determinately, and compels her to
hear him.
“When first you came to Herst for your own amuse-
ment, to pass away the hours that perhaps hung a
little heavily upon your hands, or to rouse a feeling of
jealousy in the heart of Luttrell, or to prove the power
you have over all men by the right of your fatal
beauty, you played off upon me all the pretty airs and
graces, all the sweet looks and tender words that come
so easy to you, never caring what torment I might have
to endure when your dainty pastime had palled upon
you. Day by day I was led to believe that I was
more to you than those others who also waited on
your words."
“That is false false. Your own vanity misled
you.”
“I was the one singled out to escort you here, to
hear your messages there. Now and again you threw
me flowers, not half so honied as your smiles. And
when you had rendered me half mad—nay, I think,
wholly so—for love of you, and I asked you to be my
wife, you asked me in return 'what I meant, pretend-

ing an innocent ignorance of having done anything to
encourage me."
“I do not think I have done all this,” says Molly,
with a little gasping sigh; "but if I have I regret it. I
repent it. I pray your forgiveness."
“And I will grant it on one condition. Swear you
will be my wife.”
She does not answer. He is so vehement that she
fears to provoke him farther; yet nothing but a decided
refusal can be given. She raises her head and regards
him with a carefully concealed shudder, and as she
does so Luttrell's fair beautiful face-even more true
than beautiful, his eyes so blue and earnest, his firm
but tender mouth-rises before her. She thinks of his
devotion, his deep, honest love, and without thinking
any farther she says, “No," with much more decided
emphasis than prudence would have permitted.
“No,'” repeats he, furiously. “Do you still defy
me? Are you then so faithful to the memory of the
man who cast you off? Have you, perhaps, renewed
your engagement with him?
If I thought that-
if I was sure of that Speak, and say if it be
so.
The strain is too great. Molly's brave heart fails
her. She gives a little gasping cry, and with it her
courage disappears. Raising her face in mute appeal
to the bare trees, to the rushing, comfortless wind, to
the murky sky, she bursts into a storm of tears.
“Oh, if my brother were but alive,” cries she in
passionate protest, "you would not dare treat me like
this! Oh, John, John, where are you? It is I, your

Why are you silent?'
Her sobs fall upon the chilly air. Her tears drop

through her fingers down upon the brown tinged grass,
upon a foolish frozen daisy that has outlived its fellows
-upon her companion's heart!
With a groan he comes to his senses, releases
her, and, moving away, covers his face with his hands.
“Don't do that,” he says. “Stop crying. What a
brute I am! Molly, Molly, be silent, I desire you. I am
punished enough already."
Hardly daring to believe herself free, and dreading
a relapse on Philip's part, and being still a good deal
overstrung and frightened, Miss Massereene sobs on
very successfully, while even at this moment secretly
reproaching herself in that she did not pocket her
pride half an hour ago, and give way to the tears that
have had such a fortunate effect.
Just at this juncture Luttrell, clearing a stile that
separates him from them, appears upon the scene.
His dismay on seeing Molly in tears almost ob-
literates the displeased amazement with which he re-
gards Philip's unexpected appearance.
“Molly," he calls out to her even from the dis-
tance, some undefined instinct telling him she will be
glad of his presence. And Molly, hearing him, raises
her head, and without a word or cry runs to him and
Alings herself into the fond shelter of his arms.
As he holds her closely in his young, strong, ardent
embrace, a great peace—a joy that is almost pain-
comes to her. Had she still any lingering doubts of
her love for him, this moment, in which he stands by
her as a guardian, a protector, a true lover, would for
ever dispel them.
“You here,” says Luttrell, addressing Philip with a
frown, while his face flames, and then grows white as

Shadwell's own, “and Miss Massereene in tears! Ex-
plain-
"Better leave explanation to another time," inter-
rupts Philip with insolent hauteur, his repentant mood
having vanished with Luttrell's arrival, “and take Miss
Massereene home. She is tired."
So saying, he turns coolly on his heel, and walks
away
Luttrell makes an angry movement as though
to follow him; but Molly with her arms restrains him.
“Do not leave me,” she says, preparing to cry again
directly if he shows any determination to have it out
with Shadwell. “Stay with me. I feel so nervous and
—and faint.”
“Do you, darling?” Regarding her anxiously-
“You do look pale. What was Shadwell saying to
you? Why were you crying? If I thought he--"
“No, no”-laying five hasty, convincing little fingers
on his arm—"nothing of the kind. Won't you believe
me? He only reminded me of past days, and I was
foolish, and that was all.”
“But what brought him at all?”
“To see me," says Molly, longing yet fearing to tell
him of Philip's unpardonable behaviour. “But do not
let us talk of him. I cannot bear him. He makes me
positively nervous. He is so dark, so vehement, som
uncanny!"
“The fellow isn't much of a fellow certainly,” says
Luttrell with charming explicitness.

“How quiet you are,” Molly says, at length awaken-
ing to the fact of her lover's dumbness. “What are you
thinking about?"
“You, of course,” he answers with a rather joyless
smile. "I have received my marching orders. I must
join my regiment in Dublin next Saturday.”
“And this is Tuesday!" Aghast at the terrible news
-"Oh, Teddy! Could they not have left us together
for the few last days that remain to us?”
“It appears they could not,” replies he, with a pro-
longed and audible sigh.
"I always said your Colonel was a bear,” says Miss
Massereene, vindictively.
“Well, but you see, he doesn't know how matters
stand-he never heard of you," replies Luttrell, apolo-
getically.
“Well, he ought to know; and even if he did, he
would do it all the more. Oh, Teddy! dear Teddy!”
--with a sudden change of tone, thoroughly appreciated
by one individual at least—"what shall I do without
you?”

CHAPTER XIV.
When we two parted in silence and tears,
Half broken hearted, to sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek, and cold, colder thy kiss.
BYRON.
THEY have wandered down once more by the river's
side where first he told her how he loved her. To-
night, again, the moon is shining brightly, again the
stream runs rippling by, but not, as then, with a joy-
ous love song; now it sounds sad as death, and
"wild with all regret," as though mourning for the
flowers--the sweet fond forget-me-nots—that used to
grace its banks.
Their hands are clasped, his arm is round her;
her head drooping, dejected (unlike the gay capricious
Molly of a few months back), is leaning on his breast.
Large tears are falling silently, without a sob, down
her white cheeks, because to-night they say their last
farewell. It is one of those bitter partings, such as
“press the life from out young hearts,” and makes them
doubt the good that this world conceals even in the
very core of its disappointments.
“I feel as though I were losing all,” says Molly, in
a despairing tone. “First John, and now-you. Oh,
how difficult a thing is life! how hard, how cruel!”
Yet only a month before she was singing its praises
with all the self-confidence of foolish, ignorant youth.
"While I am alive you do not lose me," he answers,

pressing his lips to her soft hair and brow. “But I am
unhappy about you, my own; at the risk of letting you
think me importunate, I would ask you again to recon-
sider your decision, and let me know how it is you
purpose fighting this cold world.”
Unable to refuse him audibly, and still determined
to adhere to her resolution to let nothing interfere with
her self-imposed task, she maintains a painful silence,
merely turning her head from side to side upon his
chest uneasily.
“You still refuse me? Do you not think, Molly”.
reproachfully—“your conduct towards me is a little cold
and unfeeling?"
“No, no. Do not misjudge me—indeed I am act-
ing for the best. See,”—placing two bare white arms
around his neck, that gleam with snowy softness in the
moonlight against the mournful draperies that fall away
from them—“if I were cold or unfeeling would I do
this?" pressing her tender lips to his. "Would I? You
know I would not. I am a coward too, and fear you
would not look upon my plan as favourably as I do.
Darling, forgive and trust me."
"Are you going on the stage?" asks he, after a
pause, and with evident hesitation.
“Why?” with a forlorn little smile. "If I were,
would you renounce me?”
“Need I answer that? But you are so young, so
pretty-I am afraid, my darling, it-it would be un-
pleasant for you."
"Be satisfied, I am not thinking of the stage. But
do not question me, Teddy. I shall write to you, as I
have promised, in six months—if I succeed."
"And if you fail?"

“I suppose then-I shall write to you too," she
answers, with a sigh and a faint smile. “But I shall
not fail. After all, success will bring me no nearer to
I shall always have the children to provide for,"
she says, despondingly.
“We can at least live and hope.”
He draws her shawl, which has slipped to the
ground, close round her, and mutely, gloomily, they
stand listening to the murmuring of the sympathetic
stream.
“I always think of this spot as the dearest on
earth,” he says, after a pause. “Here I picture you to
myself with your hands full of forget-me-nots. I have
a large bunch of them yet, the same you gathered;
faded, it is true, to others, but never so to me. They
will always be as fresh in my eyes as on the evening
I took them from you. ‘My sweet love's flowers.'
Darling, darling," pressing her to his heart in a very
agony of regret, “when shall we two stand here again
together?"
“Never,” she whispers back in a prophetic tone,
and with a trembling, sobbing sigh more sad than any
tears.
“Give me something to remember you by-some-
thing to remind me of to-night.”
“Shall you need it?" asks she, and then raising
her hands she loosens all her pretty hair, letting it fall
in a bright shower around her. “You shall have one
little lock all to yourself," she says; “choose, and cut
it where
you
will.”
Tenderly he selects a shining tress-a very small
one, so loath is he, even for his own benefit, to lessen

the glory of her hair-and, severing it, consigns it to
the back case of his watch.
“That is a good place to keep it,” she says, with
an upward glance, that permits him to see the love
that lives for him in her dewy eyes. “At least every
night when you wind your watch you must think
of me."
"I shall think of you morning, noon and night, for
that matter."
“And when shall I think of you? And yet of
what avail,” cries she in despair; “all our thought will
be of no use. It will not bring us together. We
must be always separate-always apart. Not all our
longing will bring us one day nearer to each other.
Our lives are broken asunder.”
“Do not let us waste our last moments talking
folly," replies he, calmly; "nothing earthly shall
separate us."
“Yet time they say kills all things. It may per-
haps-kill——even your love."
“You wrong me, Molly, in even supposing it. “They
sin, who tell us love can die,'” quotes he softly, in a
tender, solemn tone. “My love for you is deathless.
Beloved, be assured of this, were we two to live until
old age crept on us, I should still carry to my grave
my love for you.”
He is so earnest, that in spite of herself a little un-
acknowledged comfort comes into her heart. She
feels it is no flimsy passion of an hour he is giving
her, but a true affection that will endure for ever.
"How changed you are," he says, presently; "you,
who used to be so self-reliant, have now lost all your
courage. Try to be brave, Molly, for both our sakes.

And—as I must soon go-tell me, what is your parting
injunction to me?"
“The kindest thing I can say to you is—forget me.”
“Then say something unkind. Do you imagine I
shall take two such hateful words as a farewell?”
“Then don't forget me—be sure you don't,” cries
she, bursting into tears.
The minutes are flying-surely never have they
flown with such cruel haste.
“Come, let us go indoors,” she says, when she has
recovered herself. “I suppose it is growing late."
"I shall not go in again-I have said good-bye to
Mrs. Massereene. It only remains to part from you.”
They kiss each other tenderly.
“I shall walk as far as the gate with you,” says
Molly; and, with a last lingering glance at their be-
loved nook, they go silently away.
When they reach the gate they pause and look at
one another in speechless sorrow. Like all partings it
seems at the moment final, and plants within their
hearts the germs of an unutterable regret.
“Good-bye, my life--my darling," he whispers
brokenly, straining her to him as though he never
means again to let her go; then, almost pushing her
away, he turns and leaves her.
But she cannot part from him yet. When he has
gone a hundred yards or more she runs after him
along the quiet moonlit road and throws herself once
more into his arms.
"Teddy_Teddy,” she cries, “do not go yet," and
falls to weeping as though her heart would break. “It
is the bitterness of death,” she says, "and it is death.
I know we shall never meet again.”

"Do not speak like that," he entreats, in deep
agitation. “I know-I believe-we shall indeed meet
again, and under happier circumstances.”
“Ah, you can find comfort!” Reproachfully. “You
are not half sorry to part from me.”
"Oh, Molly, be reasonable."
“If you can find any consolation at this moment
you are not. And—if you meet anyone—anywhere-
and, like her better than me—you will kill me--re-
member that.”
“Now, where," argues he, in perfect sincerity,
“could I meet anyone to be compared with you?”
“But how shall I know it—not hearing from you
for so many months?” She says this as though he,
not she, had forbidden the correspondence.
"Then why not take something from those wretched
six months?” he says craftily.
“I don't know. Yes"-doubtfully-"it is too long
a time. In four months, then, I shall write-yes, in
four months. Now I do not feel quite so bad. Six-
teen weeks will not be so long going by.”
“One would be shorter still.”
“No, no.” Smiling. “Would
you
have me break
through all my resolution? Be faithful to me, Teddy,
and I will be faithful to you. Here"-lifting her hands
to her neck—"I am not half-satisfied with that stupid
lock of hair: it may fall out, or you may lose it some
way. Take this little chain"-loosening it from round
her throat and giving it to him—"and wear it next
your heart until we meet again—if, indeed”-sighing
"we ever do meet again. Does not all this sound
like the sentiment of a hundred years ago? But do
not laugh at me--I mean it.”

“I will do as you bid me," replies he, kissing the
slender chain as though it were some sacred relic-
and as such, indeed, he regards it--while ready tears
spring to his eyes. “It and I shall never part.”
"Well, good-bye really now," she says with quiver-
ing lips. “I feel more cheerful, more hopeful. I don't
feel as if—I were going—to cry—another tear.” With
this she breaks into a perfect storm of tears, and,
tearing herself from his embrace, runs away from him
down the avenue out of sight of his longing eyes.

CHAPTER XV.
Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you, and have your love.
Merchant of Venice.
She is indeed perfection. -Othello.
THE fourth day before that fixed upon for leaving
Brooklyn, Molly, coming down to breakfast, finds upon
her plate a large envelope directed in her grand-
father's own writing—a rather shaky writing now, it is
true, but with all the remains of what must once have
been bold and determined caligraphy.
“Who can it be from?” says Molly, regarding the
elaborate seal and crest with amazement-both so
scarlet, both so huge.
“Open it, dear, and you will see," replies Letitia,
who is merely curious, and would not be accused of
triteness for the world.
Breaking the alarming seal, Molly reads in silence;
while Letitia, unable to bear suspense, rises and reads
it also over her sister's shoulder.
It consists of a very few lines, and merely ex-
presses a desire—that is plainly a command—that
Molly will come the following day to Herst, as her
grandfather has something of importance to say to her.
“What can it be?” says Molly, glancing over her
shoulder at Mrs. Massereene, who has taken the letter
to re-read it.
“Something good, perhaps.” Wistfully. “There
may be some luck in store for you.”

“Hardly. I have ceased to believe in my own good
luck," says Molly bitterly. “At all events, I suppose I
had better go. Afterwards I might reproach myself
for having been inattentive to his wishes."
“Go by all means," says Letitia; and so it is ar-
ranged.
Feeling tired and nervous she arrives the next day
at Herst, and is met in the hall by her friend the
housekeeper, in subdued spirits and the unfailing silk
gown, who receives her in a good old motherly fashion,
and bestows upon her a
warm though deferential
kiss.
“You have come, my dear, and I am glad of it,"
she says in a mysterious tone. "He has been asking
for you incessant. Miss Amherst, she is away from
home.” This in a pleased, confidential tone, Miss
Amherst being distinctly unpopular among the domes-
tics, small and great. “Mr. Amherst, he sent her to
the Latouches for a week-against her will, I must
say. And the Captain, he has gone abroad."
“Has he?" Surprised.
“Yes, quite suddent like, and no one the wiser
why. When last he come home, after being away a
whole day, he seemed to me daft like-quite," says
Mrs. Nesbitt, raising her eyes and hands, whose cosy
plumpness almost conceals the well-worn ring that for
twenty years of widowhood has rested there alone,
"quite as though he had took leave of his senses.”
“Yes?” says Molly in a faltering tone, feeling de-
cidedly guilty.
"Ay indeed, Miss Massereene, and so 'twas. But
you are tired, my dear, no doubt, and a’most faint for
a glass of wine. Come and take off your things and

rest yourself a bit, while I tell Mr. Amherst of your
arrival.”
In half an hour, refreshed and feeling somewhat
bolder, Molly descends, and, gaining the library door
where her grandfather awaits her, she opens it and
enters.
As, pale, slender, black-robed, she advances to his
side Mr. Amherst looks up.
“You have come,” he says holding out his hand to
her, but not rising. There is a most unusual nervous-
ness and hesitancy about his manner.
“Yes. You wrote for me, and I came," she an-
swers simply, stooping, as in duty bound, to press her
lips to his cheek.
“Are you well?” he asks, scrutinisingly, struck by
the difference in her appearance
ce last
“Yes, thank you, quite well.”
"I am sorry to see you in such trouble.” There
is a callousness about the way in which these words
are uttered that jars upon Molly. She remembers on
the instant all his narrow spleen towards the one now
gone.
“I am-in sore trouble,” she answers coldly.
A pause.
Mr. Amherst, although apparently full of purpose,
clearly finds some difficulty about proceeding. Molly
is waiting in impatient silence.
“You wished to speak to me, grandpapa?" she
says at length.
“Yes-yes. Only three days ago I heard you
had been left-badly provided for. Is this so?”
“It is."
“And that"-speaking slowly-"you had made up

correctly?”
Quite correctly. Mr. Buscarlet would be sure to
give you a true version of the case."
“The news has upset me." For the first time he
turns his head and regards her with a steady gaze. “I
particularly object to your doing anything of the kind.
It would be a disgrace-a blot upon our name for
None of our family has ever been forced to
work for daily bread. And I would have you remem-

you are an Amherst.”
“Pardon me, I am a Massereene.”
“You are an Amherst." With some excitement
and considerable irritation. “Your mother must count
in some way, and you—you bear a strong resemblance
to every second portrait of our ancestors in the gallery
upstairs. I wrote, therefore, to bring you here that I
might personally desire you to give up your scheme of
self-support and come here to live at Herst as its
mistress.”
“ 'Its mistress!'” repeats Molly in utter amazement.
“And how about Marcia?”
“She shall be amply portioned-if you consent to
my proposal."
She is quite silent for a moment or two, pondering
slowly; then, in a low, curious tone, she says:
“And what is to become of my sister?”
“Your step-sister-in-law, you mean." Contemptu-
ously. “I dare say she will manage to live without
your assistance.”
Molly's blue eyes here show signs of coming fight;
so do her hands. Although they hang open and mo-
tionless at her sides there is a certain tension about

the fingers that in a quick, warm temperament be-
tokens passion.
“And
my
dead brother's children?"
“They too can live, no doubt. They are no whit
worse off than if you had never been amongst them.”
“But I have been amongst them,” cries she with
sudden uncontrollable anger that can no longer be
suppressed. "For all the years of my life they have
been my only friends. When I was thrown upon the
world without father or mother my brother took me
and gave me a father's care. I was left to him a baby,
and he gave me a mother's love. He fed me, clothed
me, guarded me, educated me, did all that man could
do for me and now shall I desert those dear to him?
They are his children, therefore mine. As long as I
can remember he was my true and loving friend;
while you—you—what are you to me? A stranger-

She stops abruptly, fearing to give her passion
further scope, and, casting her eyes upon the ground,
folds one hand tightly over the other.
“You are talking sentimental folly," replies he coolly.
"Listen. You shall hear the truth. I ill-treated your
mother, as you know. I flung her off. I refused her
prayer for help, although I knew that for months be-
fore your birth she was enduring absolute want. Your
father was in embarrassed circumstances at that time.
Now I would make reparation to her, through her
child. I tell you”-vindictively—“if you will consent
to give up the family of the man who stole my Eleanor
from me I will make you my heiress. All the property
is unentailed. You shall have Herst and 20,000l. a
year at my death,”

MOLLY BAWN.
"Oh! hush, hush!”
“Think it over, girl. Give it your fullest considera-
tion. 20,000l. a year! It will not fall to your lot
every day."
“You strangely forget yourself,” says Molly, with
chilling hauteur, drawing herself up to her full height.
“Has all your vaunted Amherst blood failed to teach
you what honour means? You bribe me with your
gold to sell myself, my better feelings, all that is good
in me! Oh, shame! Although I am but a Massereene,
and poor, I would scorn to offer anyone money to
forego their principles and betray those who loved and
trusted in them!”
“You refuse me?" asks he in tones that tremble
with rage and disappointment.
“I do."
“Then go," cries he, pointing to the door with
lifted fingers that shake perceptibly. "Leave me, and
never darken my doors again. Go, earn your bread.
Starve for those beggarly brats. Work until your young
blood turns to gall and all the youth and freshness of
your life has gone from you.”
“I hope I shall manage to live without all you
predict coming to pass,” the girl replies, faintly though
bravely, her face as white as death. Is it a curse he
is calling down upon her?
“May I ask how you intend doing so?” goes on
this terrible old man. “Few honest paths lie open to
You have not yet counted the cost of
your refusal. Is the stage to be the scene of your
future triumphs?"
She thinks of Luttrell, and of how differently he
had put the very same question. O that she had him

near her now to comfort and support her! She is
cold and trembling.
“You must pardon me," she says with dignity, "if
I refuse to tell you any of my plans.”
“You are right in refusing. It is no business of
mine. From henceforth I have no interest whatsoever
in you or your affairs. Go-go. Why do you linger,
bandying words with me, when I bid you begone?”
In a very frenzy of mortification and anger he
turns his back upon her, and, sinking down into the
chair, from which in his rage he has arisen, he lets
his head fall forward into his hands.
A great and sudden sadness falls on Molly. She
forgets all the cruel words that have been said, while
a terrible compassion for the loneliness, the utter bar-
renness of his drear old age grows within her.
Crossing the room with light and noiseless foot-
steps, treading as though in the presence of one sick
unto death, she comes up to him, lays her hands upon
his shoulders, and, stooping, presses her fresh young
lips to his worn and wrinkled forehead.
“Good-bye, grandpapa," she says softly, kindly.
Then silently, and without another farewell, leaves
him-for ever.
She hardly remembers how she makes the return
journey; how she took her ticket; how cavalierly she
received the attentions of the exceedingly nice young
man with flaxen hair suggestive of champagne who
would tuck his railway rug around her, heroically un-
mindful of the cold that penetrated his own bones.
Such trifling details escaped her then and afterwards,
leaving not so much as the smallest track upon her

memory. Yet that yellow-hairy young man dreamt of
her for a week afterwards, and would not be com-
forted, although all that could be done by a managing
mother with two marriageable daughters was done to
please him and bring him to see the error of his
ways.
All the way home she ponders anxiously as to
whether she shall or shall not reveal to Letitia all that
has taken place. To tell her will be beyond doubt to
grieve her, yet not to tell her-how impossible that
will be! The very intensity of her indignation and
scorn creates in her an imperative desire to open her
heart to somebody. And who so sympathetic as Le-
titia? And after all, even if she hides it now, will not
Letitia discover the truth sooner or later? Still-
She has not yet decided on her line of action
when Brooklyn is reached. She is still wavering, even
when Letitia, drawing her into the parlour, closes
the door, and, having kissed her, very naturally says,
“Well?"
And Molly says “Well” also, but in a different
tone; and then she turns pale, and then red—and then
she makes up her mind to tell the whole story.
“What did he want with you?” asks Letitia while
she is still wondering how she shall begin.
“Very little.” Bitterly. “A mere trifle. He only
wanted to buy me.
He asked me to sell myself body
and soul to him—putting me at a high valuation, too,
for he offered me Herst in exchange—if I would

“He did indeed. Was it not noble? Does it not

mistress of the place; and Marcia was to be portioned
off and—I saw by his eyes-banished.”

"Letty! how can you ask me such a question? Be-
sides refusing, I had the small satisfaction of telling
him exactly what I thought of him and his proposal.
I do not think he will make such overtures to me
again. Are you disappointed, Letty, that you look so
strangely? Did you think, dear, I should bring you
home some good news, instead of this disgraceful
story?"
“No.” In a low tone, and with a gesture of im-
patience. "I am not thinking of myself. Last week,
Molly, you relinquished your love-for us; to-day you
have resigned fortune. Will you never repent? In

CHAPTER XVI.
Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,
Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her
beauty.
LONGFELLOW.
It is the end of March-four months later—(barely
four months, for some days must still elapse before
that time is fully up)--and a raw evening—very raw,
and cold even for the time of year-when the train,
stopping at the Victoria Station, suffers a young man
to alight from it.
He is a tall young man, slight and upright, clad in
one of the comfortable long coats of the period, with
an aristocratic face and sweet, keen blue eyes. His
moustache, fair and lengthy, is drooping sadly through
dampness and the general inclemency of the weather.
Pushing his way through the other passengers, with
a discontented expression upon his genial face that
rather misbecomes it, he emerges into the open air, to
find a smart drizzle, unworthy the name of rain, is
falling inhospitably upon him
There is a fog—not as thick as it might be, but a
decided fog—and everything is gloomy to the last
degree.
Stumbling up against another tall young man,
dressed almost to a tie the same as himself, he
smothers the uncivil ejaculation that rises so naturally
to his lips, and after a second glance changes it to
one of greeting.
"Ah, Fenning, is it you?” he says. "This beastly

fog prevented my recognising you at first. How are
you? It is ages since last we met.”
“Is it indeed you, Luttrell?” says the new-comer,
stopping short and altering his sour look to one of
pleased astonishment. "You in the flesh?
look at you.” Drawing Luttrell into the neighbour-
hood of an unhappy lamp that tries against its con-
science to think it is showing light and grows every
minute fainter and more depressed in its struggle
against truth. “All the way from Paddyland, where
he has spent four long months,” says Mr. Fenning,
“and he is still alive! It is inconceivable. Let me
examine you. Sound, I protest—sound in wind and
limb; not a defacing mark! I wouldn't have believed
it if I hadn't seen it. I'm awful glad to see you, old
boy. What are you going to do with yourself this
evening?"
“I wish I knew. I am absolutely thrown upon the
world. You will take me somewhere with you if you
have any charity about you."
“I'm engaged for this evening." With a groan.
"Ain't I unlucky? Hang it all, something told me to
refuse old Wiggins' emblazoned card, but I wouldn't
be warned. Now, what can I do for you?”
“You can at least advise me how best to kill time
to-night.”
"The Alhambra has a good thing on,” says young
Fenning, brightening; "and the Argyll—-"
“I'm used up, morally and physically," interrupts
Luttrell, rather impatiently. “Suggest something calmer
-musical, or that.”
“Oh, musical! That is mild. I have been educated
in the belief that a sojourn in Ireland renders one

savage for the remainder of their days. I blush for
my ignorance. If it is first class music you want, go to
hear Wynter sing. She does sing this evening, happily
for you, and anything more delicious, both in face and
voice, has not aroused London to madness for a con-
siderable time. Go, hear her, but leave your heart at
your hotel before going. The Grosvenor, is it, or the
Langham? The Langham. Ah, I shall call to-morrow.
By-bye, old man. Go and see Wynter, and you will
be richly rewarded. She is tremendously lovely.”
“I will,” says Luttrell; and, having dined and
dressed himself, he goes and does it.
Feeling listless, and not in the slightest degree
interested in the coming performance, he enters the
concert-room, to find himself decidedly late. Some
one has evidently just finished singing, and the ap-
plause that followed the effort has not yet quite died
away.
With all the air of a man who wonders vaguely
within himself what in the world has brought him here
Luttrell makes his way to a vacant chair and seats
himself beside an elderly, pleasant-faced man, too
darkly skinned and too bright-eyed to belong to this
country.
“You are late--late," says this stranger in perfect
English, and, with all the geniality of most foreigners,
making room for him. “She has just sung."
“Has she?” Faintly amused. “Who?"
"Miss-Wynter. Ah! you have sustained a loss."
"I am unlucky," says Luttrell, feeling some slight
disappointment—very slight. Good singers can be
heard again.
"I came expressly to hear her. I have
been told she sings well,”

“Well-well!” Disdainfully. "Your informant was
careful not to overstep the truth. It is marvellous-
exquisite, her voice,” says the Italian with such un-
repressed enthusiasm as makes Luttrell smile. “These
antediluvian attachments," thinks he, "are always
severe.”
“You make me more regretful every minute,” he
says politely. “I feel as though I had lost some-
thing."
“So you have. But be consoled. She will sing
again later on."
Leaning back, Luttrell takes a survey of the room.
It is crowded to excess, and brilliant as lights and gay
apparel can make it. Fans are flashing, so are jewels,
so are gems of greater value still—black eyes, blue,
and grey. Pretty dresses are melting into other pretty
dresses, and there is a great deal of beauty everywhere
for those who choose to look for it.
After awhile his gaze, slowly travelling, falls on
Cecil Stafford. She is showing even more than usually
bonny and winsome in some chef d'ouvre of Worth's,
and is making herself very agreeable to a tall, lanky,
eighteenth-century sort of man who sits beside her and
is kindly allowing himself to be amused.
An intense desire to go to her and put the fifty
questions that in an instant rise to his lips seizes
Luttrell; but she is unhappily so situated that he can-
not get at her. Unless he were to summon up fortitude
to crush past three grim dowagers, two elaborately
attired girls, and one sour old spinster it cannot be
done; and Tedcastle at least has not the sort of pluck
necessary to carry him through with it.
Cecil, seeing him, starts and colours, and then

MOLLY BAWN.
nods and smiles gaily at him in pleased surprise. A
moment afterwards her expression changes, and some-
thing so like dismay as to cause Luttrell astonishment
covers her face.
Then the business of the evening proceeds, and
she turns her attention to the singers, and he has no
more time to wonder at her sudden change of coun-
tenance.
A very small young lady, hidden away in countless
yards of pink silk, delights them with one of the bal-
lads of the day. Her voice is far the biggest part of
her, and awakes in one's mind a curious craving to
know where it comes from.
Then a wonderful ugly man, with a delightful face,
plays on the violon something that reminds one of all the
sweetest birds that sing, and is sufficiently ravishing
to call forth at intervals the exclamation, “Good-
good!” from Luttrell's neighbour.
Then a very large woman warbles a French chan-
sonnette in the tiniest, most flutelike of voices; and
then--
Who is it that comes with such grave and simple
dignity across the boards, with her small head proudly
but gracefully upheld, her large eyes calm, and sweet,
and steady?
For moment Luttrell disbelieves his senses. Then
a mist rises before him, a choking sensation comes into
his throat. Laying his hand upon the back of the
chair nearest him, he fortunately manages to retain his
composure, while heart, and mind, and eyes are centred
upon Molly Bawn.
An instantaneous hush falls upon the assembly;
the very fans drop silently into their owners' laps; not

215
a whisper can be heard. The opening chords are
played by some one, and then Molly begins to sing.
It is some new, exquisite rendering of Kingsley's
exquisite words she has chosen-
O that we two were maying!-
and she sings it with all the pathos, the genius of
which she is capable.
She has no thought for all the gay crowd that
stays entranced upon her tones. She looks far above
them, her serene face-pale, but full of gentle self-
possession-more sweet than any poem. She is sing-
ing with all her heart for her beloved - for Letitia,
and Lovatt, and the children, and John in heaven.
A passionate longing to be near her— to touch
her—to speak to be answered back again-seizes
Luttrell. He takes in hungrily every minutiæ of her
clothing, her manner, her expression. He sees the
soft, gleaming bunches of snowdrops at her bosom
and in her hair. Her hands, lightly crossed before
her, are innocent of rings. Her simple black gown of
some clinging, transparent material-barely opened at
the neck-makes even more fair the milk-white of her
throat (that is scarcely less white than the snowy
flowers).
Her hair is drawn back into its old loose knot be.
hind, in the simple style that suits her. She has a
tiny band of black velvet round her neck. How fair
she is—how sweet, yet full of a tender melancholy!
He is glad in his heart for that little pensive shade,
and thinks, though more fragile, she never looked so
lovely in her life.
She has commenced the last verse:


## p. 216 (#222) ############################################

216
MOLLY BAWN.
O that we two lay sleeping
In our nest in the churchyard sod,
With our limbs at rest
On the quiet earth's breast,
And our souls at home with God!
She is almost safely through it. There is such a
deadly silence as ever presages a storm, when by some
luckless chance her eyes, that seldom wander, fall full
on Luttrell's upturned, agitated face.
His fascinated, burning gaze compels her to return
it. O that he should see her here—singing before all
these people! For the first time a terrible sense of
shame overpowers her; a longing to escape the eyes
that from all parts of the hall appear to stare at her
and criticise her voice-herself!
She turns a little faint, wavers slightly, and then
breaks down.
Covering her face with her hands, and with a ges-
ture of passion and regret, she falls hurriedly into the
background and is gone.
Immediately kindly applause bursts forth. What has
happened to the favourite? Is she ill, or faint, or has
some lost dead chord of her life suddenly sounded again?
Everyone is at a loss, and everyone is curious. It is inter-
esting—perhaps the most interesting part of the whole
performance-and to-morrow will tell them all about it.
Tedcastle starts to his feet, half-mad with agitation,
his face ashen white. There is no knowing what he
might not have done in this moment of excitement
had not his foreign neighbour, laying hands upon him,
gently forced him back again into his seat.
“My friend, consider her,” he whispers in a firm
but soft whisper. Then, after a moment's pause,

217
“Come with me," he says; and, leading the way,
beckons to Luttrell, who rises mechanically and fol-
lows him.
Into a small private apartment that opens off the
hall the Italian takes him, and, pushing towards him a
chair, sinks into another himself.
“She is the woman you love?” he asks presently
in such a kindly tone as carries away all suspicion of
impertinence.
“Yes," answers Luttrell simply.
“Well, and I love her too-as a pupil—a beloved
pupil,” says the elder man, with a smile, removing his
spectacles. “My name is Marigny."
Tedcastle bows involuntarily to the great teacher
and master of music.
"How often she has spoken of you!” he says
warmly, feeling already a friendship for this gentle
preceptor.
“Yes, yes; mine was the happiness to give to the
world this glorious voice," he says enthusiastically.
“And what a gift it is! Rare-wonderful. But you,
sir-you are engaged to her?”
“We were—we are engaged,” says Luttrell, his
eyes dark with emotion. “But it is months since we
have met. I came to London to seek her; but did
not dream that here-here
Misfortune has
separated us; but if I lived for a hundred years I
should never cease-to--"
He stops, and, getting up abruptly, paces the room
in silent impatience.
“You have spoiled her song,” says the Italian
regretfully. “And she was in such voice to-night!
Hark!” Raising his hand as the clapping and ap-

plause still reach him through the door. “Hark! how
they appreciate even her failures."
“Can I see her?"
“I doubt it. She is so prudent. She will speak
to no one. And then madame her sister is always
with her. I trust you, sir-your face is not to be dis-
believed; but I cannot give you her address. I have
sworn to her not to reveal it to anyone, and I must
not release myself from my word without her con-
sent.
“The fates are against me," says Luttrell drearily.
Then he bids good night to the Signor, and, going
out into the night, paces up and down in a fever of
longing aud disappointment.
At length the concert is over, and everyone is de-
parting. Tedcastle, making his way to the private
entrance, watches anxiously, though with little hope,
for what may come.
But others are watching also to catch a glimpse
of the admired singer, and the crowd round the door
is immense.
Insensibly, in spite of his efforts, he finds himself
less near the entrance than when first he took up his
stand there; and just as he is trying, with small regard
to courtesy, to retrieve his position, there is a slight
murmur amongst those assembled, and a second later
some one, slender, black-robed, emerges, heavily
cloaked, and, with some light, fleecy thing thrown over
her head, so as even to conceal her face, and quickly
enters the cab that awaits her.
As she places her foot upon the step of the vehicle
a portion of the white wollen shawl that hides her
features falls back, and for one instant Luttrell catches

sight of the pale, beautiful face that, waking and sleep-
ing, has haunted him all these past months, and will
haunt him till he dies.
She is followed by a tall woman, with a full posée
figure, also draped in black, whom even at that dis-
tance he recognises às Mrs. Massereene.
He makes one more vigorous effort to reach them,
but too late. Almost as his hand touches the cab the
driver receives his orders, whips up his emaciated
charger, and disappears down the street.
They are gone. With a muttered exclamation,
that savours not of thanksgiving, Luttrell turns aside,
and, calling a hansom, drives straight to Cecil Staf-
ford's.
Whether Molly slept or did not sleep that night
remains a mystery. The following morning tells no
tales. There are fresh, faint roses in her cheeks, a
brightness in her eyes that for months has been absent
from them. If a little quiet and preoccupied in
manner, she is gayer and happier in voice and speech
once her attention is gained.
Sitting in her small drawing-room, with her whole
being in a very tumult of expectation, she listens
feverishly to every knock.
It is not yet quite four months since she and Lut-
trell parted. The prescribed period has not altogether
expired; and during their separation she has indeed
verified her own predictions—she has proved an un-
deniable success. Under the assumed name of Wynter
she has sought and obtained the universal applause of
the London world.
She has also kept her word. Not once during all

220
MOLLY BAWN.
these trying months has she written to her lover; only
once has she received a line from him.
Last Valentine's morning Cecil Stafford, dropping
in, brought her a small packet closely sealed and
directed simply to “Molly Bawn.” The mere writing
made poor Molly's heart beat and her pulses throb to
pain, as in one second it recalled to mind all her past
joys, all the good days she had dreamed through, un-
knowing of the bitter wakening.
Opening the little packet, she found inside it a
gold bracelet, embracing a tiny bunch of dead forget-
me-nots, with this incription folded round them:
“There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.”
Except this one token of remembrance she has
had nothing to make her know whether indeed she
still lives in his memory or has been forgotten-per-
haps superseded-until last night. Then as she met
his eyes, that told a story more convincing than any
words, and marking the passionate delight and long-
ing on his face, she dared to assure herself of his
constancy.
Now, as she sits restlessly awaiting what time may
bring her, she thinks, with a smile, that, sad as her
life may be and is, she is surely blessed as few are in
a possession of which none can rob her, the tender,
faithful affection of one heart.
She is still smiling, and breathing a little glad sigh
over this thought, when the door opens and Lady
Stafford comes in. She is radiant, a very sunbeam, in
spite of the fact that Sir Penthony is again an absentee
from his native land, having bidden adieu to English

shores three months ago in a fit of pique, brought on
by Cecil's perversity.
Some small dissension, some trivial disagreement,
anger on his part, seeming indifference on hers, and
the deed was done. He left her indignant, enraged,
but probably more in love with her than ever; while
she But who shall fathom a woman's heart?
“You saw him last night?” asks Molly, rising with
a brilliant blush, to receive her visitor. “Cecil, did
you know he was coming? You might have told me.”
For her there is but one “he."
"So I should, my dear, directly; but the fact is I
didn't know. The stupid boy never wrote me a line
on the subject. It appears he got a fortnight's leave,
and came post-haste to London to find you. Such a
lover as he makes! And where should he go by the
erest chance, the very first evening, but into your
actual presence! It is a romance," says her ladyship,
much delighted; “positively it is a shame to let it sink
into oblivion. Some one should recommend it to the
Laureate as a theme for his next production.”
“Well?” says Molly, who at this moment is guilty
of irreverence in her thoughts towards the great poet.
“Well, now, of course, he wants to know when he
may see you."
“You didn't give him my address?” With an
amount of disappointment in her tone impossible to
suppress.
“I always notice," says Cecil in despair, “that
whenever (which is seldom) I do the right thing it
turns out afterwards to be the
wrong thing. You
swore me in to keep your secret four months ago, and
I have done so religiously. To-day, sorely against my

will, I honestly confess, I still remained faithful to my
promise, and see the result. You could almost beat
me-don't deny it, Molly; I see it in your eyes. If
we were both South Sea islanders I should be black
and blue this instant-it is the fear of scandal alone
restrains you."
“You were quite right.” Warmly. “I admire you
for it; only--
“Yes, just so. It was all I could do to refuse the
poor dear fellow, he pressed me so hard; but for the
first (and now I shall make it the last) time in my
life I was firm. I'm sure I wish I hadn't been—I
earned both your displeasure and his.”
"Not mine, dearest."
“Besides, another motive for my determination was
this: both he and I doubted if you would receive him
until the four months were verily up-you are such a
Roman matron in the way of sternness.”
“My sternness, as you call it, is a thing of the
past. Yes, I will see him whenever he may choose to
come.
“Which will be in about two hours precisely; that
is, the moment he sees me and learns his fate. I told
him to call again about one o'clock, when I supposed
I should have news for him. It is almost that now."
With a hasty glance at her watch. “I must fly. But
first give me a line for him, Molly, to convince him of
your fallibility.”
“Have you heard anything of Sir Penthony?" asks
Molly, when she has scribbled a tiny note and given
it to her friend.
“Yes; I hear he either is in London or was yester-
day, or will be tomorrow—I am not clear which,"

With affected indifference. “I told you he was sure
to turn up again all right, like a bad halfpenny; so I
was not uneasy about him. I only hope he will re-
appear in better temper than when he left.”
“Now confess you are delighted at the idea of so
soon seeing him again?" says Molly, laughing.
“Well, I'm not in such radiant spirits as somebody
I could mention.” Mischievously. “And as to con-
fessing, I never do that. I should make a bad Catholic.
I should be in perpetual hot water with my spiritual
adviser. But if he comes back penitent, and shows
himself less exigeant, I shan't refuse his overtures of
peace. Now, don't make me keep your Teddy waiting
any longer. He is shut up in my boudoir enduring
grinding torments all this time, and without a com-
panion or the chance of one, as I left word that I
should be at home to no one but him this morning.
Good-bye, darling. Give my love to Letitia and the
wee scraps. And—these bonbons—I had almost for-
gotten them.”
“Oh, by the by, did you hear what Daisy said the
other day à propos of your china?"
“No."
“When we had left your house and walked for
some time in a silence most unusual where she is she
said, in her small, solemn way, 'Molly, why does Lady
Stafford have her kitchen in her drawing-room?' Now,
was it not a capital bit of chinamania? I thought it
very severe on the times."
“It was cruel. I shall instantly send my plates
and jugs and that delicious old Worcester tureen
downstairs to their proper place,” says Cecil, laughing.
“There is no criticism so cutting as a child's,"

CHAPTER XVII.
Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal'd.
I strove against the stream, and all in vain.
Let the great river take me to the main.
No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;
Ask me no more. — -The Princess.
Almost as Cecil steps into her carriage, Sir Pen-
thony Stafford is standing on her steps, holding sweet
converse with her footman at her own hall-door.
“Lady Stafford at home?” asks he of the brilliant
but supercilious personage who condescends to answer
to his knock.
“No, sir.” Being a new acquisition of Cecil's, he
is blissfully ignorant of Sir Penthony's name and status.
“My lady is hout.”
“When will she be home?” Feeling a good deal
of surprise at her early wandering, and, in fact, not
believing a word of it.
“My lady won't be at home all this morning, sir.”
“Then I shall wait till the afternoon," says Sir
Penthony, faintly amused, although exasperated at
what he has decided is a heinous lie.
“Lady Stafford gave strict horders that no one
was to be admitted before two,” says flunkey, in-
dignant at the stranger's persistence, who has come
into the hall and calmly divested himself of his over-
coat.
“She will admit me, I don't doubt," says Sir Pen-
thony calmly. "I am Sir Penthony Stafford.”
“Oh, indeed! Sir Penthony, I beg your pardon.
Of course, Sir Penthony, if you wish to wait-

Here Sir Penthony, who has slowly been mounting
the stairs all this time, with Charles, much exercised
in his mind, at his heels—(for Cecil's commands are
not to be disputed, and the situation is a good one,
and she has distinctly declared no one is to be re-
ceived)—Sir Penthony pauses on the landing and lays
his hand on the boudoir door.
“Not there, Sir Penthony," says the man, inter-
posing hurriedly, and throwing open the drawing-
room door, which is next to it. “If you will wait
here I don't think my lady will be long, as she
said she should be 'ome at one to keep an appoint-
ment.”
“That will do." Sternly. "Go!-I dare say,"
thinks Stafford angrily as the drawing-room door is
closed on him, "if I make a point of it, she will dis-
miss that fellow. Insolent and noisy as a parrot. A
well-bred footman never gets beyond 'Yes' or 'No'
unless required, and even then only under heavy
pressure. But what appointment can she have? And
who is secreted in her room? Pshaw! Her dress-
maker, no doubt.”
But for all that he can't quite reconcile himself to
the dressmaker theory, and, but that honour forbids,
would have marched straight, without any warning,
into “my lady's chamber."
Getting inside the heavy hanging curtains, he em-
ploys his time watching through the window the people
passing to and fro, all intent upon the great business
of life-the making and spending of money.
After a little while a carriage stops beneath him,
and he sees Cecil alight from it and go with eager
haste up the steps. He hears her enter, run up the

stairs, pause upon the landing, and then, going into
the boudoir, close the door carefully behind her.
He stifles an angry exclamation and resolves, with
all the airs of a Spartan, to be calm. Nevertheless he
is not calm, and quite doubles the amount of minutes
that really elapse before the drawing-room door is
thrown open and Cecil, followed by Luttrell, comes in.
“Luttrell of all men!” thinks Sir Penthony, as
though he would have said, “Et tu, Brute?” forgetting
to come forward-forgetting everything—so entirely
has a wild, unreasoning jealousy mastered him. The
curtains effectually conceal him, so his close proximity
remains a secret.
Luttrell is evidently in high spirits. His blue eyes
are bright, his whole air triumphant. Altogether he is
as unlike the moody young man who left the Victoria
Station last evening as one can well imagine.
“O Cecil! what should I do without you?” he says
in a most heartfelt manner, gazing at her as though
(thinks Sir Penthony) he would much like to embrace
her there and then. "How happy you have made me!
And just as I was on the point of despairing. I owe
you all—everything—the best of my life.”
“I am glad you rate what I have done for you so
highly. But you know, Tedcastle, you were always
rather a favourite of mine. you forgiven me my
stony refusal of last night? I would have spoken will-
ingly, but you know I was forbidden."
“What is it I would not forgive you?" exclaims
Luttrell gratefully.
("Last night--and again this morning-probably he
will dine this evening,” thinks Sir Penthony, who by this
time is black with rage and cold with an unnamed fear).

Cecil is evidently as interested in her topic as her
companion. Their heads are very near together-as
near as they can well be without kissing. She has
placed her hand upon his arm, and is speaking in a
low, earnest tone-so low that Stafford cannot hear
distinctly, the room being lengthy and the noise from
the street confusing. How handsome Luttrell is looks
ing! With what undisguised eagerness he is drinking
in her every word!
Suddenly, with a little movement as though of sud-
den remembrance, Cecil puts her hand in her pocket
and draws from it a tiny note, which she squeezes with
much empressement into Tedcastle's hand. Then follow
a few more words, and then she pushes him gently in
the direction of the door.
“Now go,” she says, “and remember all I have
said to you. Are the conditions too hard?” With her
old charming, bewitching smile.
“How shall I thank you?” says the young man
fervently, his whole face transformed. He seizes her
hands and presses his lips to them in what seems to
the looker-on at the other end of the room an impas-
sioned manner. “You have managed that we shall
meet-and alone?”
“Yes, alone. I have made sure of that. I really
think, considering all I have done for you, Tedcastle,
you owe me something."
"Name anything," says Luttrell, with considerable
fervour. “I owe you, as I have said, everything. You
are my good angel."
“Well, that is as it may be. All women are angels
-at one time or another. But you must not speak
to me in that strain, or I shall mention some one who

would perhaps be angry.” (“That's me, I presume,”
thinks Sir Penthony grimly.)" "I suppose,”—archly-
“I need not tell you to be in time? To be late under
such circumstances, with me, would mean dismissal.
Good-bye, dear boy-go—and my good wishes will
follow you."
As the door closes upon Luttrell, Sir Penthony,
cold, and with an alarming amount of dignity about
him, comes slowly forward.
“Sir Penthony! you!” cries Cecil, colouring cer-
tainly, but whether from guilt, or pleasure, or surprise
he finds it hard to say. He inclines, however, towards
the guilt. “Why, I thought you safe in Algiers.” (This
is not strictly true.)
“No doubt. I thought you safe-in London-or
anywhere else. I find myself mistaken!”
"I am, dear, perfectly safe." Sweetly. “Don't alarm
yourself unnecessarily. But may I ask what all this
means, and why you were hiding behind my curtains
as though you were a burglar or a Bashi-Bazouk? But
that the pantomime season is over, I should say you
were practising for the Harlequin's window trick."
“You can be as frivolous as you please.” Sternly.
“Frivolity suits you best, no doubt. I came in here
half an hour ago, having first almost come to blows
with your servant before being admitted—showing me
plainly the man had received orders to allow no one
in but the one expected.”
“That is an invaluable man that Charles," murmurs
her ladyship sotto voce. “I shall raise his wages. There
is nothing like obedience in a servant.”
"I was standing there at that window awaiting your
arrival, when you came, hurried to your boudoir, spent

an intolerable time there with Luttrell, and finally
wound up your interview here by giving him a billet,
and permitting him to kiss your hands until you ought
to have been ashamed of yourself and him.”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, lying perdu
in the curtains and listening to what wasn't meant for
you." Maliciously. "You ought also to have been a
detective. You have wasted your talents frightfully.
Did Teddy kiss my hands?" Examining the little
white members with careful admiration. “Poor Ted!
he might be tired of doing so by this. Well-yes-
and---you were saying--"
“I insist,” says Sir Penthony wrathfully, "on know-
ing what Luttrell was saying to you.”
“I thought you heard."
“And why he is admitted when others are denied.”
“My dear Sir Penthony, he is my cousin. Why
should he not visit me if he likes?”
“Cousins be hanged!” says Sir Penthony, with con-
siderably more force than elegance.
“No, no," says Cecil, smoothing a little wrinkle off
the front of her gown, “not always; and I'm sure I
hope Tedcastle won't be. To my way of thinking he
is quite the nicest young man I know. It would make
me positively wretched if I thought Marwood would
ever have him in his clutches. You"-reflectively-
“are my cousin too."
"I am--and something more. You seem to forget
that. Do you mean to answer my question?"
“Certainly—if I can. But do sit down, Sir Pen-
thony. I am sure you must be tired, you are so dread-
fully out of breath. Have you come just now, this
moment, straight from Algiers? See, that little chair

over there is so comfortable. All my gentlemen visit-
ors adore that little chair. No? You won't sit down?
Well-_-"
“Are you in the habit of receiving men so early?”
“I assure you,” says Cecil, raising her brows with
a gentle air of martyrdom, and making a very melan-
choly gesture with one hand, "I hardly know the hour
I don't receive them. I am absolutely persecuted by
my friends. They will come. No matter how disagree-
able it may be to me, they arrive just at any hour that
best suits them. And I am so good-natured I cannot
bring myself to say 'Not at home.'”
"You brought yourself to say it this morning.”
“Ah, yes. But that was because I was engaged on
very particular business."
“What business?"
“I am sorry I cannot tell you.”
“You shall, Cecil. I will not leave this house until
I get an answer. I am your husband. I have the
right to demand it.”
"You forget our little arrangement. I acknowledge
no husband,” says Cecil, with just one flash from her
violet eyes.
“Do you refuse to answer me?"
"I do," replies she emphatically.
“Then I shall stay here until you alter your mind,”
says Sir Penthony with an air of determination, settling
himself, with what in a low class of man would have
been a bang, in the largest armchair the room con-
tains.
With an unmoved countenance Lady Stafford rises
and rings the bell.
Dead silence.

Then the door opens, and a rather elderly servant
appears upon the threshold.
“Martin, Sir Penthony will lunch here," says Cecil
calmly. "And-stay Martin. Do you think it likely
you will dine, Sir Penthony?"
"I do think it likely," replies he with as much
grimness as etiquette will permit before the servant.
"Sir Penthony thinks it likely he will dine, Martin.
Let Cook know. And can I order you anything you
would specially prefer?"
"Thank you, nothing. Pray give yourself no trouble
on my account."
"It would be a pleasure—the more so that it is so
rare. Stay yet a moment, Martin. May I order you a
bed, Sir Penthony?”
“I am not sure. I will let you kno later on,"
replies Stafford, who, to his rage and disgust, finds
himself inwardly convulsed with laughter.
“That will do, Martin,” says her ladyship, with the
utmost bonhomie. And Martin retires.
As the door closes the combatants regard each other
steadily for a full minute, and then they both roar.
“You are the greatest little wretch," says Sir Pen-
thony, going over to her and taking both her hands,
"it has ever been my misfortune to meet with. I am
laughing now against my will—remember that. I am
in a frantic
rage. Will
you
tell me what all that scene
between you and Luttrell was about? If you don't I
shall go straight and ask him.”
“What! And leave me here to work my wicked
will? Reflect-reflect. I thought you were going to
mount guard here all day. Think on all the sins I
shall be committing in your absence."

She has left her hands in his all this time, and is
regarding him with a gay smile, under which she
hardly hides a good deal of offended pride.
“Don't be rash, I pray you,” she says, with a gleam
of malice.
“The man who said 'pretty women were at heart
the kindest' lied," says Sir Penthony, standing over
her, tall, and young, and very nearly handsome. “You
know I am in misery all this time, and that a word
from you would relieve me--yet you will not speak it.”
“Would you”-very gravely—“credit the word of
such a sinner as you make me out to be?”
“A sinner! Surely I have never called you that.”
“You would call me anything when you get into
one of those horrid passions. Come, are you sorry?”
“I am more than sorry. I confess myself a brute
if I ever even hinted at such a word, which I doubt.
The most I feared was your imprudence.”
“From all I can gather that means quite the same
thing when said of a woman.”
“Well, I don't mean it as the same. And, to prove
my words, if you will only grant me forgiveness I will
not even mention Tedcastle's name again."
“But I insist on telling you every word he said to
me and all about it."
"If
you
had insisted on that half an hour ago you
would have saved thirty minutes," says Stafford,
laughing
“ Then I would not gratify you; now Tedcastle
came here, poor fellow, in a wretched state about
Molly Massereene, whose secret he has at length dis-
covered. About eleven o'clock last night he rushed in
here almost distracted to get her address; so I went

to Molly early this morning, obtained leave to give it
—and a love-letter as well, which you saw me deliver
and all his raptures and tender epithets were meant
for her, and not for me. Is it not a humiliating con-
fession? Even when he kissed my hands it was only
in gratitude, and his heart was full of Molly all the
time."
“Then it was not you he was to meet alone?”
Eagerly.
“What! Still suspicious? No, sir, it was not your
wife he was to meet alone.' Now are you properly
abashed? Are you satisfied?”
"I am, and deeply contrite. Yet, Cecil, you must
know what it is causes me such intolerable jealousy;
and, knowing, you should pardon. My love for you
only increases day by day. Tell me again I am for-
given."
“Yes, quite forgiven.”
“And”-stealing his arm gently round her—"are
you in the smallest degree glad to see me again?”
“In a degree-yes.” Raising to his, two eyes, full
of something more than common gladness.
"Really?"
“Really."
He looks at her, but she refuses to understand
his appealing expression, and regards him calmly in
return.
“Cecil, how cold you are!” he says reproachfully.
“Think how long I have been away from you, and
what a journey I have come.”
“True-you must be hungry." With wilful igno-
rance of his meaning.
“I am not.” Indignantly. “But I think you might

-after three weary months, that to me at least were
twelve-you might--"
“You want me to~kiss you?” says Cecil promptly,
but with a rising blush. “Well, I will, then."
Lifting her head, she presses her lips to his with a
fervour that takes him utterly by surprise.
“Cecil,” whispers he, growing a little pale, "do you
mean it?"
"Mean what?” Colouring crimson now, but laugh-
ing, also. “I mean this: if we don't go downstairs
soon luncheon will be cold. And remember, I hold
you to your engagement. You dine with me to-day.
Is not that so?"
“You know how glad I shall be.”
“Well, I hope now,” says Cecil, "you intend to re-
form, and give up travelling aimlessly all over the
unknown world at stated intervals. I hope for the
future you mean staying at home like a respectable
Christian."
“If I had a home. You can't call one's club a
home, can you? I would stay anywhere-with you.”
“I could not possibly undertake such a responsibi-
lity. Still, I should like you to remain in London,
where I could look after you a little bit now and then,
and keep you in order. I adore keeping people in
order. I am thrown away," says Cecil, shaking her
flaxen head sadly. "I know I was born to rule.”
“You do a great deal of it even in your own
limited sphere, don't you?" says her husband, laugh-
ing. “I know at least one unfortunate individual who
is completely under your control."
“No. I am dreadfully cramped. But come; in
spite of all the joy I naturally feel at your safe return

I find my appetite unimpaired. Luncheon is ready.
Follow me, my friend. I pine for a cutlet.”
They eat their cutlets tête-d-tête, and with evident
appreciation of their merits; the servants regarding the
performance with intense though silent admiration. In
their opinion (and who shall dispute the accuracy of a
servant's opinion ?) this is the beginning of the end.
When luncheon is over Lady Stafford rises.
“I am going for my drive," she says. “But what
is to become of you until dinner-hour?"
“I shall accompany you.” Audaciously.
“You! What! To have all London laughing at me!"
“Let them. A laugh will do them good, and you
no harm. How can it matter to you?”
“True. It cannot. And after all to be laughed
at one must be talked about. And to be talked about
means to create a sensation. And I should like to
create a sensation before I die. Yes, Sir Penthony”—
with a determined air-"you shall have a seat in my
carriage to-day."
"And how about to-morrow?"
“To-morrow probably some other fair lady will take
pity on you.
It would be much too slow"-mischiev-
ously—“to expect you to go driving with your wife
every day."
"I don't think I can see it in that light. Cecil”
-coming to her side, and with a sudden though gentle
boldness, taking her in his arms --"when are you going
to forgive me and take me to your heart?”
“What is it you want, you tiresome man?" asks
Cecil, with a miserable attempt at a frown.
“Your love,” replies he, kissing the weak-minded
little pucker off her forehead and the pretended pout

from her lips, without this time saying, “by your leave,
or with your leave.”
“And when you have it—what then?”
“I shall be the happiest man alive.”
“Then be the happiest man alive," murmurs she,
with tears in her eyes, although the smile still lingers
round her lips.
It is thus she gives in.
“And when," asks Stafford, half an hour later, all
the retrospective confessions and disclosures having
taken some time to get through, "when shall I instal a
mistress in the capacious but exceedingly gloomy
abode my ancestors so unkindly left to me?"
“Do not even think of such a thing for ever so
long. Perhaps next summer I may-
“Oh, nonsense! Why not say this time ten years?"
“But at present my thoughts are full of my
dear
Molly. Ah! when shall I see her as happy as-as-
I am?"
Here Sir Penthony, moved by a sense of duty and
a knowledge of the fitness of things, instantly kisses
her again.
He has barely performed this necessary act when
the redoubtable Charles puts his head in at the door
and says:
“The carriage is waiting, my lady."
“Very good," returns Lady Stafford, who, according
to Charles's version of the affair, a few hours later, is
as “red as a peony.” “You will stay here--Penthony"
-murmuring his name with a grace and a sweet
hesitation quite irresistible—“while I go and make
ready for our drive."

CHAPTER XVIII.
When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sighed for thee.
SHELLEY.
In her own small chamber, with all her pretty hair
falling loosely round her, stands Molly before her
glass, a smile upon her lips. For is not her lover to
be with her in two short hours? Already, perhaps, he
is on his way to her, as anxious, as eager to fold her
in his arms as she will be to fly to them.
A sweet agitation possesses her. Her every thought
is fraught with joy; and if at times a misgiving, a sus-
picion of the hopelessness of it all, comes as a shadow
between her and the sun of her content—(for is not
her marriage with Luttrell a thing as remote now as
when they parted?)—she puts it from her and refuses
to acknowledge a single flaw in this one day's brightness.
She brushes out her long hair, rolling it into its
usual soft knot behind, and weaves a kiss or two and
a few tender words into each rich coil. She dons her
prettiest gown, and puts on all the bravery she pos-
sesses, to make herself more fair in the eyes of her
beloved, lest by any means he should think her less
worthy of regard than when last he saw her.
With a final, almost dissatisfied, glance at the
mirror she goes downstairs to await his coming, all her
heart one glad song.
She tries to work to while away the time, but her

usually clever fingers refuse their task, and the canvas
falls unheeded to the floor.
She tries to read; but, alas! all the words grow
together and form themselves into one short sentence:
"He is coming-coming-coming."
Insensibly Tennyson's words come to her, and,
closing her eyes, she repeats them softly to herself:-
O! days and hours, your work is this,
To hold me from my proper place
A little while from his embrace,
For fuller gain of after bliss.
That out of distance might ensue
Desire of nearness doubly sweet,
And unto meeting, when we meet,
Delight a hundredfold accrue!
At length the well-known step is heard upon the
stairs, the well-known voice, that sends a very pang of
joy through every pulse in her body, sounds eagerly
through the house. His hand is on the door.
With a sudden trembling she says to herself:
“I will be calm. He must not know how dearly
he is loved."
And then the door opens. He is before her. A
host of recollections, sweet and bitter, rise with his
presence; and, forgetful of her determination to be
calm and dignified as well for his sake as her own,
she lets the woman triumph, and, with a little cry, sad
from the longing and despair of it, she runs forward
and throws herself, with a sob, into his expectant arms.
At first they do not speak. He does not even kiss
her; only holds her closely in his embrace, as one
holds some precious thing, some priceless possession
that, once lost, has been regained.

Then they do kiss each other gravely, tenderly,
with a gentle lingering.
“It is indeed you," she says at last, regarding him
wistfully with a certain pride of possession, he looks so
tall, and strong, and handsome in her eyes. She
examines him critically, and yet finds nothing wanting.
He is to her perfection, as, indeed (unhappily), a man
always is to the woman who loves him. Could she at
this moment concentrate her thoughts I think she
would apply to him all the charms contained in the
following lines:
A mouth for mastery and manful work;
A certain brooding sweetness in the eyes;
A brow the harbour of fair thought, and hair
Saxon in hue.
“You are just the same as ever," she says pre-
sently, "only taller, I really think, and broader and
bigger altogether.” Then, in a little soft whisper, "My
dear-my darling."
“And you,” he says, taking the sweet face he has
so hungered for between his hands, the better to mark
each change time may have wrought, "you have grown
thinner. You are paler. Darling”—a heavy shadow
falling across his face-"you are well—quite well?”
“Perfectly,” she answers lightly, pleased at his
uneasiness. "Town life-the city air---has whitened
me—that is all.”
"But these hollows?" Touching gently her soft
cheeks, with a dissatisfied air. They are a little sunk.
She is altogether thinner, frailer than of yore. Her
very fingers as they lie in his look slenderer, more fragile.
“Perhaps a little fretting has done it,” she answers,
with a smile and a half-suppressed sigh.

He echoes the sigh; and it may be a few tears for
all the long hours spent apart gather in their eyes, “in
thinking of the days that are no more.”
Presently, when they are calmer, more forgetful of
their separation, they seat themselves upon a sofa and
fall into a happy silence. His arm is round her; her
hand rests in his.
“Of what are you thinking, sweetheart?” he asks
after a while, stooping to meet her gaze.
"A happy thought," she answers. "I am realising
how good a thing it is 'to feel the arms of my true
love round me once again.''
“And yet it was of your own free will they were
ever loosened.”
“Of my free will!" Reproachfully. "No, no." Then,
turning away from him, she says, in a low tone, “What
did you think when you saw me singing last night?”
“That I had never seen you look so lovely in my
life.”
“I don't mean that, Teddy. What did you think
when you saw me singing—so?”
“I wished I was a millionaire, that I might on the
instant rescue you from such a life," replies he, with
much emotion.
“Ah! you felt like that? I too was unhappy. For
the first time since I began my new life it occurred
to me to be ashamed. To know that you saw me re-
minded me that others saw me too, and the knowledge
brought a flush to my cheek. I am singing again on
Tuesday; but you must not come to hear me, I could
not sing before you again.”
“Of course I will not, if it distresses you. May I
meet you outside and accompany you home?”

“Better not. People talk so much-and-there is
always such a crowd outside that door.”
"The nights you sing. Have you had any lovers,
Molly?" asks he abruptly, with a visible effort.
"Several”—smiling at his perturbation--"and two
bona fide proposals. I might have been the blushing
bride of a baronet now had I so chosen."
“Was he-rich?"
“Fabulously so, I was told. And I am sure he was
comfortably provided for, though I never heard the
exact amount of his rentroll."
“Why did you refuse him?" asks Luttrell moodily,
his eyes fixed upon the ground.
“I shall leave you to answer that question,” replies
she with all her old archness. “I cannot. Perhaps
because I didn't care for him. Not but what he was
nice old gentleman, and wonderfully preserved. I
met him at one of Cecil's “at homes,' and he professed
himself deeply enamoured of me. I might also have
been the wife of a very young gentleman in the Foreign
Office, with a most promising moustache; but I thought
of you"_laughing, and giving his hand a little squeeze
_"and I bestowed upon him such an emphatic 'No'
as turned his love to loathing."
“To-morrow or next day you may have a marquis
at your feet, or some other tremendous swell-
and2"
“Or one of our own Princes. I see nothing to
prevent it," says Molly, still laughing. “Nonsense,
Teddy; don't be an old goose. You should know by
this time how it is with me."
"I am a selfish fellow, am I not?” says Luttrell
wistfully. “The very thought that anyone wants to take

you from me renders me perfectly miserable. And yet
I know I ought to give you up-to-to encourage you
to accept an offer that would place you in a position I
shall never be able to give you. But I cannot. Molly,
I have come all this way to ask you again to marry
me, and"
"Hush, Teddy. You know it is impossible.”
“Why is it impossible? Other people have lived
and been happy on 500l. a year. And after awhile
something might turn up to enable us to help Letitia
and the children.”
“You are a little selfish now,” she says, with gentle
reproach. “I could not let Letitia be without my help
for even a short time. And—would you like your
wife to sing in public, for money? Look at it in that
light and answer me truly."
“No," without hesitation. “Not that your singing
in public lowers you in the faintest degree in anyone's
estimation; but I would not let my wife support her-
self. I could not endure the thought. But might not

“You might not”-raising her eyes—"nor would I

I work for those I love, and in that no one
can help me.”
“Are both our lives, then, to be sacrificed?”
“I will not call it a sacrifice on my part,” says the
girl bravely, although tears are heavy in her voice and
eyes. “I am only doing some little thing for him who
did all for me. There is a joy that is almost sacred
in the thought.
It has taken from me the terrible
sting of his death. To know I can still please him,
can work for him, brings him back to me from the

other world. At times I lose the sense of farness and
can feel him almost near."
“You are too good for me," says the
young man
humbly, taking her hands and kissing them twice.
“I am not. You must not say so,” says Molly
hastily, the touch of his lips weakening her.
Two large tears that have been slowly gathering
roll down her cheeks.
"Oh, Teddy!” cries she suddenly, covering her
face with her hands, “at times, when I see certain
flowers or hear some music connected with the olden
days, my heart dies within me-I lose all hope; and
then I miss you sorely-sorely."
Her head is on his breast by this time; his strong
young arms are round her, holding her as though they
would for ever shield her from the pains and griefs of
this world.
“I have felt just like you,” he says simply. “But
after all, whatever comes, we have each other. There
should be comfort in that. Had death robbed us— - you
of me or me of you—then we might indeed mourn.
But as it is there is always hope. Can you not try to
find consolation in the thought that, no matter where
I may be, however far away, I am your lover for
ever?"
"I know it," says Molly, inexpressibly comforted.
Their trust is of the sweetest and fullest. No cruel
coldness has crept in to defile their perfect love.
Living as they are on a mere shadow, a faint streak of
hope, that may never break into a fuller gleam, they
still are almost happy. He loves her. Her heart is
all his own.
These are their crumbs of comfort
sweet fragments that never fail them.

Now he leads her away from the luckless subject
of their engagement altogether, and presently she is
laughing over some nonsensical tale he is telling her
connected with the old life. She is asking him ques-
tions, and he is telling her all he knows.
Philip has been abroad -no one knows where-
for months; but suddenly, and just as mysteriously as
he departed, he turned up a few days ago at Herst,
where the old man is slowly fading. The winter has
been a severe one, and they think his days are num-
bered.
The Darleys have at last come to an open rup-
ture, and a friendly separation is being arranged.
“And what of my dear friend Mr. Potts?” asks
Molly.
“Oh, Potts! I left him behind me in Dublin.
He is uncommonly well, and has been all the winter
pottering—by the by that is an appropriate word, isn't
it?-reminds one of one of his own jokes—after a
girl who rather fancies him, in spite of his crimson
locks, or perhaps because of them. That particular
shade is, happily, rare. She has a little money too-
at least enough to make her an heiress in Ireland.”
"Poor Ireland!” says Molly. “Some day per-
haps I shall go there, and judge of its eccentricities
myself.”
"By the by, Molly," says Luttrell, with an im-
promptu air, "did you ever see the Tower?”
“Never, I am ashamed to say.”
"I share your sentiments. Never have I planted
my foot upon so much as the lowest step of its in-
terminable stairs. I feel keenly the disgrace of such
an acknowledgment. Shall we let another hour pass

without retrieving our false position? A thousand
times ‘no.' Go and put your bonnet on, Molly, and
we will make a day of it."
And they do make a day of it; and are
foolishly, thoughtlessly, unutterably happy as youth
and love combined can be in the very face of life's
disappointments.
as
The first flush of her joy on meeting Luttrell
being over, Molly grows once more depressed and
melancholy.
Misfortune has so far subdued her that now she
looks upon her future, not with the glad and hopeful
eyes of old, but through a tearful mist, while dwelling
with a sad uncertainty upon its probable results.
When in the presence of her lover she rises out of
herself, and for the time being forgets, or appears to
forget, her troubles; but when away from him she
grows moody and unhappy.
Could she but see a chance of ever being able to
alter her present mode of life-before youth and hope
are over-she would perhaps take her courage by both
hands and compel it to remain. But no such chance
presents itself.
To forsake Letitia is to leave her and the children
to starve. For how could Luttrell support them all on
a miserable pittance of 500l. a year? The idea is
preposterous. It is the same old story over again;
the same now as it was four months ago, without
alteration or improvement; and, as she tells herself,
will be the same four years hence.
Whatever Luttrell himself may think upon the sub-

ject he keeps within his breast, and for the first week
of his stay is apparently supremely happy.
Occasionally he speaks as though their marriage
is a thing that sooner or later must be consummated,
and will not see that when he does so Molly main-
tains either a dead silence or makes some dishearten-
ing remark.
At last she can bear it no longer; and one day
towards the close of his "leave,” when his sentiments
appear to be particularly sanguine, she makes up her
mind to compel him to accept a release from what
must be an interminable waiting.
“How can we go on like this,” she says, bursting
into tears, "you for ever entreating—I for ever deny-
ing? It breaks my heart, and is unfair to you. Our
engagement must end. It is for your sake I speak.”
“You are too kind. Will you not let me judge
what is best for my own happiness?”
“No; because you are mad on this one matter."
“You wish to release me from my promise?”
“I do. For your own good.”
“Then I will not be released. Because freedom
would not lead to the desired result."
“It would. It must. It is useless our going on
so. I can never marry. You see yourself I cannot.
If you were rich, or if I were rich-why, then—_"
“If you were I would not marry you, in all pro-
bability.”
“And why? Should I not be the same Molly
then?” With a wan little smile. “Well, if you were
rich I would marry you gladly, because I know your
love for me is so great you would not feel my dear
ones a burden. But as it-yes-yes—we must part.”

“You can speak of it with admirable coolness,"
says he rather savagely. “After all, at the best of
times your love for me was lukewarm.”
"Was it?” she says, and turns away from him,
hurt and offended.
“Is my love the thing of an hour," he goes on,
angry with her and with himself, in that he has dis-
pleased her, “that you should talk of the good to be
derived from the sundering of our engagement? I
wish to know what it is you mean. Do you want to
leave yourself free to marry a richer man?”
"How you misjudge me!" she says, shrinking as
if from a blow. "I shall never marry. All I want to
do is to leave you free to”—with a sob—"to-choose
whom you may."
“Very good; if it pleases you to think I am free,
as you call it, be it so. Our engagement is at an
end. I may marry my mother's cook to-morrow morn-
ing, if it so pleases me, without a dishonourable
feeling. Is that what you want? Are you satisfied
now?"
“Yes.” But she is crying bitterly as she says it.
“And do you think, my sweet," whispers he, fold-
ing her in his arms, "that all this nonsense can take
your image from my heart, or blot out the remem-
brance of all your gentle ways? For my part I doubt
it. Come, why don't you smile? You have every-
thing your own way now you should, therefore, be
in exuberant spirits. You may be on the look-out for
an elderly merchant prince; I for the dusky heiress of
a Southern planter. But I warn you, Molly, you
shan't insist upon my marrying her, unless I like her
better than you."

"You accept the words, but not the spirit, of my
proposition," she says sadly.
“Because it is a spiritless proposition altogether,
without grace or meaning. Come, now, don't martyr
yourself any more. I am free, and you are free, and
we can go on loving each other all the same. It isn't
half a bad arrangement; and so soothing to the con-
science! I always had a remorseful feeling that I was
keeping you from wedding with a duke, or a City
magnate, or an archbishop. In the meantime I sup-
pose I may be allowed to visit your Highness (in
anticipation) daily, as usual?”
“I suppose so." With hesitation.
“I wonder you didn't say no, you hard-hearted
child. Not that it would have made the slightest dif-
ference, as I should have come whether you liked it
or not. And now come out—do; the sun is shining,
and will melt away this severe attack of the blues.
Let us go into the Park and watch for our future prey

CHAPTER XIX.
Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud.
Idylls of the King.
The very next morning brings Molly the news of
her grandfather's death. He had died quietly in his
chair the day before without a sign, and without one
near him.
As he had lived so had he died-alone.
The news conveyed by Mr. Buscarlet shocks Molly
greatly, and causes her, if not actual sorrow, at least
keen regret. To have him die thus, without recon-
ciliation or one word of forgiveness to have him treat
her as he treated her poor mother-to have him go
from this world to the next hard of heart and un-
relenting, saddens her for his soul's sake.
The funeral is to be on Thursday, and this is
Tuesday. So Mr. Buscarlet writes; and adds that, by
express desire of Mr. Amherst, the will is to be
opened and read immediately after the funeral before
all those who spent last autumn in this house. “Your
presence," writes the attorney, "is particurlarly de-
sired.”
In the afternoon Lady Stafford drops in, laden as
usual with golden grain (like the Argosy) in the shape
of cakes and sweetmeats for the children, who look
upon her with much reverence in the light of a modern
and much improved Santa Klaus.
“I see you have heard of your grandfather's death
by your face," she says gravely. "Here, children"-
throwing them their several packages—“take your pro-

perty and run away while I have a chat with mamma
and Auntie Molly."
"Teddy brought us such nice sugar cigars yester-
day," says Rénée, who in her black frock and white
pinafore and golden locks looks perfectly angelic; "only
I was sorry they weren't real—the fire at the end
didn't burn one bit.”
“How do you
know?"
"Because"-with an enchanting smile—“I put it
on Daisy's hand, to see if it would, and it wouldn't;
and wasn't it a pity?”
“It was indeed. I am sure Daisy sympathises with
your grief. There, go away, you bloodthirsty child
we are very busy."
While the children, in some remote corner of the
house, are growing gradually happier and stickier their
elders discuss the last new topic.
"I received a letter this morning," Cecil says,
“summoning me to Herst, to hear the will read. You
too, I suppose?”
“Yes; though why I don't know.”
"I am sure he has left you something.
You are
his grandchild-it would be unkind of him and most
unjust to leave you out altogether, once having acknow-
ledged you."
"You forget our estrangement."
“Nevertheless something tells me there is a legacy
in store for you. I shall go down to-morrow night,
had better come with me."
“Very well,” says Molly indifferently.

showers, Nature is spreading abroad in haste its count-

less charms. Earth, struggling disdainfully with its
worn-out garb, is striving to change its brown garment
for one of dazzling green. Violets, primroses, all the
myriad joys of spring, are sweetening the air with a
thousand perfumes.
Within the house everything is subdued and hushed,
as must be, when the master lies low. The servants
walk on tiptoe; the common smile is checked; conver-
sation dwindles into compressed whispers, as though
they fear by ordinary noise to bring to life again the
unloved departed. All is gloom and insincere melan-
choly.
Cecil and Molly, travelling down together, find
Mrs. Darley, minus her husband, has arrived before
them. She is as delicately afflicted, as properly dis-
tressed as might be expected; indeed, so faithfully,
and with such perfect belief in her own powers, does
she perform the pensive rôle, that she fails not to
create real admiration in the hearts of her beholders.
Molly is especially struck—and knows some natural re-
gret that it is beyond her either to feel or look the part.
Marcia, thinking it wisdom to keep herself invisible,
maintains a strict seclusion. The hour of her triumph
approaches; she hardly dares let others see the irre-
pressible exultation that her own heart knows.
Philip has been absent since the morning; so Molly
and Lady Stafford dine in the latter's old sitting-room
alone; and confessing as the hours grow late to an un-
mistakable dread of the “uncanny," sleep together,
with a view to self-support.
About one o'clock next day all is over. Mr. Am-
herst has been consigned to his last resting-place-a

tomb unstained by any tears. At three the will is to
be read.
Coming out of her room in the early part of the
afternoon, Cecil meets unexpectedly with Mr. Potts,
who is meandering in a depressed and aimless fashion
all over the house.
"You here, Plantagenet! Why, I thought you mar-
ried to some fascinating damsel in the Emerald Isle,"
she cannot help saying in a low voice, giving him her
She is glad to see his ugly, good-humoured,
comical face in the gloomy house, although it is sur-
mounted by his offending hair.
“So I was very near it," replies he modestly, in
the same suppressed whisper. “You never knew such
a narrow escape as I had—they were determined to
marry me
“They!' You terrify me. How many of them? I
had no idea they were so bad as that—even in Ireland.”
“Oh, I mean the girl and her father. It was as
near a thing as possible; in fact, it took me all I know
to get out of it."
“I'm not surprised at that,” says Cecil, with a short
but comprehensive glance at her companion's cheerful
but rather indistinct features.
“I don't exactly mean it was my personal appear-
ance was the attraction," he returns, feeling a strong
inclination to explode with laughter, as is his habit on
all occasions, but quickly suppressing the desire, as
being wicked under the circumstances. The horror of
death has not yet vanished from amongst them. “It
was my family they were after--birth, you know—and
that. Fact is she wasn't up to the mark—wasn't good
enough. Not but what she was a nice looking girl, and

had a lovely brogue. She had money too—and she
had a-father! Such a father! I think I could have
stood the brogue, but I could not stand the father.”
“But why?” Was he a lunatic? Or perhaps a Home-
ruler?”
“No”—simply—"he was a tailor. When first I met
Miss O'Rourke she told me her paternal relative had
some appointment in the Castle. So he had. In his
youthful days he had been appointed tailor to his Ex-
cellency. It wasn't a bad appointment, I daresay; but
I confess I didn't see it."
“It was a lucky escape. It would take a good deal
of money to make me forget the broadcloth. Are you
coming downstairs now? I daresay we ought to be as-
sembling."
“It is rather too early, I am afraid. I wish it was
all done with, and I a hundred miles away from the
place. The whole affair has made me downright
melancholy, I hate funerals—they don't agree with me.”
"Nor yet weddings—as it seems. Well, I shall be
as glad as you to quit Herst, once we have installed
Miss Amherst as its mistress."
“Why not Shadwell, as its master?”
“If I were a horrible betting-man,” says Cecil, “I
should put all my money upon Marcia. I do not think
Mr. Amherst cared for Philip. However, we shall see.
And”-in a yet lower tone—“I hope he has not alto-
gether forgotten Molly."
“I hope not indeed. But he was a strange old man.
To forget Miss Massereene Here he breathes a
profound sigh.
"Don't sigh, Plantagenet; think of Miss O'Rourke,"
says Cecil unkindly, leaving him.

One by one, and without so much as an ordinary
“How d'ye do?” they have all slipped into the dining-
room. The men have assumed a morose air, which
they fondly believe to be indicative of melancholy-
the women, being by nature more hypocritical, present
a more natural and suitable
appearance. All are seated
in sombre garments and dead silence.
Marcia, in crape and silk of elaborate design, is
looking calm but full of decorous grief. Philip—who
has grown almost emaciated during these past months
-is the only one who wears successfully an impres-
sion of the most stolid indifference. He is leaning
against one of the windows gazing out upon the rich
lands and wooded fields which so soon will be either
all his or nothing to him. After the first swift glance
of recognition he has taken no notice of Molly, nor she
of him. A shuddering aversion fills her towards him,
a distaste bordering on horror. His very pallor, the
ill-disguised misery of his whole appearance-which
he seeks but vainly to conceal under a cold and sneer-
ing exterior-only adds to her dislike.
A sickening remembrance of their last meeting in
the wood at Brooklyn makes her turn away from him
with palpable meaning on his entrance, adding thereby
one pang the more to the bitterness of his regret.
Their meeting is to her a trial—to him an agony-
harder to endure than he had even imagined.
Feeling strangely out of place and nervous, and
saddened by memories of happy days spent in this
very room so short a time ago, Molly has taken a seat
a little apart from the rest, and sits with loosely folded
hands upon her knees, her head bent slightly downwards.

Cecil, seeing the dejection of her attitude, leaves
her own place, and drawing a chair close to hers, takes
one of her hands softly between her own.
Then the door opens, and Mr. Buscarlet, with a
sufficiently subdued though rather triumphant and con-
sequential air, enters.
He bows obsequiously to Marcia, who barely re-
turns the salute. Detestable little man! She finds
some consolation in the thought that at all events his
time is nearly over; that probably—nay, surely-he is
now about to administer law for the last time at Herst.
He bows in silence to the rest of the company-
with marked deference to Miss Massereene-and then
involuntarily each one stirs in his or her seat and
settles down to hear the will read.
A will is a mighty thing, and requires nice hand-
ling. Would that I were lawyer enough to give you
this particular one in full, with all its many bequests
and curious directions. But, alas! ignorance forbids.
The sense lingers with me, but all the technicalities,
and running phrases, and idiotic repetitions have
escaped me.
To most of those present Mr. Amherst has left
bequests; to Lady Stafford 5,000l.; to Plantagenet Potts
2,000l.; to Mrs. Darley's son the same. To all the
servants handsome sums of money, together with a
year's wages; to Mrs. Nesbitt, the housekeeper, 2001. a
year for her life. And then the attorney pauses and
assumes an important air, and everyone knows the end
is nigh.
All the rest of his property of which he died pos-
sessed—all the houses, lands, and moneys-all personal
effects—"I give and bequeath to---"

even
Here Mr. Buscarlet, either purposely or otherwise,
stops short to cough and blow a sonorous note upon
his nose.
All eyes are fixed upon him; some,
more curious or eager than the others, are leaning for-
ward in their chairs. Even Philip has turned from the
window and is waiting breathlessly.
"To my beloved grandchild, Eleanor Massereene!”
Not a sound follows this announcement, not a
movement. Then Marcia half-rises from her seat; and
Mr. Buscarlet, putting up his hand, says hurriedly,
“There is a codicil,” and everyone prepares once more
to listen.
But the codicil produces small effect. The old
man at the last moment evidently relented so far in
his matchless severity as to leave Marcia Amherst
10,000l. (and a sealed envelope, which Mr. Buscarlet
hands her), on the condition that she lives out of Eng-
land. And to Philip Shadwell 10,000l. more-and
another sealed envelope-which the attorney also de-
livers on the spot.
As the reading ceases another silence even more
profound than the first falls upon the listeners. No one
so much as glances at the other.
Marcia, ghastly, rigid, rises from her seat.
"It is false," she says, in a clear, impassioned tone.
“It is the will of an imbecile-a madman. It shall
not be." She has lost all self-restraint, and is trembling
with fear and rage and a terrible certainty of defeat.
“Pardon me, Miss Amherst,” says Mr. Buscarlet
courteously, "but I fear you will find it unwise to lay
any stress on such a thought. To dispute this will
would be madness indeed-all the world knows my
old friend, your grandfather, died in perfect possession

of his senses, and this will was signed three months
ago.
“You drew up this will, sir?” she asks in a low
tone only intended for him, drawing closer to him.
"Certainly I did, madam."
“And during all these past months understood
thoroughly how matters would be?”
Certainly, madam.”
"And knowing, continued still—with a view to
deceive me to treat me as the future mistress of
Herst?"
“I trust, madam, I always treated you with proper
respect. You would not surely have had me as rude
to you as you invariably were to me? I may not be
a gentleman, Miss Amherst, in your acceptation of that
term, but I make it a rule never to be-offensive!”
“It was
a low-a mean revenge,” says Marcia
through her teeth, her eyes aflame, her lips colourless;
"one worthy of you. I understand you, sir; but do
not for an instant think you have crushed me.” Rais-
ing her head haughtily, she sweeps past him back to
her original seat.
Molly has risen to her feet. She is very pale and
faint; her eyes, large and terrified, like a fawn's, are
fixed, oddly enough, upon Philip. The news has been
too sudden, too unexpected, to cause her even the
smallest joy as yet. On the contrary, she knows only
pity for him who, but a few minutes before, she was
reviling in her thoughts. Perhaps the sweetness of her
sympathy is the one thing that could have consoled
Philip just then.
“"Farewell—a long farewell to all my greatness,

shoulders. Then, rousing himself, he draws a long
breath, and goes straight up to Molly.
“Permit me to congratulate you,” he says with
wonderful grace, considering all things. He is stand-
ing before her, with his handsome head well up, a
certain pride of birth about him, strong enough to
carry him successfully through this great and lasting
disaster. “It is, after all, only natural that of the three
you should inherit. Surprise should lie in the fact
that never did such a possibility occur to us. We
might have known that even our grandfather's worn
and stony heart could not be proof against such grace
and sweetness as yours.”
He bows over her hand courteously, and, turning
away, walks back again to the window, standing with
his face hidden from them all.
Never has he appeared to such advantage. Never
has he been so thorougly liked as at this moment.
Molly moves as though she would go to him; but Cecil,
laying her hand upon her arm, wisely restrains her.
What can be said to comfort him, who has lost home,
and love, and all?
“It is all a mistake-it cannot be true,” says Molly
piteously. “It is a mistake." She looks appealingly
at Cecil, who wise woman that she is, only presses
her arm again meaningly, and keeps a discreet silence.
To express her joy at the turn events have taken at
this time would be gross. Though not to express it
goes hard with Cecil. She contents herself with glanc-
ing expressively at Sir Penthony every now and then,
who is standing at the other end of the room.
“I also congratulate you," says Luttrell, coming for-
ward and speaking for the first time. He is not nearly

259
so composed as Shadwell, and his voice has a strange
and stilted sound. He speaks so that Molly and Cecil
alone can hear him, delicacy forbidding any open ex-
pression of pleasure. “With all my heart," he adds;
but his tone is strange. The whole speech is evidently
a lie. His eyes meet hers with an expression in them
she has never seen there before—so carefully cold it
is, so studiously unloving.
Molly is too agitated to speak to him, but she lifts
her head, and shows him a face full of the keenest re-
proach. Her pleading look, however, is thrown away,
as he refuses resolutely to meet her gaze. With an
abrupt movement he turns away and leaves the room,
and, as they afterwards discover, the house.
Meantime Marcia has torn open her envelope, and
read its enclosure. A blotted sheet half covered with
her own writing--the very letter begun and lost in the
library last October—that being found, has condemned
her. With a half-stifled groan she lets it flutter to the
ground, where it lies humbled in the dust, an emblem
of all her falsely cherished hopes.
Philip, too, having examined his packet, has
brought to light that fatal letter of last summer that
has so fully convicted him of unlawful dealings with
Jews. Twice he reads it, slowly, thoughtfully, and then,
casting one quick, withering glance at Marcia (under
which she cowers), he consigns it to his pocket without
a word.
The play is played out. The new mistress of
Herst has been carried away by Cecil Stafford to her
own room; the others have dispersed. Philip and
Marcia Amherst are alone.
Marcia, waking from her reverie, makes a move-

ment as though she too would quit the apartment, but
Shadwell, coming deliberately up to her, bars her exit.
Laying his hand gently but firmly on her wrist, he
compels her to both hear and remain.
“You betrayed me?” he says between his teeth.
“You gave this letter”-producing it—“to my grand-
father? I trusted you, and you betrayed me.”
“I did," she answers with forced calmness.
“Why?"
“Because I loved you."
“You!" with a harsh grating laugh. It is with
difficulty he restrains his passion. “You to love! And
is it by ruining those upon whom you bestow your
priceless affection you show the depth of your devo-
tion? Pah! Tell me the truth. Did you want all,
and have you been justly punished?"
“I have told you the truth,” she answers vehe-
mently. “I was mad enough to love you even then,
when I saw against my will your wild infatuation for
that designing-_"
“Hush!” he interrupts her imperiously in a low,
dangerous tone. "If you are speaking of Miss Mas-
sereene, I warn you it is unsafe to proceed. Do
not mention her. Do not utter her name. I forbid
you.”
“So be it! Your punishment has been heavier
than any I could inflict.—You want to know why I
showed that letter to the old man, and I will tell you.
I thought, could I but gain all Herst, I might, through
it, win you back to my side. I betrayed you for that
alone. I debased myself in my own eyes for that sole
purpose. I have failed in all things. My humiliation
is complete. I do not ask your forgiveness, Philip, I

crave only—your forbearance. Grant me that at least,
for the old days' sake!"
But he will not. He scarcely heeds her words, so
great is the fury that consumes him.
“You would have bought my love!” he says with
a bitter sneer. “Know then, that with a dozen Hersts
at your back, I loathe you too much ever to be more
to you than I now am, and that is—nothing."
Quietly but forcibly he puts her from him, and
leaves the room. Outside in the hall he encounters
Sir Penthony, who has been lingering there with in-
tent to waylay him. However rejoiced Stafford may be
at Molly's luck, he is profoundly grieved for Philip.
“I know it is scarcely form to express sympathy
on such occasions,” he says with some hesitation, lay-
ing his hand on Shadwell's shoulder. “But I must
tell you how I regret, for your sake, all that has taken
place.”
“Thank you, Stafford. You are one of the very
few
whose sympathy is never oppressive. But do not be
uneasy about me,” with a short laugh. “I dare say I
shall manage to exist. I have five hundred a-year of
my own, and my grandfather's thoughtfulness has made
it a thousand. No doubt I shall keep body and soul
together, though there is no disguising the fact, I
feel keenly the difference between one thousand and
twenty.”
“My dear fellow, I am glad to see you take it so
well. I don't believe there are a dozen men of my
acquaintance who would be capable of showing such
pluck as you have done."
“I have always had a fancy for exploring. I shall
go abroad and see some life; the sooner the better. I

thank you with all my heart, Stafford, for your kind-
I thank you—and”—with a slight break in his
voice—"good-bye!”
He presses Stafford's hand warmly, and before the
other can reply, is gone.
Half an hour later Marcia, sweeping into her room
in a torrent of passion impossible to quell, summons
her maid by a violent attack on her bell.
“Take off this detested mourning," she says to the
astonished girl. “Remove it from my sight. And get
me a coloured gown and a Bradshaw."
The maid, half-frightened, obeys, and that night
Marcia Amherst quits her English home for ever.

Fare thee well! and if for ever,
Still for ever, fare thee well!
Byron.
“Oh, Cecil! now I can marry Tedcastle," says
Molly, at the end of a long and exhaustive conversa-
tion that has taken place in her own room. She blushes
a little as she says it; but it is honestly her first
thought, and she gives utterance to it. “Letitia, too,
and the children-I can provide for them. I shall
buy back dear old Brooklyn, and give it to them, and
they shall be happy once more.”
“I agree with Lord Byron,” says Cecil laughing.
“Money makes the man; the want of it, his fellow.'
You ought to feel like some princess out of the ‘Ara-
bian Nights' Entertainments.'
“I feel much more like an intruder. What right
have I to Herst? What shall I do with so much
money?"
“Spend it. There is nothing simpler. Believe me,
no one was ever in reality embarrassed by her riches,
notwithstanding all they say. The whole thing is mar-
vellous. Who could have anticipated such an event?
I am sorry I ever said anything disparaging of that
dear, delightful, genial, kind-hearted, sociable, generous
old gentleman, your grandfather."
“Don't jest,” says Molly, who is almost hysterical.

papa! Cecil, I want so much to see Letitia.”
“Of course, dear. Well"--consulting her watch
-“I believe we may as well be getting ready if we
mean to catch the next train. Will not it be a charm-
ing surprise for Letitia? I quite envy you the telling
of it.”
“I want you to tell it. I am so nervous, I know I
shall never get through it without frightening her out
of her wits. Do come with me, Cecil, and break the
news yourself."
“Nothing I should like better,” says Cecil. “Put
on your bonnet and let us be off.”
Ringing the bell, she orders round the carriage,
and presently she and Molly are wending their way
down the stairs.
At the very end of the long, beautiful old hall
stands Philip Shadwell, taking, it may be, a last look
from the window, of the place so long regarded as his
own.
As they see him, both girls pause, and Molly's lips
lose something of their fresh, warm colour.
“Go and speak to him now," says Cecil; and, con-
siderately remembering a hypothetical handkerchief,
retraces her steps to the room she has just quitted.
“Philip!” says Molly timidly, going up to him.
He turns with a start, and colours a dark red on
seeing her, but neither moves nor offers greeting.
"Oh, Philip! let me do something for you," says
Molly impulsively, without preparation, and with tears
in her eyes. “I have robbed you, though unwittingly.
Let me make amends. Out of all I have let me give
you-

"The only thing I would take from you it is out
of
your power to give," he interrupts her gently.
"Do not say so," she pleads in trembling tones.
“I do not want all the money. I cannot spend it. I
do not care for it. Do take some of it, Philip. Let
me share-_-"
“Impossible, child!" with a faint smile.
“You
don't know what you are saying.” Then, with an
effort, “You are going to marry Luttrell?”
“Yes”_blushing, until she looks like a pale, sweet
rose, with drooping head.
“How rich to overflowing are some, whilst others
starve," he says bitterly, gazing at her miserably, filling
his heart, his senses, for the last time, with a view of
her soft and perfect loveliness. Then, in a kinder
tone, “I hope you will be happy, and”-slowly—“he
too, though that is a foregone conclusion.” He pales
a little here, and stops as though half-choking. “Yes,
he has my best wishes-for your sake,” he goes on
unsteadily. “Tell him so from me, though we have
not been good friends of late.”
"I will surely tell him.”
“Good-bye!” he says, taking her hand. Something
in his expression makes her exclaim anxiously,
“For the present?”
“No--for ever. Herst and England have grown
hateful to me. I leave them as soon as possible.
Good-bye, my beloved!” he whispers in deep agitation.
“I only ask you not to quite forget me, though I hope
-I hope I shall never look upon your sweet face
again.”
So he goes, leaving his heart behind him; carry-
ing with him evermore, by land and sea, this only--

the vision of her he loves as last he sees her, weeping
sad and bitter tears for him.
A quarter of an hour later, as Molly and Cecil are
stepping into the carriage meant to convey them to
the station, one of the servants, running up hurriedly,
hands Miss Massereene a letter.
“Another?” says Cecil jestingly as the carriage
starts. “Sealed envelopes, like private bombshells,
seem to be the order of the day. I do hope this one
does not emanate from your grandfather, desiring you
to refund everything."
“It is from Tedcastle," says Molly, surprised.
Then she opens it and reads as follows
“Taking into consideration the enormous change
that has occurred in your fortunes since this morning,
I feel it only just to you and myself to write and ab-
solve you from all ties by which you may fancy your-
self still connected with me. You will remember that
in our last conversation together in London you your-
self voluntarily decided on severing our engagement.
Let your decision now stand. Begin your new life
without hampering regrets, without remorseful thoughts
To you I hope this money may bring happi-
ness; to me, through you, it has brought lasting pain;
and when, a few minutes ago, I said I congratulated
you from my heart, I spoke falsely. I say this only
to justify my last act in your eyes. I will not tell you
what it costs me to write you this; you know me well
enough to understand. I shall exchange with a friend
of mine, and sail for India in a week or two, or at
least as soon as I can; but wherever I am, or whatever
further misfortunes may be in store for me,
be as-
of me.

sured your memory will always be my greatest-pos-
sibly my only treasure.”
“What can he mean?” says Molly, looking up.
She does not appear grieved; she is simply indignant.
An angry crimson flames on her fair cheeks.
"Quixotism!” says Cecil, when she, too, has read
the letter. “Was there ever such a silly boy?”
“Oh! it is worse than anything—so cold, so terse,
so stupid. And not an affectionate word all through,
or a single regret.”
“My dear child, that is its only redeeming point.
He is evidently sincere in his desire for martyrdom.
Had he gone into heroics I should myself have gone
to Ireland (where I suppose he soon must be) to
chastise him. But as it is— Poor Tedcastle! He
looks upon it as a point of honour.”
"It is unbearable,” says Molly angrily. “Does he
think such a paltry thing as money could interfere
with my affection for him?"
“Molly, beware! You are bordering on the heroics
now. Money is not a paltry thing; it is about the best
thing going. I can sympathise with Tedcastle, if you
cannot. He felt he had no right to claim the promise
of such a transcendently beautiful being as you, now
you have added to your other charms twenty thousand
a year. He thinks of your future; he acknowledges
you a bride worthy any duke in the land (men in
love”-maliciously—“will dote, you know); he thinks
of the world and its opinion, and how fond they are
of applying the word 'fortune hunter' when they get
the chance, and it is not a pretty sobriquet.”
“He should have thought of nothing but me. Had
he come into a fortune," says Molly severely, “I should

MOLLY BAWN,
have been delighted, and I should have married him
instantly."
“Quite so. But who ever heard the opprobrious
term, 'fortune hunter,' given to a woman! It is the
legitimate thing for us to sell ourselves as dearly as
we can."
"But, Cecil” —forlornly—“what am I to do now?"
"If you will take my advice, nothing—for two or
three weeks. He cannot sail for India before then,
and do his best. Preserve an offended silence. Then
obtain an interview with him by fair means, or, if not,
by foul.”
“You unscrupulous creature!” Molly says, smiling;
but after a little reflection she determines to abide by
her friend's counsel. “Horrible, hateful letter," she
says, tearing it up and throwing it out of the window.
“I wish I had never read you. I am happier now you
are gone.”
“So am I. It was villainously worded and very
badly written."
“I don't know that,” begins Molly warmly; and
then she stops short, and they both laugh. “And you,
Cecil-what of you? Am I mistaken in thinking you
and Sir Penthony are—are-
"Yes, we are," says Cecil, smiling and colouring
brilliantly. “As you so graphically express it, we
actually-are. At present, like you, we are formally
engaged."
“Really?" Delighted. "I always knew you loved
him. And so you have given in at last?”
“Through sheer exhaustion, and merely with a
view to stop further persecution. When a man comes
to you day after day, asking you whether you love him

yet, ten to one you say yes in the end, whether it be
the truth or not. We all know what patience and per-
severance can do. But I desire you, Molly, never to
lose sight of the fact that I am consenting to be his
only to escape his importunities."
“I quite understand. But, dear Cecil, I am so re-
joiced.”
“Are you, dear?”-provokingly. “And why?-I
thought to have a second marriage, if only for the ap-
pearance of the thing; but it seems I cannot.
are going to Kamtschatka, or Bath, or Timbuctoo,
Hongkong, or Halifax, for our wedding tour, I really
don't know which, and I would not presume to dictate.
That is, if I don't change my mind between that and
this.”
“And when is that?"
“The seventeenth of next month. He wanted to
make it the first of April; but I said I was committing
folly enough without reminding all the world of it. So
he succumbed. I wish, Molly, you could be married
on the same day.”
“What am I to do with a lover who refuses to take
me?” says Molly, with a rueful laugh. “I dare say I
shall be an old maid after all.”

CHAPTER XXI.
Why shouldn't I love my love?
Why shouldn't he love me?
Why shouldn't I love my love,
Since love to all is free?
THREE full weeks that, so far as Molly is concerned,
have been terribly, wearisomely long, have dragged to
their close. Not that they have been spent in idle-
ness: much business has been transacted, many plans
fulfilled; but they have been barren of news of her
lover.
“In the spring a young man's fancies lightly turn
to thoughts of love;" but his thoughts seem far removed
from such tender dalliance.
She knows, through Cecil, of his being in Ireland
with his regiment for the first two of those interminable
weeks, and of his appearance in London during the
third, where he was seeking an exchange into some
regiment ordered on foreign service; but whether he
has or has not been successful in his search she is
supremely ignorant.
Brooklyn, her dear old home, having been dis-
covered on her grandfather's death to be still in the
market, has been bought back for her by Mr. Buscarlet,
and here Letitia-with her children and Molly-feels
happier and more contented than she could ever have
believed to be again possible.
Seated at breakfast, watched over by the faithful
Sarah, without apparent cause for uneasiness, there is,

271
nevertheless an air of uncertainty and expectation
about Mrs. Massereene and her sister that makes itself
known even to their attendant on this particular morn-
ing in early April, of which I write.
In vain does Sarah, with a suppressed attempt at
coaxing, place the various dishes under Miss Masse-
reene's eyes: they are accepted, lingeringly, daintily,
but are not eaten. The children, indeed, voracious as
their kind, come nobly to the rescue, and by a kindly
barter of their plates for Molly's, which leaves them an
undivided profit, contrive to clear the table.
Presently, Molly having refused languidly some
delicate, steaming cakes of Sarah's own making, that
damsel leaves the room in high dudgeon, and Molly
leans back in her chair.
“Tell me again, Letty, what you wrote to him," she
says, letting her eyes wander through the window, all
down the avenue, up which the postman must come,
“word for word.”
“Just exactly what you desired me, dear," replies
Letitia seriously. “I said I should like to see him
once again for the old days' sake, before he left Eng-
land, which I heard he was on the point of doing.
And I also told him, to please you”-smiling—"what
was an undeniable lie—that, but for the children, I
was here alone.”
"Quite right,” says Miss Massereene unblushingly.
Then with considerable impatience, “Will that postman
never come?"
All country posts are irregular, and this one is not
a pleasing exception. To-day, to create aggravation,
it is at least one good half hour later than usual. When

at length, however, it does come, it brings the expected
letter from Luttrell.
"Open it quickly-quickly, Letty," says her sister,
and Letitia hastens and reads it with much solemnity.
It is short and rather reckless in tone. It tells
them the writer, having effected the desired exchange,
hopes to start for India in two weeks at farthest; and
that, as he had never at any time contemplated leaving
England without bidding Mrs. Massereene good-bye,
he would seize the opportunity—she being now alone
(heavily dashed)—to run down to Brooklyn to see her
this very day.
“Oh, Letty! to-day,” exclaims Molly, paling, and
flushing, and paling again. “How I wish it was to-
morrow!”
“Could there be anyone more inconsistent than
you, my dear Molly? You have been praying for three
whole weeks to see him, and now your prayer is an-
swered, you look absolutely miserable."
“It is so sudden,” says poor Molly. “And-he
never mentioned my name. What if he refuses to
have anything to say to me even now? What shall I
do then?"
“Nonsense, my dear. When once he sees you, he
will forget all his ridiculous pride, and throw himself,
like a sensible man, at your feet.”
“I wish I could think so;-Letty," tearfully, and in a
distinctly wheedling tone, "wouldn't you speak to him?"
"Indeed I would not,” says Letitia indignantly.
“What, after writing that lie! No, you must of course
see him yourself. And indeed, my dear child”-
laughing—"you have only to meet him, wearing the
lugubrious expression you at present exhibit, to melt

his heart were it the stoniest one in Europe. See” —
drawing her to a mirror—"was there ever such a
Dolores?"
Seeing her own forlorn visage, Molly instantly
laughs, thereby ruining for ever the dismal look of it
that might have stood her in such good stead.
"I suppose he will dine," says Letitia thoughtfully.
“I must go speak to cook.”
"Perhaps he will take the very first train back to
London," says Molly, still gloomy.
"Perhaps so. Still, we must be prepared for the
worst”—wickedly. “Therefore cook and I must con-
sult. Molly”—pausing at the door—"you have exactly
four hours in which to make yourself beautiful, as he
cannot possibly be here before two. And if in that
time you cannot create a costume calculated to reduce
him to slavery, I shall lose my good opinion of you.
By-the-by, Molly”-earnestly, and with something akin
to anxiety—"do you think he likes meringues?”
“How can you be so foolish?” says Miss Mas-
sereene reprovingly. “Of course if he dines, he will
be in the humour to like anything I like, and I love
meringues. But if not--if not”-with a heavy sigh-
"you can eat all the meringues yourself.”
“Dear, dear,” says Letitia. “She is really very
bad.”
Almost as the clock strikes two, Molly enters the
orchard having given strict orders to Sarah to send
Mr. Luttrell there when he arrives, in search of Mrs.
Massereene.
She has dressed herself with great care, and
very
becomingly, being one of those people who know in-

stantly, by instinct, the exact shade and style that
suits them. Besides which, she has too much good
taste and too much good sense to be slave to that
tyrant, Fashion.
Here and there the fruit-trees are throwing out
tender buds, that glance half shrinkingly upon the
world, and show a desire to nestle again amidst their
leaves, full of a regret that they have left so soon their
wiser sisters.
There is a wonderful sweetness in the air—a
freshness indescribable-a rare Spring perfume. Myriad
violets gleam up at her, white and purple, from the
roots of apple-trees, inviting her to gather them. But
she heeds them not: they might as well be stinging-
nettles, for all the notice she bestows upon them. Or
is it that the unutterable hope in her own heart over-
powers their sweetness?
All her thoughts are centred on the impending
interview. How if she shall fail after all? What
then? Her heart sinks within her, her hands grow
cold with fear. On the instant the blankness of her
life in such a case spreads itself out before her like a
map. The lonely pilgrimage—the unlovely journey,
without companionship, or warmth, or pleasant sun-
shine.
Then she hears the click of the garden gate, and
the firm, quick step of him who comes to her up the
hilly path between the strawberry beds.
Drawing a deep breath, she shrinks within the
shelter of a friendly laurel until he is close to her;
then, stepping from her hiding-place, she advances
towards him.
As she does so, as she meets him face to face, all

her nervousness, all her inward trembling vanishes,
and she declares to herself that victory shall lie
with her.
He has grown decidedly thinner. Around his
beautiful mouth a line of sadness has fallen, not to be
concealed even by his drooping moustache. He looks
five years older. His blue eyes, too, have lost their
laughter, and are full of a settled melancholy. Alto-
gether, he presents such an appearance as should make
the woman who loves him rejoice, provided she knows
the cause.
When he sees her he stops short and grows ex-
tremely pale.
“You here!” he says in tones of displeased sur-
prise. “I understood from Mrs. Massereene you were
at Herst. Had I known the truth, I should not have
come.”
“I knew that; and the lie was mine—not Letitia's.
I made her write it because I was determined to see
you again. How do you do, Teddy?" says Miss Mas-
sereene, coming up to him, smiling saucily, although a
little tremulously. “Will you not even shake hands
with me?"
He takes her hand, presses it coldly, and drops it
again almost instantly.
“I am glad to see you looking so well,” he says
gravely, perhaps reproachfully.
“I am sorry to see you looking so ill,” replies she
softly, and then begins to wonder what on earth she
shall say next.
Mr. Luttrell, with his cane, takes the heads off two
unoffending crocuses that, most unwisely, have started
up within his reach. He is the gentleșt-natured fellow

alive, but he feels a vicious pleasure in the decapita-
tion of those yellow, harmless flowers. His eyes are
on the ground. He is evidently bent on silence. On
such occasions what is there can be matched in
stupidity with a man!
“I got your letter,” Molly says awkwardly, when the
silence has gone past bearing.
“I know."
“I did not answer it."
“I know that too,” with some faint bitterness.
“It was too foolish a letter to answer," returns she
hastily, detecting the drop of acid in his tone. “And
even if I had written then, I should only have said
some harsh things that might have hurt you. I think
I was wise in keeping silence.”
“You ere. But I cannot see how you have fol-
lowed up your wisdom by having me here to-day.”
There is a little pause, and then-
“I wanted so much to see you,” murmurs she in
the softest, sweetest of voices.
He winces, and shifts his position uneasily, but
steadily refuses to meet her beseeching eyes. He
visits two more unhappy crocuses with capital punish-
ment, and something that is almost a sigh escapes
him; but he will not look up, and he will not trust
himself to answer her.
“Have you grown cruel, Teddy?” goes on Molly in
a carefully modulated tone. “You are killing those
poor crocuses that have done you no harm. And you
are killing me too, and what harm have I done you?
Just as I began to see some chance of happiness be-
fore us, you ran away (you a soldier, to show the white
feather!), and thereby ruined all the enjoyment I

277
might have known in my good fortune. Was that
kind?”
“I meant to be kind, Molly; I am kind," replies he
huskily.
“Very cruel kindness, it seems to me.”
“Later on you will not think so."
“It strikes me, Teddy,” says Miss Massereene
reprovingly, "you are angry because poor grandpapa
chose to leave me Herst."
“Angry? Why should I be angry?”
“Well, then, why don't you say you are glad?”
“Because I am not glad.”
“And why? For months and months we were
almost crying for money, and when, by some most for-
tunate and unlooked-for chance, it fell to my lot, you
behaved as though some overpowering calamity had
befallen you. Why should not you be as glad of it as
I am?"
“Don't speak like that, Molly,” says Luttrell, with
a groan.
“You know all is over between us. The
last time we met in London you yourself broke our
engagement, and now do you think I shall suffer you
to renew it? I am not so selfish as you imagine. I
am no match for you now. You must forget me (it
will not be difficult, I daresay), and it would be a down-
right shame to keep you to-to-
“Then you condemn me to die an old maid, the
one thing I most detest; while you, if you refuse to
have me, Teddy, I shall insist on your dying an old
bachelor, if only to keep me in countenance.”
“Think of what the world would say.”
“Who cares what it says? And besides, it knows
we were engaged once.”


## p. 278 (#284) ############################################

278
MOLLY BAWN.
“And also that we quarrelled and parted."
“ And that we were once more united in London,
where you did not despise the poor concert-singer.
Were you not devoted to me then, when I had but
few friends? Were you ashamed of me then?"
“Ashamed of you!”
"Once you threw me over,” says Molly, with a smile
that suits the month, being half tears, half sunshine.
“Once I did the same by you. That makes us quits.
Now we can begin all over again.”
“Think of what all your friends will say,” says he
desperately, knowing he is losing ground, but still
persisting
“Indeed I will, because all my friends are yours,
and they will think as I do.”
Two little tears steal from under her heavily fringed
lids, and run down her cheeks. Going nearer to him
she hesitates, glances at him, shyly, hesitates still, and
finally lays her head upon his shoulder.
Of course, when the girl you love lays her head
upon your shoulder, there is only one thing to be done.
Luttrell does that one thing. He instantly encircles
her with his arms.
“See, I am asking you to marry me,” says Molly,
raising dewy eyes to his, and blushing one of her rare
sweet blushes. “I beg you to take me. If, after that,
you refuse me, I shall die of shame. Why don't you
speak, Teddy? Say, ‘Molly, I will marry you.''
“Oh, Molly!” returns the young man, gazing down
on her despairingly, while his strong arms hold her
fast, “if you were only poor. If this cursed money---"
“Never mind the money. What do I care whether

279
I am rich or poor? I care only for you. If you go
away I shall be the poorest wretch on earth!”
“My angel! My own darling girl!"
“No!” with a little sob. “Say, “My own darling
wife!'"
“My own darling wife!" replies he, conquered.
“Then why don't you kiss me?” says Miss Mas-
sereene softly, her face dangerously close to his; and
Tedcastle, stooping, forges the last link that binds him
to her for ever.
“Ah!” says Molly presently, laughing gaily, although
the tears still lie wet upon her cheeks, "did you imagine
for one instant you could escape me? At first I was
so angry I almost determined to let you go—as punish-
ment; but afterwards”—mischievously—“I began to
think how unhappy you would be, and I relented.”
“Then I
suppose I must now buy you another ring
for this dear little finger," says he smiling, and pressing
it to his lips.
"No"--running her hand into her pocket, "at least,
not an engagement ring. You may get me any other
kind you like, because I am fond of rings; but I shall
have no betrothal ring but the first you gave me. Look”
-drawing out a little case, and opening it until he
sees within the original diamonds—his first gift to her
-lying gleaming in their rich new setting. “These
are yours; I saved them from the fire that day you
behaved so rudely to them, and have had them reset.”
“You rescued them?” he asks, amazed.
“At the risk of burning my fingers, so you may
guess how I valued them. Now they are purified, and
you must never get into such a naughty temper again.
Promise!”

"I promise faithfully."
“Now I shall wear it again,” says Molly, regarding
her ring lovingly, “under happier- how much hap-
pier, circumstances. Put it on, Teddy, and say after
me, 'Darling Molly, pardon me for having compelled
you to ask my hand in marriage!'”
“I will not," -laughing.
“You must. You are my property now, and must
do as I bid you. So you may as well begin at once.
Say it, sir, directly!”
He says it.
“Now you know what a horrible henpecking there
will be for you in the future. I shall rule you with a
rod of iron.”
"And I-shall hug my chains.”
“Think what a life I am condemning you to. Are
you not frightened? And all because I cannot do
without you. Oh, Teddy,” cries Molly Bawn suddenly,
and without a word of warning bursting into a passion
of tears, and flinging herself into his willing arms, "are
you not glad-glad-that we belong to each other
again?"
“Time will show you how glad,” replies he softly.
“I know now I could not have lived without you, my
sweet-my darling!”
