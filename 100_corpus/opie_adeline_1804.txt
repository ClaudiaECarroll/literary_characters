OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
ON THE FIRST VOLUME.
There is a charm associated with the name of Mrs. Opie
which we may not hope to meet with in connexion with writers
of greater pretension and of more modern date. The pathos,
melancholy tenderness, and perfect naturalness of her writings,
have been long acknowledged; they will be appreciated where
ever the English language is spoken. We have no hesitation
in saying that the cause of sound English literature is much
advanced by a republication such as the present. This, the
first volume, contains “ Father and Daughter,” and “Temper,"
tales replete with interest. The volume is finely got up, and
in the hands of the highly respectable house of Longman and
Co., the whole edition may be expected to be equally well
executed. We ought to have stated that this Edition has been
revised and corrected by the Authoress herself.-Morning
Advertiser, Jan, 17, 1844.
The writings of Mrs. Opie are known to a wide circle of
readers, and this edition, which unites neatness and beauty
with cheapness, and has the advantage of being revised and
corrected by her own pen, will spread them amongst a large
additional circle of readers. The melancholy tenderness which
pervades Mrs. Opie's name, the knowledge of the human
heart which they display, the touching pathos they contain,
and the end at which they aim, make out a strong claim to
enduring popularity. Few can open these pages without being
interested in their contents, and fewer still can lay down the
volume without finding the sensibilities touched, and the mind
softened towards the suffering and failing of our kind. The
first volume before us contains the Father and Daughter, and
Temper, or Domestic Scenes, very handsomely printed and
illustrated with 2 engravings.-Chelmsford Chron. Jan. 12, 1844

This is a republication of the best of Mrs. Opie's works; we
speak of the novel of “Temper, or Domestic Scenes," and
which possesses the double merit of enforcing a most useful
truth in domestic life, and that of exemplifying it in a tale
abounding in natural and touching scenes of the family life of
English gentlemen, The important truth of which we are
speaking is, that nothing leads to more misery, to more imme-
diate suffering, and to the infusion of bad passions and feelings
in after life, than the injudicious treatment of temper in chil-
dren by the unwise indulgence of it on the part of parents.
This is exhibited in a very powerful and pleasing tale, in which
the characters are at once natural and striking, and the scenes
such as easily and properly arise out of the situation. Mrs.
Opie, as a writer, may be very briefly characterised as one who
excels most of her contemporaries in two main points, first, a
sound judgment-perhaps a striking common sense would be
the better term-secondly, that of maintaining a uniform pro-
priety in all her characters and manners. From one end of
her works to the other we see nothing to object to, upon the
score of sound religion, correct morals, and an exact propriety
in manners and habits. In a word, good sense is her prevailing
characteristic; and an exact painting of domestic manners, in
such scenes and characters as she selects, is her chief merit.
Her “ Temper” is a very useful as well as a very pleasing
work, and it affords us satisfaction that it is published in this
cheap form, so as to become adapted to general circulation.-
Bell's Weekly Messenger, Jan. 27, 1844.
“ The pleasures of melancholy are suited only to minds of
uncommon susceptibility,--to those persons who may be said to
have a sympathetic taste for distress; and from readers of this
class, the tale of woe now before us will meet with peculiar
acceptance. For ourselves, we own that we have been truly
affected by the perusal of it, since it is replete with interest,
and possesses pathos enough to affect the heart of the most
callous of critical readers."-Monthly Review.

ADELINE MOWBRAY.
A Tale.
CHAPTER I.
In an old family mansion, situated on an estate in
Gloucestershire known by the name of Rosevalley, resided
Mrs. Mowbray, and Adeline her only child.
Mrs. Mowbray's father, Mr. Woodville, a respectable
country gentleman, married, in obedience to the will of
his mother, the sole surviving daughter of an opulent
merchant in London, whose large dower paid off some
considerable mortgages on the Woodville estates, and
whose mild and unoffending character soon gained that
affection from her husband after marriage, which he
denied her before it.
Nor was it long before their happiness was increased,
and their union cemented, by the birth of a daughter; who
continuing to be an only child, and the probable heiress
of great possessions, became the idol of her parents,
and the object of unremitted attention to those who
surrounded her. Consequently, one of the first lessons
which Editha Woodville learnt was that of egotism, and
to consider it as the chief duty of all who approached
her, to study the gratification of her whims and caprices.
But, though rendered indolent in some measure by
the blind folly of her parents, and the homage of her
dependents, she had a taste above the enjoyments which
they offered her. . .


## p. 2 (#18) ###############################################

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
She had a decided passion for literature, which she
had acquired from a sister of Mr. Woodville, who had
been brought up amongst literary characters of various
pursuits and opinions; and this lady had imbibed from
them a love of free inquiry, which she had little difficulty
in imparting to her young and enthusiastic relation.
But, alas! that inclination for study, which, had it
been directed to proper objects, would have been the
charm of Miss Woodville's life, and the safeguard of her
happiness, by giving her a constant source of amuse-
ment within herself; proved to her, from the unfortunate
direction which it took, the abundant cause of misery
and disappointment.
For her, history, biography, poetry, and discoveries
in natural philosophy, had few attractions, while she
pored with still unsatisfied delight over abstruse systems
of morals and metaphysics, or new theories in politics ;
and scarcely a week elapsed in which she did not receive,
from her aunt's bookseller in London, various tracts on
these her favourite subjects.
Happy would it have been for Miss Woodville, if the
merits of the works which she so much admired could
have been canvassed in her presence by rational and un-
prejudiced persons : but, her parents and friends being
too ignorant to discuss philosophical opinions or political
controversies, the young speculator was left to the
decisions of her own inexperienced enthusiasm. To her,
therefore, whatever was bold and uncommon seemed new
and wise ; and every succeeding theory held her imagi-
nation captive till its power was weakened by one of equal
claims to singularity.
She soon, however, ceased to be contented with read-
ing, and was eager to become a writer also. But, as
she was strongly imbued with the prejudices of an ancient
family, she could not think of disgracing that family by
turning professed author : she therefore confined her
little effusions to a society of admiring friends, secretly

lamenting the loss which the literary world sustained in
her being born a gentlewoman.
Nor is it to be wondered at, that, as she was ambitious
to be, and to be thought, a deep thinker, she should
have acquired habits of abstraction, and absence, which
imparted a look of wildness to a pair of dark eyes, that
beamed with intelligence, and gave life to features of the
most perfect regularity.
To reverie, indeed, she was from childhood inclined;
and her life was long a life of reverie. To her the
present moment had scarcely ever existence; and this
propensity to lose herself in a sort of ideal world, was
considerably increased by the nature of her studies.
Fatal and unproductive studies! While, wrapt in
philosophical abstraction, she was trying to understand
a metaphysical question on the mechanism of the human
mind, or what constituted the true nature of virtue, she
suffered day after day to pass in the culpable neglect of
positive duties; and while imagining systems for the
good of society, and the furtherance of general philan-
thropy, she allowed individual suffering in her neighbour-
hood to pass unobserved and unrelieved. While profess-
ing her unbounded love for the great family of the world,
she suffered her own family to pine under the conscious-
ness of her neglect; and viciously devoted those hours
to the vanity of abstruse and solitary study, which might
have been better spent in amusing the declining age of
her venerable parents, whom affection had led to take
up their abode with her.
Let me observe, before I proceed further, that Mrs.
Mowbray scrupulously confined herself to theory, even
in her wisest speculations; and being too timid, and too
indolent, to illustrate by her conduct the various and
opposing doctrines which it was her pride to maintain
by turns, her practice was ever in opposition to her
opinions.
Hence, after haranguing with all the violence of a

true Whig on the natural rights of man, or the blessings
of freedom, she would “ turn to a Tory in her elbow
chair," and govern her household with despotic authority;
and after embracing at some moments the doubts of the
sceptic, she would often lie motionless in her bed, from
apprehension of ghosts, a helpless prey to the most
abject superstition.
Such was the mother of ADELINE MOWBRAY! such
was the woman who, having married the heir of Rose-
valley, merely to oblige her parents, saw herself in the
prime of life a rich widow, with an only child, who was
left by Mr. Mowbray, a fond husband, but an ill-judging
parent, entirely dependent on her!”
At the time of Mr. Mowbray's death, Adeline Mowbray
was ten years old, and Mrs. Mowbray thirty; and like
an animal in an exhausted receiver, she had during her
short existence been tormented by the experimental
philosophy of her mother.
Now it was judged right that she should learn nothing,
and now that she should learn every thing. Now, her
graceful form and well-turned limbs were to be free from
any bandage, and any clothing save what decency required,
-and now they were to be tortured by stiff stays, and
fettered by the stocks and the back-board.
All Mrs. Mowbray's ambition had settled in one point,
one passion, and that was EDUCATION. For this
purpose she turned over innumerable volumes in search
of rules on the subject, on which she might improve,
anticipating with great satisfaction the moment when she
should be held up as a pattern of imitation to mothers,
and be prevailed upon, though with graceful reluctance,
to publish her system, without a name, for the benefit
of society.
But, however good her intentions were, the execution
of them was continually delayed by her habits of ab-
straction and reverie. After having over night arranged
the tasks of Adeline for the next day,—lost in some new

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
speculations for the good of her child, she would lie in
bed all the morning, exposing that child to the dangers
of idleness.
At one time Mrs. Mowbray had studied herself into
great nicety with regard to the diet of her daughter ;
but, as she herself was too much used to the indulgencies
of the palate to be able to set her in reality an example
of temperance, she dined in appearance with Adeline at
one o'clock on pudding without butter, and potatoes
without salt; but while the child was taking her after-
noon's walk, - her own table was covered with viands
fitted for the appetite of opulence.
Unfortunately, however, the servants conceived that
the daughter as well as the mother had a right to regale
clandestinely; and the little Adeline used to eat for her
supper, with a charge not to tell her mamma, some of
the good things set by from Mrs. Mowbray's dinner.
It happened that, as Mrs. Mowbray was one evening
smoothing Adeline's flowing curls, and stroking her
ruddy cheek, she exclaimed triumphantly, raising Adeline
to the glass, “ See the effect of temperance and low
living! If you were accustomed to eat meat, and butter,
and drink any thing but water, you would not look so
healthy, my love, as you do now. O the excellent
effects of a vegetable diet!”
The artless girl, whose conscience smote her during
the whole of this speech, hung her blushing head on her
bosom :-it was the confusion of guilt; and Mrs.
Mowbray perceiving it earnestly demanded what it meant,
when Adeline, half crying, gave a full explanation.
Nothing could exceed the astonishment and mortifi-
cation of Mrs. Mowbray ; but, though usually tenacious
of her opinions, she in this case profited by the lesson
of experience. She no longer expected any advantage
from clandestine measures :—but Adeline, her appetites
regulated by a proper exertion of parental authority, was
allowed to sit at the well-furnished table of her mother,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
and was precluded, by a judicious and open indulgence,
from wishing for a secret and improper one; while the
judicious praises which Mrs. Mowbray bestowed on
Adeline's ingenuous confession endeared to her the
practice of truth, and laid the foundation of a habit of
ingenuousness which formed through life one of the
ornaments of her characterW ould that Mrs. Mowbray
had always been equally judicious !
Another great object of anxiety to her was the method
of clothing children ; whether they should wear flannel,
or no flannel ; light shoes, to give agility to the motions
of the limbs ; or heavy shoes, in order to strengthen the
muscles by exertion ;-when one day, as she was turning
over a voluminous author on this subject, the nursery-
maid hastily entered the room, and claimed her attention,
but in vain ; Mrs. Mowbray went on reading aloud :-
“ Some persons are of opinion that thin shoes are
most beneficial to health ; others, equally worthy of
respect, think thick ones of most use : and the reasons
for these different opinions we shall class under two
heads ”
“ Dear me, ma'am !” cried Bridget, “and in the
meantime Miss Adeline will go without any shoes at all."
“Do not interrupt me, Bridget,” cried Mrs. Mowbray,
and proceeded to read on. In the first place, it is not
clear, says a learned writer, whether children require
any clothing at all for their feet.”
At this moment Adeline burst open the parlour door, and,
crying bitterly, held up her bleeding toes to her mother.
“ Mamma, mamma!” cried she, “you forget to send
for a pair of new shoes for me, and see, how the stones
in the gravel have cut me!”
« This sight, this appeal, decided the question in
dispute. The feet of Adeline bleeding on'a new Turkey
carpet proved that some clothing for the feet was neces-
sary; and even Mrs. Mowbray for a moment began to
suspect that a little experience is better than a great deal
of theory.

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
CHAPTER II.
MEANWHILE, in spite of all Mrs. Mowbray's eccentrici-
ties and caprices, Adeline, as she grew up, continued to
entertain for her the most perfect respect and affection.
Her respect was excited by the high idea which she had
formed of her abilities,-an idea founded on the venera-
tion which all the family seemed to feel for her on that
account -and her affection was excited even to an en-
thusiastic degree by the tenderness with which Mrs.
Mowbray had watched over her during an alarming illness.
For twenty-one days Adeline had been in the utmost
danger; nor is it probable that she would have been able
to struggle against the force of the disease, but for the
unremitting attention of her mother. It was then, perhaps,
for the first time that Mrs. Mowbray felt herself a mother:
-all her vanities, all her systems, were forgotten in the
danger of Adeline,-she did not even hazard an opinion
on the medical treatment to be observed. For once she
was contented to obey instructions in silence; for once
she was never caught in a reverie ; but, like the most
common-place woman of her acquaintance, she lived to
the present moment:-and she was rewarded for her
cares by the recovery of her daughter, and by that
daughter's most devoted attachment.
Not even the parents of Mrs. Mowbray, who, because
she talked on subjects which they could not understand,
looked up to her as a superior being, could exceed Adeline
in deference to her mother's abilities; and when, as she
advanced in life, she was sometimes tempted to think
her deficient in maternal fondness, the idea of Mrs.
Mowbray bending with pale and speechless anxiety over
her sleepless pillow used to recur to her remembrance,
and in a moment the recent indifference was forgotten.
Nor could she entirely acquit herself of ingratitude in


## p. 8 (#24) ###############################################

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
observing this seeming indifference : for, whence did the
abstraction and apparent coldness of Mrs. Mowbray
proceed ? From her mind's being wholly engrossed in
studies for the future benefit of Adeline. Why did she
leave the concerns of her family to others ? why did she
allow her infirm but active mother to superintend all the
household duties ? and why did she seclude herself from
all society, save that of her own family, and Dr. Nor-
berry, her physician and friend, but that she might
devote every hour to endeavours to perfect a system of
education for her beloved and only daughter, to whom
the work was to be dedicated ?
" And yet,” said Adeline mentally, “I am so un-
grateful sometimes as to think she does not love me
sufficiently.”
But while Mrs. Mowbray was busying herself in plans
for Adeline's education, she reached the age of fifteen,
and was in a manner educated; not, however, by her,-
though Mrs. Mowbray would, no doubt, have been sur-
prised to have heard this assertion.
Mrs. Mowbray, as I have before said, was the spoiled
child of rich parents; who, as geniuses were rarer in
those days than they are now, spite of their own
ignorance, rejoiced to find themselves the parents of a
genius ; and as their daughter always disliked the usual
occupations of her sex, the admiring father and mother
contented themselves with allowing her to please herself ;
say to each other, “ She must not be managed in a
common way; for you know, my dear, she is one of
your geniuses,—and they are never like other folks.”
Mrs. Woodville, the mother, had been brought up
with all the ideas of economy and housewifery which at
that time of day prevailed in the city, and influenced the
education of the daughters of citizens.
“ My dear,” said she one day to Adeline, “as you are
no genius, you know, like your mother, (and God forbid
you should! for one is quite enough in a family,) I shall

make bold to teach you every thing that young women
in my young days used to learn, and my daughter may
thank me for it some time or other : for you know, my
dear, when I and my good man die, what in the world
would come of my poor Edith, if so be she had no one
to manage for her! for, Lord love you! she knows no
more of managing a family, and such-like, than a new-
born babe.”
“And can you, dear grandmother, teach me to be of
use to my mother?” said Adeline.
“ To be sure, child; for as you are no genius, no
doubt you can learn all them sort of things that women
commonly know :-80 we will begin directly.”
In a short time Adeline, stimulated by the ambition
of being useful, (for she had often heard her mother
assert that utility was the foundation of all virtue,) be-
came as expert in household affairs as Mrs. Woodville
herself : even the department of making pastry was now
given up to Adeline, and the servants always came to her
for orders, saying, that 'as their mistress was a learned
lady, and that, and so could not be spoken with except
here and there on occasion, they wished their young
mistress, who was more easy spoken, would please to
order :' and as Mr. and Mrs. Woodville's infirmities in-
creased every day, Adeline soon thought it right to
assume the entire management of the family.
She also took upon herself the office of almoner to
Mrs. Woodville, and performed it with an activity un-
known to her ; for she herself carried the broth and wine
that were to comfort the infirm cottager; she herself
saw the medicine properly administered that was to pre-
serve his suffering existence: the comforts the poor
required she purchased herself; and in sickness she
visited, in sorrow she wept with them. And though
Adeline was almost unknown personally to the neighbour-
ing gentry, she was followed with blessings by the sur-
rounding cottagers; while many a humble peasant

watched at the gate of the park to catch a glimpse of
his young benefactress, and pray to God to repay to the
heiress of Rosevalley the kindness which she had shown
to him and his offspring.
Thus happy, because usefully employed, and thus
beloved and respected, because actively benevolent, passed
the early years of Adeline Mowbray; and thus was she
educated, before her mother had completed her system
of education.
It was not long before Adeline took on herself a still
more important office. Mrs. Mowbray's steward was
detected in very dishonest practices ; but, as she was
too much devoted to her studies to like to look into her
affairs with a view to dismiss him, she could not be
prevailed on to discharge him from her service. Fortu-
nately, however, her father on his death-bed made it his
request that she would do so; and Mrs. Mowbray pledged
herself to obey him.
“But what shall I do for a steward in Davison's place?”
said she soon after her father died.
“ Is one absolutely necessary?” returned Adeline
modestly. “ Surely farmer Jenkins would undertake to
do all that is necessary for half the money; and, if he
were properly overlooked-
“ And pray who can overlook him properly?” asked
Mrs. Mowbray.
“My grandmother and I,” replied Adeline timidly :
« we both like business and —
“ Like business ! but what do you know of it?”
“ Know !” cried Mrs. Woodville, « why, daughter,
Lina is very clever at it, I assure you !"
“ Astonishing! She knows nothing yet of accounts.”
“ Dear me! how mistaken you are, child ! She knows
accounts perfectly well.”
“ Impossible !” replied Mrs. Mowbray : “ who should
have taught her? I have been inventing an easy method
of learning arithmetic, by which I was going to teach
her in a few months.”


## p. 11 (#27) ##############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
11
“ Yes, child: but I, thinking it a pity that the poor
girl should learn nothing, like, till she was to learn every
thing, taught her according to the old way; and I
cannot but say she took to it very kindly. Did not you,
Lina ?”
“ Yes, grandmother,” said Adeline ; " and as I love
arithmetic very much, I am quite anxious to keep all my
mother's accounts, and overlook the accounts of the
person whom she shall employ to manage her estates in
future.”
To this Mrs. Mowbray, half pleased and half morti-
fied, at length consented; and Adeline and farmer
Jenkins entered upon their occupations. Shortly after
Mrs. Woodville was seized with her last illness; and
Adeline neglected every other duty, and Mrs. Mowbray
her studies, “ to watch, and weep, beside a parent's
bed.”
But watch and weep was all that Mrs. Mowbray did :
with every possible wish to be useful, she had so long
given way to habits of abstraction, and neglect of every-
day occupations, that she was rather a hindrance than a
help in the sick-room.
During Adeline's illness, excessive fear of losing her
only child had indeed awakened her to unusual exertion;
and as all that she had to do was to get down, at stated
times, a certain quantity of wine and nourishment, her
task though wearisome was not difficult: but to sooth
the declining hours of an aged parent, to please the
capricious appetite of decay, to assist with ready and
skilful alacrity the shaking hand of the invalid, jealous
of waiting on herself and wanting to be cheated into
being waited upon ;—these trifling yet important details
did not suit the habits of Mrs. Mowbray. But Adeline
was versed in them all; and her mother, conscious of
her superiooity in these things, was at last contented to
sit by inactive, though not unmoved.
One day, when Mrs. Mowbray had been prevailed

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
upon to lie down for an hour or two in another apartment,
and Adeline was administering to Mrs. Woodville some
broth which she had made herself, the old lady pressed
her hand affectionately, and cried, “ Ah! child, in a
lucky hour I made bold to interfere, and teach you what
your mother was too clever to learn. Wise was I to think
one genius enough in a family,-else, what should I have
done now? My daughter, though the best child in the
world, could never have made such nice broth as this to
comfort me, so hot, and boiled to a minute like! bless
her! she'd have tried, that she would, but ten to one
but she'd have smoked it, overturned it, and scalt her
fingers into the bargain.—Ah, Lina, Lina! maybap the
time will come when you, should you have a sick husband
or a child to nurse, may bless your poor grandmother
for having taught you to be useful.”
“ Dear grandmother,” said Adeline tenderly, “ the
time has come: I am, you see, useful to you; and there-
fore I bless you already for having taught me to be so."
- Good girl, good girl! just what I would have you !
And forgive me, Lina, when I own that I have often
thanked God for not making you a genius! Not but
what no child can behave better than mine; for, with
all her wit and learning, she was always so respectful,
and so kind to me and my dear good man, that I am
sure I could not but rejoice in such a daughter; though,
to be sure, I used to wish she was more conversible like;
for, as to the matter of a bit of chat, we never gossiped
together in our lives. And though, to be sure, the
squires' ladies about are none of the brightest, and not
to compare with my Edith, yet still they would have done
for me and my dear good man to gossip a bit with. So
I was vexed when my daughter declared she wanted all
her time for her studies, and would not visit any body,
no, not even Mrs. Norberry, who is to be sure a very
good sort of a woman, though a little given to speak ill
of her neighbours. But then so we are all, you know:

and, as I say, why, if one spoke well of all alike, what
would be the use of one person's being better than his
neighbours, except for conscience's sake? But, as I
was going to say, my daughter was pleased to compliment
me, and declare she was sure I could amuse myself with-
out visiting women so much inferior to me; and she
advised my beginning a course of study, as she called it."
“ And did you ?” asked Adeline with surprise.
“ Yes. To oblige her, my good man and I began to
read one Mr. Locke on the Conduct of the Human Under-
standing; which my daughter said would teach us to
think.”
“ To think ?” said Adeline.
“ Yes.—Now, you must know, my poor husband did
not look upon it as very respectful like in Edith to say
that, because it seemed to say that we had lived all these
years without having thought at all ;' which was not true,
to be sure, because we were never thoughtless like, and
my husband was so staid when a boy that he was called
a little old man.”
“ But I am sure,” said Adeline, half smiling, “ that
my mother did not mean to insinuate that you wanted
proper thought.”
“No, I dare say not,” resumed the old lady, “and
so I told my husband, and so we set to study this book:
but, dear me! it was Hebrew Greek to us—and so dull !”
“ Then you did not get through it, I suppose?”
“ Through it, bless your heart ! No-not three pages!
So my good man says to Edith, says he, 'You gave us
this book, I think, child, to teach us to think ? · Yes,
sir,' says she. And it has taught us to think,' says he :
- it has taught us to think that it is very dull and dis-
agreeable.' So my daughter laughed, and said her father
was witty ; but, poor soul! he did not mean it.
- Well, then : as, to amuse us, we liked to look at
the stars sometimes, she told us we had better learn their
names, and study astronomy; and so we began that :

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
but that was just as bad as Mr. Locke; and we knew no
more of the stars and planets, than the man in the
moon. Yet that's not right to say, neither; for, as he
is so much nearer the stars, he must know more about
them than any one whosomever. So at last my daughter
found out that learning was not our taste; so she left us
to please ourselves, and play cribbage and draughts in
an evening as usual.”
Here the old lady paused, and Adeline said affection-
ately, “ Dear grandmother, I doubt you exert yourself
too much: so much talking can't be good for you."
“O ! yes, child !” replied Mrs. Woodville : « it is no
trouble at all to me, I assure you, but quite natural and
pleasant like: besides, you know I shall not be able to
talk much longer, so let me make the most of my time
now."
This speech brought tears into the eyes of Adeline;
and seeing her mother re-enter the room, she withdrew
to conceal the emotion which she felt, lest the cheerful
loquacity of the invalid, which she was fond of indulg-
ing, should be checked by seeing her tears. But it had
already received a check from the presence of Mrs.
Mowbray, of whose superior abilities Mrs. Woodville
was so much in awe, that, concluding her daughter
could not bear to hear her nonsense, the old lady smiled
kindly on her when with a look of tender anxiety she
hastened to her bedside, and then, holding her hand,
composed herself to sleep.
In a few days more, she breathed her last on the
supporting arm of Adeline; and lamented in her dying
moments, that she had nothing valuable in money to
leave, in order to show Adeline how sensible she was of
her affectionate attentions : “but you are an only child,”
she added, “ and all your mother has will be yours.”
“ No doubt,” observed Mrs. Mowbray eagerly; and
her mother died contented.

CHAPTER III.
At this period Adeline's ambition had led her to form
new plans, which Mrs. Woodville's death left her at
liberty to put in execution. Whenever the old lady re-
minded her that she was no genius, Adeline had felt
as much degraded as if she had said that she was no
conjuror; and though she was too humble to suppose
that she could ever equal her mother, she was resolved
to try to make herself more worthy of her, by imitating
her in those pursuits and studies on which were founded
Mrs. Mowbray's pretensions to superior talents.
She therefore made it her business to inqnire what
those studies and pursuits were ; and finding that Mrs.
Mowbray's noted superiority was built on her passion
for abstruse speculations, Adeline eagerly devoted her
leisure hours to similar studies : but, unfortunately,
these new theories, and these romantic reveries, which
only served to amuse Mrs. Mowbray's fancy, her more
enthusiastic daughter resolved to make conscientiously
the rules of her practice. And while Mrs. Mowbray ex-
pended her eccentric philosophy in words, as Mr. Shandy
did his grief, Adeline carefully treasured up hers in her
heart, to be manifested only by its fruits.
One author in particular, by a train of reasoning
captivating though sophistical, and plausible though
absurd, made her a delighted convert to his opinions,
and prepared her young and impassioned heart for the
practice of vice, by filling her mind, ardent in the love
of virtue, with new and singular opinions on the subject
of moral duty. On the works of this writer Adeline had
often heard her mother descant in terms of the highest
praise ; but she did not feel herself so completely his
convert on her own conviction, till she had experienced
the fatal fascination of his style, and been conveyed by

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
his bewitching pen from the world as it, into a world as
it ought to be.
This writer, whose name was Glenmurray, amongst
other institutions, attacked the institution of marriage;
and after having elaborately pointed out its folly and
its wickedness, he drew so delightful a picture of the
superior purity, as well as happiness, of an union
cemented by no ties but those of love and honour, that
Adeline, wrought to the highest pitch of enthusiasm for
a new order of things, entered into a solemn compact
with herself to act, when she was introduced into
society, according to the rules laid down by this writer.
Unfortunately for her, she had no opportunity of
hearing these opinions combated by the good sense and
sober experience of Dr. Norberry then their sole visitant;
for at this time the American war was the object of
attention to all Europe: and as Mrs. Mowbray, as well
as Dr. Norberry, were deeply interested in this subject,
they scarcely ever talked on any other; and even
Glenmurray and his theories were driven from Mrs.
Mowbray's remembrance by political tracts and the eager
anxieties of a politician. Nor had she even leisure to
observe, that while she was feeling all the generous
anxiety of a citizen of the world for the sons and
daughters of American independence, her own child
was imbibing, through her means, opinions dangerous
to her well-being as a member of any civilized society,
and laying, perhaps, the foundation to herself and her
mother of future misery and disgrace. Alas! the astro-
loger in the fable was but too like Mrs. Mowbray!
But even had Adeline had an opportunity of discuss-
ing her new opinions with Dr. Norberry, it is not at all
certain that she would have had the power.
Mrs. Mowbray was, if I may be allowed the expression,
a showing-off woman, and loved the information which
she acquired, less for its own sake than for the supposed
importance which it gave her amongst her acquaintance,

17
and the means of displaying her superiority over other
women. Before she secluded herself from society in
order to study education, she had been the terror of the
ladies in the neighbourhood; since, despising small talk,
she would always insist on making the gentlemen of her
acquaintance (as much terrified sometimes as their wives)
engage with her in some literary or political conversation.
She wanted to convert every drawing-room into an arena
for the mind, and all her guests into intellectual gladia-
tors. She was often heard to interrupt two grave ma-
trons in an interesting discussion of an accouchement,
by asking them if they had read a new theological tract,
or a pamphlet against the minister? If they softly ex-
patiated on the lady-like fatigue of body which they had
endured, she discoursed in choice terms on the energies
of the mind; and she never received or paid visits with-
out convincing the company that she was the most wise,
most learned, and most disagreeable of companions.
But Adeline, on the contrary, studied merely from the
love of study, and not with a view to shine in conversa-
tion; nor dared she venture to expatiate on subjects
which she had often heard Mrs. Woodville say were very
rarely canvassed, or even alluded to, by women. She
remained silent. therefore, on the subject nearest her
heart, from choice as well as necessity, in the presence of
Dr. Norberry, till at length she imbibed the political
mania herself, and soon found it impossible to conceal
the interest which she took in the success of the infant
republic. She therefore one day put into the doctor's
hands some bouts rimes which she had written on some
recent victory of the American arms; exclaiming with a
smile, “I, too, am a politician !” and was rewarded by
an exclamation of “Why girl-I protest you are as clever
as your mother!”
This unexpected declaration fixed her in the path of
literary ambition: and though wisely resolved to fulfil,
as usual, every feminine duty, Adeline was convinced


## p. 18 (#34) ##############################################

18
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
that she, like her mother, had a right to be an author, a
politician, and a philosopher; while Dr. Norberry's
praises of her daughter convinced Mrs. Mowbray, that
almost unconsciously she had educated her into a prodigy,
and confirmed her in her intention of exhibiting herself
and Adeline to the admiring world during the next season
at Bath ; for at Bath she expected to receive that ad-
miration which she had vainly sought in London.
Soon after their marriage, Mr. Mowbray had carried
his lovely bride to the metropolis, where she expected to
receive the same homage which had been paid to her
charms at the assize-balls in her neighbourhood. What
then must have been her disappointment, when, instead
of hearing as she passed, “That is Miss Woodville, the
rich heiress or the great genius—or the great beauty”
-or, “ That is the beautiful Mrs. Mowbray,” she walked
unknown and unobserved in public and in private, and
found herself of as little importance in the wide world of
the metropolis, as the most humble of her acquaintance
in a country ball-room. True, she had beauty, but then
it was unset-off by fashion ; nay, more, it was eclipsed
by unfashionable and tasteless attire; and her manner,
though stately and imposing in an assembly where she
was known, was wholly unlike the manners of the world,
and in a London party appeared arrogant and offensive.
Her remarks, too, wise as they appeared to her and Mr.
Mowbray, excited little attention, -as the few persons to
whom they were known in the metropolis were wholly
ignorant of her high pretensions, and knew not that they
were discoursing with a professed genius, and the oracle
of a provincial circle. Some persons, indeed, surprised
at hearing from the lips of eighteen, observations on mo-
rals, theology, and politics, listened to her with wonder,
and even attention, but turned away observing-
« Such things, 'tis true, are neither new nor rare,
The only wonder is, how they got there:”

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
19
till at length, disappointed, mortified, and disgusted,
Mrs. Mowbray impatiently returned to Rosevalley, where
in beauty, in learning, and in grandeur she was un-
rivalled, and where she might deal out her dogmas, sure
of exciting respectful attention, however she might fail of
calling forth a more flattering tribute from her auditors.
But in the narrower field of Bath she expected to shine
forth with greater éclat than in London, and to obtain
admiration more worthy of her acceptance than any
which a country circle could offer. To Bath, therefore,
she prepared to go; and the young heart of Adeline beat
high with pleasure at the idea of mixing with that busy
world which her fancy had often clothed in the most
winning attractions.
But her joy, and Mrs. Mowbray's, was a little over-
clouded at the moment of their departure, by the sight
of Dr. Norberry's melancholy countenance. What was
to be, as they fondly imagined, their gain, was his loss,
and with a full heart he came to bid them adieu.
For Adeline he had conceived not only affection, but
esteem amounting almost to veneration ; for she appeared
to him to unite various and opposing excellencies.
Though possessed of taste and talents for literature, she
was skilled in the minutest details of housewifery and
feminine occupations: and at the same time she bore
her faculties so meekly, that she never wounded the self-
love of any one, by arrogating to herself any superiority.
Such Adeline appeared to her excellent old friend; and
his affection for her was, perhaps, increased by the ne-
cessity which he was under of concealing it at home.
The praises of Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline were odious
to the ears of Mrs. Norberry and her daughters,—but
especially the praises of the latter,—as the merit of
Adeline was so uniform, that even the eye of envy could
not at that period discover any thing in her vulnera-
ble to censure : and as the sound of her name excited in
his family a number of bad passions and corresponding
c 2

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
expressions of countenance, the doctor wisely resolved
to keep his feelings, with regard to her, locked up in his
own bosom.
But he persisted in visiting at the Park daily; and it
is no wonder, therefore, that the loss, even for a few
months, of the society of its inhabitants should by him
be anticipated as a serious calamity.
“Pshaw!” cried he, as Adeline, with an exulting
bound sprung after her mother into the carriage, “ how
gay and delighted you are! though my heart feels sadly
queer and heavy.”
« My dear friend,” cried Mrs. Mowbray, “I must
miss your society wherever I go.”—“ I wish you were
going too,” said Adeline : “I shall often think of you."
“ Pshaw, girl! don't lie," replied Dr. Norberry, swal-
lowing a sigh as he spoke: “you will soon forget an old
fellow like me.”—“ Then I conclude that you will soon
forget us.”—“He! how! what! think so at your peril."
-"I must think so, as we usually judge of others by
ourselves.”—“Go to-go, miss mal-a-pert.-Well, but,
drive on, coachman—this taking leave is plaguy dis-
agreeable, so shake hands and be off.”
They gave him their hands, which he pressed very
affectionately, and the carriage drove on.
“I am an old fool,” cried the doctor, wiping his eyes
as the carriage disappeared. “ Well: Heaven grant,
sweet innocent, that you may return to me as happy and
spotless as you now are!”
Mrs. Mowbray had been married at a very early age,
and had accepted in Mr. Mowbray the first man who
addressed her : consequently that passion for personal
admiration, so natural to women, had in her never been
gratified, nor even called forth. But seeing herself, at
the age of thirty-eight, possessed of almost undiminished
beauty, she recollected that her charms had never re-
ceived that general homage for which nature intended
them; and she who at twenty had disregarded, even to

21
a fault, the ornaments of dress, was now, at the age of
thirty-eight, eager to indulge in the extremes of decora-
tion, and to share in the delights of conquest and ad-
miration with her youthful and attractive daughter.
Attractive, rather than handsome, was the epithet best
suited to describe Adeline Mowbray. Her beauty was
the beauty of expression of countenance, not regularity
of feature, though the uncommon fairness and delicacy
of her complexion, the lustre of her hazel eyes, her long
dark eye-lashes, and the profusion of soft light hair which
curled over the ever-mantling colour of her cheek, gave
her some pretensions to what is denominated beauty.
But her own sex declared she was plain—and perhaps
they were right—though the other protested against the
decision-and probably they were right also: but women
criticize in detail, men admire in the aggregate. Women
reason, and men feel, when passing judgment on female
beauty: and when a woman declares another to be plain,
the chances are that she is right in her opinion, as she
cannot, from her being a woman, feel the charm of that
power to please, that “ something than beauty dearer,"
which often throws a veil over the irregularity of fea-
tures, and obtains, for even a plain woman, from men at
least, the appellation of pretty.
Whether Adeline's face were plain or not, her form
could defy even the severity of female criticism. She
was indeed tall, almost to a masculine degree; but such
were the roundness and proportion of her limbs, such
the symmetry of her whole person, such the lightness
and gracefulness of her movements, and so truly femi-
nine were her look and manner, that superior height
was forgotten in the superior loveliness of her figure.
It is not to be wondered at, then, that Miss Mowbray
was an object of attention and admiration at Bath, as
soon as she appeared, nor that her mother had her share
of flattery and followers. Indeed, when it was known
that Mrs. Mowbray was a rich widow, and Adeline de-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
pendent upon her, the mother became, in the eyes of
some people, much more attractive than her daughter.
It was impossible, however, that, in such a place as
Bath, Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline could make, or rather
retain, a general acquaintance. Their opinions on most
subjects were so very different from those of the world,
and they were so little consciaụs, from the retirement in
which they lived, that this difference existed, or was
likely to make them enemies, that not a day elapsed in
which they did not shock the prejudices of some, and
excite the contemptuous pity of others; and they soon
saw their acquaintance coolly dropped by those who, as
persons of family and fortune, had on their first arrival
sought it with eagerness.
But this was not entirely owing to the freedom of
their sentiments on politics, or on other subjects; but,
because they associated with a well-known but obnoxious
author ;-a man whose speculations had delighted the
inquiring but ignorant lover of novelty, terrified the
timid idolater of ancient usages, and excited the regret
of the cool and rational observer :-regret, that elo-
quence so overwhelming, powers of reasoning so acute,
activity of research so praise-worthy, and a love of inves-
tigation so ardent, should be thrown away on the dis-
cussion of moral and political subjects, incapable of
teaching the world to build up again with more beauty
and propriety, a fabric, which they were perhaps, calcu-
lated to pull down: in short, Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline
associated with Glenmurray, that author over whose
works they had long delighted to meditate, and who
had completely led their imagination captive, before the
fascination of his countenance and manners had come
in aid of his eloquence.

CHAPTER IV.
FREDERIC GLENMURRAY was a man of family, and of
a small independent estate, which, in case he died without
children, was to go to the next male heir; and to that
heir it was certain it would go, as Glenmurray on prin-
ciple was an enemy to marriage, and consequently not
likely to have a child born in wedlock.
It was an unfortunate circumstance for Glenmurray,
that, with the ardour of a young and inexperienced mind,
he had given his eccentric opinions to the world as soon
as they were conceived and arranged,-as he, by so doing,
prejudiced the world against him in so unconquerable a
degree, that to him almost every door and heart was
shut; and he by that means excluded from every chance
of having the errors of his imagination corrected by the
arguments of the experienced and enlightened—and cor-
rected, no doubt, they would have been, for he had a
mild and candid spirit, and mind open to conviction.
“ I consider myself,” he used to say, “ as a sceptic,
not as a man really certain of the truth of any thing
which he advances. I doubt of all things, because I
look upon doubt as the road to truth; and do but con-
vince me what is the truth, and at what risk, whatever
sacrifice, I am ready to embrace it."
But, alas ! neither the blamelessness of his life, nor
even his active virtue, assisted by the most courteous
manners, were deemed sufficient to counteract the mis-
chievous tendency of his works; or rather, it was sup-
posed impossible that his life could be blameless and his
seeming virtues sincere :-and unheard, unknown, this
unfortunate young man was excluded from those circles
which his talents would have adorned, and forced to lead

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
a life of solitude, or associate with persons unlike to him
in most things, except in a passion for the bold in theory,
and the almost impossible in practice.
Of this description of persons he soon became the
oracle—the head of a sect, as it were; and those tenets
which at first he embraced, and put forth more for
amusement than from conviction, as soon as he began to
suffer on their account, became as dear to him as the
cross to the Christian martyr: and deeming persecution
a test of truth, he considered the opposition made to him
and his doctrines, not as the result of dispassionate
reason striving to correct absurdity, but as selfishness
and fear endeavouring to put out the light which showed
the weakness of the foundation on which were built their
claims to exclusive respect.
When Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline first arrived at Bath,
the latter had attracted the attention and admiration of
Colonel Mordaunt, an Irishman of fortune, and an
officer in the guards; and Adeline had not been insen-
sible to the charms of the very fine person and engaging
manners, united to powers of conversation which dis-
played an excellent understanding improved by education
and reading. But Colonel Mordaunt was not a marry-
ing man, as it is called : therefore, as soon as he began
to feel the influence of Adeline growing too powerful for
his freedom, and to observe that his attentions were far
from unpleasing to her,—too honourable to excite an
attachment in her which he resolved to combat in him-
self, he resolved to fly from the danger, which he knew
he could not face and overcome ; and after a formal but
embarrassed adieu to Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline, he
suddenly left Bath.
This unexpected departure both surprised and grieved
Adeline ; but, as her feelings of delicacy were too strong
to allow her to sigh for a man who, evidently, had no
thoughts of sighing for her, she dismissed Colonel Mor-
daunt from her remembrance, and tried to find as much

interest still in the ball-rooms, and the promenades, as
his presence had given them: nor was it long before she
found in them an attraction and an interest stronger than
any which she had yet felt.
It is naturally to be supposed that Adeline had often
wished to know personally an author whose writings
delighted her as much as Glenmurray's had done, and
that her fancy had often portrayed him: but though it
had clothed him in a form at once pleasing and respect-
able,-still, from an idea of his superior wisdom, she had
imagined him past the meridian of life, and not likely to
excite warmer feelings than those of esteem and venera-
tion : and such continued to be Adeline's idea of Glen-
murray, when he arrived at Bath, having been sent
thither by his physicians for the benefit of his health.
Glenmurray, though a sense of his unpopularity had
long banished him from scenes of public resort in general,
was so pleased with the novelties of Bath, that, though
he walked wholly unnoticed except by the lovers of
genius in whatsoever shape it showed itself, he fre-
quented daily the pump-room, and the promenades; and
Adeline had long admired the countenance and dignified
person of this young and interesting invalid, without
the slightest suspicion of his being the man of all others
whom she most wished to see.
Nor had Glenmurray been slow to admire Adeline:
and so strong, so irresistible was the feeling of admiration
which she had excited in him, that, as soon as she ap-
peared, all other objects vanished from his sight; and as
women are generally quick-sighted to the effect of their
charms, Adeline never beheld the stranger without a
suffusion of pleasurable confusion on her cheek.
One morning at the pump-room, when Glenmurray,
unconscious that Adeline was near, was reading the
newspaper with great attention, and Adeline for the
first time was looking at him unobserved, she heard
the name of Glenmurray pronounced, and turned her

· 26
ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
head towards the person who spoke, in hopes of seeing
Glenmurray himself; when Mrs. Mowbray, turning round
and looking at the invalid, said to a gentleman next her,
“ Did you say, Sir, that that tall, pale, dark, interesting-
looking young man is Mr. Glenmurray, the celebrated
author ?”
“ Yes, ma'am,” replied the gentleman with a sneer :
“ that is Mr. Glenmurray, the celebrated author.”
“Oh! how I should like to speak to him!” cried.
Mrs. Mowbray.
“ It will be no difficult matter,” replied her informant:
" the gentleman is always quite as much at leisure as
you see him now; for all persons have not the same
taste as Mrs. Mowbray.”
So saying, he bowed and departed, leaving Mrs. Mow-
bray, to whom the sight of a great author was new, so
lost in contemplating Glenmurray, that the sarcasm with
which he spoke entirely escaped her observation.
Nor was Adeline less abstracted: she too was contem-
plating Glenmurray, and with mixed but delightful feelings.
“ So then he is young and handsome too!” said she
mentally: “it is a pity he looks so ill," added she
sighing: but the sigh was caused rather by his looking
so well—though Adeline was not conscious of it.
By this time Glenmurray had observed who were his
neighbours, and the newspaper was immediately laid down.
« Is there any news to-day?” said Mrs. Mowbray to
Glenmurray, resolved to make a bold effort to become
acquainted with him. Glenmurray, with a bow and a
blush of mingled surprise and pleasure, replied that there
was a great deal,--and immediately presented to her the
paper which he had relinquished, setting chairs at the
same time for her and Adeline.
Mrs. Mowbray, however, only slightly glanced her eye
over the paper :-her desire was to talk to Glenmurray;
and in order to accomplish this point, and prejudice him
in her favour, she told him how much she rejoiced in

27
seeing an author whose works were the delight and in-
struction of her life. “Speak, Adeline,” cried she,
turning to her blushing daughter; “ do we not almost
daily read and daily admire Mr. Glenmurray's writings ?”
_“Yes, certainly,” replied Adeline, unable to articu-
late more, awed no doubt by the presence of so superior
a' being; while Glenmurray, more proud of being an
author than ever, said internally, “ Is it possible that
that sweet creature should have read and admired my
works ?”
But in vain, encouraged by the smiles and even by the
blushes of Adeline, did he endeavour to engage her in
conversation. Adeline was unusually silent, unusually
bashful. But Mrs. Mowbray made ample amends for
her deficiency; and Mr. Glenmurray, flattered and
amused, would have continued to converse with her and
look at Adeline, had he not observed the impertinent
sneers and rude laughter to which conversing so fami-
liarly with him exposed Mrs. Mowbray. As soon as he
observed this, he arose to depart; for Glenmurray was,
according to Rochefoucault's maxim, so exquisitely selfish,
that he always considered the welfare of others before his
own; and heroically sacrificing his own gratification to
save Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline from further censure,
he bowed with the greatest respect to Mrs. Mowbray,
sighed as he paid the same compliment to Adeline, and,
lamenting his being forced to quit them so soon, with
evident reluctance left the room.
« What an elegant bow he makes !” exclaimed Mrs.
Mowbray. Adeline had observed nothing but the sigh;
and on that she did not choose to make any comment.
The next day Mrs. Mowbray, having learned Glen-
murray's address, sent him a card for a party at her
lodgings. Nothing but Glenmurray's delight could ex-
ceed his astonishment at this invitation. He had ob-
served Mrs. Mowbray and Adeline, even before Adeline
had obseryed him; and, as he gazed upon the fascinating

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline, he had sighed to think that she too would be
taught to avoid the dangerous and disreputable acquaint-
ance of Glenmurray. To him, therefore, this mark of
attention was a source both of consolation and joy. But,
being well convinced that it was owing to her ignorance
of the usual customs and opinions of those with whom
she associated, he was too generous to accept the invita-
tion, as he knew that his presence at a rout at Bath
would cause general dismay, and expose the mistress to
disagreeable remarks at least : but he endeavoured to
make himself amends for his self-denial, by asking leave
to wait on them when they were alone.
CHAPTER V.
A Day or two after, as Adeline was leaning on the arm
of a young lady, Glenmurray passed them, and to his re-
spectful bow she returned a most cordial salutation.
« Gracious me! my dear,” said her companion,“ do
you know who that man is ?"!
“ Certainly :-it is Mr. Glenmurray.”
“ And do you speak to him ?”
6 Yes :-why should I not ?"
“ Dear me! Why, I am sure! Why-don't you know
what he is ?”
“ Yes ; a celebrated writer, and a man of genius.”
« Oh, that may be, Miss Mowbray: but they say one
should not notice him, because he is -
“ He is what?” said Adeline eagerly.
“ I do not exactly know what; but I believe it is a
French spy, or a Jesuit.”
“ Indeed ?” replied Adeline laughing. “But I am
used to have better evidence against a person than a
they say before I neglect an acknowledged acquaintance:
therefore, with your leave, I shall turn back and talk a
little to poor Mr. Glenmurray.”

It so happened that poor Mr. Glenmurray heard
every word of this conversation; for he had turned round
and followed Adeline and her fair companion, to present
to the former the glove which she had dropped ; and as
they were prevented from proceeding by the crowd on
the parade, which was assembled to see some unusual
sight, he, being immediately behind them, could distin-
guish all that passed; so that Adeline turned round to
go in search of him before the blush of grateful admira-
tion for her kindness had left his cheek.
“ Then she seeks me because I am shunned by others!"
said Glenmurray to himself. In a moment the world to
him seemed to contain only two beings, Adeline Mowbray
and Frederic Glenmurray; and that Adeline, starting
and blushing with joyful surprise at seeing him so near
her, was then coming in search of him of him, the
neglected Glenmurray! Scarcely could he refrain catch-
ing the lovely and ungloved hand next him to his heart;
but he contented himself with keeping the glove that he
was before so eager to restore, and in a moment it was
lodged in his bosom.
Nor could “I can't think what I have done with my
glove," which every now and then escaped Adeline, pre-
vail on him to own that he had found it. At last, indeed,
it became unnecessary; for Adeline, as she glanced her
eye towards Glenmurray, discovered it in the hiding-
place : but, as delicacy forbade her to declare the dis-
covery which she had made, he was suffered to retain his
prize ; though a deep and sudden blush which overspread
his cheek, and a sudden pause which she made in her
conversation, convinced Glenmurray that she had de-
tected his secret. Perhaps he was not sorry—nor Ade-
line ; but certain it is that Adeline was for the remainder
of the morning more lost in reverie than ever her mother
had been ; and that from that day every one, but Adeline
and Glenmurray, saw that they were mutually enamoured.
Glenmurray was the first of the two lovers to perceive

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
that they were so; and he made the discovery with a
mixture of pain and pleasure. For what could be the
result of such an attachment ? He was firmly resolved
never to marry; and it was very unlikely that Adeline,
though she had often expressed to him her approbation
of his writings and opinions, should be willing to sacri-
fice everything to love, and become his mistress. But
a circumstance took place which completely removed
his doubts on this subject.
Several weeks had elapsed since the first arrival of the
Mowbrays at Bath, and in that time almost all their
acquaintances had left them one by one ; but neither
Mrs. Mowbray nor Adeline had paid much attention to
this circumstance. Mrs. Mowbray’s habits of abstrac-
tion, as usual, made her regardless of common occur-
rences; and to these were added the more delightful
reveries occasioned by the attentions of a very handsome
and insinuating man, and the influence of a growing
passion. Mrs. Mowbray, as we have before observed,
married from duty, not inclination ; and to the passion
of love she had remained a total stranger, till she became
acquainted at Bath with Sir Patrick O'Carrol. Yes ;
Mrs. Mowbray was in love for the first time when she
was approaching her fortieth year! and a woman is never
so likely to be the fool of love, as when it assails her late
in life, especially if a lover be as great a novelty to her
as the passion itself. Though not, alas! restored to a
second youth, the tender victim certainly enjoys a second
childhood, and exhibits but too openly all the little tricks
and minauderies of a love-sick girl, without the youthful
appearance that in a degree excuses them. This was the
case with Mrs. Mowbray; and while, regardless of her
daughter's interest and happiness, she was lost in the
pleasing hopes of marrying the agreeable baronet, no
wonder the cold neglect of her Bath associates was not
seen by her.
· Adeline, engrossed also by the pleasing reveries of a

first love, was as unconscious of it as herself. Indeed
she thought of nothing but love and Glenmurray ; else,
she could not have failed to see, that, while Sir Patrick's
attentions and flatteries were addressed to her mother,
his ardent looks and passionate sighs were all directed to
herself.
Sir Patrick O'Carrol was a young Irishman, of an old
family but an encumbered estate ; and it was his wish to
set his estate free by marrying a rich wife, and one as
little disagreeable as possible. With this view he came
to Bath ; and in Mrs. Mowbray he not only beheld a
woman of large independent fortune, but possessed of
great personal beauty, and young enough to be attractive.
Still, though much pleased with the wealth and appear-
ance of the mother, he soon became enamoured of the
daughter's person ; and had he not gone so far in his
addresses to Mrs. Mowbray as to make it impossible she
should willingly transfer him to Adeline, and give her a
fortune at all adequate to his wants, he would have
endeavoured honourably to gain her affections, and en-
tered the lists against the favoured Glenmurray,
But, as he wanted the mother's wealth, he resolved to
pursue his advantage with her, and trust to some future
chance for giving him possession of the daughter. In
his dealings with men, Sir Patrick was a man of honour ;
in his dealings with women, completely the reverse: he
considered them as a race of subordinate beings, and that
if, like horses, they were well lodged, fed, and kept clean,
they had no right to complain.
Constantly therefore did he besiege Mrs. Mowbray
with his conversation, and Adeline with his eyes ; and
the very libertine gaze with which he often beheld her,
gave a pang to Glenmurray which was but too soon pain-
fully increased.
Sir Patrick was the only man of fashion who did not
object to visit at Mrs. Mowbray's on account of her inti-
macy with Glenmurray; but he had his own private rea-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
sons for going thither, and continued to visit at Mrs.
Mowbray's though Glenmurray was generally there, and
sometimes he and the latter gentleman where the whole
of their company.
One evening they and two ladies were drinking tea at
Mrs. Mowbray's lodgings, when Mrs. Mowbray was
unusually silent and Adeline unusually talkative. Ade-
line scarcely ever spoke in her mother's presence, from
deference to her abilities ; and whatever might be Mrs.
Mowbray's defects in other respects, her conversational
talents and her uncommon command of words were indis-
putable. But this evening, as I before observed, Adeline,
owing to her mother's tender abstractions, was obliged
to exert herself for the entertainment of the guests.
It so happened, also, that something was said by one
of the party which led to the subject of marriage, and
Adeline was resolved not to let so good an opportunity
pass of proving to Glenmurray how sincerely she ap-
proved his doctrine on that subject. Immediately, with
an unreserve which nothing but her ignorance of the
world, and the strange education which she had received,
could at all excuse, she began to declaim against mar-
riage, as an institution at once absurd, unjust, and im-
moral, and to declare that she would never submit to so
contemptible a form, or profane the sacred ties of love by
80 odious and unnecessary a ceremony.
This extraordinary speech, though worded elegantly
and delivered gracefully, was not received by any of her
hearers, except Sir Patrick, with any thing like admira-
tion. The baronet, indeed, clapped his hands, and cried
“ Bravo! a fine spirited girl, upon my word !” in a
manner so loud, and so offensive to the feelings of Ade-
line, that, like the orator of old, she was tempted to
exclaim, “ What foolish thing can I have said, that has
drawn forth this applause ?”
But Mrs. Mowbray, though she could not help ad-
miring the eloqnence which she attributed to her example,

--was shocked at hearing Adeline declare that her prac-
tice should be consonant to her theory; while Glen-
murray, though Adeline had only expressed his senti-
ments, and his reason approved what she had uttered,
felt his delicacy and his feelings wounded by so open
and decided an avowal of her opinions, and intended
conduct in consequence of them ; and he was still more
hurt when he saw how much it delighted Sir Patrick,
and offended the rest of the company; who, after a silence,
the result of surprise and disgust, suddenly arose, and,
coldly wishing Mrs. Mowbray good night, left the house.
By Mrs. Mowbray the cause of this abrupt departure
was unsuspected : but Adeline, who had more observa-
tion, was convinced that she was the cause of it; and
sighing deeply at the prejudices of the world, she sought
to console herself by looking at Glenmurray, expecting
to find in his eyes an expression of delight and appro-
bation. To her great disappointment, however, his
countenance was sad ; while Sir Patrick, on the contrary,
had an expression of impudent triumph in his look,
which made her turn blushing from his ardent gaze, and
indignantly follow her mother, who was then leaving
the room. '
As she passed him, Sir Patrick caught her hand raptu-
rously to his lips (an action which made Glenmurray start
from his chair), and exclaimed, “Really you are the only
honest little woman I ever knew! I always was sure
that what you just now said was the opinion of all your
sex, though they were so confounded coy they would
not own it."
.“ Own what Sir?” asked the astonished Adeline.
“ That they thought marriage a cursed bore, and pre-
ferred leading the life of honour, to be sure.”
“ The life of honour! What is that ?" demanded
Adeline, while Glenmurray paced the room in agitation.
“ The life, my dear girl, which you mean to lead ;-
love and liberty with the man of your heart.”

“ Sir Patrick,” cried Glenmurray impatiently, “ this
conversation is "
.“ Prodigiously amusing to me,” returned the baronet,
“ especially as I never could hold it to a modest woman
before.”
“ Nor shall you now, Sir," fiercely interrupted Glen-
murray.
“ Shall not, Sir?” vociferated Sir Patrick
“ Pray, gentlemen, be less violent," exclaimed the
terrified and astonished Adeline. “I can't think what
could offend you, Mr. Glenmurray, in Sir Patrick's ori-
ginal observation : the life of honour appears to me a
very excellent name for the pure and honourable union
which it is my wish to form; and ”
“ There; I told you so;" triumphantly interrupted
Sir Patrick: “and I never was better pleased in my life:
sweet creature! at once so lovely, so wise, and so liberal !”
"Sir,” cried Glenmurray, “ this is a mistake : your
life of honour and Miss Mowbray's are as different as
possible ; you are talking of what you are grossly igno-
rant of.”
“ Ignorant! I ignorant ! Look you, Mr. Glenmurray,
do you pretend to tell me I know not what the life of
honour is, when I have led it so many times with so
many different women ?”
“How, Sir!” replied Adeline : “ many times ? and
with many different women ? My life of honour can be
led with one only.”
« Well, my dear soul, I only led it with one at a time.”
“O Sir! you are indeed ignorant of my meaning,"
she rejoined : “ it is the individuality of an attachment
that constitutes its purity; and "
“ Ba-ba-bu, my lovely girl! what has purity to do in
the business ?
“Indeed, Sir Patrick,” meekly returned Adeline,

“I beg, I conjure you to drop this conversation : your
innocence is no match for-
“ For what, Sir, ?” furiously demanded Sir Patrick.
“ Your licentiousness,” replied Glenmurray.
“ Sir, I wear a sword,” cried the baronet." And I
a cane,” said Glenmurray calmly, “either to defend
myself or chastise insolence.”
*" Mr. Glenmurray! Sir Patrick !" exclaimed the agi-
tated Adeline : “ for my sake, for pity's sake desist!”
“ For the present I will, madam,” faltered out Sir
Patrick ;-"but I know Mr. Glenmurray's address, and
he shall hear from me.”
“ Hear from you! Why, you do not mean to chal-
lenge him? you can't suppose Mr. Glenmurray would do
so absurb a thing as fight a duel ? Sir, he has written a
volume to prove the absurdity of the custom.—No, no!
you threaten his life in vain,” she added, giving her
hand to Glenmurray; who, in the tenderness of the
action and the tone of her voice, forgot the displeasure
which her inadvertency had caused, and pressing her
hand to his lips, secretly renewed his vows of unalterable
attachment.
“ Very well, madam,” exclaimed Sir Patrick in a tone
of pique : “ then, so as Mr. Glenmurray's life is safe,
you care not what becomes of mine!”
“ Sir," replied Adeline, “ the safety of a fellow-crea-
ture is always of importance in my eyes."
“ Then you care for me as a fellow-creature only,”
retorted Sir Patrick,“ not as Sir Patrick O'Carrol ? -
Mighty fine, truly, you dear ungrateful ” seizing her
hand; which he relinquished, as well as the rest of his
speech, on the entrance of Mrs. Mowbray.
Soon after Adeline left the room, and Glenmurray
bowed and retired; while Sir Patrick, having first re-
peated his vows of admiration to the mother, returned
home to muse on the charms of the daughter, and the
necessity of challenging the moral Glenmurray.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Sir Patrick was a man of courage, and had fought
several duels : but as life at this time had a great many
charms for him, he resolved to defer at least putting himself
in the way of getting rid of it ; and after having slept late
in the morning, to make up for the loss of sleep in the
night, occasioned by his various cogitations, he rose, re-
solved to go to Mrs. Mowbray's, and if he had an oppor-
tunity, indulge himself in some practical comments on
the singular declaration made the evening before by her
lovely daughter.
Glenmurray meanwhile had passed the night in equal
watchfulness and greater agitation. To fight a duel
would be, as Adeline observed, contrary to his principles ;
and to decline one, irritated as he was against Sir Patrick,
was repugnant to his feelings.
To no purpose did he peruse and re-peruse nearly the
whole of his own book against duelling; he had few
religious restraints to make him resolve on declining a
challenge, and he felt moral ones of little avail : but in
vain did he sit at home till the morning was far advanced,
expecting a messenger from Sir Patrick ;--no messenger
came :-he therefore left word with his servant, that, if
wanted, he might be found at Mrs. Mowbray's, and went
thither, in hopes of enjoying an hour's conversation with
Adeline; resolving to hint to her, as delicately as he
could, that the opinions which she bad expressed were
better confined, in the present dark state of the public
mind, to a select and discriminating circle.
CHAPTER VI.
SiR PATRICK had reached Mrs. Mowbray's some time
before him, and had, to his great satisfaction, found
Adeline alone; nor did it escape his penetration that her
cheeks glowed, and her eyes sparkled with pleasure, at ,
his approach.


## p. 37 (#53) ##############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
But he would not have rejoiced in this circumstance,
had he known that Adeline was pleased to see him merely
because she considered his appearance as a proof of Glen-
murray's safety; for, in spite of his having written
against duelling, and of her confidence in his firmness
and consistency, she was not quite convinced that the
reasoning philosopher would triumph over the feeling
man.
." You are welcome, Sir Patrick !” cried Adeline, as he
entered, with a most winning smile : “ I am very glad
to see you : pray sit down.”
The baronet, who, audacious as his hopes and inten-
tions were, had not expected so kind a reception, was
quite thrown off his guard by it, and, catching her sud-
denly in his arms, endeavoured to obtain a still kinder
welcome. Adeline as suddenly disengaged herself from
him, and, with the dignity of offended modesty, desired
him to quit the room, as, after such an insolent attempt,
she could not think herself justified in suffering him to
remain with her.
But her anger was soon changed into pity, when she
saw Sir Patrick lay down his hat, seat himself, and burst
into a long deliberate laugh.
“ He is certainly mad !” she exclaimed ; and, leaning
against the chimney-piece, she began to contemplate him
with a degree of fearful interest.
." Upon my soul! now," cried the baronet, when his
langh was over, “ you do not suppose, my dear creature,
that you and I do not understand one another! Telling
a young fellow to leave the house on such occasions,
means, in the pretty no meaning of your sex, Stay, and
offend again,' to be sure.”
“ He is certainly mad!” said Adeline, more confirmed
than before in her idea of his insanity, and immediately
endeavoured to reach the door: but in so"doing she"ap-
proached Sir Patrick, who, rather roughly seizing her
trembling hand, desired her to sit down, and hear what.


## p. 38 (#54) ##############################################

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
he had to say to her. Adeline, thinking it not right to
irritate him, instantly obeyed.
“Now, then, to open my mind to you,” said the
baronet, drawing his chair close to hers : “ From the
very first moment I saw you, I felt that we were made
for one another ; though, being bothered by my debts, I
made up to the old duchess, and she nibbled the bait
directly,—deeming my clean inches (six feet one, without
shoes) well worth her dirty acres."
“How dreadfully incoherent he is !” thought Adeline,
not suspecting for a moment that, by the old duchess,
he meant her still blooming mother.
“ But, my lovely dear ! continued Sir Patrick, most
ardently pressing her hand, “So much have your
sweet person, and your frank and liberal way of thinking,
charmed me, that I here freely offer myself to you, and we
will begin the life of honour together as soon as you please.”
Still Adeline, who was unconscious how much her
avowed opinions, had exposed her to insult, continued to
believe Sir Patrick insane ; a belief which the wildness
of his eyes confirmed. “ I really know not,-you sur-
prise me, Sir Patrick,- "
“ Surprise you, my dear soul! How could you expect
anything else from a man of my spirit, after your honest
declaration last night?-AU I feared was, that Glenmurray
should get the start of me.”
Adeline, though alarmed, bewildered, and confounded,
had still recollection enough to know that, whether sane
or insane, the words and looks of Sir Patrick were full
of increasing insult. “ I believe, I think I had better
retire,” faltered out Adeline.
“Retire ! No, indeed,” exclaimed the baronet;
rudely seizing her.
This outrage restored Adeline to her usual spirit and
self-possession; and bestowing on him the epithet of
• mean-sould ruffian !' she had almost freed herself from
his grasp, when a quick step was heard on the stairs,
and the door was thrown open by Glenmurray. In a

39
moment Adeline, bursting into tears, threw herself into
his arms, as if in search of protection.
Glenmurray required no explanation of the scene before
him : the appearance of the actors in it was explanation
sufficient ; and while with one arm he foldly held Ade-
line to his bosom, he raised the other in a threatening
attitude against Sir Patrick, exclaiming as he did it,
“ Base, unmanly villain!”
• Villain !” echoed Sir Patrick- " but it is very
well-very well for the present—Good morning to you,
sir!” So saying he hastily withdrew.
As soon as he was gone, Glenmurray for the first time
declared to Adeline the ardent passion with which she
had inspired him ; and she, with equal frankness, con-
fessed that her heart was irrevocably his.
From this interesting tête-à-tête Adeline was summoned
to attend a person on business to her mother; and
during her absence Glenmurray received a challenge from
the angry baronet, appointing him to meet him that
afternoon at five o'clock, about two miles from Bath. To
this note, for fear of alarming the suspicions of Adeline,
Glenmurray returned only a verbal message, saying he
would answer it in two hours : but as soon as she returned
he pleaded indispensable business; and before she could
mention any fears respecting the consequences of what
had passed between him and Sir Patrick, he had left the
room, having, to prevent any alarm, requested leave to
wait on her early the next day.
As soon as Glenmurray reached his lodgings, he again
revolved in his mind the propriety of accepting the chal-
lenge. “How can I expect to influence others by my
theories to act right, if my practice sets them a bad
example?” But then again he exclaimed, “ How can I
expect to have any thing I say attended to, when, by
refusing to fight, I put it in the power of my enemies to
assert I am a poltroon, and worthy only of neglect and
contempt ? No, no; I must fight:-even Adeline her-

self, especially as it is on her account, will despise me if
I do not :"-and then, without giving himself any more
time to deliberate, he sent an answer to Sir Patrick,
promising to meet him at the time appointed.
But after he had sent it he found himself a prey to so
much self-reproach, and after he had forfeited his claims
to consistency of conduct, he felt himself so strongly
aware of the value of it, that, had not the time of the
meeting been near at hand, he would certainly have de-
liberated upon some means of retracting his consent to it.
Being resolved to do as little mischief as he could, he
determined on having no second in the business; and
accordingly repaired to the field accompanied only by a
trusty servant, who had orders to wait his master's plea-
sure at a distance.
Contrary to Glenmurray's expectations, Sir Patrick
also came unattended by a second; while his servant,
who was with him, was, like the other, desired to remain
in the back ground.
" I wish, Mr. Glenmurray, to do every thing honour-
able,” said the baronet, after they had exchanged saluta-
tions : “therefore, Sir, as I concluded you would find it
difficult to get a second, I am come without one, and I
conclude that I concluded right.---Aye, men of your
principle can have but few friends."
“And men of your practice ought to have none, Sir
Patrick," retorted Glenmurray: “ but, as I don't think
it worth while to explain to you my reasons for not
having a second, as I fear that you are incapable of
understanding them, I must desire you to take your
ground.”
“ With all my heart,” replied his antagonist; and
then taking aim, they agreed to fire at the same moment.
They did so; and the servants, hearing the report of
the pistols, ran to the scene of action, and saw Sir
Patrick bleeding in the sword-arm, and Glenmurray, also
wounded, leaning against a tree.

~ This is cursed unlucky,” said Sir Patrick coolly :
“ you have disabled my right arm I can't go on with
this business at present; but when I am well again
command me. Your wound, I believe, is as slight as
mine ; but as I can walk, and you cannot, and as I have
a chaise, and you not, you shall use it to convey you and
your servant home, and I and mine will go on foot.”
To this obliging offer Glenmurray was incapable of
giving denial; for he became insensible from loss of
blood, and with the assistance of his antagonist was car-
ried to the chaise, and supported by his terrified servant,
conveyed back to Bath.
It is not to be supposed that an event of this nature
should be long unknown. It was soon told all over the
city that Sir Patrick O'Carrol and Mr. Glenmurray had
fought a duel, and that the latter was dangerously
wounded; the quarrel having originated in Mr. Glen-
murray's scoffing at religion, king, and constitution,
before the pious and loyal baronet.
This story soon reached the ears of Mrs. Mowbray,
who, in an agony of tender sorrow, and in defiance of
all decorum, went in person to call on her admired Sir
Patrick ; and Adeline, who heard of the affair soon after,
as regardless of appearances as her mother, and more
alarmed, went in person to inquire concerning her
wounded Glenmurray.
By the time that she had arrived at his lodgings, not
only his own surgeon but Sir Patrick's had seen him, as
his antagonist thought it necessary to ascertain the true
state of his wound, that he might know whether he
ought to stay, or fly his country.
The account of both the surgeons was, however, so
favourable, and Glenmurray in all respects so well, that
Sir Patrick's alarms were soon quite at an end ; and the
wounded man was lying on a sofa, lost in no very plea-
sant reflections, when Adeline knocked at his door.
Glenmurray at that very moment was saying to himself,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ Well;—80 much for principle and consistency! Now,
my next step must be to marry, and then I shall have
made myself a complete fool, and the worst of all fools,
a man presuming to instruct others by his precepts, when
he finds them incapable of influencing even his own actions.
Atthis moment his servant came up with Miss Mowbray's
compliments, and, if he was well enough to see her, she
would come up and speak to him.”
In an instant all his self-reproaches were forgotten;
and when Adeline hung weeping and silent on his
shoulder, he could not but rejoice in an affair which had
procured him a moment of such heartfelt delight. At
first Adeline expressed nothing but terror at the conse-
quences of his wound, and pity for his sufferings; but
when she found that he was in no danger, and in very
little pain, the tender mistress yielded to the severe
monitress, and she began to upbraid Glenmurray for
having acted not only in defiance of her wishes and prin-
ciples, but of his own; of principles laid down by him
to the world in the strongest point of view, and in a
manner convincing to every mind.
“ Dearest Adeline, consider the provocation," cried
Glenmurray ;—"a gross insult offered to the woman I
love!”
“ But who ever fought a duel without provocation,
Glenmurray? If provocation be a justification, your book
was unnecessary; and did not you offer an insult to the
understanding of the woman you love, in supposing that
she could be obliged to you for playing the fool on her
account?”
“ But I should have been called a coward had I de-
clined the challenge; and though I can bear the world's
hatred, I could not its contempt:-I could not endure
the loss of what the world calls honour.”
“ Is it possible,” rejoined Adeline, “ that I hear the
philosophical Glenmurray talking thus, in the silly jargon
of a man of the world ?"

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
43
* Alas! I am a man, not a philosopher, Adeline!”
“ At least be a sensible one ;-consistent I dare not
now call you. But have you forgotten the distinction
which, in your volume on the subject of duels, you
so strongly lay down between real and apparent honour?
In which of the two classes do you put the honour of
which, in this instance, you were so tenacious ? What
is there in common between the glory of risking the life
of a fellow-creature, and testimony of an approving
conscience ?”
“ An excellent observation that of yours, indeed, my
sweet monitress," said Glenmurray.
“ An observation of mine ; It is your own,” replied
Adeline : “ but see, I have the book in my muff; and I
will punish you for the badness of your practice, by
giving you a dose of your theory.”
“ Cruel girl!” cried Glenmurray, “ I am not ordered
a sleeping draught !”
Adeline was however resolved; and, opening the
book, she read argument after argument with unyielding
perseverance, till Glenmurray, who, like the eagle in the
song, saw on the dart that wounded him his own feathers,
cried “ Quarter!”
« But tell me, dear Adeline," said Glenmurray, a little
piqued at her too just reproofs, “ you, who are so severe
on my want of consistency, are you yourself capable of
acting up in every respect to your precepts ?”
.“ After your weakness," replied Adeline, smiling,
“ it becomes me to doubt my own strength ; but I
assure you that I make it a scruple of conscience,. to
show by my conduct my confidence in the truth of my
opinions.”
" Then, in defiance of the world's opinion, that opinion
which I, you see, had not resolution to brave, you will
be mine--not according to the ties of marriage, but
with no other ties or sanction than those of love and
reason?”


## p. 44 (#60) ##############################################

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“I will,” said Adeline : "and may He whom I worship
(raising her fine eyes and white arms to heaven) desert
me when I desert you!”
Who that had seen her countenance and gesture at
that moment, could have imagined she was calling on
heaven to witness an engagement to lead a life of infamy?
Rather would they have thought her a sublime enthusiast
breathing forth the worship of a grateful soul.
It may be supposed that Glenmurray's heart beat
with exultation at this confession from Adeline, and that
he forgot, in the promised indulgence of his passion,
those bounds which strict decorum required. But Glen-
murray did her justice ; he bebeld her as she was all
purity of feeling and all delicacy; and, if possible, the
slight favours by which true love is long contented to be
fed, though granted by Adeline with more conscious
emotion, were received by him with more devoted respect:
besides, he again felt that mixture of pain with pleasure,
on this assurance of her love, which he had experienced
before. For he knew, though Adeline did not, the extent
of the degradation into which the step which her con-
science approved would necessarily precipitate her; and
experience alone could convince him that her sensibility
to shame, when she was for the first time exposed to it,
would not overcome her supposed fortitude and boasted
contempt of the world's opinion, and change all the roses
of love into the thorns of regret and remorse.
And could he who doted on her ;-he, too, who ad-
mired her as much for her consummate purity as for any
other of her qualities ;-could he bear to behold this fair
creature, whose open eye beamed with the consciousness
of virtue, casting her timid glances to the earth, and
shrinking with horror from the conviction of having in
the world's eye forfeited all pretensions to that virtue
which alone was the end of her actions ! Would the
approbation of her own mind be sufficient to support her
under such a trial, though she had with such sweet

earnestness talked to him of its efficacy! These reflections
had for some time past been continually occurring to him,
and now they came across his mind blighting the triumphs
of successful passion :-nay, but from the dread of incur-
ring yet more ridicule, on account of the opposition of
his practice to his theory, and perhaps the indignant
contempt of Adeline, he could have thrown himself at
her feet, conjuring her to submit to the degradation of
being a wife.,
But, unknown to Glenmurray, perhaps, another reason
prompted him to desire this concession from Adeline.
We are never more likely to be in reality the slaves of
selfishness, than when we fancy ourselves acting with
most heroic disinterestedness.Egotism loves a becoming
dress, and is always on the watch to hide her ugliness
by the robe of benevolence. Glenmurray thought that
he was willing to marry Adeline merely for her sake!
but I suspect it was chiefly for his. The true and deli-
cate lover is always a monopolizer, always desirous of
calling the woman of his affections his own : it is not
only because he considers marriage as a holy institution
that the lover leads his mistress to the altar ; but because
it gives him a right to appropriate the fair treasure to
himself, because it sanctions and perpetuates the dearest
of all monopolies, and erects a sacred barrier to guard his
rights,- around which, all that is respectable in society,
all that is most powerful and effectual in its organization,
is proud and eager to rally.
But while Glenmurray, in spite of his happiness, was
sensible to an alloy of it, and Adeline was tenderly im-
puting to the pain of his wound the occasionally mourn-
ful expression of his countenance, Adeline took occasion
to declare that she would live with Glenmurray only on
condition that such a step met with her mother's appro-
bation.
« Then are my hopes for ever at an end,” said Glen-
murray :-"or, -or (and spite of himself his eyes

sparkled as he spoke)-or we must submit to the absurd
ceremony of marriage.”
“ Marriage!” replied the astonished Adeline: “ can
you think so meanly of my mother, as to suppose her
practice so totally opposite to her principles, that she
would require her daughter to submit to a ceremony
which she herself regards with contempt ?--Impossible.
I am sure, when I solicit her consent to my being yours,
she will be pleased to find that her sentiments and obser-
vations have not been thrown away on me.”
. Glenmurray thought otherwise: however, he bowed
and was silent; and Adeline declared that, to put an end
to all doubt on the subject, she would instantly go in
search of Mrs. Mowbray and propose the question to
her : and Glenmurray, feeling himself more weak and
indisposed than he chose to own to her, allowed her,
though reluctantly, to depart.
CHAPTER VII.
Mrs. MOWBRAY was but just returned from her chari-
table visit when Adeline entered the room. “And pray,
Miss Mowbray, where have you been ?” she exclaimed,
seeing Adeline with her hat and cloak on.
“I have been visiting poor Mr. Glenmurray," she
replied.
“ Indeed!” cried Mrs. Mowbray: “and without my
leave! and pray who went with you ?”
. - Nobody, ma'am.”
“ Nobody!—What! visit a man alone at his lodgings,
after the education which you have received!”
“ Indeed, madam,” replied Adeline meekly, “my
education never taught me that such conduct was im-
proper; nor, as you did the same this afternoon, could
I have dared to think it so.”
“ You are mistaken, Miss Mowbray,” replied her

mother : “ I did not do the same; for the terms which
I am upon with Sir Patrick made my visiting him no
impropriety at all.”
* If you think I have acted wrong," replied Adeline
timidly, “no doubt I have done so ; though you were
quite right in visiting Sir Patrick, as the respectability
of your age and character, and Sir Patrick's youth,
warranted the propriety of the visit :-but, surely the
terms which I am upon with Mr. Glenmurray
“ The terms which you are upon with Mr. Glenmurray!
and my age and character! what can you mean ?” angrily
exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray. .
“I hope, my dear mother,” said Adeline tenderly,
" that you had long ere this guessed the attachment
which subsists between Mr. Glenmurray and me ;--an
attachment cherished by your high opinion of him and
his writings; but which respect has till now made me
hesitate to mention to you."
“Would to heaven!” replied Mrs. Mowbray, “ that
respect had made you for ever silent on the subject ! Do
you suppose that I would marry my daughter to a man
of small fortune,—but more especially to one who, as
Sir Patrick informs me, is shunned for his principles and
profligacy by all the world ?”
« To what Sir Patrick says of Mr. Glenmurray I pay
no attention,” answered Adeline; “nor are you, my
dear mother, capable, I am sure, of being influenced
by the prejudices of the world.—But you are quite mis-
taken in supposing me so lost to consistency, and so
regardless of your liberal opinions and the books which
we have studied, as to think of marrying Mr. Glenmurray."
“ Grant me patience !” cried Mrs. Mowbray : “why,
to be sure you do not think of living with him without
being married ?”
“ Certainly, madam; that you may have the pleasure
of beholding one union founded on rational grounds and
cemented by rational ties.”


## p. 48 (#64) ##############################################

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ How!” cried Mrs. Mowbray, turning pale. I! I
have pleasure in seeing my daughter a kept mistress !
You are mad, quite mad.-I approve such unhallowed
connexions !”
“ My dearest mother,” replied Adeline, “ your agita-
tion terrifies me,—but indeed what I say is strictly true ;
and see here, in Mr. Glenmurray's book, the very passage
which I so often have heard you admire.” As she said
this, Adeline pointed to the passage ; but in an instant
Mrs. Mowbray seized the book and threw it on the fire.
Before Adeline had recovered her consternation Mrs.
Mowbray fell into a violent hysteric; and long was it
before she was restored to composure. When she re-
covered she was so exhausted that Adeline dared not
renew the conversation ; but leaving her to rest, she
made up a bed on the floor in her mother's room, and
passed a night of wretchedness and watchfulness,-the
first of the kind which she had ever known.-Would it
had been the last!
In the morning Mrs. Mowbray awoke, refreshed and
calm; and, affected at seeing the pale cheek and sunk
eye of Adeline, indicative of a sleepless and unhappy
night, she held out her hand to her with a look of kind-
ness ; Adeline pressed it to her lips, as she knelt by the
bed-side, and moistened it with tears of regret for the
past and alarm for the future.
“ Adeline, my dear child,” said Mrs. Mowbray in a
faint voice, “ I hope you will no longer think of putting
a design in execution so fraught with mischief to you,
and horror to me. Little did I think that you were so
romantic as to see no difference between amusing one's
imagination with new theories and new systems, and
acting upon them in defiance of common custom, and
the received usages of society. I admire the convenient
trousers and graceful dress of the Turkish women ; but
I would not wear them myself, lest it should expose me
to derision.”

“ Is there no difference,” thought Adeline, “between
the importance of a dress and an opinion !—Is the one
to be taken up, and laid down again, with the same in-
difference as the other !” But she continued silent, and
Mrs. Mowbray went on.
“ The poetical philosophy which I have so much de-
lighted to study, has served me to ornament my conver-
sation, and make persons less enlightened than myself
wonder at the superior boldness of my fancy, and the
acuteness of my reasoning powers ;-but I should as soon
have thought of making this little gold chain round my
neck fasten the hall-door, as act upon the precepts laid
down in those delightful books. No; though I think all.
they say are true, I believe the purity they inculcate too
much for this world.”
Adeline listened in silent astonishment and conster-
nation. Conscience, and the conviction of what is
right, she then for the first time learned, were not to be
the rule of action; and though filial tenderness made her
resolve never to be the mistress of Glenmurray, she also
resolved never to be his wife, or that of any other man;
while, in spite of herself, the great respect with which
she had hitherto regarded her mother's conduct and
opinions began to diminish.
“ Would to heaven, my dear mother,” said Adeline,
when Mrs. Mowbray had done speaking, “ that you had
said all this to me ere my mind had been indelibly im-
pressed with the truth of these forbidden doctrines; for
now my conscience tells me that I ought to act up to
them !”
“ How!” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray, starting up in
her bed, and in a voice shrill with emotion, “are you
then resolved to disobey me, and dishonour yourself?”
“Oh! never, never!" replied Adeline, alarmed at her
mother's violence, and fearful of a relapse. « Be but
the kind affectionate parent that you have ever been to
me; and though I will never marry out of regard to my

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
own principles, I will also never contract any other union,
out of respect to your wishes, - but will lead with you a
quiet, if not a happy life ; for never, never can I forget
Glenmurray.”
“ There speaks the excellent child I always thought
you to be!” replied Mrs. Mowbray; " and I shall leave
it to time and good counsels to convince you, that the
opinions of a girl of eighteen, as they are not founded
on long experience, may possibly be erroneous.”
Mrs. Mowbray never made a truer observation ; but
Adeline was not in a frame of mind to assent to it.
• Besides,” continued Mrs. Mowbray, “had I ever
been disposed to accept of Mr. Glenmurray as a son-in-
law, it is very unlikely that I should be so now; as the
duel took place not only, I find, from the treasonable
opinions which he put forth, but from some disrespectful
language which he held concerning me.”
" Who could dare to invent so infamous a calumny !”
exclaimed Adeline.
“ My authority is unquestionable, Miss Mowbray; I
speak from Sir Patrick himself.”
- Then he adds falsehood to his other villanies !”
returned Adeline, almost inarticulate with rage :-" but
what could be expected from a man who could dare to
insult a young woman under the roof of her mother with
his licentious addresses ?”
• What mean you?” cried Mrs. Mowbray, turning pale.
“ I mean that Sir Patrick yesterday morning insulted
me by the grossest familiarities, and "
“My dear child,” replied Mrs. Mowbray laughing,
“ that is only the usual freedom of his manner; a man-
ner which your ignorance of the world led you to mistake.
Ile did not mean to insult you, believe me. I am sure
that, spite of his ardent passion for me, he never, even
when alone with me, hazarded any improper liberty."
“ The ardent passion which he feels for you, madam!...
exclaimed Adeline, turning pale in her turn.

51
“ Yes, Miss Mowbray! What, I suppose you think
me too old to inspire one !--But, I assure you, there are
people who think the mother handsomer than the
daughter!”
“ No doubt, dear mother, every one ought to think so,
---and would to heaven Sir Patrick were one of those!
But he, unfortunately
“ Is of that opinion," interrupted Mrs. Mowbray
angrily: “and to convince you-so tenderly does he love
me, and so fondly do I return his passion, that in a few
days I shall become his wife.”
Adeline, on hearing this terrible information, fell in-
sensible on the ground. When she recovered she saw
Mrs. Mowbray anxiously watching by her, but not with
that look of alarm and tenderness with which she had
attended her during her long illness; that look which
was always present to her grateful and affectionate remem-
brance. No; Mrs. Mowbray's eye was cast down with
a half-mournful, half-reproachful, and half-fearful ex-
pression, when it met that of Adeline.
The emotion of anguish which her fainting had evinced
was a reproach to the proud heart of Mrs. Mowbray, and
Adeline felt that it was so; but when she recollected that
her mother was going to marry a man who had so lately
declared a criminal passion for herself, she was very near
relapsing into insensibility. She however struggled with
her feelings, in order to gain resolution to disclose to
Mrs. Mowbray all that had passed between her and Sir
Patrick. But as soon as she offered to renew the con-
versation, Mrs. Mowbray sternly commanded her to be
silent; and insisting on her going to bed, she left her to
her own reflections, till wearied and exhausted she fell
into a sound sleep: nor, as it was late in the evening
when she awoke, did she rise again till the next
morning.
Mrs. Mowbray entered her room as she was dressing,
and inquired how she did, with some kindness.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ I shall be better, dear mother, if you will but hear
what I have to say concerning Sir Patrick,” replied
Adeline, bursting into tears.
“ You can say nothing that will shake my opinion of
him, Miss Mowbray,” replied her mother coldly : “80 I
advise you to reconcile yourself to a circumstance which
it is not in your power to prevent.” So saying, she left
the room: and Adeline, convinced that all she could say
would be vain, endeavoured to console herself, by think-
ing that, as soon as Sir Patrick became the husband of
her mother, his wicked designs on her would undoubt-
edly cease; and that, therefore, in one respect, that ill-
assorted union would be beneficial to her.
Sir Patrick, meanwhile, was no less sanguine in his
expectations from his marriage. Unlike the innocent
Adeline, he did not consider his union with the mother
as a necessary check to his attempts on the daughter;
but, emboldened by what to him appeared the libertine
sentiments of Adeline, and relying on the opportunities
of being with her, which he must infallibly enjoy under
the same roof in the country, he looked on her as his
certain prey. Though he believed Glenmurray to be at
that moment preferred to himself, he thought it impossi-
ble that the superior beauty of his person should not, in
the end, have its due weight: as a passion founded in
esteem, and the admiration of intellectual beauty, could
not, in his opinion, subsist: besides, Adeline appeared in
his eyes not a deceived enthusiast, but a susceptible and
forward girl, endeavouring to hide her frailty under fine
sentiments and high-sounding theories. Nor was Sir
Patrick's inference an unnatural one. Every man of the
world would have thought the same; and on very plausi-
ble grounds.

CHAPTER VIII.
As Sir Patrick was not punctual as lovers to the mo-
ment sworn,' Mrs. Mowbray resolved to sit down and
write immediately to Glenmurray; flattering herself at
the same time, that the letter which was designed to
confound Glenmurray would delight the tender baronet;
--for Mrs. Mowbray piqued herself on her talents for
letter-writing, and was not a little pleased with an oppor-
tunity of displaying them to a celebrated author. But never
before did she find writing a letter so difficult a task.
Her eager wish of excelling deprived her of the means ;
and she who, in a letter to a friend or relation, would
have written in a style at once clear and elegant, after
two hours' effort produced the following specimen of the
obscure, the pedantic, and affected.-
« SIR,
“ The light which cheers and attracts, if we follow its
guidance, often lead us into bogs and quagmires :-
Verbum sapienti. Your writing are the lights, and the
practice to which you advise my deluded daughter is the
bog and quagmire. I agree with you in all you have
said against marriage ;-I agree with the savage nations
in the total uselessness of clothing; still I condescend
to wear clothes, though neither becoming nor useful,
because I respect public opinion; and I submit to the
institution of marriage for reasons equally cogent. Such
being my sentiments, Sir, I must desire you never to see
my daughter more. Nor could you expect to be received
with open arms by me, whom the shafts of your ridicule
have pierced, though warded off by the shield of love
and gallantry ;—but for this I thank you! Now shall I
possess, owing to your baseness, at once a declared lover
and a tried avenger; and the chains of Hymen will be

rendered more charming by gratitude’s having blown the
flame, while love forged the fetters.
“But with your writings I continue to amuse my
imagination.—Lovely is the flower of the nightshade,
though its berry be poison. Still shall I admire and
wonder at you as a author, though I avoid and detest
you as a man.
“ Editha MOWBRAY."
This letter was just finished when Sir Patrick arrived,
and to him it was immediately shown.
“ Heh! what have we here?” cried he laughing vio-
lently as he perused it. “ Here you talk of being pierced
by shafts which were warded off. Now, had I said that,
it would have been called a bull. As to the concluding
paragraph
“0! that, I flatter myself,” said Mrs. Mowbray,
“ will tear him with remorse.”
“ He must first understand it,” cried Sir Patrick :
“ I can but just comprehend it, and am sure it will be
all botheration to him.”
“I am sorry to find such is your opinion,” replied
Mrs. Mowbray; “ for I think that sentence the best
written of any."
“ I did not say it was not fine writing,” replied the
baronet, “ I only said it was not to be understood.—But,
with your leave, you shall send the letter, and we'll drop
the subject.”
So said, so done, to the great satisfaction of Sir
Patrick, who felt that it was for his interest to suffer the
part of Mrs. Mowbray's letter which alluded to Glen-
murray's supposed calumnies against her to remain ob-
scurely worded, as he well knew that what he had asserted
on this subject was wholly void of foundation.
Glenmurray did not receive it with equal satisfaction.
He was indignant at the charge of having advised Ade-
line to become his mistress rather than his wife ; and as
so much of the concluding passage as he could under-

stand seem to imply that he had calumniated her mother,
to remain silent a moment would have been to confess
himself guilty: he therefore answered Mrs. Mowbray's
letter immediately. The answer was as follows :-
“ MADAM,
“ To clear myself from the charge of having advised
Miss Mowbray to a step contrary to the common customs,
however erroneous, of society at this period, I appeal
to the testimony of Miss Mowbray herself; and I here
repeat to you the assurance which I made to her, that I
am willing to marry her when and where she chooses. I
love my system and my opinions, but the respectability
of the woman of my affections more. Allow me, there-
fore, to make you a little acquainted with my situation
in life:
“ To you it is well known, madam, that wealth,
honours, and titles have no value in my eyes ; and that
I reverence talents and virtues, though they wear the
garb of poverty, and are born in the most obscure stations.
But you, or rather those who are so fortunate as to in-
fluence your determinations, may consider my sentiments
on this subject as romantic and absurd. It is necessary,
therefore, that I should tell you, as an excuse in their
eyes for presuming to address your daughter, that, by
the accident of birth, I am descended from an ancient
family, and nearly allied to a noble one; and that my
paternal inheritance, though not large enough for splen-
dour and luxury, is sufficient for all the purposes of
comfort and genteel affluence. I would say more on this
subject, but I am impatient to remove from your mind
the prejudice which you seem to have imbibed against
me. I do not perfectly understand the last paragraph
in your letter. If you will be so kind as to explain it to
me, you may depend on my being perfectly ingenuous :
indeed, I have no difficulty in declaring, that I have

neither encouraged a feeling, nor uttered a word, capable
of giving the lie to the declaration which I am now going
to make That I am,
“ With respect and esteen,
“ Your obedient servant,
“ F. GLENMURRAY."
This letter had an effect on Mrs. Mowbray's feelings
so much in favour of Glenmurray, that she was almost
determined to let him marry Adeline. She felt that she
owed her some amends for contracting a marriage so
suddenly, and without either her knowledge or appro-
bation ; and she thought that, by marrying her to the
man of her heart, she should make her peace both with
Adeline and herself. But, unfortunately, this design,
as soon as it began to be formed, was communicated to
Sir Patrick.
“ So then !” exclaimed he, “you have forgotten and
forgiven the impertinent things which the puppy said !
things which obliged me to wear this little useless ap-
pendage in a sling thus (pointing to his wounded arm).”
“O! no, my dear Sir Patrick! But though what
Mr. Glenmurray said might alarm the scrupulous tender-
ness of a lover, perhaps it was a remark which might
only suit the sincerity of a friend. Perhaps, if Mr.
Glenmurray had made it to me, I should have heard it
with thanks, and with candour have approved it.”
“ My sweet soul !” replied Sir Patrick, “ you may be
as candid and amiable as ever you please, but, by St.
Patrick !' never shall Sir Patrick O'Carrol be father-in-
law to the notorious and infamous Glenmurray—that
subverter of all religion and order, and that scourge of
civilized society!”
So saying, he stalked about the room; and Mrs.
Mowbray, as she gazed on his handsome person, thought
it would be absurd for her to sacrifice her own happiness
to her daughter's, and give up Sir Patrick as her husband

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
57
in order to make Glenmurray her son. She therefore
wrote another letter to Glenmurray, forbidding him any
further intercourse with Adeline, on any pretence what-
ever; and delayed not a moment to send him her final
decision.
“ That is acting like the sensible woman I took you
for,” said Sir Patrick: “the fellow has now gotten his
quietus, I trust, and the dear little Adeline is reserved
for happier fate. Sweet soul! you do not know how
fond she will be of me! I protest that I shall be so
kind to her, it will be difficult for people to decide which
I love best, the daughter or the mother.”
“But I hope I shall always know, Sir Patrick," said
Mrs. Mowbray gravely.
“ You !-0 yes, to be sure. But I mean that my
fatherly attentions shall be of the warmest kind. But
now do me the favour of telling me at what hour to-
morrow I may appoint the clergyman to bring the license?”
The conversation that followed, it were needless and
tedious to describe. Suffice, that eight o'clock the next
morning was fixed for the marriage ; and Mrs. Mowbray,
either from shame or compassion, resolved that Adeline
should not accompany her to church, nor even know of
the ceremony till it was over.
Nor was this a difficult matter. Adeline remained in
her own apartment all the preceding day, endeavouring,
but in vain, to reconcile herself to what she justly termed
the degradation of her mother. She felt, alas ! the most
painful of all feelings, next to that of self-abasement,
the conciousness of the abasement of one to whom she
had all her life looked up with love and veneration. To
write to Glenmurray while oppressed by such contending
emotions she knew to be impossible ; she therefore con-
tented herself with sending a verbal message, importing
that he should hear from her the next day : and poor
Glenmurray passed the rest of that day and the night in
a state little better than her own.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
The next morning Adeline, who had not closed her
eyes tiil day-light, .woke late, and from a sound but un-
refreshing sleep. The first object she saw was her maid,
smartly dressed, sitting by her bed-side; and she also
saw that she had been crying.
“ Is my mother ill, Evans ?” she exclaimed.
“O! no, Miss Adeline, quite well,” replied the girl,
sighing.
“ But why are you so much dressed ?” demanded
Adeline.
“ I have been out,” answered the maid.
“ Not on unpleasant business ?”
“ That's as it may be," she cried, turning away; and
Adeline, from delicacy, forbore to press her further.
“ 'Tis very late-is it not ?" asked Adeline, “and
time for me to rise ?”
“ Yes, miss--I believe you had better get up.”
Adeline immediately rose.—“Give me the dark gown
I wore yesterday,” said she.
“ I think, miss, you had better put on your new
white one,” returned the maid.
“ My new white one !” exclaimed Adeline, astonished
at an interference so new.
“ Yes, miss—I think it will be taken kinder, and
look better.”
At these words Adeline's suspicions were awakened.
“ I see, Evans," she cried, “ you have something extra-
ordinary to tell me :--I partly guess ; I,-my mother
- Here, unable to proceed, she lay down on the
bed which she had just quitted.
“Yes, Miss Adeline—'tis very true ; but pray compose
yourself, I am sure I have cried enough on your account,
that I have.”
“ What is true, my good Evans?” said Adeline faintly.
“Why, miss, my lady was married this morning to Sir
Patrick O'Carrol!—Mercy on me, how pale you look! I am
sure I wish the villain was at the bottom of the sea, so I do.”


## p. 59 (#75) ##############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
“ Leave me,” said Adeline faintly, struggling for
utterance.
“No—that I will not,” bluntly replied Evans ; "you
are not fit to be left; and they are rejoicing below with
Sir Pat's great staring servant. But, for my part, I had
rather stay here and cry with you than laugh with them.”
Adeline hid her face in the pillow, incapable of further
resistance, and groaned aloud.
“ Who should ever have thought my lady would have
done so !” continued the maid.—“Only think, miss! they
say, and I doubt it is too true, that there have been no
writings, or settlements, I think they call them, drawn
up; and so Sir Pat have got all, and he is over head
and ears in debt, and my lady is to pay him out on't!”
At this account, which Adeline feared was a just one,
as she had seen no preparations for a wedding going on,
and had observed no signs of deeds, or any thing of the
kind, she started up in an agony of grief—“ Then has
my mother given me up, indeed!” she exclaimed, clasp-
ing her hands together, “and the once darling child
may soon be a friendless outcast !”
“You want a friend, Miss Adeline!” said the kind
girl, bursting into tears.-“ Never, while I live, or any
of my fellow-servants.” And Adeline, whose heart was
bursting with a sense of forlornness and abandonment,
felt consoled by the artless sympathy of her attendant;
and, giving way to a violent flood of tears, she threw
her arms round her neck, and sobbed upon her bosom.
Having thus eased her feelings, she recollected that it
was incumbent on her to exert her fortitude ; and that
it was a duty which she owed her mother not to condemn
her conduct openly herself, nor suffer any one else to do
it in her presence : still, at that moment, she could not
find in her heart to reprove the observations by which,
in spite of her sense of propriety, she had been soothed
and gratified; but she hastened to dress herself as became
a bridal dinner, and dismissed, as soon as she could,

the affectionate Evans from her presence. She then
walked up and down her chamber, in order to summon
courage to enter the drawing-room. " But how strange,
how cruel it was,” said she, “ that my mother did not
come to inform me of this important event herself!”.
In this respect, however, Mrs. Mowbray had acted
kindly. Reluctant, even more than she was willing to
confess to her own heart, to meet Adeline alone, she
had chosen to conclude that she was still asleep, and had
desired she might not be disturbed; but soon after her
return from church, being assured that she was in a
sound slumber, she had stolen to her bed-side and put a
note under her pillow, acquainting her with what had
passed: but this note Adeline in her restlessness had,
with her pillow, pushed on the floor, and there unseen
it had remained. But, as Adeline was pacing to and fro,
she luckily observed it; and, by proving that her mother
had not been so very neglectful of her, it tended to
fortify her mind against the succeeding interview. The
note began:-“ My dearest child ! to spare you, in your
present weak state, the emotion which you would neces-
sarily feel in attending me to the altar, I have resolved
to let the ceremony be performed unknown to you. But,
my beloved Adeline, I trust that your affection for me
will make you rejoice in a step, which you may, perhaps,
at present disapprove, when convinced that it was
absolutely necessary to my happiness, and can, in no
way, be the means of diminishing yours.
“ I remain
“ Your ever affectionate mother.”
“ She loves me still then !” cried Adeline, shedding
tears of tenderness, “and I accused her unjustly.-
my dear mother, if this event should indeed increase
your happiness, never shall I repine at not having been
able to prevent it.” And then, after taking two or three
hasty turns round the room, and bathing her eyes to re-

move in a degree the traces of her tears, she ventured
into the drawing-room.
But the sight of her mother seated by Sir Patrick, his
arm encircling her waist, in that very room which had
so lately witnessed his profligate attempts on herself,
deprived her of the little resolution which she had been
able to assume, and pale and trembling she sunk speech-
less with emotion on the first chair near her.
Mrs. Mowbray, or, as we must at present call her,
Lady O'Carrol, was affected by Adeline's distress, and,
hastening to her, received the almost fainting girl in her
arms; while even Sir Patrick, feeling compassion for the
unhappiness which he could more readily understand
than his bride, was eager to hide his confusion by calling
for water, drops, and servants.
“ I want neither medicine nor assistance now," said
Adeline, gently raising her head from her mother's
shoulder : “ the first shock is over, and I shall, I trust,
behave in future with proper self-command.”
“ Better late than never," muttered Lady O'Carrol,
on whom the word shock had not made a pleasant impres-
sion; while Sir Patrick, approaching Adeline, exclaimed,
“ If you have not self-command, Miss Mowbray, it is the
only comniand which you cannot boast; for your power
of commanding others no one can dispute, who has ever
had the happiness of beholding you."
So saying, he took her hand; and, as her mother's
husband, claimed the privilege of saluting her,-a privi-
lege which Adeline, though she almost shrunk with horror
from his touch, had self-command enough not to deny
him : immediately after he claimed the same favour from
his bride; and they resumed their position on the sofa.
But so embarrassing was the situation of all parties
that no conversation took place; and Adeline, unable
any longer to endure the restraint to which she was
obliged, rose, to return to her own room, in order to hide
the sorrow which she was on the point of betraying,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
when her mother in a tone of reproach exclaimed, “ It
grieves me to the soul, Miss Mowbray, to perceive that
you appear to consider as a day of mourning the day
which I consider as the happiest of my life.”
“Oh! my dearest mother!" replied Adeline, returning
and approaching her, “it is the dread of your deceiving
yourself, only, that makes me sad at a time like this : if
this day in its consequences prove a happy one "
“And wherefore should you doubt that it will, Miss
Mowbray?”
“ Miss Mowbray, do you doubt my honour?” cried
Sir Patrick hastily.
Adeline instantly fixed her fine eyes on his face with a
look which he knew how to interpret, but not how to
support: and he cast his to the ground with painful
consciousness.
She saw her triumph, and it gave her courage to pro-
ceed :-“sir !” she cried, “it is in your power to
convert all my painful doubts into joyful certainties;
make but my mother happy, and I will love and bless
you ever.-Promise me, sir,” she continued, her enthu-
siasm and affection kindling as she spoke, “promise me
to be kind and indulgent to her;-she has never known
contradiction; she has been through life the darling ob-
ject of all who surrounded her; the pride of her parents,
her husband, and her child: neglect, injury, and unkind-
ness she would inevitably sink under: and I conjure you
(here she dropped on her knees and extended her arms
in an attitude of entreaty) by all your hopes of happi-
ness hereafter, to give her reason to continue to name
this the happiest day of her life.”
Here she ceased, overcome by the violence of her
emotions; but continued her look and attitude of en-
treaty, full of such sweet earnestness, that the baronet
could hardly conceal the variety of feelings which assailed
him; amongst which, passion for the lovely object before
him predominated. To make a jest of Adeline's serious-

63
ness he conceived to be the best way to conceal what he
felt; and while Mrs. Mowbray, overcome with Adeline's
expressions of tenderness, was giving way to them by a
flood of tears, and grasping in both hers the clasped
hands of Adeline, he cried, in an ironical tone,—“ You
are the most extraordinary motherly young creature that
I ever saw in my life, my dear girl! Instead of your mo-
ther giving the nuptial benediction to you, the order of
nature is reversed, and you are giving it to her. Upon
my word I begin to think, seeing you in that posture,
that you are my bride begging a blessing of mamma on
our union, and that I ought to be on my knees too."
So saying, he knelt beside Adeline at Lady O'Carrol's
feet, and in a tone of mock solemnity besought her to
bless both her affectionate children: and as he did this,
he threw his arm round the weeping girl, and pressed
her to his bosom. This speech, and this action, at once
banished all self-command from the indignant Adeline,
and in an instant she sprung from his embrace; and for-
getting how much her violence must surprise, if not alarm
and offend, her mother, she rushed out of the room, and
did not stop till she had reached her own chamber.
When there, she was alarmed lest her conduct should
have occasioned both pain and resentment to Lady
O'Carrol; and it was with trembling reluctance that she
obeyed the summons to dinner ; but her fears were
groundless. The bride had fallen into one of her reve-
ries during Sir Patrick's strange speech, from which she
awakened only at the last words of it, viz. “affectionate
children :" and seeing Sir Patrick at her feet, with a very
tender expression on his face, and hearing the words
“ affectionate children,” she conceived that he was ex-
pressing his hopes of their being blest with progeny, and
that a selfish feeling of fear at such a prospect had hur-
ried Adeline out of the room. She was therefore dis-
posed to regard her daughter with pity, but not with
resentment, when she entered the dinner-room, and

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline's tranquillity in a degree returned: but when she
retired for the night she could not help owning to her-
self, that that day, her mother's wedding day, had been
the most painful of her existence and she literally
sobbed herself to sleep.
The next morning a new trial awaited her; she had to
write a final farewell to Glenmurray. Many letters did
she begin, many did she finish, and many did she tear;
but recollecting that the longer she delayed sending him
one, the longer she kept him in a state of agitating sus-
pense, she resolved to send the last written, even though
it appeared to her not quite so strong a transcript of her
feelings as the former ones. Whether it was so or not,
Glenmurray received it with alternate agony and tran-
sport;—with agony because it destroyed every hope of
Adeline's being his,—and with transport, because every
line breathed the purest and yet most ardent attachment,
and convinced him that, however long their separation,
the love of Adeline would experience no change.
Many days elapsed before Glenmurray could bear any
companion but the letter of Adeline; and during that
time she was on the road with the bride and bridegroom
to a beautiful seat in Berkshire, called the Pavilion, hired
by Sir Patrick, the week before his marriage, of one of
his profligate friends. As the road lay through a very
fine country, Adeline would have thought the journey a
pleasant one, had not the idea of Glenmurray ill and de-
jected continually haunted her. Sir Patrick appeared to.
be engrossed by his bride, and she was really wholly
wrapt up in him ; and at times the beauties of the scenery
around had power to engage Adeline's attention : but
she immediately recollected how much Glenmurray would
have participated in her delight, and the contemplation
of the prospect ended in renewed recollections of him.

CHAPTER IX.
At length they arrived at the place of their destination;
and Sir Patrick, warmly embracing his bride, bade her
welcome to her new abode; and immediately approach-
ing Adeline, he bestowed on her an embrace no less
cordial :-or, to say the truth, so ardent seemed the
welcome, even to the innocent Adeline, that she vainly
endeavoured to persuade herself that, as her father-in-
law, Sir Patrick's tenderness was excusable.
Spite of her efforts to be cheerful she was angry and.
suspicious, and had an indistinct feeling of remote
danger; which though she could not define even to her-
self, it was new and painful to her to experience. But
as the elastic mind of eighteen soon rebounds from the
pressure of sorrow, and forgets in present enjoyment
the prospect of evil, Adeline gazed on the elegant apart-
ment she was in with joyful surprise; while, through
folding doors on either side of it, she beheld a suite of
rooms, all furnished with a degree of tasteful simplicity
such as she had never before beheld : and through the
windows, which opened on a lawn that sloped to the .
banks of a rapid river, she saw an amphitheatre of
wooded hills, which proved that, how great soever had
been the efforts of art to decorate their new habitation,
the hand of Nature had done still more to embellish it;
and all fear of Sir Patrick was lost in gratitude for his
having chosen such a retirement.
With eager curiosity Adeline hurried from room to
room; admired in the western apartments the fine effect
of the declining sun shining through rose-coloured win-
dow curtains; gazed with delight on the statues and
pictures that every where met the eye, and reposed with
unsuspecting gaiety on the couches of eider down which
were in profusion around. Every thing in the house

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
spoke it to be the temple of Pleasure: but the innocent
Adeline and her unobservant mother saw nothing but
elegant convenience in an abode in which the disciples of
Epicurus might have delighted; and while Æolian harps
in the windows, and perfumes of all kinds, added to the
enchantment of the scene, the bride only beheld in the
choice of the villa a proof of her husband's desire of
making her happy; and Adeline sighed for virtuous love
and Glenmurray, as all that was wanting to complete her
fascination.
Sir Patrick, meanwhile, was not blind to the impres-
sions made on Adeline by the beauty of the spot which
he had chosen, though he was far from suspecting the
companion she had pictured to herself as most fitted to
enjoy and embellish it; and pleased because she was
pleased, and delighted to be regarded by her with such
unusual looks of complacency, he gave himself up to his
natural vivacity; and Adeline passed a merry, if not a
happy, evening with the bride and bridegroom.
But the next morning she arose with the painful con-
viction as fresh as ever on her mind, that day would
succeed to day, and yet she should not behold Glen-
murray : and that day would succeed to day, and still
should she see O'Carrol, still be exposed to his noisy
mirth, to his odious familiarities, which, though she
taught herself to believe they proceeded merely from the
customs of his country, and the nearness of their relation-
ship, it was to her most painful to endure.
Her only resource, therefore, from unpleasant thoughts
was reading; and she eagerly opened the cases of books
in the library, which were unlocked. But, on taking
down some of the books, she was disappointed to find
none of the kind to which she had been accustomed.
Mrs. Mowbray's peculiar taste had led her, as we have
before observed, to the perusal of nothing but political
tracts, systems of philosophy, and Scuderi's and other
romances. Scarcely had the works of our best poets

67
found their way to her library; and novels, plays, and
works of a lighter kind she was never in the habit of
reading herself, and consequently had not put in the
hands of her daughter. Adeline had, therefore, read
Rousseau's Contrat Social, but not his Julie; Montes-
quieu's Esprit des Loix, but not his Lettres Persandes ;
and had glowed with republican ardour over the scenes
of Voltaire's Brutus, but had never had her mind pol-
luted by the pages of his romances.
Different had been the circumstances, and consequently
the practice, of the owner of Sir Patrick's new abode.
Of all Rousseau's works, he had in his library only the
New Heloise and his Confessions ; of Montesquieu, none
but the glowing letters above-mentioned ; and while
Voltaire's chaste and moral tragedies were excluded, his
profligate tales attracted the eye by the peculiar elegance
of their binding, while dangerous French novels of all
descriptions met the view under the downy pillows of
the inviting sofas around, calculated to inflame the fancy
and corrupt the morals.
But Adeline, unprepared by any reading of the kind
to receive and relish the poison contained in them, turned
with disgust from pages so uncongenial to her feelings;
nor did her eye dwell delighted on any of the stores
which the shelves contained.
Disappointment in her hopes of finding amusement in
reading, Adeline had recourse to walking; and none of
the beautiful scenes around remained long unexplored by
her. In her rambles she but too frequently saw scenes
of poverty and distress, which ill contrasted with the
beauty of the house which she inhabited; scenes, which
even a small portion of the money expended there in
useless decoration would have entirely alleviated : and
they were scenes, too, which Adeline had been accus-
tomed to relieve. The extreme of poverty in the cottage
did not disgrace, on the Mowbray estate, the well-fur-
nished mansion-house ; but Adeline, as we have observed
F 2

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
before, was allowed to draw on her mother for money
sufficient to prevent industrious labour from knowing
the distresses of want.
“And why should I not draw on her here for money
for the same purposes ?” cried Adeline to herself, as she
beheld one spectacle of peculiar hardships.-" Surely
my mother is not dependent on her husband ? and even
if she were, Sir Patrick has not a hard heart, and will
not refuse my prayer : and therefore, promising the
sufferers instant relief, she left them, saying she should
soon reach the Pavilion and be back again ; while the
objects of her bounty were silent with surprise at hearing
that their relief was to come from the Pavilion, a place
hitherto closed to the solicitations of poverty, though
ever open to the revels and the votaries of pleasure.
Adeline found her mother alone ; and with a beating
heart and a flushed cheek, she described the scene which
she had witnessed, and begged to be restored to her old
office of almoner on such occasions.
“ A sad scene, indeed, my dear Adeline !” replied the
bride in evident embarrassment, “ and I will speak to
Sir Patrick about it.”
“ Speak to Sir Patrick, madam ! cannot you follow
the impulse of humanity without consulting him?"
“ I can't give the relief you ask without his assistance,"
replied her mother; “ for, except a guinea or so, I have
no loose cash about me for my own uses.—Sir Patrick's
benevolence has long ago emptied his purse, and I gladly
surrendered mine to him.”
" And shall you in future have no money for the pur-
poses of charity but that you must claim from Sir Patrick?”
asked Adeline mournfully.
“O dear! yes,--I have a very handsome allowance set-
tled on me; but then at present he wants it himself (Adeline
involuntarily clasped her hands together in an agony,
and sighed deeply.) But, however, child,” added the
bride," as you seem to make such a point of it, take

69
this guinea to the cottage you mention, en atten-
dant !”
Adeline took the guinea : but it was very insufficient
to pay for medical attendance, to discharge the rent due
to a clamorous landlord, and to purchase several things
necessary for the relief of the poor sufferers : therefore
she added another guinea to it, and, not liking to relate
her disappointment, sent the money to them, desiring
the servant to say that she would see them the next
morning, when she resolved to apply to Sir Patrick for
the relief which her mother could not give; feeling at
the same time the mournful conviction, that she herself,
as well as her mother, would be in future dependent on
his bounty.
Though disposed to give way to mournful reflections
on her own account, Adeline roused herself from the
melancholy abstraction into which she was falling, by
reflecting that she had still to plead the cause of the
poor cottagers with Sir Patrick ; and hearing he was in
the house, she hastened to prefer her petition.
Sir Patrick listened to her tone of voice, and gazed on
her expressive countenance with delight; but when she
had concluded her narration a solitary half-guinea was
all he bestowed on her, saying, “ I am never roused to
charity by the descriptions of others; I must always see
the distress which I am solicited to relieve.”
« Then go with me to the cottage,” exclaimed Adeline ;
but to her great mortification he only smiled, bowed,
and disappeared : and when he returned to supper,
Adeline could scarcely prevail on herself to look at him
without displeasure, and could not endure the unfeeling
vivacity of his manner.
Mortified and unhappy, she next morning went to the
cottage, reluctant to impart to its expecting inhabitants
the ill success which she had experienced. But what
was her surprise when they came out joyfully to meet
her, and told her that a gentleman had been there that

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
morning very early, had discharged their debts, and gives
them a sum of money for their future wants !
“ His name, his name?” eagerly inquired Adeline :
but that they said he refused to give; and as he was in a
horseman's large coat, and held a hankerchief to his face,
they were sure they should not know him again.
A pleasing suspicion immediately came across Adeline's
mind that this benevolent unknown might be Glenmurray:
and the idea that he was perhaps unseen hovering round
her, gave her one of the most exquisite feelings which
she had ever known. But this agreeable delusion was
soon dissipated by one of the children's giving her a card
which the kind stranger had dropped from his pocket;
and this card had on it “ Sir Patrick O'Carrol.”
At first it was natural for her to be hurt and disap-
pointed at finding that her hopes concerning Glenmurray
had no foundation in truth; but her benevolence, and
indeed regard for her mother's happiness as well as her
own, led her to rejoice in this unexpected proof of excel-
lence in Sir Patrick. He had evidently proved that he
loved to do good by stealth, and had withdrawn himself
even from her thanks.
In a moment, therefore, she banished from her mind
every trace of his unworthiness. She had done him in-
justice, and she sought refuge from the remorse which
this consciousness inflicted on her, by going into the
opposite extreme. From that hour, indeed, her com-
plaisance to his opinions, and her attentions to him,
were so 'unremitting and evident, that Sir Patrick's pas-
sion became stronger than ever, and his hopes of a return
to it seemed to be built on a very strong foundation.
Adeline had given all her former suspicions to the
wind; 'daily instances of his benevolence came to her
knowledge, and threw such a charm over all he said and
did, that even the familiarity in his conduct, look, and
manner towards her, appeared to her now nothing more
than the result of the free manners of his countrymen :

71
--and she sometimes could not help wishing Sir Patrick
to be known to, and intimate with, Glenmurray. But
the moment was now at hand that was to unveil the real
character of Sir Patrick, and determine the destiny of
Adeline.
· One day Sir Patrick proposed taking his bride to see
a beautiful ferme ornee at about twelve miles' distance ;
and if it answered the expectations which he had formed
of it, they were determined to spend two or three days in
the neighbourhood to enjoy the beauty of the grounds;
-in that case he was to return in the evening to the
Pavilion, and drive Adeline over the next morning to
partake in their pleasure.
To this scheme both the ladies gladly consented, as it
was impossible for them to suspect the villanous design
which it was intended to aid.
The truth was, that Sir Patrick, having, as he fondly
imagined, gained Adeline's affections, resolved to defer
no longer the profligate attempt which he had long
meditated ; and had contrived this excursion in order to
insure his wife's absence from home, and a tête-à-tête
with her daughter.
At an early hour the curricle was at the door, and Sir
Patrick, having handed his lady in, took leave of Adeline.
He told her that he should probably return early in the
evening, pressed her hand more tenderly than usual, and,
springing into the carriage, drove off with a countenance
animated with expected triumph.
Adeline immediately set out on a long walk to the ad-
joining villages, visited the cottages near the Pavilion,
and, having dined at an early hour, determined to pass
the rest of the day in reading, provided it was possible
for her to find any book in the house proper for her
perusal.
With this intention she repaired to an apartment
called the library, but what in these times would be de-
nominated a boudoir ; and this even in Paris, would have

72
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR, .
been admired for its voluptuous elegance. On the table
lay several costly volumes, which seemed to have been
very lately perused by Sir Patrick, as some of them were
open, some turned down at particular passages : but as
soon as she glanced her eye over their contents, Adeline
indignantly threw them down again; and, while her
cheek glowed with the blush of offended modesty she
threw herself on a sofa, and fell into a long and mourn-
ful reverie on the misery which awaited her mother, in
consequence of her having madly dared to unite herself
for life to a young libertine, who could delight in no
other reading but what was offensive to good morals and
to delicacy. Nor could she dwell upon this subject
without recurring to her former fears for herself; and so
lost was she in agonising reflections, that it was some
time before she recollected herself sufficiently to remem-
ber that she was guilty of an indecorum, in staying so
long in an apartment which contained books that she
ought not even to be suspected of having had an oppor-
tunity to peruse.
Having once entertained this consciousness, Adeline
hastily arose, and had just reached the door when Sir
Patrick himself appeared at it. She started back in
terror when she beheld him, on observing in his counte-
nance and manner evident marks not only of determined
profligacy, but of intoxication. Her suspicions were
indeed just. Bold as he was in iniquity, he dared not
in a cool and sober moment put his guilty purpose in
execution ; and he shrunk with temporary horror from
an attempt on the honour of the daughter of his wife,
though he believed that she would be a wiiling victim.
He had therefore stopped on the road to fortify his
courage with wine; and, luckily for Adeline, he had
taken more than he was aware of; for when, after a
vehement declaration of the ardour of his passion, he
dared irreverently to approach her, Adeline, strong in
innocence, aware of his intention, and presuming on his

73
situation, disengaged herself from his grasp with ease;
and pushing him with violence from her, he fell with
such force against the brass edge of one of the sofas,
that, stunned and wounded by the fall, he lay bleeding
on the ground. Adeline involuntarily was hastening to
his assistance : but recollecting how mischievous to her
such an exertion of humanity might be, she contented
herself with ringing the bell violently to call the servants
to his aid. Then, in almost frantic haste, she rushed
out of the house, ran across the park, and when she
recovered her emotion she found herself, she scarcely
knew how, sitting on a turf seat by the road side.
“ What will become of me!” she wildly exclaimed:
“my mother's roof is no longer a protection to me ;-I
cannot absent myself from it without alleging a reason
for my conduct, which will ruin her peace of mind for
ever. Wretch that I am! whither can I go, and where
can I seek for refuge ?”
At this moment, as she looked around in wild dismay,
and raised her streaming eyes to heaven, she saw a man's
face peeping from between the branches of a tree opposite
to her, and observed that he was gazing on her intently.
Alarmed and fluttered, she instantly started from her
seat, and was hastening away, when the man suddenly
dropped from his hiding-place, and, running after her,
called her by her name, and conjured her to stop; while,
with an emotion of surprise and delight, she recognised in
him Arthur, the servant of Glenmurray!
Instantly, scarcely knowing what she did, she pressed
the astonished Arthur's rough hand in hers; and by this
action confused and confounded the poor fellow so much,
that the speech which he was going to make faltered on
his tongue.
:“Oh! where is your master ?” eagerly inquired
Adeline.
“ My master has sent you this, miss,” replied Arthur,
holding out a letter, which Adeline joyfully received;


## p. 74 (#90) ##############################################

74
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
and, spite of her intended obedience to her mother's will,
Glenmurray himself could not have met with a more
favourable reception, for the moment was a most propitious
one to his love : nor, as it happened, was Glenmurray
too far off to profit by it. On his way from Bath he
went a few miles out of his road, in order, as he said,
and perhaps as he thought, to pay a visit to an old ser-
vant of his mother's, who was married to a respectable
farmer; but, fortunately, the farm commanded a view
of the Pavilion, and Glenmurray could from his window
gaze on the house that contained the woman of his
affections.
But to return to Adeline, who, while hastily tearing
open the letter, asked Arthur where his master was, and
heard with indescribable emotion that he was in the
neighbourhood.
• Here! so providentially !” she exclaimed, and pro-
ceeded to read the letter ; but her emotion forbade her
to read it entirely. She only saw that it contained bank-
notes; that Glenmurray was going abroad for his health;
and, in case he should die there, had sent her the money
which he had meant to leave her in his will, lest she
should be, in the meanwhile, any way dependent on
Sir Patrick.
Numberless conflicting emotions took possession of
Adeline's heart while this new proof of her lover's
attentive tenderness met her view : and, as she con-
trasted his generous and delicate attachment with the
licentious passion of her mother's libertine husband, a
burst of uncontrollable affection for Glenmurray agitated
her bosom; and, rendered superstitious by her fears,
she looked on him as sent by Providence to save her
from the dangers of her home.
« This is the second time,” cried she, “ that Glen-
murray, as my guardian angel, has appeared at the
moment when I was exposed to danger from the same
guilty quarter! Ah! surely there is more than accident

in this! and he is ordained to be my guide and my
protector !”
When once a woman has associated with an amiable
man the idea of protection, he can never again be in-
different to her: and when the protector happens to be
the chosen object of her love, his power becomes fixed
on a basis never to be shaken.
“ It is enough,” said Adeline in a faltering voice,
pressing the letter to her lips, and bursting into tears of
grateful tenderness as she spoke : « Lead me to your
master directly.”
“ Bless my heart! will you see him then, miss ?”
cried Arthur.
“ See him?" replied Adeline — " see the only friend
I now can boast ?- But let us be gone this moment, lest
I should be seen and pursued.”
Instantly, guided by Arthur, Adeline set off full speed
for the farm-house, nor stopped till she found herself in
the presence of Glenmurray!
“O! I am safe now !” exclaimed Adeline, throwing
herself into his arms; while he was 80 overcome with
surprise and joy that he could not speak the welcome
which his heart gave her : and Adeline, happy to behold
him again, was as silent as her lover. At length Glen-
murray exclaimed :-
“ Do we then meet again, Adeline!”
“ Yes," replied she; “and we meet to part no more.”
“ Do not mock me," cried Glenmurray starting from
his seat, and seizing her extended hand; “ my feelings
must not be trifled with.”
“ Nor am I a woman to trifle with them. Glenmurray,
I come to you for safety and protection ;-I come to seek
shelter in your arms from misery and dishonour. You
are ill, you are going into a foreign country: and from
this moment look on me as your nurse, your companion;
your home shall be my home, your country my
country !”

76
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Glenmurray, too much agitated, too happy to speak,
could only press the agitated girl to his bosom, and fold
his arms round her, as if to assure her of the protection
which she claimed.
“ But there is not a moment to be lost,” cried
Adeline: I may be missed and pursued : let us be gone
directly.”
The first word was enough for Glenmurray : eager to
secure the recovered treasure which he had thought for
ever lost, his orders were given, and executed by the
faithful Arthur with the utmost dispatch; and even
before Adeline had explained to him the cause of her
resolution to elope with him they were on their road to
Cornwall, meaning to embark at Falmouth for Lisbon.
But Arthur, who was going to marry, and leave Glen-
murray's service, received orders to stay at the farm till
he had learned how Sir Patrick was : and having ob-
tained the necessary information, he was to send it to
Glenmurray at Falmouth. The next morning he saw Sir
Patrick himself driving full speed past the farm ; and
having written immediately to his master, Adeline had
the satisfaction of knowing that she had not purchased
her own safety by the sufferings or danger of her perse-
cutor, and the consequent misery of her mother.
CHAPTER X.
But Glenmurray's heart needed no explanation of the
cause of Adeline's elopement. She was with him-with
him, as she said, for ever. True, she had talked of
flying from misery and dishonour ; but he knew they
could not reach her in his arms,—not even dishonour
according to the ideas of society,—for he meant to make
Adeline legally his as soon as they were safe from pur-
suit, and his illness was forgotten in the fond transport
of the present moment.

Adeline's joy was of a much shorter duration. Recol-
lections of a most painful nature were continually recur-
ring. True it was that it was no longer possible for her
to reside under the roof of her mother : but was it ne-
cessary for her to elope with Glenmurray ? the man
whom she had solemnly promised her mother to renounce!
Then, on the other side, she argued that the appearance
of love for Glenmurray was an excuse sufficient to con-
ceal from her deluded parent the real cause of her elope-
ment.
“ It was my sole alternative," said she mentally :-
“my mother must either suppose me an unworthy child,
or know Sir Patrick to be an unworthy husband ; and it
will be easier for her to support the knowledge of the
one than of the other : then, when she forgives me, as
no doubt she will in time, I shall be happy : but that I
could never be, while convinced that I had made her
miserable by revealing to her the wickedness of Sir
Patrick.”
While this was passing in her mind, her countenance
was full of such anxious and mournful expression, that
Glenmurray, unable to keep silence any longer, conjured
her to tell him what so evidently weighed upon her
spirits.
« The difficulty that oppressed me is past,” she re-
plied, wiping from her eyes the tears which the thought
of having left her mother so unexpectedly, and for the
first time, produced. “I have convinced myself, that
to leave home and commit myself to your protection was
the most proper and virtuous step that I could take: I
have not obeyed the dictates of love, but of reason.”
"I am very sorry to hear it," said Glenmurray mourn-
fully,
It seems to me so very rational to love you,” re-
turned Adeline tenderly, shocked at the sad expression
of his countenance, “ that what seems to be the dictates
of reason may be those of love only."

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
To a reply like this, Glenmurray could only answer by
those incoherent yet intelligible expressions of fondness
to the object of them, which are so delightful to lovers
themselves, and so uninteresting to other people: nay,
so entirely was Glenmurray again engrossed by the sense
of present happiness, that his curiosity was still sus-
pended, and Adeline's story remained untold. But
Adeline's pleasure was damped by painful recollections,
and still more by her not being able to hide from herself
the mournful consciousness that the ravages of sickness
were but too visible in Glenmurray's face and figure, and
that the flush of unexpected delight could but ill conceal
the hollow paleness of his cheek, and the sunk appear-
ance of his eyes.
Meanwhile the chaise rolled on,-post succeeded to
post; and though night was far advanced, Adeline,
fearful of being pursued, would not consent to stop, and
they travelled till morning. But Glenmurray, feeling
himself exhausted, prevailed on her, for his sake, to alight
at a small inn on the road side near Marlborough.
There Adeline narrated the occurrences of the past
day; but with difficulty could she prevail on herself to
own to Glenmurray that she had been the object of such
an outrage as she had experienced from Sir Patrick.
A truly delicate woman feels degraded, not flattered,
by being the object of libertine attempts; and, situated
as Adeline and Glenmurray now were, to disclose the
insult which had been offered to her was a still more dif-
ficult task: but to conceal it was impossible. She felt
that, even to him, some justification of her precipitate
and unsolicited flight was necessary; and nothing but
Sir Patrick's attempt could justify it. She, therefore,
blushing and hesitating, revealed the disgraceful secret;
but such was its effect on the weak spirits and delicate
health of Glenmurray, that the violent emotions which
he underwent brought on a return of his most alarming
symptoms; and in a few hours Adeline, bending over the

sick bed of her lover, experienced for the first time that
most dreadful of feelings, fear for the life of the object
of her affections.
Two days, however, restored him to comparative safety,
and they reached a small and obscure village within a
short distance from Falmouth, most conveniently situ-
ated. There they took up their abode, and resolved to
remain till the wind should change, and enable them to
sail for Lisbon.
In this retreat, situated in air as salubrious as that of
the south of France, Glenmurray was soon restored to
health, especially as happy love was now his, and brought
back the health of which hopeless love had contributed
to deprive him. The woman whom he loved was his
companion and his nurse; and so dear had the quiet
scene of their happiness become to them, that, forgetful
there was still a danger of their being discovered, it was
with considerable regret that they received a summons to
embark, and saw themselves on their voyage to Portugal.
But before she left England Adeline wrote to her mother.
After a pleasant and short voyage the lovers found
themselves at Lisbon; and Glenmurray, pursuant to his
resolution, immediately proposed to Adeline to unite
himself to her by the indissoluble ties of marriage.
Nothing could exceed Adeline's surprise at this pro-
posal : at first she could not believe Glenmurray was in
earnest; but seeing that he looked not only grave but
anxious, and as if earnestly expecting an answer, she
asked him whether he had convinced himself that what
he had written against marriage was a tissue of mis-
chievous absurdity.
Glenmurray, blushing, with the conceit of an author
replied“ that he still thought his arguments unanswer-
able.”
“ Then, if you still are convinced your theory is good,
why let your practice be bad? It is incumbent on you
to act up to the principles that you profess, in order to

give them their proper weight in society-else you give
the lie to your own declarations.”
“ But it is better for me to do that, than for you to be
the sacrifice to my reputation.”
« I,” replied Adeline, “ am entirely out of the
question: you are to be governed by no other law but
your desire to promote general utility, and are not to
think at all of the interest of an individual.”
“ How can I do so, when that individual is dearer to
me than all the world beside ?” cried Glenmurray
passionately,
“ And if you but once recollect that you are dearer to
me than all the world beside, you will cease to suppose
that my happiness can be affected by the opinion enter-
tained of my conduct by others.” As Adeline said this,
she twisted both her hands in his arms so affectionately,
and looked up in his face with so satisfied and tender an
expression, that Glenmurray could not bear to go on
with a subject which evidently drew a cloud across her
brow; and hours, days, weeks, and months passed
rapidly over their heads before he had resolution to
renew it.
Hours, days, weeks, and months spent in a manner
most dear to the heart and most salutary to the mind of
Adeline !-Her taste for books, which had hitherto been
cultivated in a partial manner, and had led her to one
range of study only, was now directed by Glenmurray to
the perusal of general literature ; and the historian, the
biographer, the poet, and the novelist, obtained alter-
nately her attention and her praises.
In her knowledge of the French and Italian languages,
too, she was now considerably improved by the instruc-
tions of her lover; and while his occasional illnesses
were alleviated by her ever watchful attentions, their at-
tachment was cemented by one of the strongest of all
ties the consciousness of mutual benefit and assistance.

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
CHAPTER XI. ·
ONE evening, as they were sitting on a bench in one of
the public walks, a gentleman approached them, whose
appearance bespoke him to be an Englishman, though
his sun-burnt complexion showed that he had been for
years exposed to a more ardent climate than that of Britain.
As he came nearer, Glenmurray thought his features
were familiar to him; and the stranger, starting with
joyful' surprise, seized his hand, and welcomed him as an
old friend. Glenmurray returned his salutation with
great cordiality, and recognised in the stranger, a Mr.
Maynard, an amiable man, who had gone to seek his
fortune in India, and was returned a nabob, but with an
irreproachable character.
“So, then,” cried Mr. Maynard gaily, “ this is the
elegant young English couple that my servant, and even
the inn-keeper himself, was so loud in praise of! Little
did I think the happy man was my old friend,—though
no man is more deserving of being happy: but I beg
you will introduce me to your lady.”
Glenmurray, though conscious of the mistake he was
under, had not resolution enough to avow that he was
not married; and Adeline, unaware of the difficulty of
Glenmurray's situation, received Mr. Maynard's saluta-
tion with the utmost ease, though the tremor of her
lover's voice, and the blush on his cheek, as he said
“Adeline, give me leave to introduce to you Mr. Maynard,
an old friend of mine,” —were sufficient indications that
the rencontre disturbed him.
In a few minutes Adeline and Mr. Maynard were no
longer strangers. Mr. Maynard, who had not lived
much in the society of well-informed women, and not
at all in that of women accustomed to original thinking,
was at once astonished and delighted at the variety of

82
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline's remarks, at the playfulness of her imagination,
and the eloquence of her expressions. But it was very
evident, at length, to Mr. Maynard, that in proportion as
Adeline and he became more acquainted and more satis-
fied with each other, Glenmurray grew more silent and
more uneasy. The consequence was unavoidable: as
most men would have done on a like occasion, Mr. May-
nard thought Glenmurray was jealous of him.
Butno thought so vexatious to himself, and so degrading
to Adeline, had entered the confiding and discriminating
mind of Glenmurray. The truth was, he knew that
Mr. Maynard, whom he had seen in the walks, though
he had not known him again, had ladies of his party;
and he expected that the more Mr. Maynard admired his
supposed wife, the more would he be eager to introduce
her to his companions.
Nor was Glenmurray wrong in his conjectures.
“ I have two sisters with me, madam,” said Mr. May-
nard, “whom I shall be happy and proud to introduce
to you. One of them is a widow, and has lived several
years in India, but returned with me in delicate health,
and was ordered hither: she is not a woman of great
reading, but has an excellent understanding, and will
admire you. The other is several years younger; and I am
sure she would be happy in an opportunity of profiting by
the conversation of a lady, who, though not older than
herself, seems to have had so many more opportunities of
improvement."
Adeline bowed, and expressed her impatience to form
this new acquaintance; and looked triumphantly at
Glenmurray, meaning to express See, spite of the sup-
posed prejudices of the world, here is a man who wants
to introduce me to his sisters. Little did she know that
Maynard concluded she was a wife : his absence from
England had made him ignorant of the nature of Glen-
murray's works, or even that he was an author ; so that
he was not at all likely to suppose that the moral, pious

youth, whom he had always respected, was become a
visionary philosopher, and, in defiance of the laws of
society, was living openly with a mistress.
“ But my sister will wonder what is become of me;"
suddenly cried Maynard ; “ and as Emily is so unwell
as to keep her room to-day, I must not make her anxious.
But for her illness, I should have requested your company
to supper.”
“ And I should have liked to accept the invitation,”
replied Adeline ; “ but I will hope to see the ladies soon.”
so Oh! without fail, to-morrow,” cried Maynard : “if
Emily be not well enough to call on you, perhaps you
will come to her apartments.”
“ Undoubtedly : expect me at twelve o'clock."
Maynard then shook his grave and silent friend by the
hand and, departed,-his vanity not a little flattered by
the supposed jealousy of Glenmurray.
“ There now,” said Adeline, when he was out of
hearing, “ I hope some of your tender fears are done
away. You see there are liberal and unprejudiced per-
sons in the world; and Mr. Maynard, instead of shunning
me, courts my acquaintance for his sisters."
Glenmurray shook his head, and remained silent ; and
Adeline was distressed to feel by his burning hand that
he was seriously uneasy.
“ I shall certainly call on these ladies to-morrow,”
continued Adeline :-" I really pine for the society of
amiable women.”
Glenmurray sighed deeply: he dreaded to tell her that
he could not allow her to call on them, and yet he knew
that this painful task awaited him. Besides, she wished,
she said, to know some amiable women; and, eager as
he was to indulge all her wishes, he felt but too certainly
that in this wish she could never be indulged. Even
had he been capable of doing so dishonourable an action
as introducing his mistress as his wife, he was sure that
Adeline would have spurned at the deception ; and silent

and sad he grasped Adeline's hand as her arm rested
within his, and complaining of indisposition, slowly
returned to the inn.
The next morning at breakfast, Adeline again expressed
her eagerness to form an acquaintance with the sisters of
Mr. Maynard; when Glenmurray, starting from his seat,
paced the room in considerable agitation.
“ What is the matter!” cried Adeline, hastily rising
and laying her hand on his arm.
Glenmurray grasped her hand, and replied with
assumed firmness : “ Adeline, it is impossible for you to
form an acquaintance with Mr. Maynard's sisters : pro-
priety and honour both forbid me to allow it.”
« Indeed !” exclaimed Adeline, “ are they not as amia-
ble, then, as he described them ? are they improper ac-
quaintances for me? Well then-I am disappointed : but
you are the best judge of what is right, and I am contented
to obey you.”
The simple, ingenuous and acquiescent sweetness with
which she said this, was a new pang to her lover :-had
she repined, had she looked ill-humoured, his task would
pot have been so difficult.
But what reason can you give for declining this ac-
quaintance?” resumed Adeline.
« Aye! there's the difficulty,” replied Glenmurray :
“ pure-minded and amiable as I know you to be, how
can I bear to tell these children of prejudice that you are
not my wife, but my mistress ?”
Adeline started; and, turning pale, exclaimed, “ Are
you sure, then, that they do not know it already?”
« Quite sure—else Maynard would not have thought
you a fit companion for his sisters.”
“ But surely-he must know your principles ;-he
must have read your works?”
“ I am certain he is ignorant of both, and does not
even know that I am an author.”
“Is it possible ?” cried Adeline: “is there any one so
unfortunate as to be unacquainted with your writings?”

Glenmurray at another time would have been elated at
a compliment like this from the woman whom he idolized;
but at this moment he heard it with a feeling of pain
which he would not have liked to define to himself, and
casting his eyes to the ground he said nothing.
“ So then,” said Adeline mournfully, “ I am an im-
proper companion for them, not they for me!” and spite
of herself her eyes filled with tears.--At this moment a
waiter brought in a note for Glenmurray;—it was from
Maynard, and as follows:-
MY DEAR FRIEND,
Emily is better to-day; and both my sisters are so im-
patient to see, and know, your charming wife, that they
beg me to present their compliments to Mrs. Glenmurray
and you; and request the honour of your company to a
late breakfast:-at eleven o'clock we hope to see you.
Ever yours,
G. M.
“ We will send an answer,” said Glenmurray : but the
waiter had been gone some minutes before either Adeline
or Glenmurray spoke. At length Adeline, struggling
with her feelings, observed, " Mr. Maynard seems so
amiable a man, that I should think it would not be diffi-
cult to convince him of his errors : surely, therefore, it
is your duty to call on him, state our real situation, and
our reasons for it, and endeavour to convince him that
our attachment is sanctioned both by reason and virtue.”
“ But not by the church,” replied Glenmurray, “and
Maynard is of the old school: besides, a man of forty-eight
is not likely to be convinced by the arguments of a young
man of twenty-eight, and the example of a girlof nineteen.”
“ If age be necessary to give weight to arguments,"
returned Adeline, “ I wonder that you thought proper
to publish four years ago.”.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
“ Would to God I never had published !” exclaimed
Glenmurray, almost pettishly.
“ If you had not, I probably should never have been
yours," replied Adeline, fondly leaning her head on his
shoulder, and then looking up in his face. Glenmurray
clasped her to his bosom ; but again the pleasure was
mixed with pain. “ All this time,” rejoined Adeline,
“ your friends are expecting an answer : you had better
carry it in person.”
“I cannot,” replied Glenmurray, “ and there is only
one way of getting out of this business to my satisfaction.
“ Name it; and rest assured that I shall approve it.”
“ Then I wish to order horses immediately, and set
off on our road to France.”
“ So soon,—though the air agrees with you so well ?”
“ O yes ;—for when the mind is uneasy no air can be
of use to the body.”
“ But why is your mind uneasy ?”
“ Here I should be exposed to see Maynard, and
and-he would see you too.”
“ And what then?”
• What then ?—Why, I could not bear to see him
look on you with an eye of disrespect.”
“ And wherefore should he ?”
“ O Adeline, the name of wife imposes restraint even
on a libertine ; but that of mistress "
• Is Mr. Maynard then a libertine?” said Adeline
gravely: and Glenmurray, afraid of wounding her feel-
ings by entering into a further explanation, changed the
subject, and again requested her consent to leave Lisbon.
as I have often told you,” said Adeline sighing, “ that
my will is yours; and if you will give strict orders to
have letters sent after us to the towns that we shall stop
at, I am ready to set off immediately."
Glenmurray then gave his orders; wrote a letter
explaining his situation to Maynard, and in an hour they
were on their journey to France.

CHAPTER XII.
In the meanwhile Mr. Maynard, Miss Maynard, and
Mrs. Wallington his widowed sister, were impatiently
expecting Glenmurray's answer, and earnestly hoping
to see him and his lovely companion,—but from different
motives. Maynard was impatient to see Adeline because
he really admired her; his sisters, because they hoped
to find her unworthy of such violent admiration.
Their vanity had been piqued, and their envy excited,
by the extravagant praises of their brother; and they
had interrupted him by the first questions which all
women ask on such occasions,+" Is she pretty ?”
· And he answered, “ Very pretty.”
“ Is she tall ?”
“ Very tall, taller than I am.”
“ I hate tall women,” replied Miss Maynard (a little
round girl of nineteen.)
“ Is she fair?”
“ Exquisitely fair.”
“ I like brown women,” cried the widow : “ fair
people always look silly.”
But Mrs. Glenmurray's eyes are hazel, and her eye-
lashes long and dark.”
“ Hazel eyes are always bold-looking,” cried Miss
Maynard.
- Not Mrs. Glenmurray's; for her expression is the
most pure and ingenuous that I ever saw. Some girls,
indecent in their dress, and very licentious in their
manner, passed us as we sat on the walk; and the com-
ments which I made on them provoked from Mrs. Glen-
murray some remarks on the behaviour and dress of
women; and, as she commented on the disgusting ex-
pression of vice in women, and the charm of modest
dignity both in dress and manners, her own dress,


## p. 88 (#104) #############################################

88
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
manners, and expression, were such an admirable com-
ment on her words, and she shone so brightly, if I may
use the expression, in the graceful awfulness of virtue,
that Igazed with delight, and somewhat ofapprehension lest
this fair perfection should suddenly take flight to her native
skies, toward which herfine eyes were occasionally turned.”
“ Bless me! if our brother is not quite poetical! This
prodigy has inspired him,” replied the widow with a sneer.
“For my part, I hate prodigies,” said Miss Maynard :
“ I feel myself unworthy to associate with them.”
When one woman calls another a prodigy, and ex-
presses herself as unworthy to associate with her, it is
very certain that she means to insult rather than compli-
ment her; and in this sense Mr. Maynard understood
his sister's words: therefore after having listened with
tolerable patience to a few more sneers at the unconscious
Adeline, he was provoked to say that, ill-disposed as he
found they were toward his new acquaintance, he hoped
that when they became acquainted with her they would
still give him reason to say, as he always had done, that
he was proud of his sisters ; for, in his opinion, no
woman ever looked so lovely as when she was doing
justice to the merits and extenuating the faults of a rival.
“A rival !” exclaimed the sisters at once :-“ And,
pray, what rivalship could there be in this case ?”
“My remark was a general one: but since you choose
to make it a particular one, I will answer to it as such,”
continued Mr. Maynard. “ All women are rivals in one
sense-rivals for general esteem and admiration; and
she only shall have my suffrage in her favour, who can
point out a beauty or a merit in another woman without
insinuating at the same time a counterbalancing effect.”
“ But Mrs. Glenmurray, it seems, has no defects !”
“ At least I have not known her long enough to find
them out; but you, no doubt, will, when you know her,
very readily spare me that trouble.”
How injudiciously had Maynard prepared the minds

89
of his sisters to admire Adeline. It was a preparation
to make them hate her; and they were very impatient
to begin the task of depreciating both her morale and
her physique, when Glenmurray's note arrived.
“ It is not Glenmurray's hand,” said Maynard—(in-.
deed, from agitation of mind the writing was not re-
cognisable). « It must be hers then,” continued he,
affecting to kiss the address with rapture.
“ It is the hand of a sloven,” observed Mrs. Walling-
ton, studying the writing.
“ But in dress she is as neat as a Quaker,” retorted
the brother, eagerly snatching the letter back, “and
her mind seems as pure as her dress.”
He then broke the seal, and read out what follows:-
“ DEAR MAYNARD,
“When you receive this, Adeline and I shall be on our
road to France, and you,-start not !are the occasion
of our abrupt departure.”
“So, so, jealous indeed,” said Maynard to himself,
and more impressed than ever with the charms of Adeline ;
for he concluded that Glenmurray had discovered in her
an answering prepossession.
“ You the occasion, brother!” cried both sisters.
“ Have patience.”
“ You saw Adeline ; you admired her; and wished
to introduce her to your sisters—this, honour forbad me
to allow”—(the sisters started from their seats) “ for
Adeline is not my wife, but my companion.”
Here Maynard niade a full pause—at once surprised
and confounded. His sisters, pleased as well as astonished,
looked triumphantly at each other; and Mrs. Wallington
exclaimed, “So, then, this angel of purity turns out to
be a kept lady!” At this remark Miss Maynard laughed
heartily, but Maynard, to hide his confusion, commanded
silence, and went on with the letter :

90
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ But, spite of her situation, strange as it may seem
to you, believe me, no wife was ever more pure than
Adeline.”
At this passage the sisters could no longer contain
.themselves, and they gave way to loud bursts of laughter,
which Maynard could hardly help joining in; but being
angry at the same time he uttered nothing but an oath,
which I shall not repeat, and retreated to his chamber
to finish the letter alone.
During his absence the laughters redoubled ;—but in
the midst of it Maynard re-entered, and desired they
would allow him to read the letter to the end. The
sisters immediately begged that he would proceed, as it
was so amusing that they wished to hear more,—Glen-
murray continued thus :
“ You have no doubt yet to learn that some few years
ago I commenced author, and published opinions contrary
to the established usage of society: amongst other things
I proved the absurdity of the institution of marriage ;
and Adeline, who at an early age read my works, became
one of my converts.”
“ The man is certainly mad," cried Maynard, “ and
how dreadful it is that this angelic creature should have
been his victim.”
“ But perhaps this fallen angel, brother, for such
you will allow she is, spite of her purity, was as wicked
as he. I know people in general only blame the seducer,
but I always blame the seduced equally.”
“I do not doubt it,” said her brother sneeringly, and
going on with the letter.
« No wonder then, that, being forced to fly from her
maternal roof, she took refuge in my arms.”
“ Lucky dog!”
“But though Adeline was the victim neither of her
own weakness nor of my seductions, but was merely
urged by circumstances to act up to the principles which
she openly professed, I felt so conscious that she would

be degraded in your eyes after you were acquainted with
her situation, though in mine she appears as spotless as
ever, that I could not bear to expose her even to a glance
from you less respectful than those with which you beheld
her last night. I therefore prevailed on her to leave
Lisbon ; nor had I any difficulty in so doing, when she
found that your wish of introducing her to your sisters
was founded on your supposition of her being my wife,
and that all chance of your desiring her acquaintance for
them would be over, when you knew the nature of her
connexion with me. I shall now bid you farewell. I
write in haste and agitation, and have not time to say
more than God bless you !
“ F. G.”
“ Yes, yes, I see how it is,” muttered Mr. Maynard
to himself when he had finished the letter, “ he was
jealous of me. I wish (raising his voice) that he had
not been in such a hurry to go away.”
“ Why, brother,” replied Mrs. Wallington, “ to be
sure you would not have introduced us to this piece of
angelic purity a little the worse for the wear!”
“ No," replied he; “ but I might have enjoyed her
company myself.”
“And perhaps, brother, you might have rivalled the
philosophic author in time,” observed Miss Maynard.
“ If I had not, it would have been from no want of
good will on my part,” returned Maynard.
“ Well, then I rejoice that the creature is gone,”
replied Mrs. Wallington, drawing up.
" And I too,” said Miss Maynard disdainfully: “but
I think we had better drop this subject; I have had
quite enough of it.”
" And so have I,” cried Mrs. Wallington : “ but I
must observe, before we drop it entirely, that when next
my brother comes home and wearies his sisters by ex-
aggerated praises of another woman, I hope he will take

care that his goddess, or rather his angel of purity, does
not turn out to be a kept mistress."
So saying she left the room, and Miss Maynard,
tittering, followed her; while Maynard, too sore on this
subject to bear to be laughed at, took his hat in a pet,
and, flinging the door after him with great violence,
walked out to muse on the erring but interesting com-
panion of Glenmurray.
CHAPTER XIII.
WHILE these conversations were passing at Lisbon,
Glenmurray and Adeline were pursuing their journey
to France; and insensibly did the charm of being to-
gether obliterate from the minds of each the rencontre
which had so much disturbed them.
But Adeline began to be uneasy on a subject of much
greater importance; she every day expected an answer
from her mother, but no answer arrived ; and they had
been stationary at Perpignan some days, to which place
they had desired their letters to be addressed, poste
restante, and still none were forwarded thither from
Lisbon.
The idea that her mother had utterly renounced her
now took possession of her imagination, and love had no
charm to offer her capable of affording her consolation :
the care which she had taken of her infancy, the af-
fectionate attentions that had preserved her life, and the
uninterrupted kindness which she had shown towards
her till her attachment to Sir Patrick took place,—all these
pressed powerfully and painfully on her memory, till her
elopement seemed wholly unjustifiable in her eyes, and
she reprobated her conduct in terms of the most bitter
self-reproach.
At these moments even Glenmurray seemed to become
the object of her aversion. Her mother had forbidden

her to think of him; yet, to make her flight more
agonizing to her injured parent, she had eloped with
him. But as soon as ever she beheld him he regained
his wonted influence over her heart and her self-
reproaches became less poignant : she became sensible
that Sir Patrick's guilt and her mother's imprudent
marriage were the causes of her own fault, and not
Glenmurray; and could she but receive a letter of pardon
from England, she felt that her conscience would again
be at peace.
But soon an idea of a still more harrassing nature suc-
ceeded and overwhelmed her. Perhaps her desertion
had injured her mother's health ; perhaps she was too ill
to write ; perhaps she was dead :-and when this hor-
rible supposition took possession of her mind she used to
avoid even the presence of her lover; and as her spirits
commonly sunk towards evening, when the still renewed
expectations of the day had been deceived, she used to
hasten to a neighbouring church when the bell called to
vespers, and, prostrate on the steps of the altar, lift up
her soul to heaven in the silent breathings of penitence
and prayer. Having thus relieved her heart she returned
to Glenmurray, pensive but resigned.
One evening after she had unburthened her feelings
in this manner, Glenmurray prevailed on her to walk
with him to a public promenade ; and being tired they
sat down on a bench in a shady part of the mall. They
had not sat long before a gentleman and two ladies seated
themselves beside them.
Glenmurray instantly rose up to depart ; but the gen-
tleman also rose and exclaimed, “ 'Tis he indeed! Glen-
murray, have you forgotten your old friend Willie Douglas ?”'
Glenmurray, pleased to see a friend whom he had once
80 highly valued, returned the salutation with marked
cordiality; while the ladies with great kindness accosted
Adeline, and begged she would allow them the honour of
her acquaintance.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Taught by the rencontre at Lisbon, Adeline for a mo-
ment felt embarrassed; but there was something so truly
benevolent in the countenance of both ladies, and she
was so struck by the extreme beauty of the younger one,
that she had not resolution to avoid, or even to receive
their advances coldly; and while the gentlemen were
commenting on each other's looks, and in an instant
going over the occurrences of past years, the ladies,
pleased with each other, had entered into conversation.
“ But I expected to see you and your lady,” said
Major Douglas; “ for Maynard was writing to me from
Lisbon when he laid by his pen and took the walk in
which he met you; and on his return he filled up the
rest of his letter with the praises of Mrs. Glenmurray,
and expressions of envy at your happiness.”
Glenmurray and Adeline both blushed deeply. “ So!”
said Adeline to herself, “ here will be another letter to
write when we get home;" for, though ingenuousness
was one of her most striking qualities, she had not reso-
lution enough to tell her new acquaintance that she was
not married : besides, she flattered herself, that, could
she once interest these charming women in her favour,
they would not refuse her their society even when they
knew her real situation ; for she thought them too
amiable to be prejudiced, as she called it, and was not
yet aware how much the perfection of the female charac-
ter depends on respect even to what may be called the
prejudices of others.
The day began to close in; but Major Douglas, though
Glenmurray was too uneasy to answer him except by
monosyllables, would not hear of going home, and con-
tinued to talk with cheerfulness and interest of the
scenes of his and Glenmurray's early youth. He too was
ignorant of his friend's notoriety as an author: he had
lived chiefly at his estates in the Highlands ; nor would
he have left them, but because he was advised to travel
for his health : and the lovely creature whom he had

95
married, as well as his only sister, was anxious on his
account to put the advice in execution. He therefore
made no allusions to Glenmurray's opinions that could
give him an opportunity of explaining his real situation;
and he saw with confusion, that every moment increased
the intimacy of Adeline and the wife and sister of his
friend.
At length his feelings operated so powerfully on his
weak frame, that a sudden faintness seized him, and sup-
ported by Adeline and the major, and followed by his
two kind companions, he returned to the inn: there, to
get rid of the Douglases and avoid the inquiries of Ade-
line, who suspected the cause of his illness, he imme-
diately retired to bed.
His friends also returned home, lamenting the appa-
rently declining health of Glenmurray, and expatiating
with delight on the winning graces of his supposed wife;
for these ladies were of a different class of women to the
sisters of Maynard.—Mrs. Douglas was so confessedly a
beauty, so rich in acknowledged attractions, that she
could afford to do justice to the attractions of another :
and Miss Douglas was so decidedly devoid of all preten-
sions to the lovely in person, that the idea of competition
with the beautiful never entered her mind, and she was
always eager to admire what she knew that she was in-
capable of rivalling. Unexposed, therefore, to feel those
petty jealousies, those paltry competitions which injure
the character of women in general, Emma Douglas's
mind was the seat of benevolence and candour,—as was
her beautiful sister's from a different cause; and they
were both warmer even than the major in praise of
Adeline.
But a second letter from Mr. Maynard awaited Major
Douglas at the inn, which put a fatal stop to their self-
congratulations at having met Glenmurray and his com-
panion.
Mr. Maynard, full of Glenmurray's letter, and still

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
more deeply impressed than ever with the image of Ade-
line, could not forbear writing to the major on the sub-
ject; giving as a reason, that he wished to let him know
the true state of affairs, in order that he might avoid
Glenmurray. - The letter came too late.
“ And I have seen him, have welcomed him as a friend,
and he has had the impudence to introduce his harlot to
my wife and sister!”
So spoke the major in the language of passion,-and
passion is never accurate.—Glenmurray had not intro-
duced Adeline: and this was gently hinted by the kind
and candid Emma Douglas ; while the younger and more
inexperienced wife sat silent with consternation, at having
pressed with the utmost kindness the hand of a kept
mistress.
Vain were the representations of his sister to sooth
the wounded pride of Major Douglas. Without con-
sidering the difficulty of such a proceeding, he insisted
upon it that Glenmurray should have led Adeline away
instantly, as unworthy to breathe the same air with his
wife and sister.
“You find by that letter, brother,” said Miss Douglas,
o that this unhappy Adeline is still an object of respect
in his eyes, and he could not wound her feelings so
publicly, especially as she seems to be more ill-judging
than vicious.”
She spoke in vain.—The major was a soldier, and so
delicate in his ideas of the honour of women, that he
thought his wife and sister polluted from having, though
unconsciously, associated with Adeline; being violently
irritated therefore at the supposed insult offered him by
Glenmurray, he left the room, and, having dispatched a
challenge to him, told the ladies he had letters to write
to England till bed-time arrived: then, after having
settled his affairs in case he should fall in the conflict, he
sat brooding alone over the insolence of his former friend.
There was a consciousness too which aggravated his

97
resentment. Calumny had been busy with his reputa-
tion; and, though he deserved it not, had once branded
him with the name of coward. Besides, his elder sister
had been seduced by a man of very high rank, and was
then living with him as his mistress. Made still more
susceptible therefore of affront by this distressing con-
sciousness, he suspected that Glenmurray, from being
acquainted with these circumstances, had presumed on
them, and dared to take a liberty with him, situated as
he then was, which in former times he would not have
ventured to offer.
As Adeline and Glenmurray were both retired for the
night when the major's note arrived, it was not delivered
till morning, nor then, luckily, till Adeline, supposing
Glenmurray asleep, was gone to take her usual walk to
the post-office : Glenmurray, little aware of its contents,
opened it, and read as follows:
“SIR,
“ For your conduct in introducing your mistress to
my wife and sister, I demand immediate satisfaction. As
you may possibly not have recovered your indisposition
of last night, and I wish to take no unfair advantages, I
do not desire you to meet me till evening ; but at six
o'clock, a mile out of the north side of the town, I shall
expect you.-I can lend you pistols if you have none.”
“ There is only one step to be taken,” said Glenmur-
ray mentally, starting up and dressing himself : and in a
few moments he was at Major Douglas's lodgings.
· The major had just finished dressing, when Glenmurray
was announced. He started and turned pale at seeing
him; then, dismissing his servant and taking up his hat
and his pistols, he desired Glenmurray to walk out with
him.
“ With all my heart,” replied Glenmurray. But
recollecting himself, “ No no,” said he : "I come hither
н

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
now, merely to talk to you ; and if, after what has passed,
the ladies should see us go out together, they would be
but too sure of what was going to happen, and might
follow us.”
“ Well, then sir," cried the major, “ we had better
separate till evening."
*" I shall not leave you, Major Douglas,” replied Glen-
murray solemnly, “whatever harsh things you may say
or do, till I have made you listen to me.”
“ How can I listen to you, when nothing you can say
can be a justification of your conduct ?”
“I do not mean to offer any.--I am only come to tell
you my story, with that of my companion, and my reso-
lutions in consequence of my situation; and I conjure
you, by the recollections of our early days, of our past
pleasures and fatigues, those days when fatigue itself was
a pleasure, and I was not the weak emaciated being that
I am now, unable to bear exertion, and overcome even
to female weakness by agitation of mind such as I ex-
perienced last night-
“ For God's sake sit down,” cried the major, glancing
his eye over the faded form of Glenmurray.—Glenmurray
sat down.
“I say, I conjure you by these recollections,” he con-
tinued, " to hear me with candour and patience. Weak-
ness will render me brief.” Here he paused to wipe the
damps from his forehead; and Douglas, in a voice of
emotion, desired him to say whatever he chose, but to
say it directly.
" I will,” replied Glenmurray; “ for indeed there is
one at home who will be alarmed at my absence.”
The major frowned; and, biting his lip, said, “ Pro-.
ceed, Mr. Glenmurray,” in his usual tone.
Glenmurray obeyed. He related his commencing au-
thor,—the nature of his works,—his acquaintance with
Adeline,-its consequences,-her mother's marriage, -
Sir Patrick's villany,—Adeline's elopement, her refusal

99
to marry him, and the grounds on which it was founded.
s And now,” cried Glenmurray when his narration was
ended, “hear my firm resolve. Let the consequences
to my reputation be what they may, let your insults be
what they may, I will not accept your challenge; I will
not expose Adeline to the risk of being left without a
protector in a foreign land, and probably without one in
her own. I fear that, in the natural course of things, I
shall not continue with her long; but while I can watch
over and contribute to her happiness, no dread of shame,
no fear for what others may think of me, no selfish con-
sideration whatever shall induce me to hazard a life
which belongs to her, and on which at present her hap-
piness depends. I think, Douglas, you are incapable of
treating me with indignity; but even to that I will pa-
tiently submit, rather than expose my life; while con-
soled by my motive, I will triumphantly exclaim- See,
Adeline, what I can endure for thy sake !'”
Here he paused; and the major, interested and affected,
had involuntarily put out his hand to him ; but, drawing
it back, he said, “ Then I may be sure that you meant
no affront to me by suffering my wife and sister to con-
verse with Miss Mowbray ?”
Glenmurray having put an end to these suspicions
entirely, by a candid avowal of his feelings, and of his
wish to have escaped directly if possible, the major shook
him affectionately by the hand, and told him that though
he firmly believed too much learning had made him mad,
yet, that he was as much his friend as ever. “ But
what vexes me is,” said he, “ that you should have
turned the head of that sweet girl. The opinion of the
world is every thing to a woman.”
“ Aye, it is indeed,” replied Glenmurray; “ and,
spite of ridicule, I would marry Adeline directly, as I
said before, to guaranty her against reproach, -I wish
you would try to persuade her to be mine legally.”
“ That I will,” eagerly replied the major ; “ I am

sure I shall prevail with her. I am sure I shall soon
convince her that the opinions she holds are nothing but
nonsense.”
“ You will find,” replied Glenmurray, blushing,
“ that her arguments are unanswerable notwithstanding.
“ What, though taken from the cursed books you
mentioned ?”
* You forget that I wrote these books."
“ So I did ; and I wish she could forget it also : and
then they would appear to her, as they must do no
doubt to all people of common sense, and that is, abomi-
nable stuff.”
Glenmurray bit his lips--but the author did not long
absorb the lover, and he urged the major to return with
him to his lodgings.
« Aye, that I will,” cried he : “and what is more,
my sister Emma, who writes admirably, shall write her
a letter to convince her that she had better be married
directly.”
“ She had better 'converse with her,” said Glenmurray.
The major looked grave, and observed that they would
do well to go and consult the women on the subject,
and tell them the whole story. So saying, he opened
the door of a closet leading to their apartment: but
there, to their great surprise, they found Mrs. Douglas
and Emma, and as well informed of everything as them-
selves ;-for, expecting that a duel might be the conse-
quence of the major's impetuosity, and hearing Mr. Glen-
murray announced, they resolved to listen to the con-
versation, and, if it took the turn which they expected,
to rush in and endeavour to mollify the disputants.
“ So, ladies; this is very pretty indeed! Eaves-drop-
pers, I protest,” cried Major Douglas : but he said no
more; for his wife, affected by the recital which she had
heard, and delighted to find that there would be no duel,
threw her arms round his neck, and burst into tears.
Emma, almost equally affected, gave her hand to Glen-

murray, and told him nothing on her part should be
omitted to prevail on Adeline to sacrifice her opinions to
her welfare.
“ I said so,” cried the major. “ You will write to her.”
“No; I will see her, and argue with her.”
“ And so will I,” cried the wife.
“ That you shall not,” bluntly replied the major.
“ Why not? I think it my duty to do all I can to save
a fellow-creature from ruin; and words spoken from the
heart are always more powerful than words written.”
“ But what will the world say, if I permit you to con-
verse with a kept mistress ?”.
“ The world here to us, as we associate with none and
are known to none, is Mr. Glenmurray and Miss Mow-
bray; and of their good word we are sure.”
"Aye,” cried Emma, “and sure of succeeding with
this interesting Adeline too; for if she likes us, as I
think she does —
“ She adores you,” replied Glenmurray.
“ So much the better :—then, when we shall tell her
that we cannot associate with her, much as we admire
her, unless she consents to become a wife, surely she
will hear reason.”
“No doubt," cried Mrs. Douglas ; " and then we
will go to church with her, and you, Emma, shall be
bride's maid.”
“I see no necessity for that," observed the major
gravely.
“ But I do,” replied Emma. “ She will repeat her
vows with more heartfelt reverence, when two respectable
women, deeply impressed themselves with their import-
ance, shall be there to witness them.”
“But there is no Protestant church here," exclaimed
Glenmurray: “ however, we can go back to Lisbon, and
you are already resolved to return thither."
This point being settled, it was agreed that Glenmurray
should prepare Adeline for their visit; and with a

lightened heart he went to execute his commission. But
when he saw Adeline he forgot his commission and every
thing but her distress ; for he found her with an open
letter in her hand, and an unopened one on the floor,
in a state of mind almost bordering on phrensy.
CHAPTER XIV.
As soon as Adeline beheld Glenmurray, “ See !” she
exclaimed in a hoarse and agitated tone, “ there is my
letter to my mother, returned unopened, and here is a
letter from Dr. Norberry which has broken my heart :-
however, we must go to England directly."
The letter was as follows:
“ You have made a pretty fool of me, deluded but still
dear girl ! for you have made me believe in forebodings.
You may remember with what a full heart I bade you adieu,
and I recollect what a devilish queer sensation I had
when the park-gates closed on your fleet carriage. I
almost swore at the postillions for driving so fast, as I
wished to see you as long as I could ; and now I protest
that I believe I was actuated by a foreboding that at that
house, and on that spot, I should never behold you again.
(Here a tear had fallen on the paper, and the word, 'again'
was nearly blotted out.) Dear, lost Adeline, I prayed
for you too! I prayed that you might return as innocent
and happy as you left me. Heaven have mercy on us!
who should have thought it?-But this is nothing to the
purpose, and I suppose you think you have done nought
but what is right and clever.”
He then proceeded to inform Adeline, who had written
to him to implore his mediation between her and her
mother, “ that the latter had sent express for him on
finding, by the hasty scrawl which came the day after
Adeline's departure from the farm-house, that she had
eloped, and who was the companion of her flight; that

103
he found her in violent agitation, as Sir Patrick, stung
to madness at the success of his rival, had with' an in-
genuousness worthy a better cause avowed to her his
ardent passion for her daughter, his resolution to follow
the fugitives, and by every means possible separate Ade-
line from her lover; and that, after having thanked Lady
O'Carrol for her great generosity to him, he had taken
his pistols, mounted his horse, attended by his groom
also well armed, and vowed that he would never return
unless accompanied by the woman whom he adored.”
“ No wonder therefore,” continued the doctor, “that
I was an unsuccessful advocate for you,-especially as I
was not inclined to manage the old bride's self-love ; for
I was so provoked at her folly in marrying the handsome
profligate, that, if she had not been in distress, I never
meant to see her again. But, poor silly soul! she suffers
enough for her folly, and so do you ;-for, her affections
and her self-love being equally wounded by Sir Patrick's
confession, you are at present the object of her aversion.
To you she attributes all the misery of having lost the
man on whom she still dotes; and when she found from
your last letter to me that you are not the wife but the
mistress of Glenmurray, (by the bye, your letter to her
from Lisbon she desires me to return unopened,) and
that the child once her pride is become her disgrace, she
declared her solemn resolution never to see you more,
and to renounce you for ever—(Terrible words, Adeline,
I tremble to write them.) But a circumstance has since
occurred which gives me hopes that she may yet forgive,
and receive you on certain conditions. About a fortnight
after Sir Patrick's departure, a letter from Ireland,
directed to him in a woman's hand, arrived at the Pa-
vilion. Your mother opened it, and found it was from
a wife of her amiable husband, whom he had left in the
north of Ireland, and who, having heard of his second
marriage, wrote to tell him that, unless he came quickly
back to her, she would prosecute him for bigamy, as he

knew very well that undoubted proofs of the marriage
were in her possession. At first this new proof of her
beautiful spouse's villany drove your mother almost to
phrensy, and I was again sent for ; but time, reflection,
and perhaps my arguments, convinced her, that to be
able to free herself from this rascal for ever, and conse-
quently her fortune, losing only the ten thousand pounds
which she had given him to pay his debts, was in reality
a consoling circumstance. Accordingly, she wrote to
the real Lady O'Carrol, promising to accede quietly to
her claim, and wishing that she would spare her and
herself the disgrace of a public trial ; especially as it
must end in the conviction of Sir Patrick. She then,
on hearing from him that he had traced you to Falmouth,
and was going to embark for Lisbon when the wind was
favourable, enclosed him a copy of his wife's letter, and
bade him an eternal farewell —But be not alarmed lest
this insane profligate should overtake and distress you.
He is gone to his final account. In his hurry to get on
board, overcome as he was with the great quantity of
liquor which he had drunk to banish care, he sprung
from the boat before it was near enough to reach the
vessel ; his foot slipped against the side, he fell into the
water, and, going under the ship, never rose again.
I leave you to imagine how the complicated distresses of
the last three months, and this awful climax to them,
have affected your mother's mind ; even I cannot scold
her, now, for the life of me: she is not yet, I believe,
disposed in your favour; but were you here, and were
you to meet, it is possible that, forlorn, lonely, and de-
serted as she now feels, the tie between you might be
once more cemented; and much as I resent your conduct,
you may depend on my exertions.-0 Adeline, child of
my affection, why must I blush to subscribe myself
“ Your sincere friend,

Words cannot describe the feelings of anguish which
this letterexcited in Adeline: nor could she make known her
sensations otherwise than by reiterated requests to be al-
lowed to set off for England directly,—requests to which
Glenmurray, alarmed for her intellects, immediately as-
sented. Therefore, leaving a hasty note for the Douglases,
they soon bade farewell to Perpignan ; and after a long labo-
rious journey, but ashort passage, they landed at Brighton.
It was a fine evening; and numbers of the gay and
fashionable of both sexes were assembled on the beach,
to see the passengers land. Adeline and Glenmurray
were amongst the first : and while heart-sick, fatigued,
and melancholy, Adeline took the arm of her lover, and
turned disgusted from the brilliant groups before her,
she saw, walking along the shore, Dr. Norberry, his wife,
and his two daughters.
Instantly, unmindful of every thing but the delight of
seeing old acquaintances, and of being able to gain some
immediate tidings of her mother, she ran up to them :
and just as they turned round, she met them, extending
her hand in friendship as she was wont to do. But in
vain ;-no hand was stretched out to meet hers, nor
tongue nor look proclaimed a welcome to her ; Dr. Nor-
berry himself coldly touched his hat, and passed on,
while his wife and daughters looked scornfully at her,
and, without deigning to notice her, pursued their walk.
Astonished and confounded, Adeline had not power
to articulate a word; and had not Glenmurray caught
her in his arms, she would have fallen to the ground.
“ Then now I am indeed an outcast! even my oldest
and best friend renounces me,” she exclaimed.
But I am left to you,” cried Glenmurray.
Adeline sighed. She could not say, as she had for-
merly done, " and you are all to me.” The image of
her mother, happy as the wife of a man she loved, could
not long rival Glenmurray; but the image of her mother,
disgraced and wretched, awoke all the habitual but dor-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
mant tenderness of years ; every feeling of filial gratitude
revived in all its force; and, even while leaning on the
shoulder of her lover, she sighed to be once more clasped
to the bosom of her mother,
Glenmurray felt the change, but, though grieved, was
not offended :-" I shall die in peace," he cried, “ if I
can but see you restored to your mother's affection, even
though the surrender of my happiness is to be the
purchase.”
" You shall die in peace!” replied Adeline shuddering.
The phrase was well-timed, though perhaps undesignedly
80. Adeline clung close to his arm, her eyes filled with
tears, and all the way to the inn she thought only of
Glenmurray with an apprehension which she could not
conquer.
“What do you mean to do now?” said Glenmurray.
“ Write to Dr. Norberry. I think he will at least
have humanity enough to let me know where to find my
mother.”
“ No doubt; and you had better write directly.”
Adeline took up her pen. A letter was written,-and
as quickly torn. Letter succeeded to letter; but not
one of them answered her wishes. The dark hour
arrived, and the letter remained unwritten.
" It is too soon to ring for candles,” said Glenmurray,
putting his arm ronnd her waist and leading her to the
window. The sun was below the horizon, but the reflec-
tion of his beams still shone beautifully on the surround-
ing objects. Adeline, reclining her cheek on Glenmur-
ray's arm, gazed in silence on the scene before her: when
the door suddenly opened, and a gentleman was an-
nounced. It was now so dark that all objects were
indistinctly seen, and the gentleman had advanced close
to Adeline before she knew him to be Dr. Norberry: and
before she could decide how she should receive him, she
felt herself clasped to his bosom with the affection of a
father.

Surprised and affected, she could not speak ; and
Glenmurray had ordered candles before Adeline had re-
covered herself sufficiently to say these words, “ After
your conduct on the beach, I little expected this visit.”
“ Pshaw!” replied the doctor : “ when a man out of
regard to society has performed a painful task, surely he
may be allowed, out of regard to himself, to follow the
dictates of his heart.-I obeyed my head when I passed
you so cavalierly, and I thought I should never have
gone through my task as I did ;-but then for the sake
of my daughters, I gave a gulp, and called up a fierce
look. But I told madam that I meant to call on you,
and she insisted, very properly, that it should be in the
dark hour.”
• But what of my mother?”
“ She is a miserable woman, as she deserves to be-
an old fool.”
« Pray do not call her so; to hear she is miserable is
torment sufficient to me :-where is she?”
“ Still at the Pavilion : but she is going to let Rose-
valley, retire to her estate in Cumberland, and live un-
known and unseen.”
« But will she not allow me to live with her ?”
" What! as Mr. Glenmurray's mistress ? receive under
her roof the seducer of her daughter ?”
“ Sir, I am no seducer.”
“No," cried Adeline : “ I became the mistress of Mr.
Glenmurray from the dictates of my reason, not my
weakness or his persuasions.”
“ Humph!” replied the doctor, “ I should expect to
find such reason in Moorfields : besides, had not Mr.
Glenmurray's books turned your head, you would not
have thought it pretty and right to become the mistress
of any man : so he is your seducer, after all.”
“ So far I plead guilty,” replied Glenmurray; " but
whatever my opinions are, I have ever been willing to
sacrifice them to the welfare of Miss Mowbray, and

have, from the first moment that we were safe from pur-
suit, been urgent to marry her.”
« Then why are you not married ?”
“ Because I would not consent,” said Adeline coldly.
“ Mad, certainly mad,” exclaimed the doctor : “ but
you, 'faith, you are an honest fellow after all,” turning
to Glenmurray and shaking him by the hand; “ weak
of the head, not bad in the heart; burn your vile books,
and I am your friend for ever.”
“ We will discuss that point another time," replied
Glenmurray : “ at present the most interesting subject
to us is the question whether Mrs. Mowbray will forgive
her daughter or not?”
“Why, man, if I may judge of Mrs. Mowbray by
myself, one condition of her forgiveness will be your
marrying her daughter."
“O blest condition !” cried Glenmurray.
“I should think,” replied Adeline coldly, “my
mother must have had too much of marriage to wish
me to marry; but if she should insist on my marrying,
I will comply, and on no other account.”
“Strange infatuation! To me it appears only justice
and duty. But your reasons, girl, your reasons ?”
“ They are few, but strong. Glenmurray, philan-
thropically bent on improving the state of society, puts
forth opinions counteracting its received usages, backed
by arguments which are in my opinion incontrovertible.”
“ In your opinion !—Pray, child, how old are you?”!
“ Nineteen.”
“ And at that age you set up for a reformer? Well,—
go on."
“But though it be important to the success of his
opinions, and indeed to the respectability of his character,
that he should act according to his precepts, he, for the
sake of preserving to me the notice of persons whose
narrowness of mind I despise, would conform to an insti-
tution which both he and I think unworthy of regard

from a rational being.–And shall not I be as generous
as he is ? shall I scruple to give up for his honour and
fame the petty advantages which marriage would give
me? Never-his honour and fame are too dear to me;
but the claims which my mother has on me are in my
eyes so sacred that, for her sake, though not for my own,
I would accept the sacrifice which Glenmurray offers.
If, then, she says that she will never see or pardon me
till I am become a wife, I will follow him to the altar
directly ; but till then I must insist on remaining as I
am. It is necessary that I should respect the man I
love ; and I should not respect Glenmurray were he not
capable of supporting with fortitude the consequences of
his opinions; and could he, for motives less strong than
those he avows, cease to act up to what he believes to be
right. For, never can I respect or believe firmly in the
truth of those doctrines, the followers of which shrink
from a sort of martyrdom in support of them.
“O Mr. Glenmurray!” cried the doctor shaking his
head, “ what have you to answer for! What a glorious
champion would that creature have been in the support
of truth, when even error in her looks so like to virtue !
-And then the amiable disinterestedness of you both!
What a powerful thing must true love be, when it can
make a speculative philosopher indifferent to the interests
of his system, and ready to act in direct opposition to it,
rather than injure the respectability of the woman he
loves! Well, well, the Lord forgive you, young man, for
having taken it into your head to set up for a great author!”
Glenmurray answered by a deep-drawn sigh; and the
doctor continued : “ Then there is that girl again, with
a heart so fond and true that her love comes in aid of her
integrity, and makes her think no sacrifice too great, in
order to prove her confidence in the wisdom of her lover,
-urging her to disregard all personal inconveniences
rather than let him forfeit, for her sake, his pretensions
to independence and consistency of character! girl, I

can't help admiring you, but no more I could a Malabar
widow, who with fond and pious enthusiasm, from an
idea of duty, throws herself on the funeral pile of her
husband. But still I should think you a great fool, not-
withstanding, for professing the opinions that led to such
an exertion of duty. And now here are you, possessed
of every quality both of head and heart to bless others
and to bless yourself-owing to your foolish and perni-
cious opinions ;-here you are, I say blasted in reputation
in the prime of your days, and doomed perhaps to pine
through existence in- Pshaw! I can't support the
idea!” added he, gulping down a sob as he spoke, and
traversing the room in great emotion.
Adeline and Glenmurray were both of them deeply
and painfully affected; and the latter was going to express
what he felt, when the doctor, seizing Adeline's hand,
affectionately exclaimed, “ Well, my poor child! I will
see your mother once more; I will go to London to-
morrow-by this time she is there-and you had better
follow me; you will hear of me at the Old Hummums;
and here is a card of address to an hotel near it, where
I would advise you to take up your abode.”
So saying he shook Glenmurray by the hand; when,
starting back, he exclaimed “Why, man! here is a skin
like fire, and a pulse like lightning. My dear fellow,
you must take care of yourself.”
Adeline burst into tears.
“ Indeed, doctor, I am only nervous.”
“ Nervous !—What, I suppose you think you under-
stand my profession better than I do. But don't cry,
my child : when your mind is easier, perhaps, he will do
very well ; and, as one thing likely to give him imme-
diate ease, I prescribe a visit to the altar of the next
parish church."
· So saying he departed ; and all other considerations
were again swallowed up in Adeline's mind by the idea
of Glenmurray's danger.

“ Is it possible that my marrying you would have such
a blessed effect on your health ?” cried Adeline after a
pause.
“ It certainly would make my mind easier than it
now is,” replied he.
“ If I thought so,” said Adeline : “ but no-regard
for my supposed interest merely makes you say so; and
indeed I should not think so well of you as I now do, if
I imagined that you could be made easy by an action by
which you forfeited all pretensions to that consistency
of character so requisite to the true dignity of a philo-
sopher.”
A deep sigh from Glenmurray, in answer, proved that
he was no philosopher.
In the morning the lovers set off for London, Dr.
Norberry having preceded them by a few hours. This
blunt but benevolent man had returned the evening
before slowly and pensively to his lodgings, his heart
full of pity for the errors of the well-meaning enthusiasts
whom he had left, and his head full of plans for their
assistance, or rather for that of Adeline. But he entered
his own doors again reluctantly—he knew but too well
that no sympathy with his feelings awaited him there.
His wife, a woman of narrow capacity and no talents or
accomplishments, had, like all women of that sort, a
great aversion to those of her sex who united to feminine
graces and gentleness, the charms of a cultivated under-
standing and pretensions to accomplishments or literature.
Of Mrs. Mowbray, as we have before observed, she
had always been peculiarly jealous, because Dr. Norberry
spoke of her knowledge with wonder, and of her under-
standing with admiration; not that he entertained one
moment a feeling of preference towards her, inconsistent
with an almost idolatrous love of his wife, whose skill in
all the domestic duties, and whose very pretty face and
person, were the daily themes of his praise. But Mrs.
Norberry wished to engross all his panegyrics to herself,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
and she never failed to expatiate on Mrs. Mowbray's
foibles and flightiness as long as the doctor had expatiated
on her charms.
Sometimes, indeed, this last subject was sooner ex-
hausted than the one which she had chosen ; but when
Adeline grew up, and became as it were the rival of her
daughters in the praises of her husband, she found it
difficult, as we have said before, to bring faults in array
against excellencies.
Mrs. Norberry could with propriety observe, when the
doctor, was exclaiming, “ What a charming essay Mrs.
Mowbray has just written !”
“ Aye,—but I dare say she can't write a market bill.”
When he said, “ How well she comprehends the com-
ponents parts of the animal system !”
She could with great justice reply, “ But she knows
nothing of the component parts of a plum pudding.”
But when Adeline became the object of the husband's
admiration and the wife's enmity, Mrs. Norberry could
not make these pertinent remarks, as Adeline was as
conversant with all branches of housewifery as herself ;
and, though as learned in all systems as her mother, was
equally learned in the component parts of puddings and
pies. She was therefore at a loss what to say when Ade-
line was praised by the doctor; and all she could observe
on the occasion was, that the girl might be clever, but
was certainly very ugly, very affected, and very conceited.
It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that Mrs. Mow-
bray's degrading and unhappy marriage, and Adeline's
elopement, should have been sources of triumph to Mrs.
Norberry and her daughters; who, though they liked
Mrs. Mowbray very well, could not bear Adeline.
“ So Dr. Norberry, these are your uncommon folks!”
-exclaimed Mrs. Norberry on hearing of the marriage
and of the subsequent elopement ;-I suppose you are
now well satisfied at not having a genius for your wife,
or geniuses for your daughters ?”

“ I always was, my dcar," meekly replied the morti-
fied and afflicted doctor, and dropped the subject as soon
as possible; nor had it been resumed for some time when
Adeline accosted them on the beach at Brighton. But
her appearance called forth their dormant enmity; and
the whole way to their lodgings the good doctor heard
her guilt expatiated upon with as much violence as ever :
but just as they got home he coldly and firmly observed,
“I shall certainly call on the poor deluded girl this
evening.”
And Mrs. Norberry, knowing by the tone and manner
in which he spoke, that this was a point which he would
not give up, contented herself with requiring only that
he should go in the dark hour.
CHAPTER XV.
It was to a wife and daughters such as these that he was
returning, with the benevolent wish of interesting them
for the guilty Adeline.
So, Dr. Norberry, you are come back at last!” was
his first salutation, “ and what does the creature say for
herself?”
“ The creature!” –Your fellow-creature, my dear, says
very little-grief is not wordy.”
« Grief !-So then she is unhappy, is she ?” cries Miss
Norberry; “ I am monstrous glad of it.”
The doctor started ; and an oath nearly escaped his
lips. He did say, “Why, zounds, Jane !”—but then he
added, in a softer tone, Why do you rejoice in the poor
girl's affliction?”
“ Because I think it is for the good of her soul.”
“ Good girl!” replied the father :~" Jane, (seizing
her hand,) may your soul never need such a medicine!”

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ It never will,” said her mother proudly : “ she has
been differently brought up.”
“ She has been well brought up, you might have
added,” observed the doctor, “ had modesty permitted
it. Mrs. Mowbray, poor woman, had good intentions ;
but she was too flighty. Had Adeline, my children, had
such a mother as yours, she would have been like you."
“But not half so handsome,” interrupted the mother
in a low voice.
“But as our faults and our virtues, my dear, depend
iso much on the care and instruction of others, we should
look with pity, as well as aversion on the faults of those
less fortunate in instructors than we have been.”
“Certainly ;-very true,” said Mrs. Norberry, flattered
and affected by this compliment from her husband : “but
you know, James Norberry,” laying her hand on his, “I
always told you you overrated Mrs. Mowbray; and that
she was but a dawdle after all.”
“You always did, my good woman,” replied he, raising
her hand to his lips.
“But you men think yourselves much wiser than we are!"
“ We do so," replied the doctor.
The tone was equivocal—Mrs. Norberry felt it to be
so, and looked up in his face. The doctor understood
the look : it was one of doubt and inquiry; and, as it
was his intercst to sooth her in order to carry his point,
he exclaimed, “We men are, indeed, too apt to pride
ourselves in our supposed superior wisdom : but I, you
will own, my dear, have always done your sex, justice;
and you in particular."
“ You have been a good husband indeed, James Nor-
herry," replied his wife in a faltering voice ; and I believe
you to be, to every one, a just and honourable man.”
" And I dare say, dame, I do no more than justice to
you, when I think you will approve and further a plan
for Adeline Mowbray's good, which I am going to pro-
pose to you.”

Mrs. Norberry withdrew her hand; but returning it
again : " To be sure, my dear," she cried. “Any
thing you wish; that is, if I see right to
“ I will explain myself,” continued the doctor gently.
“ I have promised this poor girl to endeavour to bring
about a reconciliation between her and her mother : but
though Adeline wishes to receive her pardon on any
terms, and even, if it be required, to renounce her lover,
I fear Mrs. Mowbray is too much incensed against her,
to see or forgive her.”
“ Hard-hearted woman!” cried Mrs. Norberry.
Cruel, indeed!” cried her daughters.
“ But a mother ought to be severe, very severe, on
such occasions, young ladies," hastily added Mrs. Nor-
berry : “ but go on, my dear.”
“Now it is but too probable,” continued the doctor,
“ that Glenmurray will not live long, and then this young
creature will be left to struggle unprotected with the dif-
ficulties of her situation ; and who knows but that she
may, from poverty, and the want of a protector, be
tempted to continue in the paths of vice ?"
“Well, Dr. Norberry, and what then?—Who or what
is to prevent it?-You know we have three children to
provide for; and I am a young woman as yet.”
“ True, Hannah,” giving her a kiss, “and a very
pretty woman too.”
“ Well, my dear love, anything we can do with pru-
dence I am ready to do; I can say no more.”
“ You have said enough,” cried the doctor exultingly;
“ then hear my plan : Adeline shall, in the event of
Glenmurray's death, which though not certain seems
likely to be sure, I did not inquire into the nature of
his nocturnal perspirations, his expectoration, and so
forth "
“ Dear papa, you are so professional!” affectedly ex-
claimed his youngest daughter.
“ Well, child, I have done ; and to return to my sub-

ject—if Glenmurray lives or dies, I think it advisable
that Adeline should go into retirement to lie-in. And
where can she be better than in my little cottage now
empty, within a four-miles ride of our house? If she
wants protection, I can protect her; and if she wants
money before her mother forgives her, you can give it to
her.”
“ Indeed, papa,” cried both the girls, “ we shall not
grudge it.”
The doctor started from his chair, and embraced his
daughters with joy mixed with wonder; for he knew
they had always disliked Adeline.--True; but then, she
was prosperous, and their superior. Little minds love
to bestow protection; and it was easy to be generous to
the fallen Adeline Mowbray: had her happiness conti-
nued, so would their hatred.
“ Then it is a settled point, is it not dame?” asked
the doctor, chucking his wife under the chin; when, to
his great surprise and consternation, she threw his hand
indignantly from her, and vociferated, “ She shall never
live within a ride of our house, I can assure you, Dr.
Norberry.”
The doctor was petrified into silence, and the girls
could only articulate “ La! mamma?” But what could
produce this sudden and violent change? Nothing but
a simple and natural operation of the human mind,
Though a very kind husband, and an indulgent father,
Dr. Norberry was suspected, though unjustly, of being a
very gallant man: and some of Mrs. Norberry's good-
natured friends had occasionally hinted to her their sorrow
at hearing such and such reports; reports which were
indeed destitute of foundation; but which served to
excite suspicions in the mind of the tenacious Mrs.
Norberry. And what more likely to re-awaken them than
the young and frail Adeline Mowbray living in a cottage
of her husband's, protected, supported, and visited by
him! The moment this idea occurred, its influence was

unconquerable; and with a voice and manner of deter-
mined hostility she made known her resolves in conse:
quence of it.
After a pause of dismay and astonishment, the doctor
cried, “ Dame, what have you gotten in your head ?
What, all on a sudden, has had such an ugly effect on
you?”
“ Second thoughts are best, doctor; and I now feel
that it would be highly improper for you, with daughters
grown up, to receive with such marked kindness a single
young woman at a cottage of yours, who is going to
lie-in.”
“ But, my dear, it is a different case, when I do it to
keep her out of the way of further harm.”
6. That is more than I know, Dr. Norberry,” replied
the wife bridling, and fanning herself.
“ Whew!” whistled the doctor; and then addressing
his daughters, “ Girls, you had better go to bed; it
grows late.”
The young ladies obeyed; but first hung round their
mother's neck, as they bade her good night, and hoped
she would not be so cruel to the poor deluded Adeline. ·
Mrs. Norberry angrily shook them off, with a peevish
--" Get along, girls." The doctor cordially kissed,
and bade God bless them; while the door closed and left
the loving couple alone,
What passed, it were tedious to repeat: suffice that
after a long altercation, continued even after they were
retired to rest, the doctor found his wife, on this subject,
incapable of listening to reason, and that, as a finishing
stroke, she exclaimed, “ It does not signify talking,
Dr. Norberry, while I have my senses, and can see into
a mill-stone a little, the hussey shall never come near us."
The doctor sighed deeply; turned himself round, not
to sleep but to think, and rose the next morning to go
in search of Mrs. Mowbray, dreading the interview
which he was afterwards to have with Adeline; for he

did not expect to succeed in his application to her mother,
and he could not now soften his intelligence with a 'but,'
as he intended. “True,” he meant to have said to her,
“your mother will not receive you ; but if you ever want
a home or a place of retirement, I have a cottage, and so
forth."
“ Pshaw!” cried the doctor to himself, as these
thoughts came across him on the road, and made him
hastily let down the front window of the post-chaise for
air.
“ Did your honour speak ?” cries the post-boy.
« Not Í. But can't you drive faster and be hanged to
you?”
The boy whipped his horses.—The doctor then found
that it was up hill-down went the glass again :-Hold,
you brute, why do you not see it is up hill ?” For find
fault he must; and with his wife he could not, or dared
not, even in fancy.
“ Dear me! Why, your honour bade me put it on.”
“ Devilishly obedient,” muttered the doctor : I wish
every one was like you in that respect.”—And in a state
of mind not the pleasantest possible the doctor drove
into town, and to the hotel where Mrs. Mowbray was to
be found.
Dr. Norberry was certainly now not in a humour
to sooth any woman whom he thought in the wrong,
except his wife; and, whether from carelessness or design,
he did not, unfortunately for Adeline, manage the self-
love of her unhappy mother.
He found Mrs. Mowbray with her heart shut op, not
softened by sorrow. The hands once stretched forth
with kindness to welcome him, were now stiffly lạid one
upon the other; and “ How are you, sir ?” coldly arti-
culated, was followed by as cold a “ Pray sit down.”
“ Why, how ill you look !” exclaimed the doctor.
“ I attend more to my feelings than my looks," with
a deep sigh, answered Mrs. Mowbray.

“ Your feelings are as bad as your looks, I dare say.”
“ They are worse, sir," said Mrs. Mowbray, piqued.
“ There was no need of that,” replied the doctor :
“ but I am come to point out to you one way of getting
rid of some of your unpleasant feelings :-see, and for-
give your daughter."
Mrs. Mowbray started, changed colour, and exclaimed
with quickness, “ Is she in England ?” but added in-
stantly, “ I have no daughter :-she, who was my child,
is my most inveterate foe; she has involved me in disgrace
and misery.”
« With a little of your own help she has,” replied
the doctor. « Come, come, my old friend, you have
both of you something to forget and forgive ; and the
sooner you set about it the better. Now do write, and
tell Adeline, who is by this time in London, that you
forgive her.”
- Never :-after having promised me not to hold con-
verse with that villain without my consent? Had I no
other cause of complaint against her ;-—had she not by
her coquettish arts seduced the affections of the man I
loved :-never, never would I forgive her having violated
the sacred promise which she gave me.”
“A promise,” interrupted the doctor, “ which she
would never have violated, had not you first violated
that sacred compact which you entered into at her birth.”
“What mean you, sir?”
“ I mean, that though a parent does not, at a child's
birth, solemnly make a vow to do all in his or her power
to promote the happiness of that child, --still, as he has
given it birth, he has tacitly bound himself to make it
happy. This tacit agreement you broke, when at the
age of forty, you, regardless of your daughter's welfare,
played the fool and married a pennyless profligate, merely
because he had a fine person and a handsome leg."
Mrs. Mowbray was too angry and too agitated to in-
terrupt him, and he went on :

“I beg, Dr. Norberry,” interrupted Mrs. Mowbray
in a faint voice, “ that you would spare the disgusting
recital.”
“ Well, well, I will. Now do consider the dilemma
your child was in: she must either elope, or by her
presence keep alive a criminal passion in her father-in-
law, which you sooner or later must discover; and be
besides exposed to fresh insults.—Well, Glenmurray by
chance happened to be on the spot just as she escaped
from that villanous fellow's clutches, and-_”.
“ He is dead, Dr. Norberry,” interrupted Mrs.
Mowbray; " and you know the old adage, • Do not
speak ilſ of the dead.'”
.." And a very silly adage it is. I had rather speak ill
of the dead than the living, for my part: but let me go
on.-Well, love taking the name and habit of prudence
and filial piety, (for she thought she consulted your
happiness, and not her own,) bade her fly to and with
her lover ; and now there she is, owing to the pretty
books which you let her read, living with him as his
mistress, and glorying in it, as if it was a notable praise-
worthy action.
" And you would have me forgive her?”
“ Certainly: a fault which both your precepts and
conduct occasioned. Not but what the girl has been
wrong, terribly wrong :-no one ought to do evil that
good may come. You had forbidden her to have any
intercourse with Glenmurray; and she therefore knew
that disobeying you would make you unhappy—that was
a certainty. That fellow's persevering in his attempts,
after the fine rebuff which she had given him, was an
uncertainty; and she ought to have run the risk of it,
and not committed a positive fault to avoid a possible

evil. But then hers was a fault which she could not
have committed had not you married that—but I forbear.
And as to her not being married to Glenmurray, that is
no fault of his ; and with your consent, he will marry
your daughter to-morrow morning. That ever so good,
cleanly-hearted a youth should have poked his nose into
the filthy mess of eccentric philosophy!”
“ Have you done, doctor?” cried Mrs. Mowbray
haughtily : “ have you said all that Miss Mowbray and
you have invented to insult me?”
“ Your child send me to insult you !-She !-Adeline !
- Why, the poor soul came broken-hearted and post
haste from France, when she heard of your misfortunes,
to offer her services to console you."
“ She console me?—she, the first occasion of them?
-But for her, I might still have indulged the charming
delusion, even if it were delusion, that love of me, not
of my wealth, induced the man I doted upon to commit
a crime to gain possession of me.”
“ Why!" hastily interrupted the doctor, “every one
saw that he loved her long before he married you."
The storm, long gathering, now burst forth ; and
rising, with the tears, high colour, and vehement voice
of unbridled passion, Mrs. Mowbray exclaimed, raising
her arm and clenching her fist as she spoke, “ And it is
being the object of that cruel preference, which I never,
never will forgive her!”
The doctor, after ejaculating “ Whew!” as much as
to say “ The murder is out,” instantly took his hat
and departed, convinced his labour was vain. “There,”
muttered he as he went down stairs, “ two instances in
one day! Ah, ah,—that jealousy is the devil.” He
then slowly walked to the hotel, where he expected to
find Adeline and Glenmurray.
They had arrived about two hours before ; and Adeline
in a frame of mind but ill fitted to bear the disappoint-
ment which awaited her. For, with the sanguine ex-

pectations natural to her age, she had been castle-build-
ing as usual ; and their journey to London had been ren-
dered a very short one, by the delightful plans, for the
future, which she had been forming and imparting to
Glenmurray.
“ When I consider,” said she, “ the love which my
mother has always shown for me, I cannot think it
possible that she can persist in renouncing me; and
however her respect for the prejudices of the world, a
world which she intended to live in at the time of her
unfortunate connexion, might make her angry at my
acting in defiance of its laws,—now that she herself,
from a sense of injury and disgrace, is about to retire
from it, she will no longer have a motive to act contrary
to the dictates of reason herself, or to wish me to do so.”
“ But your ideas of reason and hers may be so dif-
ferent-
“ No. Our practice may be different, but our theory
is the same, and I have no doubt but that my mother
will now forgive and receive us; and that, living in a
romantic solitude, being the whole world to each other,
our days will glide away in uninterrupted felicity.”
“ And how shall we employ ourselves ? said Glen-
murray smiling.
“ You shall continue to write for the instruction of
your fellow-creatures; while my mother and I shall be
employed in endeavouring to improve the situation of
the poor around us, and perhaps in educating our
children.”
Adeline, when animated by any prospect of happiness,
was irresistible: she was really Hope herself, as described
by Collins—
“ But thou, oh Hope, with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure !”
and Glenmurray, as he listened to her, forgot his
illness ; forgot every thing, but what Adeline chose

to imagine. The place of their retreat was fixed upon.
It was to be a little village near Falmouth, the scene
of their first happiness. The garden was laid out;
Mrs. Mowbray's library planned ; and so completely
were they lost in their charming prospects for the future,
that every turnpike-man had to wait a longer time than
he was accustomed to for his money; and the postillion
had driven into London in the way to the hotel, before
Adeline recollected that she was, for the first time, in a
city which she had long wished most ardently to see.
They had scarcely taken up their abode at the hotel
recommended to them by Dr. Norberry, when he knocked
at the door. Adeline from the window had seen him
coming; and sure as she thought herself to be of her
mother's forgiveness, she turned sick and faint when the
decisive moment was at hand; and, burrying out of the
room, she begged Glenmurray to receive the doctor, and
apologize for her absence.
Glenmurray awaited him with a beating heart. He
listened to his step on the stairs : it was slow and heavy;
unlike that of a benevolent man coming to communicate
good news. Glenmurray began immediately to tremble
for the peace of Adeline; and, hastily pouring out a
glass of wine, was on the point of drinking it when Dr.
Norberry entered.
“ Give me a glass,” cried he: “I want one, I am
sure, to recruit my spirits.” Glenmurray in silence
complied with his desire. “Come, I'll give you a toast,"
cried the doctor : “ Here is —
At this moment Adeline entered. She had heard the
doctor's last words, and she thought he was going to
drink to the reconciliation of her mother and herself ;
and hastily opening the door she came to receive the
good news which awaited her. But, at sight of her, the
toast died unfinished on her old friend's lips; he swal-
lowed down the wine in silence, and then taking her
hand led her to the sofa.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline's heart began to die within her; and before
the doctor, after having taken a pinch of snuff and blowed
his nose full three times, was prepared to speak, she
was convinced that she had nothing but unwelcome
intelligence to receive; and she awaited in trembling ex-
pectation an answer to a “ Well, sir," from Glenmurray,
spoken in a tone of fearful emotion.
“ No, it is not well, sir," replied the doctor.”
“ You have seen my mother?” said Adeline, catching
hold of the arm of the sofa for support: and in an
instant Glenmurray was by her side.
“ I have seen Mrs. Mowbray, but not your mother :
for I have seen a woman dead to every graceful impulse
of maternal affection, and alive only to a selfish sense of
rivalship and hatred. My poor child! God forgive the
deluded woman! But I declare she detests you!”
“ Detests me?” exclaimed Adeline.
“ Yes; she swears that she can never forgive the pre-
ference which that vile fellow gave you, and I am con-
vinced that she will keep her word ; and here the doctor,
turning round, saw Adeline lying immoveable in Glen-
murray's arms. But she did not long remain so, and
with a frantic scream kept repeating the words “ She
detests me!” till unable to contend any longer with the
acuteness of her feelings, she sunk, sobbing convulsively,
exhausted on the bed to which they carried her.
“My good friend, my only friend,” cried Glenmurray,
“ what is to be done? Will she scream again, think
you, in that most dreadful and unheard-of manner?
For, if she does, I must run out of the house."
“ What, then, she never treated you in this pretty way
before, heh?”
“ Never, never. Her self-command has always been
exemplary.”
“Indeed ?—Lucky fellow! My wife and daughters
often scream just as loud, on very trifling occasions :
but that scream went to my heart; for I well know how

-
to distinguish between the shriek of agony and that of
passion."
* When Adeline recovered, she ardently conjured Dr.
Norberry to procure her an interview with her mother;
contending that it was absolutely impossible to suppose,
that the sight of a child so long and tenderly loved
should not renew a little of her now dormant affection.
“ But you were her rival, as well as her child; remem-
ber that. However, you look so ill, that now, if ever,
she will forgive you, I think : therefore I will go back to
Mrs. Mowbray; and while I am there do you come, ask
for me, and follow the servant into the room.”
“I will,” replied Adeline : and leaning on the arm of
her lover, she slowly followed the doctor to her mother's
hotel.
CHAPTER XVI.
“ This is the most awful moment of my life,” said
Adeline.
“ And the most anxious one of mine," replied Glen-
murray. “ If Mrs. Mowbray forgives you, it will be
probably on condition that,
“ Whatever be the conditions, I must accept them,”
said Adeline.
« True," returned Glenmurray, wiping the cold dews
of weakness from his forehead : but no matter—at any
rate, I should not have been with you long.
Adeline, with a look of agony, pressed the arm she
held to her bosom.
Glenmurray's heart smote him immediately—he felt
he had been ungenerous; and, while the hectic of a
moment passed across his cheek, he added, “ But I do
not do myself justice in saying so. I believe my best
chance of recovery is the certainty of your being easy.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Let me but see you happy, and so disinterested is my
affection, as I have often told you, that I shall cheerfully
assent to any thing that may ensure your happiness.”
“ And can you think," answered Adeline, “ that my
happiness can be independent of yours? Do you not
see that I am only trying to prepare my mind for being
called upon to surrender my inclinations to my duty ?”
At this moment they found themselves at the door of
the hotel. Neither of them spoke; the moment of trial
was come; and both were unable to encounter it firmly.
At last Adeline grasped her lover's hand, bade him wait
for her at the end of the street, and with some degree
of firmness she entered the vestibule, and asked for
Dr. Norberry.
Dr. Norberry, meanwhile, with the best intentions
in the world, had but ill prepared Mrs. Mowbray's mind
for the intended visit. He had again talked to her of
her daughter; and urged the propriety of forgiving her;
but he had at the same time renewed his animadversions
on her own conduct.
“ You know not, Dr. Norberry," observed Mrs.
Mowbray, “the pains I took with the education of that
girl ; and I expected to be repaid for it by being styled
the happiest as well as best of mothers.”
“ And so you would, perhaps, had you not wished to
be a wife as well as mother.”
“ No more on that subject, sir,” haughtily returned
Mrs. Mowbray.-“ Yes,—Adeline was indeed my joy,
my pride."
“Aye, and pride will have a fall; and a pretty
tumble yours has had, to be sure, my old friend; and
it has broke its knees-never to be sound again.”
At this unpropitious moment “a lady to Dr. Norberry"
was announced, and Adeline tottered into the room.
“ What strange intrusion is this?” cried Mrs. Mow-
bray: who is this woman?”
Adeline threw back her veil, and falling on her knees,

stretched out her arms in an attitude of entreaty : speak
she could not, but her countenance was sufficiently ex-
pressive of her meaning; and her pale sunk cheek spoke
forcibly to the heart of her mother.–At this moment,
when a struggle which might have ended favourably for
Adeline was taking place in the mind of Mrs. Mowbray,
Dr. Norberry injudiciously exclaimed,
« There,—there she is! Look at her, poor soul! There
is little fear, I think, of her ever rivalling you again.”
At these words Mrs. Mowbray darted an angry look
at the doctor, and desired him to take away that woman;
who came, no doubt instigated by him, to insult her.
“ Take her away,” she cried, “and never let me see her
again.
“O my mother, hear me, in pity hear me!” exclaimed
Adeline.
“ As it is for the last time, I will hear you,” replied
Mrs. Mowbray; “ for never, no never will I behold you
more! Hear me vow
“ Mother, for mercy's sake, make not a vow so ter-
rible!” cried Adeline, gathering courage from despair,
and approaching her: “I have grievously erred, and will
cheerfully devote the rest of my life to endeavour, by the
most submissive obedience and attention, to atone for my
past guilt.”
“ Atone for it! Impossible ; for the misery which I
owe to you, no submission, no future conduct can make
me amends. Away! I say : your presence conjures up
recollections which distract me, and I solemnly swear—"
“ Hold, hold, if you have any mercy in your nature,”
cried Adeline almost frantic : “ this is, I feel but too
sensibly, the most awful and important moment of my
life : on the result of this interview depends my future
happiness or misery. Hear me, O my mother! You,
who can so easily resolve to tear the heart of a child that
adores you, hear me! reflect that, if you vow to abandon
me for ever, you blast all the happiness and prospects of

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
my life; and at nineteen 'tis hard to be deprived of hap-
piness for ever. True, I may not long survive the anguish
of being renounced by my mother, a mother whom I
love with even enthusiastic fondness; but then could you
ever know peace again with the conviction of having
caused my death? Oh! no. Save then yourself and me
from these miseries, by forgiving my past errors, and
deigning sometimes to see and converse with me!”
The eager and animated volubility with which Adeline
spoke made it impossible to interrupt her, even had Mrs.
Mowbray been inclined to do so : but she was not; nor,
when Adeline had done speaking, could she find in her
heart to break silence.
It was evident to Dr. Norberry that Mrs. Mowbray's
countenance expressed a degree of softness which augured
well for her daughter; and, as if conscious that it did
so, she covered her face suddenly with her handkerchief.
“ Now then is the time,” thought the doctor. “Go
nearer her, my child,” said he in a low voice to Adeline,
“ embrace her knees.”
Adeline rose, and approached Mrs. Mowbray; she
seized her hand, she pressed it to her lips. Mrs. Mow-
bray's bosom heaved violently: she almost returned the
pressure of Adeline's hand.
“ Victory, victory!” muttered the doctor to himself,
cutting a caper behind Mrs. Mowbray's chair.
Mrs. Mowbray took the handkerchief from her face.
“ My mother, my dear mother ! look on me, look on
me with kindness only one moment, and only say that
you do not hate me!”
Mrs. Mowbray turned round and fixed her eyes on
Adeline with a look of kindness, and Adeline's began to
sparkle with delight; when, as she threw back her cloak,
which, hanging over her arm, embarrassed her as she
knelt to embrace her mother's knees, Mrs. Mowbray's
eyes glanced from her face to her shape.
• In an instant the fierceness of her look returned :

pound
“ Shame to thy race, disgrace to thy family!” she ex-
claimed, spurning her kneeling child from her: “ and
canst thou, while conscious of carrying in thy bosom the
proof of thy infamy, dare to solicit and expect my pardon ?
-Hence! ere I load thee with maledictions."
Adeline wrapped her cloak round her, and sunk terri-
fied and desponding on the ground.
“ Why, what a ridiculous caprice is this !” cried the
doctor. “ Is it a greater crime to be in a family way,
than to live with a man as his mistress ?—You knew
your daughter had done the last : therefore it is nonsense
to be so affected at the former.-Come, come, forget and
forgive!”
“ Never : and if you do not leave the house with her
this moment, I will not stay in it. My injuries are so
great that they cannot admit forgiveness.”
• What a horrible, unforgiving spirit yours must be!”
cried Dr. Norberry : “and after all, I tell you again,
that Adeline has something to forgive and forget too ;
and she sets you an example of Christian charity in coming
hither to console and comfort you, poor forsaken woman
as you are!”
is Forsaken !” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray : “ aye; why,
and for whom, was I forsaken? There's the pang! and
yet you wonder that I cannot instantly forgive and
receive the woman who injured me where I was most
vulnerable.”
“O my mother!” cried Adeline, almost indignantly,
« and can that wretch, though dead, still have power to
influence my fate in this dreadful manner ? and can you
still regret the loss of the affection of that man whose
addresses were a disgrace to you ?”
At these unguarded words, and too just reproaches,
Mrs. Mowbray lost all self-command; and, in a voice
almost inarticulate with rage, exclaimed :-" I loved that
wretch, as you are pleased to call him. I gloried in the
addresses which you are pleased to call my disgráce.

. ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
But he loved you-he left me for you—and on your
account he made me endure the pangs of being forsaken
and despised by the man whom I adored. Then mark
my words : I solemnly swear,” dropping on her knees
as she spoke, “ by all my hopes of happiness hereafter,
that until you shall have experienced the anguish of
having lost the man whom you adore, till you shall have
been as wretched in love, and as disgraced in the eye of
the world, as I have been, I never will see you more, or
pardon your many sins against me-No-not even were
you on your death-bed. Yet, no ; I am wrong there-
Yes ; on your death-bed,” she added, her voice faltering
as she spoke, and passion giving way in a degree to the
dictates of returning nature,—“Yes, there; there I
should—I should forgive you."
“ Then I feel that you will forgive me soon,” faintly
articulated Adeline sinking on the ground; while Mrs.
Mowbray was leaving the room, and Dr. Norberry was
standing motionless with horror, from the rash oath
which he had just heard. But Adeline's fall aroused
him from his stupor.
“ For pity's sake, do not go and leave your daughter
dying !” cried he: “ your vow does not forbid you to
continue to see her now.” Mrs. Mowbray turned back,
and started with horror at beholding the countenance of
Adeline.
“ Is she really dying ?” cried she eagerly, “and have
I killed her?” These words, spoken in a faltering tone,
and with a look of anxiety, seemed to recall the fleeting
spirit of Adeline. She looked up at her mother, a sort
of smile quivered on her lip; and faintly articulating
“I am better,” she burst into a convulsive flood of tears,
and laid her head on the bosom of her compassionate
friend.
“ She will do now,” cried he exultingly to Mrs. Mow-
bray : “you need alarm yourself no longer."
But alarm was perhaps a feeling of enjoyment, to the

131
sensations which then took possession of Mrs. Mowbray.
The apparent danger of Adeline had awakened her long
dormant tenderness : but she had just bound herself by
an oath not to give way to it, except under circumstances
the most unwelcome and affecting, and had therefore
embittered her future days with remorse and unavailing
regret.—For some minutes she stood looking wildly and
mournfully on Adeline, longing to clasp her to her bosom,
and pronounce her pardon, but not daring to violate her
oath. At length, I cannot bear this torment,” she
exclaimed, and rushed out of the room : and when in
another apartment, she recollected, and uttered a scream
of agony as she did so, that she had seen Adeline pro-
bably for the last time ; for, voluntarily, she was now to
see her no more.
· The same recollections occurred to Adeline; and as
the door closed on her mother, she raised herself up, and
looked eagerly to catch the last glimpse of her gown, as
the door shut it from her sight.“ Let us go away
directly now," said she, “ for the air of this room is not
good for me.”
The doctor, affected beyond measure at the expression
of quiet despair with which she spoke, went out to order
a coach; and Adeline instantly rose, and kissed with
fond devotion the chair on which her mother had sat.
Suddenly she heard a deep sigh—it came from the next
room-perhaps it came from her mother ; perhaps she
could still see her again : and with cautious step she
knelt down and looked through the key-hole of the door.
She did see her mother once more. Mrs. Mowbray
was lying on the bed, beating the ground with her foot,
and sighing as if her heart would break.
“O that I dare go in to her!” said Adeline to her-
self: “ but I can at least bid her farewell here.” She
then put her mouth to the aperture, and exclaimed,
“ Mother, dearest mother! since we meet now for the
last time" (Mrs. Mowbray started from the bed) “ let

me thank you for all the affection, all the kindness which
you lavished on me during eighteen happy years. I shall
never cease to love and pray for you.” (Mrs. Mowbray
sobbed aloud.) “ Perhaps, you will some day or other
think you have been harsh to me, and may wish that you
had not taken so cruel a vow.” (Mrs. Mowbray beat her
breast in agony: the moment of repentance was already
come.) “ It may therefore be a comfort to you at such
moments to know, that I sincerely, and from the bottom
of my heart, forgive this rash action :-and now, my
dearest mother, hear my parting prayers for your hap-
piness!”
At this moment a noise in the next room convinced
Adeline that her mother had fallen down in a fainting fit,
and the doctor entered the room.
" What have I done?” she exclaimed. “Go to her
this instant.”—He obeyed. Raising up Mrs. Mowbray
in his arms, he laid her on the bed, while Adeline bent
over her in silent anguish, with all the sorrow of filial
anxiety. But when the remedies which Dr. Norberry
administered began to take effect, she exclaimed, “ For
the last time! Cruel, but most dear mother !” and
pressed her head to her bosom, and kissed her pale lips
with almost frantic emotion.
Mrs. Mowbray opened her eyes; they met those of
Adeline, and instantly closed again.
“ She has looked at me for the last time,” said Ade-
line; “and now this one kiss, my mother, and farewell
for ever!” So saying she rushed out of the room, and
did not stop till she reached the coach, which Glenmurray
had called, and springing into it, was received into the
arms of Glenmurray.
“ You, are my all now," said she. “ You have long
been mine,” replied he: but respecting the anguish and
disappointment depicted on her countenance, he forbore
to ask for an explanation ; and resting her pale cheek
on his bosom, they reached the inn in silence.

Adeline had walked up and down the room a number
of times, had as often looked out of the window, before
Dr. Norberry, whom she had been anxiously expecting
and looking for, made his appearance. “ Thank God,
you are come at last!” said she, seizing his hand as he
entered.
“I left Mrs. Mowbray,” replied he,“ much better
both in mind and body.”
“ A blessed hearing!” replied Adeline.
“And you, my child, how are you?” asked the doctor
affectionately.
" I know not yet,” answered Adeline mournfully :
“ as yet I am stunned by the blow which I have received ;
but pray tell me what has passed between you and my
mother since we left the hotel.”
“ What has passed?” cried Dr. Norberry, starting
from his chair, taking two hasty strides across the room,
pulling up the cape of his coat, and muttering an oath
between his shut teeth—" Why, this passed :—The de-
luded woman, renounced her daughter; and her friend,
her old and faithful friend, has renounced her.”
“Oh! my poor mother!” exclaimed Adeline.
“ Girl! girl! don't be foolish,” replied the doctor;
“ keep your pity for more deserving objects ; and, as
the wisest thing you can do, endeavour to forget your
mother.”
“ Forget her! Never.”
“ Well, well, you will be wiser in time; and now you
shall hear all that passed. When she recovered entirely,
and found that you were gone, she gave way to an agony
of sorrow, such as I never before witnessed; for I be-
lieve that I never beheld before the agony of remorse."
“My poor mother !” cried Adeline, again bursting
into tears. .
" What! again !” exclaimed the doctor. (Adeline
motioned to him to go on, and he continued.) “ At sight
of this, I was weak enough to pity her; and, with the

greatest simplicity, I told her, that I was glad to see
that she felt penitent for her conduct, since penitence
paved the way to amendment; when, to my great sur-
prise, all the vanished fierceness and haughtiness of her
look returned, and she told me, that so far from repent-
ing she approved of her conduct; and that remorse had
no share in her sorrow; that she wept from consciousness
of misery inflicted by the faults of others, not her own.”
“Oh! Dr. Norberry," cried Adeline reproachfully,
“ I doubt, by awakening her pride, you destroyed the
tenderness returning towards me.”
“ May be so. However, so much the better; for
anger is a less painful state of mind to endure than that
of remorse : and while she thinks herself only injured
and aggrieved, she will be less unhappy.”
“Then,” continued Adeline in a faltering voice, “I
care not how long she bates me.”
Dr. Norberry looked at Adeline a moment with tears
in his eyes, and evidently gulped down a rising sob.
“ Good child! good child!” he at length articulated.
“But she'll forget and forgive all in time, I do not
doubt.”
“ Impossible : remember her oath.”
“ And do you really suppose that she will think her-
self bound to keep so silly and rash an oath; an oath
made in the heat of passion?”
“ Undoubtedly I do; and I know, that were she to
break it, she would never be otherwise than wretched all
her life after. Therefore, unless Glenmurray forsakes
me (she added, trying to smile archly as she spoke), and
this I am not happy enough to expect, I look on our
separation in this world to be eternal."
* You do!—Then, poor devil! how miserable she will
be, when her present resentment shall subside! Well;
when that time comes I may perhaps see her again,"
added the doctor, gulping again.
“Heaven bless you for that intention !” cried Adeline.

“But how could you ever have the heart to renounce her?”
“ Girl! you are almost as provoking as your mother.
Why, how could I have the heart to do otherwise, when
she whitewashed herself and blackened you? To be
sure, it did cause me a twinge or two to do it; and had
she been an iota less haughty, I should have turned back
and said, “ Kiss and be friends again. But she seemed
80 provokingly anxious to get rid of me, and waved me
with her hand to the door in such a tragedy queen sort
of a manner, that, having told her very civilly to go to
the devil her own way, I gulped down a sort of a tender
choking in my throat, and made as rapid an exit as
possible. And now another trial awaits me. I came to
town, at some inconvenience to myself, to try to do you
service. I have failed, and I have now no further business
here : 80 we must part, and I know not when we shall
meet again. For I rarely leave home, and may not see
you again for years."
“ Indeed!” exclaimed Adeline. “ Surely," looking
at Glenmurray, “we might settle in Dr. Norberry's
neighbourhood ?”
Glenmurray said nothing, but looked at the doctor;
who seemed confused, and was silent.
“Look ye, my dear girl," said he at length : “ the
idea of your settling near me occurred to me, but,” here
he took two hasty strides across the room—“ in short,
that's an impossible thing; so I beg you to think no
more about it. If, indeed, you mean to marry Mr.
Glenmurray-”
“ Which I shall not do,” replied Adeline coldly.
“ There again, now!” cried the doctor pettisbly :
“you, in your way, are quite as obstinate and ridiculous
as your mother. However, I hope you will know better
in time. But it grows late-'tis time I should be in my
chaise, and I hear it driving up. Mr. Glenmurray,"
continued he in an altered tone of voice,“ to your care
and your tenderness I leave this poor child ; and, zounds,

infancy, and I wish, from my soul, that I left you in a
better situation. But you will write to me, heh?”
“ Undoubtedly.”
“ Well, one kiss :-don't be jealous, Glenmurray.
Your hand, man.- Woons, what a hand! My dear fellow,
take care of yourself, for that poor child's sake: get the
advice which I recommended, and good air.” A rising
sob interrupted him—he hemmed it off, and ran into his
chaise.

“ Now, then,” said Adeline, her tears dropping fast as
she spoke, “ now, then, we are alone in the world;
henceforward we must be all to each other.”
“ Is the idea a painful one, Adeline?” replied Glen-
murray reproachfully.
“ Not so," returned Adeline. “Still I can't yet forget
that I had a mother, and a kind one too.”
“ And may have again.”
“ Impossible:there is a vow in heaven against it.
No-My plans for future happiness must be laid un-
mindful and independent of her. They must have you
and your happiness for their sole object; I must live for
you alone : and you,” added she in a faltering voice,
6 must live for me.”
“ I will live as long as I can,” replied Glenmurray
sighing, “and as one step towards it I shall keep early
hours : so to rest, dear Adeline, and let us forget our
sorrows as soon as possible.”

care was to determine on their future residence. It was
desirable that it should be at a sufficient distance from
London, to deserve the name and have the conveniences
of a country abode, yet sufficiently near it for Glenmurray
to have the advice of a London physician if necessary.
" Suppose we fix at Richmond ?” said Glenmurray :
and Adeline, to whom the idea of dwelling on a spot at
once so classical and beautiful was most welcome, joy-
fully consented; and in a few days they were settled
there in a pleasant but expensive lodging.
But here, as when abroad, Glenmurray occasionally
saw old acquaintances, many of whom were willing to
renew their intercourse with him for the sake of being
introduced to Adeline; and who, from a knowledge of
her situation, presumed to pay her that sort of homage,
which, though, not understood by her, gave pangs un-
utterable to the delicate mind of Glenmurray. “ Were
she my wife, they dared not pay her such marked atten-
tion,” said he to himself; and again, as delicately as he
could, he urged Adeline to sacrifice her principles to the
prejudices of society.
“ I thought," replied Adeline gravely, “ that, as we
lived for each other, we might act independent of society,
and serve it by our example even against its will."
Glenmurray was silent.—He did not like to own how
painful and mischievous he found in practice the princi-
ples which he admired in theory-and Adeline continued:
“ Believe me, Glenmurray, ours is the very situation
calculated to urge us on in the pursuit of truth. We
are answerable to no one for our conduct; and we can
make any experiments in morals that we choose. I am
wholly at a loss to comprehend why you persist in urging
me to marry you. Take care, my dear Glenmurray-
the high respect I bear your character was shaken a little
by your fighting a duel in defiance of your principles ;
and your eagerness to marry, in further defiance of them,
may weaken my esteem, if not my love."

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline smiled as she said this : but Glenmurray
thought she spoke more in earnest than she was willing
to allow; and, alarmed at the threat, he only answered,
“You know it is for your sake merely that I speak;” and
dropped the subject ; secretly resolving, however, that
he would not walk with Adeline in the fashionable pro-
menades, at the hours commonly spent there by the
beau monde.
But, in spite of this precaution, they could not escape
the assiduities of some gay men of fashion, who knew
Glenmurray and admired his companion ; and Adeline
at length suspected that Glenmurray was jealous. But
in this she wronged him ; it was not the attention paid
her, but the nature of it, that disturbed him. Nor is it
to be wondered at that Adeline herself was eager to
avoid the public walks, when it is known that one of
her admirers at Richmond was the Colonel Mordaunt
whom she had become acquainted with at Bath.
Colonel Mordaunt, “curst with every granted prayer,"
was just beginning to feel the tedium of life, when he
saw Adeline unexpectedly at Richmond; and though he
felt shocked at first, at beholding her in so different a
situation from that in which he had first beheld her, still
that very situation, by holding forth to him a prospect
of being favoured by her in his turn, revived his admira-
tion with more than its original violence, and he resolved
to be, if possible, the lover of Adeline, after Glenmurray
should have fallen a victim, as he had no doubt but he
would, to his dangerous illness.
But the opportunities which he had of seeing her sud-
denly ceased. She no longer frequented the public
walks; and him, though he suspected it not, she most
studiously avoided; for she could not bear to behold the
alteration in his manner when he addressed her, an
alteration perhaps unknown to himself. True, it was
not insulting ; but Adeline, who had admired him too
much at Bath not to have examined with minute atten-

tion the almost timid expression of his countenance, and
the respectfulness of his manner when he addressed her,
shrunk abashed from the ardent and impassioned ex-
pression with which he now met her-an expression
which Adeline used to call “looking like Sir Patrick :")
and which indicated even to her inexperience, that the
admiration which he then felt was of a nature less pure
and flattering than the one which she excited before ;
and though in her own eyes she appeared as worthy of
respect as ever, she was forced to own even to herself,
that persons in general would be of a contrary opinion.
But in vain did she resolve to walk very early in a
morning only, being fully persuaded that she should then
meet with no one. Colonel Mordaunt was as wakeful
as she was; and being convinced that she walked during
some part of the day, and probably early in a morning,
he resolved to watch near the door of her lodgings, in
hopes to obtain an hour's conversation with her. The
consequence was, that he saw Adeline one morning walk
pensively alone, down the shady road that leads from the
terrace to Petersham.
This opportunity was not to be overlooked ; and he
overtook and accosted her with such an expression of
pleasure on his countenance, as was sufficient to alarm
the now suspicious delicacy of Adeline ; and, conscious
as she was that Glenmurray beheld Colonel Mordaunt's
attentions with pain, a deep blush overspread her cheek
at his approach, while her eyes were timidly cast down.
Colonel Mordaunt saw her emotion, and attributed it
to a cause flattering to his vanity; it even encouraged
him to seize her hand ; and, while he openly congratu-
lated himself on his good fortune in meeting her alone,
he presumed to press her hand to his lips. Adeline in-
dignantly withdrew it, and replied very coldly to his
inquiries concerning her health.
“But where have you hidden yourself lately?” cried
he._"O Miss Mowbray! loveliest and, I may add, most

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
beloved of women, how have I longed to see you alone,
and pour out my whole soul to you!”
Adeline answered this rhapsody by a look of astonish-
ment only-being silent from disgust and consterna-
tion,—while involuntarily she quickened her pace, as if
wishing to avoid him.
“O hear me, and hear me patiently!” he resumed.
“ You must have noticed the effect which your charms
produced on me at Bath ; and may I dare to add that
my attentions then did not seem displeasing to you?”
“Sir!” interrupted Adeline, sighing deeply, “my
situation is now changed ; and ”
“It is so, I thank Fortune that it is so," replied
Colonel Mordaunt; “and I am happy to say, it is
changed by no crime of mine.” (Here Adeline started
and turned pale.) “But I were unworthy all chance of
happiness, were I to pass by the seeming opportunity of
being blest, which the alteration to which you allude
holds forth to me.”
Here he paused, as if in embarrassment, but Adeline
was unable to interrupt him.
“Miss Mowbray,” he at length continued, “I am told
that you are not on good terms with your mother; nay,
I have heard that she has renounced you ; may I pre-
sume to ask if this be true?”
“It is," answered Adeline trembling with emotion.
“Then, as before long it is probable that you will be
without—without a protector
(Adeline turned
round and fixed her eyes wildly upon him.) “To be
sure,” continued he, avoiding her steadfast gaze, “I
could wish to call you mine this moment; but, unhappy
as you appear to be in your present situation, I know,
unlike many women circumstanced as you are, you are
too generous and noble-minded to be capable of forsaking
in his last illness the man whom in his happier moments
you have honoured with your love.” As he said this,
Adeline, her lips parched with agitation, and breathing

short, caught hold of his arm ; and pressing her cold
hand, he went on: “ Therefore, I will not venture even
to wish to be honoured with a kind look from you till
Mr. Glenmurray is removed to a happier world. But
then, dearest of women, you whom I loved without hope
of possessing you, and whom now I dote upon to mad-
ness, I conjure you to admit my visits, and let my atten-
tions prevail on you to accept my protection, and allow
me to devote the remainder of my days to love and you!"
« Merciful Heaven !” exclaimed Adeline, clasping her
hands together, “to what insults am I reserved!”
• Insults !” echoed Colonel Mordaunt.
“Yes, Sir," replied Adeline: “you have insulted me,
grossly insulted me, and know not the woman whom you
have tortured to the very soul.”
“Hear me, hear me, Miss Mowbray !” exclaimed
Colonel Mordaunt, almost as much agitated as herself :
“by heaven I meant not to insult you! and perhaps I-
perhaps I have been misinformed-No!—Yes, yes, it
must be so ; your indignation proves that I have—You
are, no doubt-and on my knees I implore your pardon
-you are the wife of Mr. Glenmurray.”
“And suppose I am not his wife,” cried Adeline, “is
it then given to a wife only to be secure from being in-
sulted by offers horrible to the delicacy, and wounding
to the sensibility, like those which I have heard from
you ?” But before Colonel Mordaunt could reply, Ade-
line's thoughts had reverted to what he had said of
Glenmurray's certain danger; and, unable to bear this
confirmation of her fears, with the speed of phrensy she
ran towards home, and did not stop till she was in sight
of her lodging, and the still closed curtain of her apart-
ment met her view.
“He is still sleeping, then,” she exclaimed, “and I
have time to recover myself, and endeavour to hide from
him the emotion of which I could not tell the reason.”
So saying, she softly entered the house, and by the time

ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
Glenmurray rose she had regained her composure. Still
there was a look of anxiety on her fine countenance,
which could not escape the penetrating eye of love.
“Why are you so grave this morning?” said Glen-
murray, as Adeline seated herself at the breakfast table :
-"I feel much better and more cheerful to-day.”
“But are you, indeed, better ?”' replied Adeline, fix-
ing her tearful eyes on him.
“Or I much deceive myself,” said Glenmurray.
“ Thank Heaven !” devoutly replied Adeline. “I
thought-I thought—" Here tears choked her utter-
ance, and Glenmurray drew from her a confession of her
anxious fears for him, though she prudently resolved not
to agitate him by telling him of the rencontre with
Colonel Mordaunt.
But when the continued assurances of Glenmurray
that he was better, and the animation of his countenance,
had in a degree removed her fears for his life, she had
leisure to revert to another source of uneasiness, and to
dwell on the insult which she had experienced from
Colonel Mordaunt's offer of protection.
“How strange and irrational,” thought Adeline,“ are
the prejudices of society! Because an idle ceremony has
not been muttered over me at the altar, I am liable to
be thought a woman of vicious inclinations, and to be
exposed to the most daring insults.”
As these reflections occurred to her, she could scarcely
help regretting that her principles would not allow her
delicacy and virtue to be placed under the sacred shelter
bestowed by that ceremony which she was pleased to
call idle. And she was not long without experiencing
still further hardships from the situation in which she
had persisted so obstinately to remain. Their establish-
ment consisted of a footman and a maid servant; but
the latter had of late been so remiss in the performance
of her duties, and so impertinent when reproved for her
faults, that Adeline was obliged to give her warning.


## p. 143 (#159) ############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
143
“Warning, indeed !” replied the girl: “a mighty
hardship, truly! I can promise you I did not mean to
stay long; it is no such favour to live with a kept miss;
and if you come to that, I think I am as good as you."
Shocked, surprised, and unable to answer, Adeline
took refuge in her room. Never before had she been
accosted by her inferiors without respectful attention ;
and now, owing to her situation, even a servant-maid
thought herself authorised to insult her, and to raise
herself to her level !
“But surely,” said Adeline mentally, “I ought to
reason with her, and try to convince her that I am in
reality as virtuous as if I were Glenmurray's wife, in-
stead of his mistress.”
Accordingly she went back into the kitchen; but her
resolution failed her when she found the footman there,
listening with a broad grin on his countenance to the
relation which Mary was giving him of the “fine trim-
ming" which she had given “madam.”
Scarcely did the presence of Adeline interrupt or re-
strain her; but at last she turned round and said, “And,
pray, have you got anything to say to me?”
"Nothing more now," meekly replied Adeline, “un-
less you will follow me to my chamber.”
“ With all my heart,” cried the girl; and Adeline re-
turned to her own room
“I wish, Mary, to set you right,” said Adeline,“ with
respect to my situation. You called me, I think, a kept
miss, and seemed to think ill of me."
“Why, to be sure, ma'am,” replied Mary, a little
alarmed-"every body says you are a kept lady, and so
I made no bones of saying so; but I am sure if so be
you are not so, why I ax pardon.”
“But what do you mean by the term kept lady ?”
“Why, a lady who lives with a man without being
married to him, I take it; and that I take to be your
case, an't it, I pray ?”

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Adeline blushed and was silent :-it certainly was her
case. However, she took courage and went on.
“But mistresses, or kept ladies in general, are women
of bad character, and would live with any man ; but I
never loved, nor ever shall love, any man but Mr. Glen-
murray. I look on myself as his wife in the sight of
God; nor will I quit him till death shall separate us.”
“ Then if so be that you don't want to change, I think
you might as well be married to him.”
Adeline was again silent for a moment, but continued-
“ Mr. Glenmurray would marry me to-morrow, if I
chose.”
“ Indeed! Well, if master is inclined to make an
honest woman of you, you had better take him at his
word, I think.”.
“ Gracious heaven!” cried Adeline, “what an ex-
pression! Why will you persist to confound me with
those deluded women who are victims of their own
weakness ?”
.“ As to that,” replied Mary, “ you talk too fine for
me; but a fact is a fact-are you or are you not my
master's wife?”
." I am not.”
“ Why then you are his mistress, and a kept lady to
all intents and purposes : so what signifies argufying
the matter? I lived with a kept madam before ; and she
was as good as you, for aught I know.”
Adeline, shocked and disappointed, told her she might
leave the room.
“ I am going,” pertly answered Mary, “ and to seek
for a place : but I must beg that you will not own you
are no better than you should be, when a lady comes to
ask my character; for then perhaps I should not get
any one to take me, I shall call you Mrs. Glenmurray."
“ But I shall not call myself so," replied Adeline.
“ I will not say what is not true, on any account.”
“ There now, there's spite ! and yet you pretend to

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
145
call yourself a gentlewoman, and to be better than other
kept ladies! Why, you are not worthy to tie the shoe-
strings of my last mistress—she did not mind telling a
lie rather than lose a poor servant a place ; and she called
herself a married woman rather than hurt me.”
“Neither she nor you, then,” replied Adeline gravely,
“were sensible of what great importance a strict ad-
herence to veracity is, to the interests of society. I am ;
--and for the sake of mankind I will always tell the truth.”
“ You had better tell one innocent lie for mine,"
replied the girl pertly. “I dare to say the world will
neither know nor care anything about it: and I can tell
you I shall expect you will.”
So saying she shut the door with violence, leaving
Adeline mournfully musing on the distresses attending
on her situation, and even disposed to question the pro-
priety of remaining in it.
The inquietude of her mind, as usual, showed itself in
her countenance, and involved her in another difficulty:
to make Glenmurray uneasy by an avowal of what had
passed between her and Mary was impossible ; yet how
could she conceal it from him ? And while she was de-
liberating on this point, Glenmurray entered the room,
and tenderly inquired what had so evidently disturbed her.
“ Nothing of any consequence,” she faltered out, and
burst into tears.
“ Could nothing of consequence' produce such
emotion?” answered Glenmurray.
“But I am ashamed to own the cause of my uneasiness."
“ Ashamed to own it to me, Adeline? To be sure,
you have a great deal to fear from my severity !” said
he, faintly smiling.
Adeline for a moment resolved to tell him the whole
truth ; but fearful of throwing him into a degree of
agitation hurtful to his weak frame, she, who had the
moment before so nobly supported the necessity of a
strict adherence to truth, condescended to equivocate and

evade ; and turning away her head, while a conscious
blush overspread her cheek, she replied, “You know
that I look forward with anxiety and uneasiness to the
time of my approaching confinement.”
Glenmurray believed her; and overcome by some
painful feelings, which fears for himself and anxiety for
her occasioned him, he silently pressed her to his bosom;
and, choked with contending emotions, returned to his
own apartment.
“ And I have stooped to the meanness of disguising
the truth !” cried Adeline, clasping her hands convul-
sively together : “surely, surely, there must be something
radically wrong in a situation which exposes one to such
a variety of degradations !”
Mary, meanwhile, had gone in search of a place; and
having found the lady to whom she had been advised to
offer herself, at home, she returned to tell Adeline that
Mrs. Pemberton would call in half an hour to inquire
her character. The half-hour, an anxious one to Adeline,
having elapsed, a lady knocked at the door, and inquired,
in Adeline's hearing for Mrs. Glenmurray.
“ Tell the lady,” cried Adeline immediately from the
top of the staircase, “ that Miss Mowbray will wait on
her directly.” The footman obeyed, and Mrs. Pemberton
was ushered into the parlour: and now, for the first
time in her life, Adeline trembled to approach a stranger;
for the first time she was going to appear before a fellow-
creature, conscious she was become an object of scorn,
and, though an enthusiast for virtue, would be considered
as a votary of vice. But it was a mortification which
she must submit to undergo; and hastily throwing a
large shawl over her shoulders, to hide her figure as
much as possible, with a trembling hand she opened the
door, and found herself in the dreaded presence of Mrs.
Pemberton.
Nor was she at all re-assured when she found that lady
dressed in the neat, modest garb of a strict Quaker-a

147
garb which creates an immediate idea in the mind, of
more than common rigidness of principles and sanctity
of conduct in the wearer of it. Adeline curtsied in silence.
Mrs. Pemberton bowed her head courteously; then,
with a countenance of great sweetness, and a voice cal-
culated to inspire confidence, said, “I believe thy name
is Mowbray ; but I came to see Mrs. Glenmurray; and
as on these occasions I always wish to confer with the
principal, wouldst thou, if it be not inconvenient, ask
the mistress of Mary to let me see her ?”
“ I am myself the mistress of Mary," replied Adeline
in a faint voice.
“ I ask thine excuse," answered Mrs. Pemberton,
re-seating herself: " as thou art Mrs. Glenmurray,
thou art the person I wanted to see.”
Here Adeline changed colour, overcome with the con-
sciousness that she ought to undeceive her, and the sense
of the difficulty of doing so.
« But thou art very pale, and seemest uneasy,” con-
tinued the gentle Quaker-" I hope thy husband is not
worse?”
“ Mr. Glenmurray, but not my husband,” said Ade-
line, “ is better to-day.”
“ Art thou not married ?” asked Mrs. Pemberton
with quickness.
“I am not.”
“And yet thou livest with the gentleman I named, and
art the person whom Mary called Mrs. Glenmurray!”
“I am,” replied Adeline, her paleness yielding to a
deep crimson, and her eyes filling with tears.
Mrs. Pemberton sat for a minute in silence; then
rising with an air of cold dignity, “ I fear thy servant is
not likely to suit me,” she observed, “and I will not
detain thee any longer.”
“She can be an excellent servant,” faltered out Adeline.
" Very likely-but there are objections.” So saying
she reached the door: but as she passed Adeline she

stopped, interested and affected by the mournful expres-
sion of her countenance, and the visible effort she made
to retain her tears.
Adeline saw, and felt humbled at the compassion which
her countenance expressed: to be an object of pity was as
mortifying as to be an object of scorn, and she turned her
eyes on Mrs. Pemberton with a look of proud indignation :
but they met those of Mrs. Pemberton fixed on her with
a look of such benevolence, that her anger was instantly
subdued; and it occurred to her that she might make the
benevolent compassion visible in Mrs. Pemberton's
countenance serviceable to her discarded servant.
“ Stay, madam,” she cried, as Mrs. Pemberton was
about to leave the room, “ allow me a moment's conver-
sation with you.”
Mrs. Pemberton, with an eagerness which she suddenly
endeavoured to check, returned to her seat.
“ I suspect,” said Adeline, (gathering courage from
the conscious kindness of her motive,) that your objection
to take Mary Warner into your service proceeds wholly
from the situation of her present mistress.”
“Thou judgest rightly,” was Mrs. Pemberton's answer.
“ Nor do I wonder,” continued Adeline, “ that you
make this objection, when I consider the present pre-
judices of society."
“Prejudices!” softly exclaimed the benevolent Quaker.
Adeline faintly smiled, and went on " But surely
you will allow, that in a family quiet and secluded as
ours, and in daily contemplation of an union uninter-
rupted, faithful, and virtuous, and possessing all the
sacredness of marriage, though without the name, it is
not likely that the young woman in question should
have imbided any vicious habits or principles ?”
“ But in contemplating thy union itself, she has lived
in the contemplation of vice; and thou wilt own, that,
by having given it an air of respectability, thou hast only
made it more dangerous."

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
149
« On this point,” cried Adeline, “I see we must
disagree-I shall therefore, without further preamble,
inform you, madam, that Mary, aware of the difficulty
of procuring a service, if it were known that she had
lived with a kept mistress, as the phrase is, (here an
indignant blush overspread the face of Adeline,) desired
me to call myself the wife of Glenmurray: but this, from
my abhorrence of all falsehood, I peremptorily refused.”
" And thou didst well,” exclaimed Mrs. Pemberton,
“ and I respect thy resolution."
“But my sincerity will, I fear, prevent the poor girl's
obtaining other reputable places ; and I, alas! am not
rich enough to make her amends for the injury which
my conscience forces me to do her. But if you, madam,
could be prevailed upon to take her into your family,
even for a short time only, to wipe away the disgrace
which her living with me has brought upon her"
“ Why can she not remain with thee?” asked Mrs.
Pemberton hastily.
“ Because she neglected her duty, and, when reproved
for it, replied in very injurious language.”
“ Presuming probably on thy way of life?”
“I must confess that she has reproached me with it.”
“ And this was all her fault?”
“ It was :--she can be an excellent servant."
“ Thou hast said enough; thy conscience shall not
have the additional burthen to bear, of having deprived
a poor girl of her maintenance-I will take her.”
" A thousand thanks to you," replied Adeline : “ you
have removed a weight off my mind; but my conscience,
has none to bear.”
“No ?” returned Mrs. Pemberton: “dost thou deem
thy conduct blameless in the eyes of that Being whom
thou hast just blessed ?”
“ As far as my connexion with Mr. Glenmurray is
concerned, I do."
6Indeed ?"

“ Nay, doubt me not-believe me that I never wan-
tonly violate the truth; and that even an evasion, which
I, for the first time in my life, was guilty of to-day, has
given me a pang to which I will not again expose
myself.”
" And yet, inconsistent beings as we are,” cried Mrs.
Pemberton, “ straining at a goat, and swallowing a
camel, what is the guilt of the evasion which weighs on
thy mind, compared to that of living, as thou dost, in an
illicit commerce? Surely, surely, thine heart accuses
thee ; for thy face bespeaks uneasiness, and thou wilt
listen to the whispers of penitenee, and leave, ere long,
the man who has betrayed thee."
“ The man who has betrayed me! Mr. Glenmurray is
no betrayer—he is one of the best of human beings.
No, madam : if I had acceded to his wishes, I should
long ago have been his wife, but, from a conviction of
the folly of marriage, I have preferred living with him
without the performance of a ceremony which, in the eye
of reason, can confer neither honour nor happiness."
“ Poor thing!” exclaimed Mrs. Pemberton, rising as
she spoke, “ I understand thee now—Thou art one of
the enlightened, as they call themselves—Thou art one
of those wise in their own conceit, who, disregarding the
customs of ages, and the dictates of experience, set up
their own opinions against the hallowed institutions of
men and the will of the Most High.”
“ Can you blame me," interrupted Adeline, “ for
acting according to what I think right?”
“ But hast thou well studied the subject on which
thou hast decided ? Yet, alas ! to thee how vain must
be the voice of admonition ! (she continued, her coun-
tenance kindling into strong expression as she spoke)
From the poor victim of passion and persuasion, peni-
tence and amendment might be rationally expected ;
and she, from the path of frailty, might turn again to
that of virtue: but for one like thee, glorying in thine

iniquity, and erring, not from the too tender heart, but
the vain-glorious head,—for thee there is, I fear, no
blessed return to the right way; and I, who would have
tarried with thee even in the house of sin, to have re-
claimed thee, penitent, now hasten from thee, and for
ever-firm as thou art in guilt.”
As she said this she reached the door ; while Adeline,
affected by her emotion, and distressed by her language,
stood silent and almost abashed before her.
But with her hand on the lock she turned round, and
in a gentler voice said, " Yet not even against a wilful
offender like thee, should one gate that may lead to
amendment be shut. Thy situation and thy fortunes
may soon be greatly changed; affliction may subdue thy
pride, and the counsel of a friend of thine own sex might
then sound sweetly in thine ears. Should that time
come, I will be that friend. I am now about to set off
for Lisbon with a very dear friend, about whom I feel as
solicitous as thou about thy Glenmurray; and there I
shall remain some time. Here then is my address; and if
thou shouldest want my advice or assistance write to me,
and be assured that Rachel Pemberton will try to forget
thy errors in thy distresses.”
So saying she left the room, but returned again, before
Adeline had recovered herself from the various emotions
which she had experienced during her address, to ask
her Christian name. But when Adeline replied, “ My
name is Adeline Mowbray,” Mrs. Pemberton started,
and eagerly exclaimed, “ Art thou Adeline Mowbray
of Gloucestershire-the young heiress, as she was called,
of Rosevalley?”
“I was once," replied Adeline, sinking back into a
chair, “ Adeline Mowbray of Rosevalley.”
Mrs. Pemberton for a few minutes gazed on her in
mournful silence : “And art thou,” she cried, “Adeline
Mowbray? Art thou that courteous, blooming, blessed
being, (for every tongue that I heard name thee blessed

152
ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
thee,) whom I saw only three years ago bounding over
thy native hills, all grace, and joy, and innocence ?”
Adeline tried to speak, but her voice failed her.'
“ Art thou she,” continued Mrs. Pemberton, “whom
I saw also leaning from the window of her mother's
mansion, and inquiring with the countenance of a pity-
ing angel concerning the health of a wan labourer who
limped past the door?”
Adeline hid her face with her hands.
Mrs. Pemberton went on in a lower tone of voice,
“ I came with some companions to see thy mother's
grounds, and to hear the nightingales in her groves ;
but (here Mrs. Pemberton's voice faltered) I have seen
a sight far beyond that of the proudest mansion, said I
to those who asked me of thy mother's seat ; I have
heard what was sweeter to my ear than the voice of the
ness and prosperity, yet active in the discharge of every
Christian duty; and I have heard her speak in the sooth-
ing accents of kindness and of pity, while her name was
followed by blessings, and parents prayed to have a child
like her. O lost, unhappy girl! such was Adeline
Mowbray: and often, very often, has thy graceful image
recurred to my remembrance: but, how art thou
changed! Where is the open eye of happiness? where
is the bloom that spoke a heart at peace with itself? I
repeat it, and I repeat it with agony. Father of mer-
cies! is this thy Adeline Mowbray ?"
Here, overcome with emotion, Mrs. Pemberton paused;
but Adeline could not break silence : she rose, she
stretched out her hand as if going to speak, but her
utterance failed her, and again she sunk on a chair.
“ It was thine,” resumed Mrs. Pemberton in a faint
and broken voice, “to diffuse happiness around thee,
and to enjoy wealth unhated, because thy hand dis-
pensed nobly the riches which it had received bounte-
ously: when the ear heard thee, then it blessed thee ;

when the eye saw thee, it gave witness to thee; and
yet-
"
Here again she paused, and raised her fine eyes to
heaven for a few minutes, as if in prayer; then, press-
ing Adeline's hand with an almost convulsive grasp, she
drew her bonnet over her face, as if eager to hide the
emotion which she was unable to subdue, and suddenly
left the house; while Adeline, stunned and overwhelmed
by the striking contrast which Mrs. Pemberton had
drawn between her past and present situation, remained
for some minutes motionless on her seat, a prey to a
variety of feelings which she dared not venture to
analyze.
But, amidst the variety of her feelings, Adeline soon
found that sorrow, sorrow of the bitterest kind, was up-
permost. Mrs. Pemberton had said that she was about
to be visited by affliction—alluding, there was no doubt,
to the probable death of Glenmurray-And was his fate
so certain that it was the theme of conversation at Rich-
mond? Were only her eyes blind to the certainty of
his danger?
On these ideas did Adeline chiefly dwell after the de-
parture of her monitress; and in an agony unspeakable
she entered the room where Glenmurray was sitting, in
order to look at him, and form her own judgment on a
subject of such importance. But, alas ! she found him
with the brilliant deceitful appearance that attends his
complaint-a bloom resembling health on his cheek,
and a brightness in his eye rivalling that of the undim-
med lustre of youth. Surprised, delighted, and over-
come by these appearances, which her inexperience ren-
dered her incapable of appreciating justly, Adeline threw
herself on the sofa by him; and, as she pressed her cold
cheek to his glowing one, her tearful eye was raised to
heaven with an expression of devout thankfulness,
“Mrs. Pemberton paid you a long visit,” said Glen-
murray, “and I thought once, by the elevated tone of
her voice, that she was preaching to you."

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ I believe she was," cheerfully replied Adeline, “and
now I have a confession to make; the season of reserve
shall be over, and I will tell you all the adventures of
this day without evasion."
“Aye, I thought you were not ingenuous with me
this morning,” replied Glenmurray : “but better late
than never.”
Adeline then told him all that had passed between her
and Mary and Mrs. Pemberton, and concluded with say-
ing, “But the surety of your better health, which your
looks give me, has dissipated every uneasiness; and if
you are but spared to me, sorrow cannot reach me, and
I despise the censure of the ignorant and the prejudiced.
The world approve! What is the world to me?"
“The conscious mind is its own awful world !"
Glenmurray sighed deeply as she concluded her nar-
ration.
“I have only one request to make," said he—“Never
let that Mary come into my presence again ; and be
sure to take care of Mrs. Pemberton's address.”
Adeline promised that both his requests should be at-
tended to. Mary was paid her wages, and dismissed
immediately; and a girl being hired to supply her place,
the ménage went on quietly again.
But a new mortification awaited Glenmurray and
Adeline. In spite of Glenmurray's eccentricities and
opinions, he was still remembered with interest by some
of the female part of his family; and two of his cousins,
more remarkable for their beauty than their virtue, hear-
ing that he was at Richmond, made known to him their
intention of paying him a morning visit on their way to
their country-seat in the neighbourhood.
“Most unwelcome visitors, indeed !” cried Glenmur.
ray, throwing the letter down ; “I will write to them
and forbid them to come.”
“ That's impossible," replied Adeline, “for by this

time they must be on the road, if you look at the date
of the letter : besides, I wish you to receive them; I
should like to see any relations or friends of yours,
especially those who have liberality of sentiment enough
to esteem you as you deserve.”
“ You ! you see them !” exclaimed Glenmurray,
pacing the room impatiently: “O Adeline, that is im-
possible!”
“I understand you," replied Adeline, changing colour:
“ they will not deem me worthy,” forcing a smile, “to
be introduced to them.”
“And therefore would I forbid their coming. I can-
not bear to exclude you from my presence in order that
I may receive them. No: when they arrive, I will send
them word that I am unable to see them.”
“While they will attribute the refusal to the influence
of the ereature who lives with you! No, Glenmurray,
for my sake I must insist on your not being denied to
them; and, believe me, I should consider myself as un-
worthy to be the choice of your heart, if I were not able
to bear with firmness a mortification like that which
awaits me."
“But you allow it to be a mortification ?”
“Yes, it is mortifying to a woman who knows her-
self to be virtuous, and is an idolater of virtue, to pay
the penalty of vice, and be thought unworthy to asso-
ciate with the relations of the man whom she loves.”
“ They shall not come, I protest,” exclaimed Glen-
murray.
But Adeline was resolute; and she carried her point.
Soon after this conversation the ladies arrived, and
Adeline shut herself up in her own apartment, where she
gave way to no very pleasant reflections. Nor was she
entirely satisfied with Glenmurray's conduct :-true, he
had earnestly and sincerely wished to refuse to see his
unexpected and unwelcome guests; but he had never
once expressed a desire of combating their prejudices

for Adeline's sake, and an intention of requesting that
she might be introduced to them ; but, as any common
man would have done under similar circumstances, he
was contented to do homage to “ things as they are,”
without an effort to resist the prejudice to which he was
superior.
is Alas !” cried Adeline, “when can we hope to see
society enlightened and improved, when even those who
see and strive to amend its faults in theory, in practice
tamely submit to the trammels which it imposes ?"
An hour, a tedious hour to Adeline, having elapsed,
Glenmurray's visitors departed ; and by the disappoint-
ment that Adeline experienced at hearing the door close
on them, she felt that she had had a secret hope of
being summoned to be presented to them; and, with a
bitter feeling of mortification, she reflected, that she was
probably to the man whom she adored a shame and a
reproach.
" Yet I should like to see them,” she said, running to
the window as the carriage drove up, and the ladies en-
tered it. At that moment they, whether from curiosity
to see her, or accident, looked up at the window where
she was. Adeline started back indignant and confused;
for, thrusting their heads eagerly forward, they looked
at her with the bold unfeeling stare of imagined su-
periority; and Adeline, spite of her reason, sunk abashed
and conscious from their gaze.
“And this insult,” exclaimed she, clasping her hands
and bursting into tears, “ I experience from Glenmur-
ray's relations ! I think I could have borne it better
from any one else.”
She had not recovered her disorder when Glenmurray
entered the room, and, tenderly embracing her, exclaim-
ed, “ Never, never again, my love, will I submit to such
a sacrifice as I have now made;" when seeing her in
tears, too well aware of the cause, he gave way to such a
passionate burst of tenderness and regret, that Adeline,

terrified at his agitation, though soothed by his fond-
ness, affected the cheerfulness which she did not feel,
and promised to drive the intruders from her remem-
brance.
· Had Glenmurray and Adeline known the real charac-
ter of the unwelcome visitors, neither of them would
have regretted that Adeline was not presented to them.
One of them was married, and to so accommodating a
husband, that his wife's known gallant was his intimate
friend; and under the sanction of his protection she was
received every where, and visited by every one, as the
world did not think proper to be more clear-sighted than
the husband himself chose to be. The other lady was a
young and attractive widow, who coquetted with many
men, but intrigued with only one at a time ; for which
self-denial she was rewarded by being allowed to pass
unquestioned through the portals of fashionable society.
But these ladies would have scorned to associate with
Adeline; and Adeline, had she known their private his-
tory, would certainly have returned the compliment.
The peace of Adeline was soon after disturbed in
another way. Glenmurray finding himself disposed to
sleep in the middle of the day, his cough having kept
him waking all night, Adeline took her usual walk, and
returned by the church-yard. The bell was tolling; and
as she passed she saw a funeral enter the church-yard,
and instantly averted her head.
In so doing her eyes fell on a decent-looking woman,
who with a sort of angry earnestness was watching the
progress of the procession.
"Aye, there goes your body, you rogue !” she ex-
claimed indignantly, “but I wonder where your soul is
now ?-where I would not be for something."
Adeline was shocked, and gently observed, “What
crime did the person of whom you are speaking, that you
should suppose his soul so painfully disposed of ?”
“What crime?" returned the woman : “ crime

enough, I think :-why, he ruined a poor girl here in
the neighbourhood : and then, because he never chose
to make a will, there is she lying-in of a little by-blow,
with not a farthing of money to maintain her or the
child, and the fellow's money is gone to the heir-at-law,
scarce of kin to him, while his own flesh and blood is
left to starve."
Adeline shuddered :-if Glenmurray were to die, she
and the child which she bore would, she knew, be
beggars.
“Well, miss, or madam, belike, by the look of you,"
continued the woman glancing her eye over Adeline's
person, “ what say you? Don't you think the fellow's
soul is where we should not like to be? However, he
had his hell here too, to be sure! for, when speechless
and unable to move his fingers, he seemed by signs to
ask for pen and ink, and he looked in agonies; and
there was the poor young woman crying over him, and
holding in her arms the poor destitute baby, who would
as he grew up be taught, he must think, to curse the
wicked father who begot him, and the naughty mother
who bore him!”
Adeline turned very sick, and was forced to seat her-
self on a tomb-stone. “ Curse the mother who bore
him !” she inwardly repeated,—“and will my child
curse me? Rather let me 'undergo the rites I have
despised !” and instantly starting from her seat she ran
down the road to her lodgings, resolving to propose to
Glenmurray their immediate marriage.
“ But is the possession of property, then,” she said
to herself as she stopped to take breath, “ so supreme a
good, that the want of it, through the means of his
mother, should dispose a child to curse that mother ?-
No: my child shall be taught to consider nothing valu-
able but virtue, nothing disgracefnl but viće.—Fool that
I am! a bugbear frightened me; and to my foolish fears

respectability of Glenmurray. No-Let his property go

my babe, when its father " Here a flood of tears
put an end to her soliloquy, and slowly and pensively
she returned home.
But the conversation of the woman in the church-yard
haunted her while waking, and continued to distress her
in her dreams that night, and she was resolved to do all
she could to relieve the situation of the poor destitute
girl and child, in whose fate she might possibly see an
anticipation of her own : and as soon as breakfast was
over, and Glenmurray was engaged in his studies, she
walked out to make the projected inquiries.
The season of the year was uncommonly fine; and the
varied scenery visible from the terrace was, at the moment
of Adeline's approach to it, glowing with more than
common beauty. Adeline stood for some minutes gazing
on it in silent delight; when her reverie was interrupted
by the sound of boyish merriment, and she saw, at one
end of the terrace, some well-dressed boys at play.
“ Alas! regardless of their doom
The little victims play!"
immediately recurred to her: for, contemplating the
probable evils of existence, she was darkly brooding over
the imagined fate of her own offspring, should it live to
see the light; and the children at their sport, having no
care of ills to come, naturally engaged her attention.
But these happy children ceased to interest her, when
she saw standing at a distance from the group, and ap-
parently looking at it with an eye of envy, a little boy,
even better dressed than the rest; who was sobbing
violently, yet evidently trying to conceal his grief. And
while she was watching the young mourner attentively,
he suddenly threw himself on a seat; and, taking out
his handkerchief, indignantly and impatiently wiped
away the tears that would no longer be restrained.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“Poor child !” thought Adeline, seating herself be-
side him; “and has affliction reached thee so soon!”
The child was beautiful: and his clustering locks
seemed to have been combed with so much care ; the
frill of his shirt was so fine, and had been so very neatly
plaited; and his sun-burnt neck and hands were so very
very clean, that Adeline was certain he was the darling
object of some fond mother's attention. “And yet he
is unhappy !” she inwardly exclaimed. “When my fate
resembled his, how happy I was !” But from the recol-
lections like these she always hastened ; and checking
the rising sigh, she resolved to enter into conversation
with the little boy.
“ What is the matter?” she cried.—No answer,
“Why are you not playing with the young gentlemen
yonder?”
She had touched the right string :-and bursting into
tears, he sobbed out, “Because they won't let me.”
“No? and why will they not let you ?” To this he
replied not; but sullenly hung his blushing face on his
bosom.
“Perhaps you have made them angry?” gently asked
Adeline. “Oh! no, no,” cried the boy; “but- "
“ But what?” Here he turned from her, and with his
nail began scratching the arm of the seat.
“Well; this is very strange, and seems very unkind,”
cried Adeline : “I will speak to them.” So saying, she
drew near the other children, who had interrupted their
play to watch Adeline and their rejected playmate.
“What can be the reason,” said she, “that you will not
let that little boy play with you?” The boys looked
down, and said nothing.
“ Is he ill-natured ?"
“No.”
“Does he not play fair ?”
“ Yes.” .
“Don't you like him ?”
“Yes."

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
“ Then why do you make him unhappy, by not let-
ting him join in your sport ?”
“ Tell the lady, Jack,” cries one; and Jack, the big-
gest boy of the party, said : “ Because he is not a gen-
tleman's son like us, and is only a little bastard.”
“ Yes,” cried one of the other children; “ and his
mamma is so proud she dresses him finer than we are,
for all he is base-born: and our papas and mammas
don't think him fit company for us.”
They might have gone on for an hour-Adeline could
not interrupt them. The cause of the child's affliction
was a dagger in her heart; and, while she listened to
the now redoubled sobs of the disgraced and proudly
afflicted boy, she was driven almost to phrensy : for
“Such,” she exclaimed, “may one time or other be the
pangs of my child, and so to him may the hours of child-
hood be embittered !” Again she seated herself by the
little mourner—and her tears accompanied his.
“My dear child, you had better go home,” said she,
struggling with her feelings ; “ your mother will cer-
tainly be glad of your company.”
“No, I won't go to her; I don't love her: they say
she is a bad woman, and my papa a bad man, because
they are not married.”
Again Adeline's horrors returned. “But, my dear,
they love you, no doubt ; and you ought to love them,”
she replied with effort.
“There, there comes your papa,” cried one of the
boys; “go and cry to him ;—go."
At these words Adeline looked up, and saw an elegant-
looking man approaching with a look of anxiety.
“Charles, my dear boy, what has happened ?” said
he, taking his hand; which the boy sullenly withdrew.
“Come home directly,” continued his father, “and tell
me what is the matter, as we go along.” But again
snatching his hand away, the proud and deeply wounded
child resentfully pushed the shoulder next him forward,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
whenever his father tried to take his arm, and elbowed
him angrily as he went.
Adeline felt the child's action to the bottom of her
heart. It was a volume of reproach to the father; and
she sighed to think what the parents, if they had hearts,
must feel, when the afflicted boy told the cause of his
grief. “But, unhappy boy, perhaps my child may live
to bless you !” she exclaimed, clasping her hands toge-
ther : “never, never will I expose my child to the pangs
which you have experienced to-day.” So saying, she
returned instantly to her lodgings; and having just
strength left to enter Glenmurray's room, she faintly ex-
claimed : “ For pity's sake, make me your wife to-mor-
row !” and fell senseless on the floor.
On her recovery she saw Glenmurray pale with agi-
tation, yet with an expression of satisfaction in his coun-
tenance, bending over her. “Adeline! my dearest
love !” he whispered as her head lay on his bosom,
“blessed be the words you have spoken, whatever be
their cause! To-morrow you shall be my wife.”
“And then our child will be legitimate, will he not ?"
sbe eagerly replied.
“ It will.”.
“Thank God!” cried Adeline, and relapsed into a
fainting fit. For it was not decreed that the object of
her maternal solicitude should ever be born to reward
it. Anxiety and agitation had had a fatal effect on the
health of Adeline ; and the day after her rencounter on
the terrace she brought forth a dead child.
As soon as Adeline, languid and disappointed, was
able to leave her room, Glenmurray, whom anxiety dur-
ing her illness had rendered considerably weaker, urged
her to let the marriage ceremony be performed imme-
diately. But with her hopes of being a mother vanished
her wishes to become a wife, and all her former reasons
against marriage recurred in their full force.
In vain did Glenmurray entreat her to keep her lately

163
formed resolution : she still attributed his persuasions
to generosity, and the heroic resolve of sacrificing his
principles, with the consistency of his character, to her
supposed good, and it was a point of honour with her
to be as generous in return: consequently the subject
was again dropped ; nor was it likely to be soon renew-
ed ; and anxiety of a more pressing nature disturbed
their peace and engrossed their attention. They had
been three months at Richmond, and had incurred there
a considerable debt; and Glenmurray, not having suf-
ficient money with him to discharge it, drew upon his
banker for half the half-year's rents from his estate,
which he had just deposited in his hands; when to his
unspeakable astonishment he found that the house had
stopped payment, and that the principal partner had
gone off with the deposits !
Scarcely could the firm mind of Glenmurray support
itself under the stroke. He looked forward to the cer-
tainty of passing the little remainder of his life not only
in pain but in poverty, and of seeing increase as fast as
his wants the difficulty of supplying them ; while the
woman of his heart bent in increased agony over his
restless couch; for he well knew that to raise money on
his estate, or to anticipate the next half-year's rents,
was impossible, as he had only a life interest in it; and,
as he held the fatal letter in his hand, his frame shook
with agitation.
“I could not have believed,” cried Adeline, “that the
loss of any sum of money could have so violently affected
you."
“Not the loss of my all! my support during the
tedious scenes of illness !”
“Your all !” faltered out Adeline ; and when she
heard the true state of the case she found her agitation
equalled that of Glenmurray, and in hopeless anguish
she leaned on the table beside him.
“What is to be done,” said she, “till the next half-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
year's rents become due? Where can we procure
money?”
“Till the next half-year's rents become due !” re-
plied he, looking at her mournfully : “I shall not be
distressed for money then.”
“No?" answered Adeline (not understanding him) :
“our expenses have never yet been more than that sum
can supply.
Glenmurray looked at her, and, seeing how uncon-
scious she was of the certainty of the evil that awaited
her, had not the courage to distress her by explaining
his meaning; and she went on to ask him what steps
he meant to take to raise money.
“My only resource,” said he, “is dunning a near re-
lation of mine who owes me three hundred pounds : he
is now, I believe, able to pay it. He is in Holland, in-
deed, at present; but he is daily expected in England,
and will come to see me here. I have named him to
you before, I believe. His name is Berrendale.”
It was then agreed that Glenmurray should write to
Mr. Berrendale immediately; and that, to prevent the
necessity of incurring a further debt for present provi-
sions and necessaries, some of their books and linen
should be sold :—but week after week elapsed, and no
letter was received from Mr. Berrendale.
Glenmurray grew rapidly worse ;--and their landlord
was clamorous for his rent ;-advice from London also
became necessary to quiet Adeline's mind, -though
Glenmurray knew that he was past cure : and after she
had paid a small sum to quiet the demands of the land-
lord for a while, she had scarcely enough left to pay a
physician: however, she sent for one recommended by
Dr. Norberry, and by selling a writing-desk inlaid with
silver, which she valued because it was the gift of her
father, she raised money sufficient for the occasion.
Dr. - arrived, but not to speak peace to the mind
of Adeline. She saw, though he did not absolutely say

165
so, that all chance of Glenmurray's recovery was over :
and though with the sanguine feelings of nineteen she
could “hope though hope were lost,” when she watched
Dr. - 's countenance as he turned from the bed-side
of Glenmurray, she felt the coldness of despair thrill
through her frame; and, scarcely able to stand, she fol-
lowed him into the next room, and awaited his orders
with a sort of desperate tranquillity.
After prescribing alleviations of the ill beyond his
power to cure, Dr. - added that terrible confirmation
of the fears of anxious affection. “Let him have what-
ever he likes ; nothing can hurt him now; and all your
endeavours must be to make the remaining hours of his
existence as comfortable as you can, by every indulgence
possible : and indeed, my dear madam,” he continued,
“you must be prepared for the trial that awaits you."
.“ Prepared! did you say?" cried Adeline in the broken
voice of tearless and almost phrensied sorrow. "O God!
if he must die, in mercy let me die with him. If I have
sinned, (here she fell on her knees,) surely, surely the
agony of this moment is atonement sufficient.”
Dr. , greatly affected, raised her from the ground,
and conjured her for the sake of Glenmurray, and that
she might not make his last hours miserable, to bear
her trial with more fortitude.
“ And can you talk of his last hours, and yet expect
me to be composed ?-0 sir ! say but that there is one
little little gleam of hope for me, and I will be calm.”
.:“ Well," replied Dr. — “I may be mistaken;
Mr. Glenmurray is young, and-and-” here his voice
faltered, and he was unable to proceed ; for the expres-
sion of Adeline's countenance, changing as it instantly
did from misery to joy,-joy of which he knew the
fallacy,—while her eyes were intently fixed on him, was
too much for a man of any feeling to support; and when
she pressed his hand in the convulsive emotions of her
gratitude, he was forced to turn away his head to conceal
he starting tear.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“Well, I may be mistaken-Mr. Glenmurray is young,”
Adeline repeated again and again, as his carriage drove
off; and she flew to Glenmurray's bed-side to impart to
him the satisfaction which he rejoiced to see her feel,
but in which he could not share.
Her recovered security did not, however, last long;
the change in Glenmurray grew every day more visible;
and to increase her distress, they were forced, to avoid
disagreeable altercations, to give the landlord a draft on
Mr. Berrendale for the sum due to him, and remove to
very humble lodgings in a closer part of the town.
Here their misery was a little alleviated by the unex-
pected receipt of twenty pounds, sent to Glenmurray by
a tenant who was in arrears to him, which enabled Ade-
line to procure Glenmurray every thing that his capricious
appetite required ; and at his earnest entreaty, in order
that she might sometimes venture to leave him, lest her
health should suffer, she hired a nurse to assist her in
her attendance upon him.
A hasty letter too was at length received from Mr.
Berrendale, saying, that he should very soon be in Eng-
land, and should hasten to Richmond immediately on
his landing. The terror of wanting money, therefore,
began to subside ; but day after day elapsed, and Mr.
Berrendale came not; and Adeline, being obliged to
deny herself almost necessary sustenance that Glen-
murray's appetite might be tempted, and his nurse, by
the indulgence of hers, kept in good humour, resolved,
presuming on the arrival of Mr. Berrendale, to write to
Dr. Norberry and solicit the loan of twenty pounds.
Having done so, she ceased to be alarmed, though she
found herself in possession of only three guineas to
defray the probable expenses of the ensuing week; and
in somewhat less misery than usual, she, at the earnest
entreaty of Glenmurray set out to take a walk.
Scarcely conscious what she did, she strolled through
the town, and seeing some fine grapes at the window of

167
a fruiterer, she went in to ask the price of them, knowing
how welcome fruit was to the feverish palate of Glen-
murray. While the shopman was weighing the grapes,
she saw a pine-apple on the counter, and felt a strong
wish to carry it home as a more welcome present; but
with unspeakable disappointment she heard that the
price of it was two guineas-a sum which she could not
think herself justified in expending, in the present state
of their finances, even to please Glenmurray, especially
as he had not expressed a wish for such an indulgence ;
besides, he liked grapes; and, as medicine, neither of
them could be effectual.
It was fortunate for Adeline's feelings that she had
not overheard what the mistress of the shop said to her
maid as she left it.
“ I should have asked another person only a guinea ;
but as those sort of women never mind what they give,
I asked two, and I dare say she will come back for it.”
“ I have brought you some grapes,” cried Adeline as
she entered Glenmurray's chamber, “ and I would have
brought you a pine-apple, but that it was too dear.”
“A pine-apple!” said Glenmurray, languidly turning
over the grapes, and with a sort of distaste putting one
of them in his mouth, " a pine-apple !-I wish you had
brought it with all my heart! I protest that I feel as if
I could eat a whole one.”
“ Well,” replied Adeline, “ if you would enjoy it so
much, you certainly ought to have it.”
“ But the price, my dear girl !—what was it ?”
“ Only two guineas,” replied Adeline, forcing a smile.
“ Two guineas !” exclaimed Glenmurray : “ No,-
that is too much to give—I will not indulge my appetite at
such a rate-but, take away the grapes—I can't eat them.”
Adeline, disappointed, removed them from his sight;
and, to increase her vexation, Glenmurray was continually
talking of pine-apples, and in that way that showed how
strongly his diseased appetite wished to enjoy the grati-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
fication of eating one. At last, unable to bear to see him
struggling with an ungratified wish, she told him that
she believed they could afford to buy the pine-apple, as
she had written to borrow some money of Dr. Norberry,
to be paid as soon as Mr. Berrendale arrived. In a
moment the dull eye of Glenmurray lighted up with
expectation; and he, who in health was remarkable for
self-denial and temperance, scrupled not, overcome by
the influence of the fever which consumed him, to gratify
his palate at a rate the most extravagant.
Adeline sighed as she contemplated this change effected
by illness; and, promising to be back as soon as possible,
she proceeded to a shop to dispose of her lace veil, the
only ornament which she had retained; and that not
from vanity, but because it concealed from the eye of
curiosity the sorrow marked on her countenance. But
she knew a piece of muslin would do as well ; and for
two guineas she sold a veil worth treble that sum ; but
it was to give a minute's pleasure to Glenmurray, and
that was enough for Adeline.
In her way to the fruiterer's she saw a crowd at the
door of a mean-looking house, and in the midst of it she
beheld a mulatto woman, the picture of sickness and
despair, supporting a young man who seemed ready to
faint every moment, but whom a rough-featured man,
regardless of his weakness, was trying to force from the
grasp of the unhappy woman; while a mulatto boy,
known in Richmond by the name of the Tawny Boy, to
whom Adeline had often given halfpence in her walks,
was crying bitterly, and hiding his face in the poor
woman's apron.
Adeline immediately pressed forward to inquire into
the cause of a distress only too congenial to her feelings ;
and as she did so, the tawny boy looked up, and, knowing
her immediately, ran eagerly forward to meet her,
seeming, though he did not speak, to associate with her
presence an idea of certain relief.

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.

“ Oh! it is only a poor man,” replied an old woman
in answer to Adeline's inquiries, “who can't pay his
debts, -and so they are dragging him to prison—that's
all.” “ They are dragging him to his death too,” cried
a younger woman in a gentle accent ; “ for he is only
just recovering from a bad fever: and if he goes to jail
the bad air will certainly kill him, poor soul !”
- Is that his wife ? ” said Adeline. “ Yes, and my
mammy,” said the tawny boy, looking up in her face,
" and she so ill and sorry.”
“ Yes, unhappy creatures,” replied her informant,
“and they have known great trouble ; and now, just as
they had got a little money together, William fell ill,
and in doctor's stuff Savanna (that's the mulatto's name)
has spent all the money she had earned, as well as her
husband's; and now she is ill herself, and I am sure
William's going to jail will kill her. And a hard-hearted,
wicked wretch Mr. Davis is, to arrest him—that he is
not but what it is his due, I cannot say but it is—but,
poor souls! he'll die, and she'll die, and then what will
become of their poor little boy?”
The tawny boy all this time was standing, crying, by
Adeline's side, and had twisted his fingers in her gown,
while her heart sympathized most painfully in the anguish
of the mulatto woman. “ What is the amount of the
sum for which he is taken up?” said Adeline.
“Oh! trifling : but Mr. Davis owes him a grudge,
and so will not wait any longer. It is in all only ten
pounds; and he says if they will pay part he will wait
for the rest; but then he knows they could as well pay
all as part.”
Adeline, shocked at the knowledge of a distress which
she was not able to remove, was turning away as the
woman said this, when she felt that the little boy pulled
her gown gently, as if appealing to her generosity;
while a surly-looking man, who was the creditor himself,
forcing a passage through the crowd, said, “Why, bring

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
him along, and have done with it ; here is a fuss to
make indeed about that idle dog, and that ugly black
toad !”
Adeline till then had not recollected that she was a
mulatto ; and this speech, reflecting so brutally on her
colour,-a circumstance which made her an object of
greater interest to Adeline,-urged her to step forward
to their joint relief with an almost irresistible impulse;
especially when another man reproached the fellow for
his brutality, and added, that he knew them both to be
hard-working, deserving persons. But to disappoint
Glenmurray of his promised pleasure was impossible ;
and having put sixpence in the tawny boy's hand, she
was hastening to the fruiterer's, when the crowd, who
were following William and the mulatto to the jail,
whither the bailiffs were dragging rather than leading
him, fell back to give air to the poor man, who had
fainted on Savanna's shoulder, and seemed on the point
of expiring—while she, with an expression of fixed
despair, was gazing on his wan cheek.
Adeline thought on Glenmurray's danger, and shud-
dered as she beheld the scene; she felt it but a too pro-
bable anticipation of the one in which she might soon
be an actor.
At this moment a man observed, “If he goes to prison
he will not live two days, that every one may see ;” and
the mulatto uttered a shriek of agony.
Adeline felt it to her very soul; and, rushing forward,
“ Sir, sir,” she exclaimed to the unfeeling creditor, “ if
I were to give you a guinea now, and promise you two
more a fortnight hence, would you release this poor man
for the present. ?”
“ No: I must have three guineas this moment,"
replied he. Adeline sighed, and withdrew her hand
from her pocket. “ But were Glenmurray here, he
would give up his indulgence, I am sure, to save the lives
of, probably two fellow-creatures,” thought Adeline :

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
171
“ and he would not forgive me if I were to sacrifice
such an opportunity to the sole gratification of his
palate.”—But then again, Glenmurray eagerly expecting
her with the promised treat, so gratifying to the feverish
taste of sickness, seemed to appear before her, and she
turned away ; but the eyes of the mulatto, who had
heard her words, and had hung on them breathless with
expectation, followed her with a look of such sad reproach
for the disappointment which she had occasioned her,
and the little boy looked up so wistfully in her face,
crying, “ Poor fader, and poor mammy!” that Adeline
could not withstand the force of the appeal ; but almost
exclaiming “ Glenmurray would upbraid me if I did not
act thus," she gave the creditor the three guineas, paid
the bailiffs their demand, and then made her way through
the crowd, who respectfully drew back to give her room
to pass, saying, “God bless you, lady! God bless you!"
But William was too ill, and Savanna felt too much to
speak; and the surly creditor said, sneeringly, “ If I
had been you, I would, at least, have thanked the lady."
This reproach restored Savanna to the use of speech;
and (but with a violent effort) she uttered in a hoarse
and broken voice, “ I tank her! God tank her! I never
can :” and Adeline, kindly pressing her hand, hurried
away from her in silence, though scarcely able to refrain
exclaiming, “ You know not the sacrifice which you have
cost me!” The tawny boy still followed her, as loath to
leave her. “Good bless you, my dear!” said she kindly
to him : “ there, go to your mother, and be good to
her.” His dark face glowed as she spoke to him, and
holding up his chin, « Tiss me!” cried he,“ poor
tawny boy love you!” She did so; and then reluctantly,
he left her, nodding his head, and saying, “Dood bye”
till he was out of sight.
With him, and with the display of his grateful joy,
vanished all that could give Adeline resolution to bear
her own reflections at the idea of returning home, and

of the trial that awaited her. In vain did she now try
to believe that Glenmurray would applaud what she had
done. He was now the slave of disease, nor was it likely
that even his self-denial and principle benevolence could
endure with patience so cruel a disappointment-and
from the woman whom he loved too !-and to whom the
indulgence of his slightest wishes ought to have been the
first object.
“ What shall I do?” cried she: “ what will he say?
-No doubt he is impatiently expecting me; and, in his
weak state, disappointment may- ” Here, unable to
bear her apprehensions, she wrung her hands in agony;
and when she arrived in sight of her lodgings she dared
not look up, lest she should see Glenmurray at the
window watching for her return. Slowly and fearfully
did she open the door; and the first sound she heard
was Glenmurray's voice from the door of his room, saying,
“ So, you are come at last !—I have been so impatient !”
And indeed he had risen and dressed himself, that he
might enjoy his treat more than he could do in a sick-bed.
“ How can I bear to look him in the face !” thought
Adeline, lingering on the stairs.
.." Adeline, my love! why do you make me wait so
long?” cried Glenmurray. “Here are knives and plates
ready; where is the treat I have been so long expecting?”
Adeline entered the room and threw herself on the
first chair, avoiding the sight of Glenmurray, whose
countenance, as she hastily glanced her eyes over it, was
animated with the expectation of a pleasure which he
was not to enjoy. “ I have not brought the pine-apple,”
she faintly articulated. “No!” replied Glenmurray, "how
hard upon me!—the only thing for weeks that I have
wished for, or could have eaten with pleasure! I suppose
you were so long going that it was disposed of before you
got there?”
“ No,” replied Adeline, struggling with her tears at
this first instance of pettishness in Glenmurray.

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
173
“ Pardon me the supposition,” replied Glenmurray,
recovering himself: “ more likely you met some dun on
the road, and so the two guineas were disposed of another
way—If so, I can't blame you. What say you ? Am I
right?”
"No." “ Then how was it?" gravely asked Glen-
murray. “You must have had a very powerful and a
sufficient reason, to induce you to disappoint a poor in-
valid of the indulgence which you had yourself excited
him to wish for.”
“This is terrible, indeed!” thought Adeline, “and
never was I so tempted to tell a falsehood.”
“ Still silent! You are very unkind, Miss Mowbray,"
said Glenmurray; “I see that I have tired even you
out.”
· These words, by the agony which they excited, restored
to Adeline all her resolution. She ran to Glenmurray;
she clasped his burning hands in hers; and as succinctly
as possible she related what had passed. When she had
finished, Glenmurray was silent; the fretfulness of disease
prompted him to say, “So then, to the relief of strangers
you sacrificed the gratification of the man whom you
love, and deprived him of the only pleasure he may live
to enjoy !” But the habitual sweetness and generosity
of his temper struggled, and struggled effectually, with
his malady; and while Adeline, pale and trembling, .
awaited her sentence, he caught her suddenly to his
bosom, and held her there a few moments in silence.
“ Then you forgive me?” faltered out Adeline.
“Forgive you! I love and admire you more than ever!
I know your heart, Adeline; and I am convinced that
depriving yourself of the delight of giving me the pro-
mised treat, in order to do a benevolent action, was an
effort of virtue of the highest order; and never, I trust,
have you known, or will you know again, such bitter
feelings as you this moment experienced.”
Adeline, gratified by his generous kindness, and

charmed with his praise, could only weep her thanks.
“ And now,” said Glenmurray, laughing, “ you may
bring back the grapes—I am not like Sterne’s dear
Jenny; if I cannot get pine-apple, I will not insist on
eating crab.”
The grapes were brought; but in vain did he try to
eat them. At this time, however, he did not send them
away without highly commending their flavour, and
wishing that he dared give way to his inclinations, and
feast upon them.
“O God of mercy!” cried Adeline, bursting into an
agony of grief as she reached her own apartment, and
throwing herself on her knees by the bed-side, “Must
that benevolent being be taken from me for ever, and
must I, must I survive him!”
She continued for some minutes in this attitude, and
with her heart devoutly raised to heaven; till every feel-
ing yielded to resignation, and she arose calm, if not
contented; when, on turning round, she saw Glenmur-
ray leaning against the door, and gazing on her.
“Sweet enthusiast !” cried he smiling : “so, thus,
when you are distressed, you seek consolation.”
“I do," she replied : “Sceptic, wouldst thou wish to
deprive me of it?"
“No, by heaven !" warmly exclaimed Glenmurray;
and the evening passed more cheerfully than usual.
The next post brought a letter, not from Dr. Nor-
berry, but from his wife ; it was as follows, and con-
tained three pound-notes :-
“Mrs. Norberry's compliments to Miss Mowbray,
having opened her letter, poor Dr. Norberry being dan-
gerously ill of a fever, find her distress ; of which shall
not inform the doctor, as he feels so much for his friend's
misfortunes, specially when brought on by misconduct.
But, out of respect for your mother, who is a good sort
of woman, though rather particular, as all learned ladies
are, have sent three pound-notes; the Miss Norberrys

175
giving one a-piece, not to lend, but a gift, and they join
Mrs. Norberry in hoping Miss Mowbray will soon see
the error of her ways; and, if so be, no doubt Dr. Nor-
berry will use his interest to get her into the Magdalen.”
This curious epistle would have excited in Glenmur-
ray and Adeline no other feelings save those of contempt,
but for the information it contained of the doctor's be-
ing dangerously ill ; and, in fear for the worthy hus-
band, they forgot the impertinence of the wife and
daughters.
The next day, fortunately, Mr. Berrendale arrived,
and with him the three hundred pounds. Consequently,
all Glenmurray's debts were discharged, better lodgings
procured, and the three pound-notes returned in a blank
cover to Mrs. Norberry. Charles Berrendale was first-
cousin to Glenmurray, and so like him in face, that they
were, at first, mistaken for brothers : but to a phy-
siognomist they must always have been unlike; as
Glenmurray was remarkable for the character and ex-
pression of his countenance, and Berrendale for the ex-
treme beauty of his features and complexion. Glen-
murray was pale and thin, and his eyes and hair dark.
Berrendale's eyes were of a light blue; and though his
eye-lashes were black, his hair was of a rich auburn;
Glenmurray was thin and muscular; Berrendale, round
and corpulent: still they were alike ; and it was not ill
observed of them, that Berrendale was Glenmurray in
good health.
But Berrendale could not be flattered by the resem-
blance, as his face and person were so truly what is
called handsome, that, partial as our sex is said to be to
'beauty, any woman would have been excused for falling
in love with him. Whether his mind was equal to his
person we shall show hereafter.
The meeting between Berrendale and Glenmurray was
affectionate on both sides; but Berrendale could scarcely
hide the pain he felt on seeing the situation of Glenmurray,

176
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
whose virtues he had always loved, whose talents he had
always respected, and to whose active friendship to-
wards himself he owed eternal gratitude.
But he soon learnt to think Glenmurray, in one respect,
an object of envy, when he beheld the constant, skilful,
and tender attentions of his nurse, and saw in that nurse
every gift of heart, mind, and person, which could make
a woman amiable.
Berrendale had heard that his eccentric cousin was
living with a girl as odd as himself; who thought her-
self a genius, and pretended to universal knowledge :
great then was his astonishment to find this imagined
pedant, and pretender, not only an adept in every useful
and feminine pursuit, but modest in her demeanour,
and gentle in her manners : little did he expect to see
her capable of serving the table of Glenmurray with
dishes made by herself, not only tempting to the now
craving appetite of the invalid but to the palate of an
epicure, while all his wants were anticipated by her
anxious attention, and many of the sufferings of sickness
alleviated by her inventive care.
Adeline, meanwhile, was agreeably surprised to see
the good effect produced on Glenmurray's spirits, and
even his health, by the arrival of his cousin ; and her
manner became even affectionate to Berrendale, from
gratitude for the change which his presence seemed to
have occasioned.
Adeline had now a companion in her occasional
walks ;-Glenmurray insisted on her walking, and in-
sisted on Berrendale's accompanying her. In these
tête-à-têtes Adeline unburthened her heart, by telling
Berrendale of the agony she felt at the idea of losing
Glenmurray; and while drowned in tears she leaned on
his arm, she unconsciously suffered him to press the
hand that leaned against him ; nor would she have felt
it a freedom to be reproved, had she been conscious that
he did so. But these trifling indulgences were fuel to

177
the flame that she had kindled in the heart of Berren-
dale ; a flame which he saw no guilt in indulging, as he
looked on Glenmurray's death as certain, and Adeline
would then be free.
But though Adeline was perfectly unconscious of his
attachment, Glenmurray had seen it even before Berren-
dale himself discovered it; and he only waited a favour-
able opportunity to make the discovery known to the
parties. All he had as yet ventured to say was, “ Charles,
my Adeline is an excellent nurse !—You would like such
an one during your fits of the gout;” and Berrendale
had blushed deeply while he assented to Glenmurray's
remarks, because he was conscious that, while enumerat-
ing Adeline's perfections, he had figured her to himself
warming his flannels, and leaning tenderly over his
gouty couch.
One day, while Adeline was reading to Glenmurray,
and Berrendale was attending not to what she read, but
to the beauty of her mouth while reading, the nurse
came in, and said that “a mulatto woman wished to
speak to Miss Mowbray.”
« Show her up,” immediately cried Glenmurray;
“ and if her little boy is with her, let him come too."
In vain did Adeline expostulate—Glenmurray wished
to enjoy the mulatto's expressions of gratitude ; and, in
spite of all she could say, the mother and child were
introduced.
“ So!” cried the mulatto, (whose looks were so im-
proved that Adeline scarcely knew her again,) “ So !
me find you at last; and, please God! we not soon part
more.” As she said this, she pressed the hem of Adeline's
gown to her lips with fervent emotion.
“ Not part from her again!” cried Glenmurray:
“ What do you mean, my good woman?”
“Oh! when she gave tree guinea for me, me tought
she mus he rich lady, but now dey say she be poor, and
me mus work for her.”

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ And who told you I was poor ?”
“ Dat cross man where you live once-he say you
could not pay him, and you go away—and he tell me
dat your love be ill; and me so sorry, yet so glad ! for
my love be well aden, and he have good employ;
and now I can come and serve you, and nurse dis poor
gentleman, and all for nothing but my meat and drink;
and I know dat great fat nurse have gold wages, and eat
and drink fat beside, -I knowd her well.” .
All this was uttered with volubility, and in a tone
between laughing and crying.
“Well, Adeline,” said Glenmurray when she had ended,
“ you did not throw away your kindness on an un-
worthy and ungrateful object; so I am quite reconciled
to the loss of the pine-apple; and I will tell your honest
friend here the story,—to show her, as she has a tender
heart herself, the greatness of the sacrifice you made for
her sake.”
Adeline begged him to desist; but he went on; and
the mulatto could not keep herself quiet on the chair
while he related the circumstance.
“And did she do dat to save me?" she passionately
exclaimed : “ Angel woman! I should have let poor
man go to prison, before disappoint my William !”
“ And did you forgive her immediately? ” said Ber-
rendale.
“ Yes, certainly.”
“ Well, that was heroic too,” returned he.
“ And no one but Glenmurray would have been so
heroic, I believe," said Adeline..
“ But, lady, you break my heart,” cried the mulatto,
“if you not take my service. My William and me, too
poor to live togedder of some year perhaps. Here, child,
tawny boy, down on knees, and vow wid me to be faithful
and grateful to this our mistress, till our last day; and
never to forsake her in sickness or in sorrow! I swear
dis to my great God :-and now say dat after me." She

179
then clasped the little boy's hands, bade him raise his
eyes to heaven, and made him repeat what she had said,
ending it with “ I swear dis, to my great God." ;
There was such an affecting solemnity in this action,
and in the mulatto such a determined enthusiasm of
manner incapable of being controlled, that Adeline, Glen-
murray, and Berrendale observed what passed in respect-
ful silence: and when it was over, Glenmurray said, in
a voice of emotion, “ I think, Adeline, we must accept
this good creature's offer; and as nurse grows lazy and
saucy, we had better part with her : and as for your
young knight there,” (the tawny boy had by this time
nestled himself close to Adeline, who, with no small
emotion, was playing with his woolly curls,) “we must
send him to school ; for, my good woman, we are not
so poor as you imagine.”
. God be thanked !” cried the mulatto.
“ But what is your name?”
“ I was christened Savanna," replied she.
“ Then, good Savanna,” cried Adeline, “ I hope we
shall both have reason to bless the day when first we
met; and to-morrow you shall come home to us.”
Savanna, on hearing this, almost screamed with joy, and
as she took her leave Berrendale slipped a guinea into
her hand : the tawny boy meanwhile slowly followed
his mother, as if unwilling to leave Adeline, even though
she gave him halfpence to spend in cakes : but on being
told that she would let him come again the next day, he
tripped gaily down after Savanna.
The quiet of the chamber being then restored, Glen-
murray fell into a calm slumber, Adeline took up her
work; and Berrendale, pretending to read, continued to
feed his passion by gazing on the unconscious Adeline.
While they were thus engaged, Glenmurray, unobserved,
awoke; and he soon guessed how Berrendale's eyes were
employed, as the book which he held in his hand was
upside down ; and through the fingers of the hand which
N 2

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
he held before his face, he saw his looks fixed on Adeline.
The moment was a favourable one for Glenmurray's
purpose : and just as he raised himself from his pillow,
Adeline had discovered the earnest gaze of Berrendale ;
and a suspicion of the truth that instant darting across
her mind, disconcerted and blushing, she had cast her
eyes on the ground.
“ That is an interesting study which you are engaged
in, Charles,” cried Glenmurray smiling
Berrendale started; and, deeply blushing, faltered
out, “ Yes.”
Adeline looked at Glenmurray, and seeing a very arch
and meaning expression on his countenance, suspected
that he had made the same discovery as herself: yet, if
so, she wondered at his looking so pleasantly on Berren-
dale as he spoke.
“ It is a book, Charles," continued Glenmurray,
“ which the more you study the more you will admire;
and I wish to give you a clue to understand some passages
in it better than you can now do.”
This speech deceived Adeline, and made her suppose
that Glenmurray really alluded to the book which lay
before Berrendale: but it convinced him that Glen-
murray spoke metaphorically; and as his manner was
kind, it also made him think that he saw and did not
disapprove his attachment.
For a few minutes, each of them being engrossed
in different contemplations, there was a complete silence;
but Glenmurray interrupted it by saying, “My dear
Adeline, it is your hour for walking; but, as I am not
disposed to sleep again, will you forgive me if I keep
your walking companion to myself to-day?-I wish to
converse with him alone.
- Oh! most cheerfully,” she replied with quickness :
“ you know I love a solitary ramble of all things.”
« Not very flattering that to my cousin," observed
Glenmurray.

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
181
“ I did not wish to flatter him," said Adeline gravely;
and Berrendale, fluttered at the idea of the coming con-
versation with Glenmurray, and mortified by Adeline's
words and manner, turned to the window to conceal his
emotion.
Adeline, then, with more than usual tenderness, con-
jured Glenmurray not to talk too much, nor do any thing
to destroy the hopes on which her only chance of hap-
piness depended, viz. the now possible chance of his
recovery, aud then set out for her walk; while, with
a restraint and coldness which she could not conquer,
she bade Berrendale farewell for the present.
The walk was long, and her thoughts perturbed :-
“ What could Glenmurray want to say to Mr. Berren-
dale?”—“Why did Mr. Berrendale sit with his eyes so in-
tently and clandestinely, as it were, fixed on me?” were
thoughts perpetually recurring to her: and half impatient,
and half reluctant, she at length returned to her lodgings.
When she entered the apartment, she saw signs of
great emotion in the countenance of both the gentlemen ;
and in Berrendale's eyes the traces of recent tears. The
tone of Glenmurray's voice too, when he addressed her,
was even more tender than usual, and Berrendale's atten-
tions more marked, yet more respectful; and Adeline
observed that Glenmurray was unusually thoughtful and
absent, and that the cough and other symptoms of his com-
plaint were more troublesome than ever.
"I see you have exerted yourself and talked too much
during my absence," cried Adeline, “and I will never
leave you again for so long a time.”
“ You never shall,” said Glenmurray. “I must leave
you for so long a time at last, that I will be blessed with
the sight of you as long as I can."
Adeline, whose hopes had been considerably revived
during the last few days, looked mournfully and re-
proachfully in his face as he uttered these words.
“ It is even so, my dearest girl," continued Glen-

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
murray, “and I say this to guard you against a melan-
choly surprise :-I wish to prepare you for an event
which to me seems unavoidable."
“ Prepare me!” exclaimed Adeline wildly. “ Can
there be any preparation to enable one to bear such a
calamity? Absurd idea! However, I shall derive con-
solation from the severity of the stroke: I feel that I
shall not be able to survive it.” So saying, her head
fell on Glenmurray's pillow; and for some time, her
sorrow almost suspended the consciousness of suffering.
From this state she was aroused by Glenmurray's
being attacked with a violent paroxysm of his complaint,
and all selfish distress was lost in the consciousness of
his sufferings : again he struggled through, and seemed
so relieved by the effort, that again Adeline's hopes
revived'; and she could scarcely return, with temper,
Berrendale's "good night," when Glenmurray expressed
a wish to rest, because his spirits had not risen in any
proportion to hers.. .
The 'nurse had been dismissed that afternoon; and
Adeline, as Savanna was not to come home till the next
morning, was to sit up alone with Glenmurray that
night; and, contrary to his usual custom, he did not
insist that she should have a companion."
- For a few hours his exhausted frame was recruited by
a sleep more than usually quiet, and but for a few hours
only. He then became restless, and so wakeful and dis-
turbed, that he professed to Adeline an utter inability to
sleep, and therefore he wished to pass the rest of the
night in serious conversation with her.
Adeline, alarmed at this intention, conjured him not
to irritate his complaint by so dangerous an exertion.
“My mind will irritate it more,” replied be, “ if I
refrain from it; for it is burthened, my Adeline, and it
longs to throw off its burthen. Now, then, cre my
senses wander, hear what I wish to communicate to you,
and interrupt me as little as possible.”


## p. 183 (#199) ############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
Adeline, oppressed and awed beyond measure at the
unusual solemnity of his manner, made no answer ; but,
leaning her cheek on his hand, awaited his communica-
tion in silence.
..“ I think,” said Glenmurray, “I shall begin with
telling you Berrendale's history; it is proper that you
should know all that concerns him.”
Adeline, raising her head, replied hastily,—“ Not to
satisfy any curiosity of mine; for I feel none, I assure
you."
- Well then,” returned Glenmurray, sighing, “ to
please me, be it. - Berrendale is the son of my mother's
sister, by a merchant of the neighbourhood of the
'Change, who hurt the family pride so much by marrying
a tradesman, that I am the only one of the clan who has
noticed þer since. He ran away, about four years ago,
with the only child of a rich West Indian from a boarding-
school. The consequence was, that her father renounced
her; but, when, three years ago, she died in giving birth
to a son,. the unhappy parent repented of his displeasure,
and offered to allow Berrendale, who from the bank-
ruptcy and sudden death of both his parents had been
left destitute, an annuity of 3001. for life, provided he
would send the child over to Jamaica, and allow him to
have all the care of his education. To this Berrendale
consented.
..“ Reluctantly, I hope,” said Adeline, “and merely
out of pity for the feelings of the childless father."
"I hope so too,” continued Glenmurray; " for I do
not think the chance of inheriting all his grandfather's
property a sufficient reason to lead him to give up to
another, and in a foreign land too, the society and edu-
cation of his child : but, whatever were his reasons,
Berrendale acceded to the request, and the infant was
sent to Jamaica ; and ever since the 3001, has been regu-
larly remitted to him : besides that, he has recovered
two thousand and odd hundred pounds from the wreck

of his father's property; and with economy, and had
he a good wife to manage his affairs for him, Berrendale
might live very comfortably."
- My dear Glenmurray,” cried Adeline impatiently,
“ what is this to me? and why do you weary yourself to
tell me particulars so little interesting to me?"
Glenmurray bade her have patience, and continued
thus: “And now, Adeline, (here his voice evidently
faltered,) I must open my whole heart to you, and con-
fess that the idea of leaving you friendless, unprotected,
and poor, your reputation injured, and your peace of
mind destroyed, is more than I am able to bear, and
will give me, in my last moments, the torments of the
damned.” Here a violent burst of tears interrupted
him ; and Adeline, overcome with emotion and surprise
at the sight of the agitation which his own sufferings
could never occasion in him, hung over him in speechless
woe.
“ Besides," continued Glenmurray, recovering him-
self a little, “1-0 Adeline !” seizing her cold hand,
“ can you forgive me for having been the means of
blasting all your fair fame and prospects in life ?”
“ For the sake of justice, if not of mercy,” exclaimed
Adeline, “ forbear thus cruelly to accuse yourself. You
know that from my own free, unbiassed choice I gave
myself to you, and in compliance with my own principles.”
o But who taught you those principles ?—who led
you to a train of reasoning, so alluring in theory, so per-
nicious in practice? Had not I, with the heedless vanity
of youth, given to the world the crude conceptions of
four-and-twenty, you might at this moment have been
the idol of a respectable society; and I, equally respected,
have been the husband of your heart ; while happiness
would perhaps have kept the fatal disease at bay, of
which anxiety has facilitated the approach."

struggled successfully with her feelings, wound up

almost to phrensy at the possibility that anxiety had
shortened Glenmurray's life, gave way to a violent
paroxysm of sorrow, which, for a while, deprived her of
consciousness; and when she recovered she found Ber-
rendale bending over her, while her head lay on Glen-
murray's pillow.
The sight of Berrendale in a moment roused her to
exertion ;-his look was so full of anxious tenderness,
and she was at that moment so ill disposed to regard it
with complacency, that she eagerly declared she was
quite recovered, and begged Mr. Berrendale would return
to bed; and Glenmurray seconding her request, with a
deep sigh he departed.
« Poor fellow!” said Glenmurray, “I wish you had
seen his anxiety during your illness !”
· “I am glad I did not,” replied Adeline : “ but how
can you persist in talking to me of any other person's
anxiety, when I am tortured with yours? Your conver-
sation of to-night has made me even more miserable than
I was before. By what strange fatality do you blame
yourself for the conduct worthy of admiration ?-for
giving to the world, as soon as produced, opinions which
were calculated to enlighten it?”
“ But," replied Glenmurray, “ as those opinions mili-
tated against the experience and custom of ages, ought
I not to have paused before I published, and kept them
back till they had received the sanction of my maturer
judgment ?”
" And does your maturer judgment condemn them ?”
“ Four years cannot have added much to the maturity
of my judgment,” replied Glenmurray : “ but I will
own that some of my opinions are changed; and that,
though I believe those which are unchanged are right in
theory, I think, as the mass of society could never at
once adopt them, they had better remain unacted upon,
than that a few lonely individuals should expose them-
selves to certain distress, by making them the rules of

their conduct. You, for instance, you, my Adeline,
what misery-!” Here his voice again faltered, and
emotion impeded his utterance.
“Live-do but live," exclaimed Adeline passionately,
" and I can know of misery but the name.”
" But I cannot live, I cannot live,” replied Glen-
murray, “ and the sooner I die the better ;--for thus to
waste your youth and health in the dreadful solitude of
a sick-room is insupportable to me.”
..^O Glenmurray ?” replied Adeline, fondly throwing
herself on his neck, “ could you but live free from any
violent pain, and were neither you nor I ever to leave
this room again, believe me, I should not have a wish
beyond it. To see you, to hear you, to prove to you
how much I love you, would indeed it would, be happi-
ness sufficient for me!”. After this burst of true and
heartfelt tenderness, there was a pause of some moments :
Glenmurray felt too much to speak, and Adeline was
sobbing on his pillow. At length she pathetically again
exclaimed, “ Live ! only live! and I am blest !”
*." But I cannot live, I cannot live," again replied Glen-
murray; “ and when I die, what will become of you ?”
“ I care not,” cried Adeline: “if I lose you, may the
same grave receive us !”.
“But it will not, my dearest :-grief does not kill;
and, entailed as my estate is, I have nothing to leave
you : and though richly qualified to undertake the care
of children, in order to maintain yourself, your unfortu-
nate connexion, and singular opinions, will be an eternal
bar to your being so employed. O Adeline! these cut-
ting fears, these dreadful reflections, are indeed the bit-
terness of death : but there is one way of alleviating my
pangs.'
“ Name it,” replied Adeline with quickness.
..“ But you must promise then to hear me with patience.
-Had I been able to live through my illness, I should
have conjured you to let me endeavour to restore you to

your place in society, and consequently to your useful-
ness, by making you my wife : and young, and I may
add innocent and virtuous, as you are, I doubt not but
the world would at length have received you into its
favour again.”
“ But you must, you will, you shall live,” interrupted
Adeline, “and I shall be your happy wife." ;
...“ Not mine," replied Glenmurray, laying an emphasis
on the last word.
Adeline started, and, fixing her eyes wildly on his,
demanded what he meant.
“I mean," replied he, “ to prevail on you to make
my last moments happy, by promising, some time hence,
to give yourself a tender, a respectable, and a legal pro-
tector.” ... .
"O Glenmurray !” exclaimed Adeline, “and can you
insult my tenderness for you with such a proposal? If I
can even survive you, do you think that I can bear to
give you a successor in my affection? or, how can you
· bear to imagine that I shall ?. i.
.i .
“Because my love for you is without selfishness, and.
I wish you to be happy even though another makes you
80. The lover, or the husband, who wishes the woman
of his affection to form no second attachment, is, in my
opinion, a selfish, contemptible being. Perhaps I do
not expect that you will ever feel, for another man, an
attachment like that which has subsisted between us
the first affection of young and impassioned hearts; but
I am sure that you may again feel love enough to make
yourself and the man of your choice perfectly happy; and
I hope and trust that you will be so.”.
“And forget you, I suppose ?” interrupted Adeline re-
proachfully.
"Not so: I would have you remember me always, but
with a chastized and even a pleasing sorrow; nay, I
would wish you to imagine me a sort of guardian spirit
watching your actions and enjoying your happiness."

“I have listened to you,” cried Adeline in a tone of
suppressed anguish, “and, I trust, with tolerable pa-
tience: there is one thing yet for me to learn—the name
of the object whom you wish me to marry, for I suppose
he is found.”
“He is,” returned Glenmurray. “Berrendale loves
you; and he it is whom I wish you to choose.”
“I thought so," exclaimed Adeline, rising and travers-
ing the room hastily, and wringing her hands.
“But wherefore does his name,” said Glenmurray,
“excite such angry emotion ? Perhaps self-love makes
me recommend him," continued he, forcing a smile, "as
he is reckoned like me, and I thought that likeness
might make him more agreeable to you.”
“Only the more odious," impatiently interrupted
Adeline. “To look like you, and not be you, Oh! in-
supportable idea!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on
Glenmurray's pillow, and pressing his burning temples
to her cold cheek.
“Adeline," said Glenmurray solemnly, “this is, per-
haps, the last moment of confidential and uninterrupted
intercourse that we shall ever have together;" Adeline
started, but spoke not; "allow me, therefore, to tell you
it is my dying request, that you would endeavour to dis-
pose your mind in favour of Berrendale, and to become
in time his wife. Circumstanced as you are, your only
chance for happiness is becoming a wife: but it is too
certain that few men worthy of you, in the most essential
points, will be likely to marry you after your connexion
with me.”
“Strange prejudice !” cried Adeline, “ to consider as
my disgrace, what I deem my glory!”
Glenmurray continued thus : “Berrendale himself has
a great deal of the old school about him, but I have con-
vinced him that you are not to be classed with the frail
of your sex; and that you are one of the purest as well
as loveliest of human beings.”

“ And did he want to be convinced of this?” cried
Adeline indignantly; "and yet you advise me to marry
him?”
“My dearest love,” replied Glenmurray, “ in all cases
the most we can expect is, to choose the best possible
means of happiness. Berrendale is not perfect; but I
am convinced that you would commit a fatal error in not
making him your husband ; and when I tell you it is my
dying request that you should do so—”.
“If you wish me to retain my senses,” exclaimed
Adeline, “repeat that dreadful phrase no more.”
“I will not say any more at all now,” faintly observed
Glenmurray, “for I am exhausted :-still, as morning
begins to dawn, I should like to sit up in my bed, and
gaze on it, perhaps for-” Here Adeline put her hand
to his mouth : Glenmurray kissed it, sighed, and did not
finish the sentence. She then opened the shutters to let
in the rising splendour of day, and, turning round to-
wards Glenmurray, almost shrieked with terror at seeing
the visible alteration a night had made in his appearance;
while the yellow rays of the dawn played on his sallow
cheek, and his dark curls, once crisped and glossy, hung
faint and moist on his beating temples.
“It is strange, Adeline," said Glenmurray (but with
great effort), « that, even in my situation, the sight of
morning, and the revival as it were of nature, seems to
invigorate my whole frame. I long to breathe the fresh-
ness of its breeze also.”
Adeline, conscious for the first time that all hope was
over, opened the window, and felt even her sick soul and
languid frame revived by the chill but refreshing breeze.
To Glenmurray it imparted a feeling of physical pleasure,
to which he had long been a stranger : “ I breathe free-
ly," he exclaimed, “I feel alive again!”—and, strange
as it may seem, Adeline's hopes began to revive also.-
“I feel as if I could sleep now,” said Glenmurray, “the
feverish restlessness seems abated; but, lest my dreams

be disturbed, promise me, ere I lie down again, that you
will behave kindly to Berrendale."
“ Impossible! The only tie that bound me to him is
broken :-I thought he sincerely sympathized with me
in my wishes for your recovery; but now that, as he
loves me, his wishes must be in direct opposition to mine,
- I cannot, indeed I cannot, endure the sight of him.” :
Glenmurray could not reply to this natural observa-
tion: he knew that, in a similar situation, his feelings
would have been like Adelino's; and, pressing her hand
with all the little strength left him, he said “Poor Ber-
rendale !” and tried to compose himself to sleep; while
Adeline, lost in sad contemplation, threw herself in a
chair by his bed-side, and anxiously awaited the event of
his re-awaking.
But it was not long before Adeline herself, exhausted
both in body and mind, fell into a deep sleep; and it
was mid-day before she awoke : for no careless, heavy-
treading, and hired nurse now watched the slumbers of
the unhappy lovers ; but the mulatto, stepping light as
air, and afraid even of breathing lest she should disturb
their repose, had assumed her station at the bed-side, and
taken every precaution lest any noise should awake
them. Hers was the service of the heart; and there is
none like it.
At twelve o'clock Adeline awoke; and her first glance
met the dark eyes of Savanna kindly fixed upon her.
Adeline started, not immediately recollecting who it
could be; but in a moment the idea of the mulatto, and
of the service which she had rendered her, recurred to
her mind, and diffused a sensation of pleasure through
her frame. " There is a being whom I have served,"
said Adeline to herself, and, extending her hand to Sa-
vanna, she started from her seat, invigorated by the
thought: but she felt depressed again by the conscious-
ness that she, who had been able to impart so much joy
and help to another, was herself a wretch for ever; and

191
in a moment her eyes filled with tears, while the mulatto
gazed on her with a look of inquiring solicitude. .
“Poor Savanna!” cried Adeline in a low and plaintive
tone. .
There are moments when the sound of one's own voice
has a mournful effect on one's feelings—this was one of
those moments to Adeline; the pathos of her own tone
overcame her, and she burst into tears : but Glenmurray
slept on; and Adeline hoped nothing would suddenly
disturb his rest, when Berrendale opened the door with
what appeared unnecessary noise, and Glenmurray
hastily awoke.
Adeline immediately started from her seat, and, look-
ing at him with great indignation, demanded why he
came in in such a manner, when he knew Mr. Glenmur-
ray was asleep.
Berrendale, shocked and alarmed at Adeline's words
and expression, so unlike her usual manner, stammered
out an excuse. “Another time, Sir," replied Adeline
coldly, “I hope you will be more careful."
“ What is the matter?” said Glenmurray, raising him-
self in the bed. “Are you scolding, Adeline? If so,
let me hear you : I like novelty.”
Here Adeline and Berrendale both hastened to him,
and Adeline almost looked with complacency on Berren-
dale ; when Glenmurray, declaring himself wonderfully
refreshed by his long sleep, expressed a great desire for
his breakfast, and said he had a most voracious appetite.
But to all Berrendale's attentions she returned the
most forbidding reserve; nor could she for a moment
lose the painful idea, that the death of Glenmurray would
be to him a source of joy, not of anguish. Berrendale
was not slow to observe this change in her conduct; and
he conceived that, as he knew Glenmurray had men-
tioned his pretensions to her, his absence would be of
more service to his wishes than his presence; and he re-
solved to leave Richmond that afternoon,-- especially as

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR, .
he had a dinner engagement at a tavern in London,
which, in spite of love and friendship, he was desirous
of keeping.
He was not mistaken in his ideas : the countenance of
Adeline assumed less severity when he mentioned his in-
tention of going away, nor could she express regret at
his resolution, even though Glenmurray with anxious
earnestness requested him to stay. But Glenmurray
entreated in vain : used to consider his own interest and
pleasure in preference to that of others, Berrendale re-
solved to go; and resisted the prayers of a man who had
often obliged him with the greatest difficulty to himself.
“Well, then,” said Glenmurray mournfully, “if you
must go, God bless you! I wish you, Charles, all pos-
sible earthly happiness; nay, I have done all I can to
ensure it you : but you have disappointed me. I hoped
to have joined your hand, in my last moments, to that of
this dear girl, and to have bequeathed her in the most
solemn manner to your care and tenderness; but no
matter, farewell! we shall probably meet no more.”
Here Berrendale's heart failed him, and he almost re-
solved to stay: but a look of angry repugnance which
he saw on Adeline's countenance, even amidst her sor-
row, got the better of his kind emotions, by wounding
his self-love; and grasping Glenmurray's hand, and say-
ing “I shall be back in a day or two,” he rushed out of
the room.
" I am sorry Mr. Berrendale is forced to go,” said
Adeline involuntarily when the street door closed after
him.
“ Had you condescended to tell him so, he would
undoubtedly have staid,” replied Glenmurray rather
peevishly. Adeline instantly felt, and regretted, the
selfishness of her conduct. To avoid the sight of a dis-
agreeable object, she had given pain to Glenmurray; or,
rather, she had not done her utmost to prevent his being
exposed to it.

“ Forgive me," said Adeline, bursting into tears : “I
own I thought only of myself, when I forbore to urge
his stay. Alas! with you, and you alone, I believe, is
the gratification of self always a secondary consideration.”
“You forget that I am a philanthropist,” replied
Glenmurray, “and cannot bear to be praised, even by
you, at the expense of my fellow-creatures. But come,
hasten dinner ; my breakfast agreed with me so well,
that I am impatient for another meal.”
“ You certainly are better to-day,” exclaimed Adeline
with unwonted cheerfulness.
“ My feelings are more tolerable, at least," replied
Glenmurray : and Adeline and the mulatto began to
prepare the dinner immediately. How often during her
attendance on Glenmurray had she recollected the words
of her grandmother, and blessed her for having taught
her to be useful !
As soon as dinner was over, Glenmurray complained
of being drowsy : still he declared he would not go to
bed till he had seen the sun set, as he had that day, for
the second time since his illness, seen it rise ; and there-
fore, when it was setting, Adeline and Savanna led him
into a room adjoining, which had a western aspect.
Glenmurray fixed his eyes on the crimson horizon with a
peculiar expression; and his lips seemed to murmur,
* For the last time! Let me breathe the evening air, too,
once more,” said he.
“ It is too chill, dear Glenmurray.”
“ It will not hurt me,” replied Glenmurray! and
Adeline complied with his request.
“ The breeze of evening is not refreshing like that of
morning," he observed ; “ but the beauty of the setting
is, perhaps, superior to that of the rising sun :-they
are both glorious sights, and I have enjoyed them both
to-day, nor have I for years experienced so strong a feeling
of devotion.”
• Thank God!” cried Adeline. “O Glenmurray!

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
there has been one thing only wanting to the completion
of our union; and that was, that we should worship
together.”
« Perhaps, had I remained longer here,” replied
Glenmurray, “we might have done so; for, believe me,
Adeline, though my feelings have continually hurried me
into adoration of the Supreme Being, I have often wished
my homage to be as regular and as founded on immutable
conviction as it once was : but it is too late now for
amendment, though, alas! not for regret, deep regret :
yet He who reads the heart knows that my intentions
were pure, and that I was not fixed in the stubbornness
of error.”
“ Let us change this discourse," cried Adeline, seeing
on Glenmurray's countenance an expression of uncommon
sadness, which he, from a regard to her feelings,
struggled to cover. He did indeed feel sadness--a sadness
of the most painful nature ; and while Adeline hung
over him with all the anxious and soothing attention of
unbounded love, he seemed to shrink from her embrace
with horror, and, turning away his head, feebly mur-
mured. “O Adeline! this faithful kindness wounds me
to the very soul. Alas! alas ! how little have I deserved it!”
If Glenmurray, who had been the means of injuring
the woman he loved, merely by following the dictates of
his conscience, and a love of what he imagined to be
truth, without any view of his own benefit or the grati-
fication of his personal wishes, felt thus acutely the
anguish of self-upbraiding,—what ought to be, and what
must be, sooner or later, the agony and remorse of that
man, who, merely for the gratification of his own illicit
desires, has seduced the woman whom he loved from
the path of virtue, and ruined for ever her reputation
and her peace of mind!
“ It is too late now for you to sit at an open window,
indeed it is,” cried Adeline, after having replied to Glen-
murray's self-reproaches by the touching language of

195
tears, and incoherent expressions of confiding and un
changed attachment; “ and as you are evidently better
to-day, do not, by breathing too much cold air, run the
risk of making yourself worse again."
“Would I were really better! would I could live!”
passionately exclaimed Glenmurray: “ but indeed I do
feel stronger to-night than I have felt for many months.”
In a moment the fine eyes of Adeline were raised to
heaven with an expression of devout thankfulness; and,
eager to make the most of a change so favourable, she
hurried Glenmurray back to his chamber, and, with a
feeling of renewed hope, sat by to watch his slumbers.
She had not sat long before the door opened, and the
little tawny boy entered. He had watched all day to see
the good lady, as he called Adeline ; but, as she had not
left Glenmurray's chamber except to prepare dinner, he
had been disappointed : so he was resolved to seek her
in her own apartment. He had bought some cakes with
the penny which Adeline had given him, and he was
eager to give her a piece of them.
“ Hush !” cried Adeline, as she held out her hand to
him ; and he in a whisper crying “ Bite,” held his
purchase to her lips. Adeline tasted it, said it was very
good, and, giving him a halfpenny, the tawny boy dis-
appeared again : the noise he made as he bounded down
the stairs woke Glenmurray. Adeline was sitting on the
side of the bed ; and as he turned round to sleep again
he grasped her hand in his, and its feverish touch damped
her hopes, and re-awakened her fears. For a short
time she mournfully gazed on his flushed cheek, and
then, gently sliding off the bed, and dropping on one
knee, she addressed the Diety in the language of humble
supplication.
Insensibly she ceased to pray in thought only, and the
lowly-murmured prayer became audible. Again Glen-
murray awoke, and Adeline reproached herself as the
cause.

“ My rest was uneasy,” cried he, “and I rejoice that
you woke me: besides, I like to hear you-Go on, my
dearest girl; there is a something in the breathings of
your pious fondness that soothes me,” added he, pressing
the hand he held to his parched lips.
Adeline obeyed : and as she continued, she felt ever
and anon, by the pressure of Glenmurray's hand, how
much he was affected by what she uttered.
“ But must he be taken from me!” she exclaimed in
one part of her prayer. “ Father, if it be possible,
permit this cup to pass by me untasted.” Here she felt
the hand of Glenmurray grasp hers most vehemently;
and, delighted to think that he had pleasure in hearing
her, she went on to breathe forth all the wishes of a
trembling yet confiding spirit, till overcome with her
own emotions she ceased and arose, and leaning over
Glenmurray's pillow was going to take his hand :-but
the hand which she pressed returned not her pressure ;
the eyes were fixed whose approving glance she sought;
and the horrid truth rushed at once on her mind, that
the last convulsive grasp had been an eternal farewell,
and that he had in that grasp expired.
Alas! what preparation howeverlong, whatanticipation
however sure, can enable the mind to bear a shock like
this! It came on Adeline like a thunder-stroke: she
screamed not; she moved not; but, fixing a dim and
glassy eye on the pale countenance of her lover, she
seemed as insensible as poor Glenmurray himself; and
hours might have elapsed—hours immediately fatal both
to her senses and existence-ere any one had entered the
room, since she had given orders to be disturbed by no
one, had not the tawny boy, encouraged by his past
success, stolen in again, unperceived, to give her a piece
of the apple which he had bought with her last
bounty.
The delighted boy tripped gaily to the bed-side, holding
up his treasure ; but he started back, and screamed in

197
all the agony of terror, at the sight which he beheld-
the face of Glenmurray ghastly, and the mouth distorted
as if in the last agony, and Adeline in the stupor of
despair.
· The affectionate boy's repeated screams soon sum-
moned the whole family into the room, while he, vainly
hanging on Adeline's arm, begged her to speak to him.
But nothing could at first rouse Adeline, not even
Savanna's loud and extravagant grief. When, however,
they tried to force her from the body, she recovered her
recollection and her strength; and it was with great
difficulty she could be carried out of the room, and kept
out when they had accomplished their purpose.
But Savanna was sure that looking at such a sad sight
would kill her mistress ; for she should die herself if
she saw William dead, she declared ; and the people of
the house agreed with her. They knew not that grief is
the best medicine for itself; and that the overcharged
heart is often relieved by the sight which standers-by
conceive likely to snap the very threads of existence.
As Adeline and Glenmurray had both of them excited
some interest in Richmond, the news of the death of the
latter was immediately abroad ; and it was told to Mrs.
Pemberton, with a pathetic account of Adeline's distress,
just as the carriage was preparing to convey her and her
sick friend on their way to Lisbon. It was a relation to
call forth all the humanity of Mrs. Pemberton's nature.
She forgot Adeline's crime in her distress ; and knowing
she had no female friend with her, she hastened on the
errand of pity to the abode of vice. Alas! Mrs. Pem-
berton had learnt but too well to sympathize in grief like
that of Adeline. She had seen a beloved husband expire
in her arms, and had afterwards followed two children to
the grave. But she had taken refuge from sorrow in
the active duties of her religion, and was enabled to
become a teacher of those truths to others, by which
she had so much benefited herself.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
Mrs. Pemberton entered the room just as Adeline, on
her knees, was conjuring the persons with her to allow
her to see Glenmurray once more.
Adeline did not at all observe the entrance of Mrs.
Pemberton, who, in spite of the self-command which
her principles and habits gave her, was visibly affected
when she beheld the mourner's tearless affliction : and
the hands which, on her entrance, were quietly crossed
on each other, confining the modest folds of her simple
cloak, were suddenly and involuntarily separated by the
irresistible impulse of pity; while, catching hold of the
wall for support, she leaned against it, covering her face
with her hands. “Let me see him ! only let me see
him once more !” cried Adeline, gazing on Mrs. Pem-
berton, but unconscious who she was.
“ Thou shalt see him," replied Mrs. Pemberton with
considerable effort; “ give me thy hand, and I will go
with thee to the chamber of death." Adeline gave a
scream of mournful joy at this permission, and suffered
herself to be led into Glenmurray's apartment. As soon
as she entered it she sprang to the bed, and, throwing
herself beside the corpse, began to contemplate it with an
earnestness and firmness which surprised every one.
Mrs. Pemberton also fixedly gazed on the wan face of
Glenmurray: “ And art thou fallen!” she exclaimed,
" thou, wise in thine own conceit, who presumedst,
perhaps, sometimes to question even the existence of the
Most High, and to set up thy vain chimeras of yesterday
against the wisdom and experience of centuries ? Child
of the dust! child of error! what art thou now, and
whither is thy guilty spirit fled? But balmy is the hand
of affliction; and she, thy mourning victim, may learn
to bless the hand that chastizes her, nor add to the
offences which will weigh down thy soul, a dread
responsibility for hers!”
Here she was interrupted by the voice of Adeline ;
who, in a deep and hollow tone, was addressing the

unconscious corpse. “ For God's sake, speak ! for this
silence is dreadful-it looks so like death.”
“Poor thing!” said Mrs. Pemberton, kneeling beside
her, “and is it even thus with thee? Would thou couldst
shed tears, afflicted one!”
“ It is very strange,” continued Adeline : “ he loved
me so tenderly, and he used to speak and look so
tenderly, and now, see how he neglects me! Glen-
murray, my love! for mercy's sake, speak to me!” As
she said this, she laid her lips to his : but, feeling on
them the icy coldness of death, she started back,
screaming in all the violence of phrensy; and, recovered
to the full consciousness of her misfortune, she was
carried back to her room in violent convulsions.
“ Would I could stay and watch over thee!” said
Mrs. Pemberton, as she gazed on Adeline's distorted
countenance; “ for thou, young as thou art, wert well
known in the chambers of sorrow and of sickness ; and
I should rejoice to pay back to thee part of the debt of
those whom thy presence so often soothed: but I must
leave thee to the care of others.”
“You leave her to my care,” cried Savanna reproach-
fully,—-who felt even her violent sorrow suspended while
Mrs. Pemberton spoke in accents at once sad yet
soothing,—“ you leave her to my care, and who watch,
who love her more than me?'
“Good Savanna!” replied Mrs. Pemberton, pressing
the mulatto's hand as she returned to her station beside
Adeline, who was fallen into a calm slumber, “ to thy
care, with confidence, I commit her. But perhaps there
may be an immediate necessity for money, and I had
better leave this with thee,” she added, taking out her
purse : but Savanna assured her that Mr. Berrendale
was sent for, and to him all those concerns were to be
left. Mrs. Pemberton stood for a few moments looking
at Adeline in silence, then slowly left the house.
When Adeline awoke, she seemed so calm and resigned,

that her. earnest requests of being allowed to pass the
night alone was granted, especially as Mrs. Pemberton
had desired that her wish, even to see Glenmurray again,
should be complied with: but the faithful mulatto
watched till morning at the door. No bed that night
received the weary limbs of Adeline. She threw herself
on the ground, and in alternate prayer and phrensy
passed the first night of her woe: towards morning,
however, she fell into a perturbed sleep. But when the
light of day darting into the room awakened her to con-
sciousness; and when she recollected that he to whom
it usually summoned her existed no longer; that the
eyes which but the preceding morning had opened with
enthusiastic ardour to hail its beams, were now for ever
closed ; and that the voice which used to welcome her
80 tenderly, she should never, never hear again; the for-
lornness of her situation, the hopelessness of her sorrow
burst upon her with a violence too powerful for her
reason: and when Berrendale arrived, he found Glen-
murray in his shroud, and Adeline in a state of insanity.
For six months her phrensy resisted all the efforts of
medicine, and the united care which Berrendale's love
and Savanna's grateful attachment could bestow; while
with Adeline's want of their care seemed to increase their
desire of bestowing it, and their affection gathered new
strength from the duration of her helpless malady. So
true is it, that we become attached more from the aid
which we give than that which we receive; and that the
love of the obliger is more apt to increase than that of
the obliged by the obligation conferred. At length,
however, Adeline's reason slowly yet surely returned;
and she, by degrees, learnt to contemplate with firmness,
and even calmness, the loss which she had sustained.
She even looked on Berrendale and his attentions not
with anger, but gratitude and complacency; she had even
pleasure in observing the likeness he bore Glenmurray;
she felt that it endèared him to her. In the first

paroxysms of her phrensy, the sight of him threw her
into fits of raving ; but as she grew better she had plea-
sure in seeing him : and when, on her recovery, she
heard how much she was indebted to his persevering
tenderness, she felt for him a decided regard, which Berren-
dale tried to flatter himself might be ripened into love.
But he was mistaken ; the heart of Adeline was formed
to feel violent and lasting attachments only. She had
always loved her mother with a tenderness of a most
uncommon nature; she had felt for Glenmurray the
fondest enthusiasm of passion : she was now separated
from them both. But her mother still lived: and though
almost hopeless of ever being restored to her society, all
her love for her returned ; and she pined for that con-
soling fondness, those soothing attentions, which, in a
time of such affliction, a mother on a widowed daughter
can alone bestow.
“ Yet, surely," cried she in the solitude of her own
room, “ her oath cannot now forbid her to forgive me;
for, am I not as WRETCHED IN LOVE, nay more, far
more so, than she has been? Yes-yes; I will write to
her: besides HE wished me to do so” (meaning Glen-
murray, whom she never named); and she did write to
her, according to the address which Dr. Norberry sent
soon after he returned to his own house. Still week after
week elapsed, and month after month, but no answer
came.
Again she wrote, and again she was disappointed ;
though her loss, her illness in consequence of it, her
pecuniary distress, and the large debt which she had in-
curred to Berrendale, were all detailed in a manner cal-
culated to move the most obdurate heart. What then
could Adeline suppose? Perhaps her mother was ill ;
perhaps she was dead: and her reason was again on the
point of yielding to this horrible supposition, when she
received her two letters in a cover, directed in her mother's
hand-writing

202
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
At first she was overwhelmed by this dreadful proof
of the continuance of Mrs. Mowbray's deep resentment;
but, ever sanguine, the circumstance of Mrs. Mowbray's
having written the address herself appeared to Adeline a
favourable symptom; and with renewed hope she wrote
to Dr. Norberry to become her mediator once more: but
to this letter no answer was returned ; and Adeline con-
cluded her only friend had died of the fever which Mrs.
Norberry had mentioned in her letter.
“ Then I have lost my only friend !” cried Adeline,
wringing her hands in agony, as this idea recurred to
her. “ Your only friend?” repeated Berrendale, who
happened to be present, “ O Adeline!”
Her heart smote her as he said this. “My oldest
friend I should have said,” she replied, holding out her
hand to him ; and Berrendale thought himself happy.
But Adeline was far from meaning to give the encou-
ragement which this action seemed to bestow : wholly
occupied by her affliction, her mind had lost its energy,
and she would not have made an effort to dissipate her
grief by employment and exertion, had not that virtuous
pride and delicacy, which in happier hours had been the
ornament of her character, rebelled against the conscious-
ness of owing pecuniary obligations to the lover whose
suit she was determined to reject, and urged her to make
some vigorous attempt to maintain herself.
Many were the schemes which occurred to her; but
pone seemed so practicable as that of keeping a day-
school in some village near the metropolis. True, Glen-
murray had said, that her having been his mistress would
prevent her obtaining scholars; but his fears, perhaps,
were stronger than his justice in this case. These fears,
however, she found existed in Berrendale's mind also,
though he ventured only to hint them with great caution.
“ You think, then, no prudent parents, if my story
should be known to them, would send their children to
me?” said Adeline to Berrendale.

“ I fear-I—that is to say, I am sure they would not."
“ Under such circumstances,” said Adeline, “ you
yourself would not send a child to my school ?”
“ Why-really-I-as the world goes,” replied Ber-
rendale.
“ I am answered,” said Adeline with a look and tone
of displeasure; and retired to her chamber, intending
not to return till Berrendale was gone to his own lodging.
But her heart soon reproached her with unjust resent-
ment; and, coming back, she apologized to Berrendale
for being angry at his laudable resolution of acting ac-
cording to those principles which he thought most vir-
tuous, especially as she claimed for herself a similar right.
Berrendale, gratified by her apology, replied, “that
he saw no objection to her plan, if she chose to deny him
the happiness of sharing his income with her, provided
she would settle in a village where she was not likely to
be known, and change her name."
• Change my name! Never. Concealment of any
kind almost always implies the consciousness of guilt;
and while my heart does not condemn me, my conduct
shall not seem to accuse me. I will go to whatever place
you shall recommend; but I beg your other request
may be mentioned no more.”
Berrendale, glad to be forgiven on any terms, promised
to comply with her wishes; and he having recommended
to her to settle at a village some few miles north of Lon-
don, Adeline hired there a small but commodious lodging,
and issued immediately cards of advertisement, stating
what she meant to teach, and on what terms ; while
Berrendale took lodgings within a mile of her, and the
faithful mulatto attended her as a servant of all-work.
· Fortunately, at this time, a lady at Richmond, who had
a son the age of the tawny boy, became so attached to
him, that she was desirous of bringing him up to be the
play-fellow and future attendant on her son ; and the
mulatto, pleased to have him so well disposed of, resisted

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
the poor little boy's tears and reluctance at the idea of
being separated from her and Adeline : and before she
left Richmond she had the satisfaction of seeing him
comfortably settled in the house of his patroness.
Adeline succeeded in her undertaking even beyond her
utmost wishes. Though unknown and unrecommended,
there was in her countenance and manner a something
so engaging, so strongly inviting confidence, and so de-
cisively bespeaking the gentlewoman, that she soon ex-
cited in the village general respect and attention: and no
sooner were scholars entrusted to her care, than she be-
came the idol of her pupils ; and their improvement was
rapid in proportion to the love which they bore her.
This fortunate circumstance proved a balm to the
wounded mind of Adeline. She felt that she had reco-
vered her usefulness—that desideratum in morals ; and
life, spite of her misfortunes, acquired a charm in her
eyes. True it was, that she was restored to her capabi-
lity of being useful, by being where she was unknown;
and because the mulatto, unknown to her, had described
her as reduced to earn her living, on account of the death
of the man to whom she was about to be married : but
she did not revert to the reasons of her being so gene-
rally esteemed; she contented herself with the conscious.
ness of being so; and for some months she was tranquil,
though not happy. But her tranquillity was destined to
be of short duration.
CHAPTER XVIII.
The village in which Adeline resided happened to be the
native place of Mary Warner, the servant whom she had
been forced to dismiss at Richmond ; and who having
gone from Mrs. Pemberton to another situation, which
she had also quitted, came to visit her friends.

The wish of saying lessening things of those of whom
one hears extravagant commendations, is, I fear, common
to almost every one, even where the object praised comes
in no competition with oneself :- and when Mary Warner
heard from every quarter of the grace and elegance,
affability and active benevolence of the new comer, it
was no doubt infinitely gratifying to her to be able to
exclaim,-“ Mowbray ! did you say her name is ? La !
I dares to say it is my old mistress, who was kept by one
Mr. Glenmurray!” But so greatly were her auditors
prepossessed in favour of Adeline, that very few of them
could be prevailed upon to believe Mary's supposition
was just; and so much was she piqued at the disbelief
which she met with, that she declared she would go to
church the next Sunday to shame the hussey, and go up
and speak to her in the church-yard before all the people.
“Ah! do so, if you ever saw our Miss Mowbray
before,” was the answer: and Mary eagerly looked for-
ward to the approaching Sunday. Meanwhile, as we
are all of us but too apt to repeat stories to the prejudice
of others, even though we do not believe them, this
strange assertion of Mary was circulated through the
village even by Adeline's admirers; and the next Sunday
was expected by the unconscious Adeline alone with no
unusual eagerness.
Sunday came; and Adeline, as she was wont to do,
attended the service : but from the situation of her
pew, she could neither see Mary nor be seen by her till
church was over. Adeline then, as usual, was walking
down the broad walk of the church-yard, surrounded by
the parents of the children who came to her school, and
receiving from them the customary marks of respect,
when Mary, bustling through the crowd, accosted her
with ;—“Šo !-your sarvant, Miss Mowbray, I am glad
to see you here in such a respectable situation.”
· Adeline, though in the gaily-dressed lady who accosted
her she had some difficulty in recognising her quondam

servant, recollected the pert shrill voice and insolent
manner of Mary immediately; and involuntarily starting
when she addressed her, from painful associations and
fear of impending evil, she replied, “ How are you,
Mary?” in a faltering tone.
« Then it is Mary's Miss Mowbray,” whispered Mary's
auditors of the day before to each other; while Mary,
proud of her success, looked triumphantly at them, and
was resolved to pursue the advantage which she had
gained.
“So you have lost Mr. Glenmurray, I find!” continued
Mary:
Adeline spoke not, but walked hastily on :--but
kept pace with her, speaking as loud as she could.Mary
« And did the little one live, pray ?”
Still Adeline spoke not.
“ What sort of a getting-up had you, Miss Mowbray ?”
At this mischievously-intended question Adeline's other
sensations were lost in strong indignation ; and resuming
all the modest but collected dignity of her manner, she
turned round, and, fixing her eyes steadily on the in-
sulting girl, exclaimed aloud, “Woman, I never injured
you either in thought, word, or deed :—Whence comes
it, then, that you endeavour to make the finger of scorn
point at me, and make me shrink with shame and con-
fusion from the eye of observation ?”
“Woman ! indeed!” replied Mary—but she was not
allowed to proceed; for a gentleman hastily stepped for-
ward, crying, “ It is impossible for us to suffer such
insults to be offered to Miss Mowbray :- I desire, there-
fore, that you will take your daughter away (turning to
Mary's father); and, if possible, teach her better
manners.” Having said this, he overtook the agitated
Adeline; and offering her his arm, saw her home to her
lodgings : while those who had heard with surprise and
suspicion the strange and impertinent questions and
insolent tone of Mary, resumed in a degree their confi.

dence in Adeline, and turned a disgusted and deaf ear
to the hysterical vehemence with which the half-sobbing
Mary defended herself, and vilified Adeline, as her father
and brother-in-law, almost by force, led her out of the
church-yard.
The gentleman who had so kindly stepped forward to
the assistance of Adeline was Mr. Beauclerc, the surgeon
of the village, a man of considerable abilities and liberal
principles ; and when he bade Adeline farewell, he said,
« My wife will do herself the pleasure of calling on you
this evening :" then, kindly pressing her band, he with
a respectful bow took his leave.
Luckily for Adeline, Berrendale was detained in town
that day; and she was spared the mortification of show-
ing herself to him, writhing as she was under the agonies
of public shame, for such it seemed to her. Convinced
as she was of the light in which she must have appeared
to the persons around her from the malicious interroga-
tories of Mary ;-convinced too, as she was more than
beginning to be, of the fallacy of the reasoning which
had led her to deserve, and even to glory in, the situation
which she now blushed to hear disclosed ;—and conscious
as she was, that to remain in the village, and expect to
retain her school, was now impossible-she gave herself
up to a burst of sorrow and despondence; during which
her only consolation was, that it was not witnessed by
Berrendale.
It never for a moment entered into the ingenuous
mind of Adeline, that her declaration would have more
weight than that of Mary Warner; and that she might,
with almost a certainty of being believed, deny her charge
entirely : on the contrary, she had no doubt but that Mrs.
Beauclerc was coming to inquire into the grounds for
Mary's gross address; and she was resolved to confess
to her all the circumstances of her story.
After church in the afternoon Mrs. Beauclerc arrived,
and Adeline observed, with pleasure, that her manner

was even kinder than usual; it was such as to ensure
the innocent of the most strenuous support, and to invite
the guilty to confidence and penitence.
“ Never, my dear Miss Mowbray,” said Mrs. Beau-
clerc, “ did I call on you with more readiness than now;
as I come assured that you will give me not only the most
ample authority to contradict, but the fullest means to
confute, the vile calumnies which that malicious girl,
Mary Warner, bas, ever since she entered the village,
been propagating against you: but, indeed, she is so
little respected in her rank of life, and you so highly in
yours, that your mere denial of the truth of her state-
ment will, to every candid mind, be sufficient to clear
your character.”
Adeline never before was so strongly tempted to violate
the truth; and there was a friendly earnestness in Mrs.
Beauclerc's manner, which proved that it would be almost
cruel to destroy the opinion which she entertained of her
virtue. For a moment Adeline felt disposed to yield to
the temptation, but it was only for a moment,--and in a
hurried and broken voice she replied, “ Mary Warner
has asserted of me nothing but- " Here her voice
faltered.
“ Nothing but falsehoods, no doubt, interrupted Mrs.
Beauclerc triumphantly,-" I thought so.”
“ Nothing but the TRUTH !” resumed Adeline.
“ Impossible !” cried Mrs. Beauclerc, dropping the
cold hand which she held : and Adeline, covering her
face, and throwing herself back in the chair, sobbed
aloud.
Mrs. Beauclerc was herself for some time unable to
speak; but at length she faintly said—“ So sensible, so
pious, so well-informed, and so pure-minded as you seem!
-to what strange arts, what wicked seductions, did you
fall a victim ?”
“ To no arts—to no seductions”-replied Adeline,
recovering all her energy at this insinuation against

Glenmurray. “My fall from virtue, as you would call it,
was, I may say, from love of what I thought virtue; and
if there be any blame, it attaches merely to my confi-
dence in my lover's wisdom and my own too obstinate
self-conceit. But you, dear madam, deserve to hear my
whole story; and, if you can favour me with an hour's
attention, I hope, at least, to convince you that I was
worthy of a better fate than to be publicly disgraced
by a malicious and ignorant girl.”
Mrs. Beauclerc promised the most patient attention ;
and Adeline related the eventful history of her life,
slightly dwelling on those parts of it which in any degree
reflected on her mother, and extolling most highly her
sense, her accomplishments, and her maternal tenderness.
When she came to the period of Glenmurray's illness
and death, she broke abruptly off and rushed into her
own chamber; and it was some minutes before she could
return to Mrs. Beauclerc, or before her visitor could wish
her to return, as she was herself agitated and affected
by the relation which she had heard :-and when Adeline
came in she threw her arms round her neck, and pressed
her to her heart with a feeling of affection that spoke
consolation to the wounded spirit of the mourner.
She then resumed her narration ;-and, having con-
cluded it, Mrs. Beauclerc, seizing her hand, exclaimed,
“For God's sake, marry Mr. Berrendale immediately ;
and abjure for ever, at the foot of the altar, those errors
in opinion to which all your misery has been owing !”
P " Would I could atone for them some other way!”
she replied.
.“ Impossible! and if you have any regard for me you
will become the wife of your generous lover; for then,
and not till then, can I venture to associate with
you."
“ I thought so," cried Adeline; “I thought all idea
of remaining here, with any chance of keeping my
scholars, was now impossible."

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ It would not be so, replied Mrs. Beauclerc, “ if
every one thought like me: I should consider your ex-
ample as a warning to all young people; and to preserve
my children from evil I should only wish them to hear
your story, as it inculcates most powerfully how vain are
personal graces, talents, sweetness of temper, and even
active benevolence, to ensure respectability and confer
happiness, without a strict regard to the long-established
rules for conduct, and a continuance in those paths of
virtue and decorum which the wisdom of ages has
pointed out to the steps of every one.—But others will,
no doubt, consider, that continuing to patronize you,
would be patronizing vice; and my rank in life is not high
enough to enable me to countenance you with any chance
of leading others to follow my example; while I should
not be able to serve you, but should infallibly lose my-
self. But some time hence, as the wife of Mr. Berren-
dale, I might receive you as your merits deserve: till
then ” Here Mrs. Beauclerc paused, and she hesi-
tated to add, “ we meet no more.”
· Indeed it was long before the parting took place Mrs.
Beauclerc had justly appreciated the merits of Adeline,
and thought she had found in her a friend and com-
panion for years to come: besides, her children were
most fondly attached to her; and Mrs. Beauclerc, while
she contemplated their daily improvement under her care,
felt grateful to Adeline for the unfolding excellencies of
her daughters. Still, to part with her was unavoidable;
but the pang of separation was in a degree soothed to
Adeline by the certainty which Mrs. Beauclerc's sorrow
gave her, that, spite of her errors, she had inspired a
real friendship in the bosom of a truly virtuous and re-
spectable woman; and this idea gave a sensation of joy
to her heart to which it had long been a stranger.
The next morning some of the parents, whom Mary's
tale had not yet reached, sent their children as usual.
But Adeline refused to enter upon any school duties,

bidding them affectionately farewell, and telling them
that she was going to write to their parents, as she was
obliged to leave her present situation, and, declining
keeping school, meant to reside, she believed in London.
The children on hearing this looked at each other with
almost tearful consternation; and Adeline observed,
with pleasure, the interest which she had made to her-
self in their young hearts. After they were gone she
sent a circular letter to her friends in the village, im-
porting that she was under the necessity of leaving her
present residence; but that, whatever her future situa-
tion might be, she should always remember, with grati-
tude, the favours which she had received at
The necessity that drove her away was, by this time,
very well understood by every one; but Mrs. Beauclerc
took care to tell those who mentioned the subject to her,
the heads of Adeline's story; and to add always, " and
I have reason to believe that, as soon as she is settled in
town, she will be extremely well married.”
To the mulatto the change in Adeline's plans was par-
ticularly pleasing, as it would bring her nearer her son,
and nearer William, from whom nothing but a sense of
grateful duty to Adeline would so long have divided her.
But Savanna imagined that Adeline's removal was owing
to her having at last determined to marry Mr. Berren-
dale; an event which she, for Adeline's sake, earnestly
wished to take place, though for her own she was unde-
cided whether to desire it or not, as Mr. Berrendale might
not, perhaps, be as contented with her services as Ade-
line was.
While these thoughts were passing in Savanna's mind,
and her warm and varying feelings were expressed by
alternate smiles and tears, Mr. Berrendale arrived from
town: and as Savanna opened the door to him, she, half
whimpering, half smiling, dropped him a very respectful
curtsey, and looked at him with eyes full of unusual
significance.

“Well, Savanna, what has happened?—Anything new
or extraordinary since my absence?” said Berrendale.
“Me tink not of wat hav appen, but what will
happen,” replied Savanna.
* And what is going to happen?” returned Berren-
dale, seating himself in the parlour, “and where is your
mistress ?”
“ She dress herself, that dear misses," replied
Savanna, lingering with the door in her hand, “and I, -
I ope to have a dear massa too.”
- What!” cried Berrendale, starting wildly from his
seat, “ what did you say ?”
• Why me ope my misses be married soon."
“ Married! to whom?” cried Berrendale, seizing her:
hand, and almost breathless with alarm.
“ Why, to you, sure,” exclaimed Savanna, “and den
me hope you will not turn away poor Savanna?”
“What reason you have, my dear Savanna, for talking
thus, I cannot tell ; nor dare I give way to the sweet
hopes which you excite: but, if it be true that I may
hope, depend on it you shall cook my wedding dinner,
and then I am sure it will be a good one.”
“ Can full joy eat ?” asked the mulatto thoughtfully.
“A good dinner is a good thing, Savanna,” replied
Berrendale, “ and ought never to be slighted.”
“Me good dinner day I marry, but I not eat it.
O sir, pity people look best in dere wedding clothes, but
my William look well all day and every day, and perhaps
you will too, sir ; and den I ope to cook your wedding

grasping her hand, “and I–” Here the door opened,
and Adeline appeared ; who, surprised at Berrendale's
familiarity with her servant, looked gravely, and stopped
at the door with a look of cold surprise. Berrendale,
awed into immediate respect-for what is so timid and
respectful as a man truly in love ?-bowed low, and lost

in an instant all the hopes which had elevated his spirits
to such an unusual degree.
Adeline with an air of pique observed, that she feared
she interrupted them unpleasantly, as something un-
usually agreeable and enlivening seemed to occupy them
as she came in, over which her entrance seemed to have
cast a cloud.
· The mulatto had by this time retreated to the door,
and was on the point of closing it when Berrendale stam-
mered out, as well as he could, “ Savanna was, indeed,
raising my hopes to such an unexpected height, that I
felt almost bewildered with joy ; but the coldness of
your manner, Miss Mowbray, has sobered me again.”
“ And what did Savanna say to you?” cried Adeline.
“I-I say,” cried Savanna returning, “ dat is, he
say, I should be let cook de wedding dinner.”.
Adeline, turning even paler than she was before,
desired her coldly to leave the room; and, seating
herself at the greatest possible distance from Berrendale,
leaned for some time in silence on her hand-he not
daring to interrupt her meditations. But at last she
said, “What could give rise to this singular conversation
between you and Savanna I am wholly at a loss to
imagine: still I-I must own that it is not so ill-timed
as it would have been some weeks ago. I will own, that
since yesterday I have been considering your generous
proposals with the serious attention which they deserve.”
On hearing this, which Adeline uttered with consider-
able effort, Berrendale in a moment was at her side, and
almost at her feet.
“1-I wish you to return to your seat,” said Adeline
coldly: but hope had emboldened him, and he chose to
stay where he was.
- But, before I require you to renew your promises,
or make any on my side, it is proper that I should tell
you what passed yesterday ; and if the additional load
of obloquy which I have acquired does not frighten you

from continuing your addresses—” Here Adeline paused :
--and Berrendale, rather drawing back, then pushing
his chair nearer her as he spoke, gravely answered, that
his affection was proof against all trials.
Adeline then briefly related the scene in the church-
yard, and her conversation with Mrs. Beauclerc, and
concluded thus :-" In consequence of this, and of the
recollections of uis advice, and his decided opinion,
that by becoming the wife of a respectable man I could
alone expect to recover my rank in society, and conse-
quently my usefulness, I offer you my hand; and pro-
mise, in the course of a few months, to become yours in
the sight of God and man.”
“And from no other reason ?-from no preference,
no regard for me?” demanded Berrendale reproachfully.
“Oh! pardon me; from decided preference ; there is
not another being in the creation whom I could bear to
call husband.”
Berrendale, gratified and surprised, attempted to take
her hand ; but, withdrawing it, she continued thus ;-
“ Still I almost scruple to let you, unblasted as your
prospects are, take a wife a beggar, blasted in reputation,
broken in spirits, with a heart whose best affections lie
buried in the grave, and which can offer you in return
for your faithful tenderness nothing but cold respect and
esteem ; one too who is not only despicable to others,
but also self-condemned.”
While Adeline said this, Berrendale, almost shuddering
at the picture which she drew, paced the room in great
agitation; and even the gratification of his passion, used
as he was to the indulgence of every wish, seemed, for a
moment, a motive pot sufficiently powerful to enable him
to unite his fate to that of a woman so degraded as
Adeline appeared to be; and he would, perhaps, have
hesitated to accept the hand she offered, had she not
added, as a contrast to the picture which she had drawn-
“ But if, in spite of all these unwelcome considerations,

you persist in your resolution of making me yours, and
I have resolution enough to conquer the repugnance
that I feel to make a second connexion, you may depend
on possessing in me one who will study your happiness
and wishes in the minutest particulars ;-one who will
cherish you in sickness and in sorrow ;-(here a twinge
of the gout assisted Adeline's appeal very powerfully ;)
and who, conscious of the generosity of your attachment,
and her own unworthiness, will strive, by every possible
effort, not to remain your debtor even in affection.”
Saying this, she put out her hand to Berrendale; and
that hand, and the arm belonging to it, were so beautiful,
and he had so often envied Glenmurray while he saw
them tenderly supporting his head, that while a vision of
approaching gout, and Adeline bending over his restless
couch, floated before him, all his prudent considerations
vanished ; and, eagerly pressing the proffered hand to
his lips, he thanked her most ardently for her kind
promise ; and, putting his arm round her waist, would
have pressed her to his bosom.
But the familiarity was ill-timed ;--Adeline was already
surprised, and even shocked, at the lengths which she
had gone; and starting almost with loathing from his
embrace, she told him it grew late, and it was time for
him to go to his lodgings. She then retired to her own
room, and spent half the night at least in weeping over
the remembrance of Glenmurray, and in loudly apostro-
phizing his departed spirit.
The next day Adeline, out of the money which she had
earned, discharged her lodgings ; and having written a
farewell note to Mrs. Beauclerc, begging to hear of her
now and then, she and the mulatto proceeded to town,
with Berrendale, in search of apartments; and having
procured them, Adeline began to consider by what means,
till she could resolve to marry Berrendale, she should
help to maintain herself, and also contrive to increase
their income if she became his wife.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
The success which she had met with in instructing
children, led her to believe that she might succeed in
writing little hymns and tales for their benefit; a method
of getting money which she looked upon to be more
rapid and more lucrative than working plain or fancy
works : and, in a short time, a little volume was ready
to be offered to a bookseller :- nor was it offered in vain.
Glenmurray's bookseller accepted it ; and the sum which
he gave, though trifling, imparted a balsam to the
wounded mind of Adeline : it seemed to open to her the
path of independence; and to give her, in spite of her
past errors, the means of serving her fellow-creatures.
But month after month elapsed, and Glenmurray had
been dead two years, yet still Adeline could not prevail
on herself to fix a time for her marriage.
But next to the aversion she felt to marrying at all,
was that which she experienced at the idea of having no
fortune to bestow on the disinterested Berrendale ; and
80 desirous was she of his acquiring some little property
by his union with her, that she resolved to ask counsel's
opinion on the possibility of her claiming a sum of
money which Glenmurray had bequeathed to her, but
without, as Berrendale had assured her, the customary
formalities.
The money was near 3001.; but Berrendale had
allowed it to go to Glenmurray's legal heir, because he
was sure that the writing which bequeathed it would not
hold good in law. Still Adeline was so unwilling to be
under so many pecuniary obligations to a man whom she
did not love, that she resolved to take advice on the
subject, much against the will of Berrendale, who thought
the money for fees might as well be saved ; but as &
chance for saving the fee he resolved to let Adeline go to
the lawyers chambers alone, thinking it likely that no
fee would be accepted from so fine a woman. Accordingly,
more alive to economy than to delicacy or decorum,
Berrendale, when Adeline, desiring a coach to be called,

summoned him to accompany her to the Temple, pleaded
terror of an impending fit of the gout, and begged her to
excuse his attendance ; and Adeline, unsuspicious of the
real cause of his refusal, kindly expressing her sorrow
for the one he feigned, took the counsellor's address,
and got into the coach, Berrendale taking care to tell her,
as she got in, that the fare was but a shilling.
The gentleman, Mr. Langley, to whom Adeline was
going, was celebrated for his abilities as a chamber
counsellor, and no less remarkable for his gallantries :
but Berrendale was not acquainted with this part of his
history: else he would not, even to save a lawyer's fee,
have exposed his intended wife to a situation of such
extreme impropriety; and Adeline was too much a
stranger to the rules of general society, to feel any great
repugnance to go alone on an errand so interesting to
her feelings.
• The coach having stopped near the entrance of the
court to which she was directed, Adeline, resolving to
walk home, discharged the coach, and knocked at the
door of Mr. Langley's chambers. A very smart servant
out of livery answered the knock; and Mr. Langley
being at home, Adeline was introduced into his apart-
ment.
Mr. Langley, though surprised at seeing a lady of a
deportment so correct and of so dignified an appearance
enter his room unattended, was inspired with so much
respect at the sight of Adeline, whose mourning habit
added to the interest which her countenance never failed
to excite, that he received her with bows down to the
ground, and, leading her to a chair, begged she would
do him the honour to be seated, and impart her commands.
Adeline embarrassed, she scarcely knew why, at the
novelty of her situation, drew the paper from her pocket,
and presented it to him.
“ Mr. Berrendale recommended me to you, sir,” said
Adeline faintly.

“ Berrendale, Berrendale, 0, aye, I remember—the
cousin of Mr. Glenmurray : you know Mr. Glenmurray
too, ma'am, I presume; pray how is he?”—Adeline,
unprepared for this question, could not speak; and the
voluble counsellor went on—" Oh !-I ask your pardon,
madam, I see ;-pray, might I presume so far, how long
has that extraordinary cleverman. been lost to the world?"
“ More than two years, sir,” replied Adeline faintly.
“You are,-may I presume so far,—you are his
widow ?”—Adeline bowed. There was a something in
Mr. Langley's manner and look so like Sir Patrick's,
that she could not bear to let him know she was only
Glenmurray's companion.
" Gone more than two years, and you still in deep
mourning !-Amiable susceptibility !-How unlike the
wives of the present day! But I beg pardon.-Now to
business.” Šo saying, he perused the paper which
Adeline had given him, in which Glenmurray simply
stated, that he bequeathed to Adeline Mowbray the sum
of 2601. in the 5 per cents. but it was signed by only one
witness.
“ What do you wish to know, Madam ?” asked the
counsellor. .
“ Whether this will be valid, as it is not signed by
two witnesses, sir ?”.
“Why,—really not,” replied Langley; “ though the
heir-at-law, if he have either equity or gallantry, could
certainly not refuse to fulfil what evidently was the in-
tention of the testator :--but then, it is very surprising
to me that Mr. Glenmurray should have wished to leave
any thing from the lady whom I have the honour to be-
hold. Pray, madam,-if I may presume to ask,—Who
is Adeline Mowbray ?”
“I-I am Adeline Mowbray,” replied Adeline in great
confusion.
“ You, madam! Bless me, I presumed ;-and pray,
madam,—if I may make so bold, what was your rela-

tionship to that wonderfully clever man ?-his niece,-
his cousin,-or,— ?”
“I was no relation of his,” said Adeline still more
confused ; and this confusion confirmed the suspicions
which Langley entertained, and also brought to his re-
collection something which he had heard of Glenmurray's
having a very elegant and accomplished mistress.
“ Pardon me, dear madam,” said Mr. Langley, “I
perceive now my mistake ; and I now perceive why Mr.
Glenmurray was so much the envy of those who had the
honour of visiting at his house. 'Pon my soul,” taking
her hand, which Adeline indignantly withdrew, “I am
grieved beyond words at being unable to give you a
more favourable opinion.”
“ But you said, sir,” said Adeline, “ that the heir-at- .
law, if he had any equity, would certainly be guided by
the evident intention of the testator.”
“ I did, madam,” replied the lawyer, evidently piqued
by the proud and cold air which Adeline assumed ;-
“ but then,-excuse me,—the applicant would not stand
much chance of being attended to, who is neither the
widow nor relation of Mr. Glenmurray."
“ I understand you, sir,” replied Adeline, “and need
trouble you no longer.”
“ Trouble ! my sweet girl !” returned Mr, Langley,
“call it not trouble; I Here his gallant effusions
were interrupted by the sudden entrance of a very showy
woman, highly rouged, and dressed in the extremity of
the fashion; and who in no very pleasant tone of voice
exclaimed,—“ I fear I interrupt you."
“Oh! not in the least,” replied Langley, blushing
even more than Adeline, “my fair client was just going.
Allow me, madam, to see you to the door,” continued he,
attempting to take Adeline's hand, and accompanying
her to the bottom of the first flight of stairs.
“ Charming fine woman upon my soul!” cried he,
speaking through his shut teeth, and forcibly sqeezing

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
her fingers as he spoke; “ and if you ever want advice
I should be proud to see you here, (with a significant
smile);” Here Adeline, too angry to speak, put the
fee in his hand, which he insisted on returning, and, in
the struggle, he forcibly kissed the ungloved hand which
was held out, praising its beauty at the same time, and
endeavouring to close her fingers on the money : but
Adeline indignantly threw it on the ground, and rushed
down the remaining staircase; over-hearing the lady, as
she did so, exclaim, “ Langley! is not that black maw-
kin gone yet? Come up this moment, you devil!” while
Langley obsequiously replied, “ Coming this moment,
my angel!”
Adeline felt so disappointed, so ashamed, and so
degraded, that she walked on some way without knowing
whither she was going; and when she recollected herself,
she found that she was wandering from court to court,
and unable to find the avenue to the street down which
the coach had come : while her very tall figure, height-
ened colour, and graceful carriage, made her an object
of attention to every one whom she met.
At last she saw herself followed by two young men ;
and as she walked very fast to avoid them, she by acci-
dent turned into the very lane which she had been seeking:
but her pursuers kept pace with her ; and she overheard
one of them say to the other, “ A devilish fine girl!
moves well too,— I cannot help thinking that I have seen
her before.”
“ And I think so too !—by her height, it must be that
sweet creature who lived at Richmond with that crazy
fellow, Glenmurray.”
Here Adeline relaxed in her pace : the name of Glen-
murray—that name which no one since his death had
ventured to pronounce in her presence,-had, during the
last half hour, been pronounced several times ; and,
unable to support herself from a variety of emotions,
she stopped, and leaned for support against the wall.

= « How do you do, my fleet and swift girl ?” said one
of the gentlemen :--and Adeline, roused at the insult,
looked at him proudly and angrily, and walked on.
" What! angry! If I may be so bold, (with a sneering
smile), fair creature, may I ask where you live now ?”
“ No, sir,” replied Adeline; “ you are wholly un-
known to me.”
“ But were you to tell me where you live, we might
cease to be strangers ; pray who is your friend now?”
Here, as his companion gave way to a loud fit of
laughter, Adeline clearly understood what he meant by the
term “ friend ;” and summoning up all her spirit, she
called a coach which luckily was passing; and turning
round to her tormentor, with great dignity said,
“ Though the situation, sir, in which I once was, may
in the eyes of the world, and in yours, authorise and
excuse your present insulting address, yet, when I tell
you that I am on the eve of marriage with a most
respectable man, I trust that you will feel the impropriety
of your conduct, and be convinced of the fruitlessness
and impertinence of the questions which you have put
to me.”
“If this be the case, madam," cried the gentleman,
“ I beg your pardon, and shall take my leave, wishing
you all possible happiness, and begging you to attribute
my impertinence wholly to my ignorance." So saying,
he bowed and left her, and Adeline was driven to her
lodgings.
« Now,” said Adeline, “ the die is cast ;-I have used
the sacred name of wife to shield me from insult; and
I am therefore pledged to assume it directly. Yes, HE
was right-I find I must have a legal protector.”
She found Berrendale rather alarmed at her long
absence; and, with a beating heart, she related her ad-
ventures to him : but when she said that Langley was
not willing to take the fee, he exclaimed, “ Very genteel
in him, indeed! I suppose you took him at his word ?”

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ Good Heavens!” replied Adeline, “ Do you think I
would deign to owe such a man a pecuniary obligation ?
-No, indeed; I threw it with proud indignation on the
floor."
“ What madness !” returned Berrendale : “ you had
much better have put it in your pocket.”
“ Mr. Berrendale,” cried Adeline gravely, and with a
look bordering on contempt, “ I trust that you are not
in earnest: for if these are your seutiments,—if this is
your delicacy, sir-
“ Say no more, dearest of women,” replied Berren-
dale pretending to laugh, alarmed at the seriousness
with which she spoke : “how could you for one moment
suppose me in earnest ? Insolent coxcomb!-I wish I
had been there."
“ I wish you had,” said Adeline, “ for then no one
would have dared to insult me:" and Berrendale, de-
lighted at this observation, listened to the rest of her
story with a spirit of indignant knight-errantry which he
never experienced before; and at the end of her narra-
tion he felt supremely happy; for Adeline assured him
that the next week she would make him her protector
for life and this assurance opened his heart so much,
that he vowed he would not condescend to claim of the
heir-at-law the pitiful sum which he might think proper
to withhold.
To be brief.—Adeline kept her word: and resolutely
struggling with her feelings, she became the next week
the wife of Berrendale. .
For the first six months the union promised well.
Adeline was so assiduous to anticipate her husband's
wishes, and contrived so many dainties for his table,
which she cooked with her own hands, that Berrendale,
declaring himself completely happy for the first time in
his life, had not a thought or a wish beyond his own fire-
side ; while Adeline, happy because she conferred happi-
ness, and proud of the name of wife, which she had

223
before despised, began to hope that her days would glide
on in humble tranquillity.
It was natural enough that Adeline should be desirous
of imparting this change in her situation to Mrs. Pem-
berton, whose esteem she was eager to recover, and
whose kind intentions towards her, at a moment when
she was incapable of appreciating them, Savanna had,
with great feeling, expatiated upon. She therefore wrote
to her according to the address which Mrs. Pemberton
had left for her, and received a most friendly letter in
return. In a short time Adeline had again an expecta-
tion of being a mother; and though she could not yet
entertain for her husband more than cold esteem, she
felt that as the father of her child he would insensibly
become more dear to her.
But Berrendale awoke from his dream of bliss, on
finding to what a large sum the bills for the half-year's
housekeeping amounted. Nor was he surprised without
reason. Adeline, more eager to gratify Berrendale's
palate than considerate as to the means, had forgotten
that she was no longer at the head of a liberal establish-
ment like her mother's, and had bought for the supply
of the table many expensive articles.
In consequence of this terrible discovery Berrendale
remonstrated very seriously with Adeline; who meekly
answered, “ My dear friend, good dinners cannot be
had without good ingredients, and good ingredients
cannot be had without money.”
“But, madam,” cried Berrendale, knitting his brows,
but not elevating his voice, for he was one of those soft-
speaking beings who in the sweetest tones possible can
say the most heart-wounding things, and give a mortal
stab to your self-love in the same gentle manner in which
they flatter it:-" there must have been great waste,
great mismanagement here, or these expenses could not
have been incurred.”
“ There may have been both,” returned Adeline, “ for

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
I have not been used to economize, but I will try to
learn ;-but I doubt, my dear Berrendale, you must
endeavour to be contented with plainer food ; for not all
the economy in the world can make rich gravies and
high sauces cheap things.”
“Oh! care and skill can do much,” said Berrendale ;
-" and I find a certain person deceived me very much
when he said you were a good manager.”
“ He only said,” replied Adeline sighing deeply,
“ that I was a good cook, and you yourself allow that ;
but I hope in time to please your appetite at less ex-
pense : as to myself, a little suffices me, and I care not
how plain that food is."
“ Still, I think I have seen you eat with a most ex-
cellent appetite,” said Berrendale, with a very significant
expression.
Adeline shocked at the manner more than the words,
replied in a faltering voice, “ As a proof of my being in
health, no doubt you rejoiced in the sight.”
“ Certainly; but less robust health would suit our
finances better."
Adeline looked up, wishing, though not expecting, to
see by his face that he was joking: but such serious
displeasure appeared on it, that the sordid selfishness of
his character was at once unveiled to her view ; and
clasping her hands in agony, she exclaimed, “Oh, Glen-
murray!” and ran into her own room.
It was the first time that she had pronounced his name
since the hour of his death, and now it was wrung from
her by a sensation of acute anguish ; no wonder, then,
that the feelings which followed completely overcame her,
and that Berrendale had undisputed and solitary posses-
sion of his supper.
But he, on his side, was deeply irritated. The “ Oh,
Glenmurray!” was capable of being interpreted two
ways :-either it showed how much she regretted Glen-
marray, and preferred him to his successor in spite of

225
the superior beauty of his person, of which he was very
vain ; or it reproached Glenmurray for having recom-
mended her to marry him. In either case it was an
unpardonable fault; and this unhappy conversation laid
the foundation of future discontent.
Adeline arose the next day dejected, pensive, and
resolved that her appetite should never again, if possible,
force a reproach from the lips of her husband. She
therefore took care that whatever she provided for the
table, besides the simplest fare, should be for Berrendale
alone; and she flattered herself that he would be shamed
into repentance of what he had observed, by seeing her
scrupulous self-denial :-she even resolved, if he pressed
her to partake of his dainties, that she would, to show
that she forgave him, accept what he offered.
But Berrendale gave her no such opportunity of showing
her generosity ;-busy in the gratification of his own
appetite, he never observed whether any other persons
ate or not, except when by eating they curtailed his
share of good things :—besides, to have an exclusive
dish to himself seemed to him quite natural and proper;
he had been a pampered child ; and, being no advocate
for the equality of the sexes, he thought it only a matter
of course that he should fare better than his wife.
Adeline, though more surprised and more shocked
than ever, could not help laughing internally, at her not
being able to put her projected generosity in practice ;
but her laughter and indignation soon yielding to con-
tempt, she ate her simple meal in silence : and while
her pampered husband sought to lose the fumes of indi-
gestion in sleep, she blessed God that temperance,
industry and health went hand-in-hand; and, retiring
to her own room, sat down to write, in order to increase,
if possible, her means of living, and consequently her
power of being generous to others.
But though Adeline resolved to forget, if possible, the
petty conduct of Berrendale,—the mulatto, who, from

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
the door's being open, had heard every word of the con-
versation which had so disturbed Adeline, neither could
nor would forget it; and though she did not vow eternal
hatred to her master, she felt herself very capable of in-
dulging it, and from that moment it was her resolution
to thwart him.
Whenever he was present, she was always urging
Adeline to eat some refreshments between meals, and
drink wine or lemonade, and tempting her weak appetite
with some pleasant but expensive sweetmeats. In vain
did Adeline refuse them ; sometimes they were bought,
sometimes only threatened to be bought; and once when
Adeline had accepted some, rather than mortify Savanna
by a refusal, and Berrendale, by his accent and expres-
sion, showed how much he grudged the supposed expense,
—the mulatto, snapping her fingers in his face, and
looking at him with an expression of indignant contempt;
exclaimed, “ I buy dem, and pay for dem wid mine
nown money; and my angel lady sall no be oblige to you!”
This was a declaration of war against Berrendale,
which Adeline heard with anger and sorrow, and her
husband with rage. In vain did Adeline promise that
she would seriously reprove Savanna (who had dis-
appeared) for her impertinence; Berrendale insisted on
her being discharged immediately; and nothing but
Adeline's assurances that she, for slender wages, did
more work than two other servants would do for enor-
mous ones, could pacify his displeasure : but at length
he was appeased. And as Berrendale, from a principle
of economy, resumed his old habit of dining out amongst
his friends, getting good dinners by that means without
paying for them, family expenses ceased to disturb the
quiet of their marriage ; and after she had been ten
months a wife Adeline gave birth to a daughter.
That moment, the moment when she heard her infant's
first cry, seem to repay her for all she had suffered ; every
feeling was lost in the maternal one; and she almost.

fancied that she loved, fondly loved, the father of her
child : but this idea vanished when she saw the languid
pleasure, if pleasure it could be called, with which
Berrendale congratulated her on her pain and danger
being passed, and received his child in his arms.
The mulatto was wild with joy : she almost stifled the
babe with her kisses, and talked even the next day of
sending for the tawny boy to come and see his new
mistress, and vow to her, as he had done to her mother,
eternal fealty and allegiance.
But Adeline saw on Berrendale's countenance a mixed
expression, -and he had mixed feelings. True, he
rejoiced in Adeline's safety ; but he said within himself,
“ Children are expensive things, and we may have a
large family ;” and, leaving the bedside as soon as he
could, he retired, to endeavour to lose in an afternoon's
nap his unpleasant reflections.
* How different,” thought Adeline, “ would have
been his feelings and his expressions of them at such
a time! Oh!" but the name of Glenmurray died away
on her lips; and hastily turning to gaze on her sleeping
babe, she tried to forget the disappointed emotions of
the wife in the gratified feelings of the mother.
Still Adeline, who had been used to attentions, could
not but feel the neglect of Berrendale. Even while she
kept her room he passed only a few hours in her society,
and dined out; and when she was well enough to have
aceompanied him on his visits, she found that he never
even wished her to go with him, though the friends
whom he visited were married; and he met, from his
own confessions, other ladies at their tables. She there-
fore began to suspect that Berrendale did not mean to
introduce her as his wife ; nay, she doubted whether he
avowed her to be such ; and at last she brought him to
own that, ashamed of having married what the world
must consider as a kept mistress, he resolved to keep
her still in the retirement to which she was habituated.

228
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
This was a severe disappointment indeed to Adeline :
she longed for the society of the amiable and accom-
plished of her own sex; and hoped that, as Mr. Berren-
dale's wife, that intercourse with her own sex might be
restored to her which she had forfeited as the mistress
of Glenmurray. Nor could she help reproaching Berren-
dale for the selfish ease and indifference with which he saw
her deprived of those social enjoyments which he daily
enjoyed himself, convinced as she was that he might, if he
chose, have introduced her at least to his intimate friends.
But she pleaded and reasoned in vain. Contented with
the access which he had to the tables of his friends, it
was of little importance to him that his wife ate her
humble meal alone. His habits of enjoyment had ever
been solitary: the school-boy, who had at school eaten
his tart and cake by stealth in a corner, that he might
not be asked to share them with another, had grown up
with the same dispositions to manhood: and as his
parents, though opulent, were vulgar in their manners
and low in their origin, he had never been taught those
graceful self-denials inculcated into the children of
polished life, which, though taught from factitious and
not real benevolence, have certainly a tendency, by long
habit, to make that benevolence real which at first was
only artificial.
Adeline had both sorts of kindness and affection, those
untaught of the heart, and those of education ;she was
polite from the situation into which the accident of birth
had thrown her, and also from the generous impulse of
her nature. To her, therefore, the uncultivated and
unblushing personnalite, as the French call it, of
Berrendale, was a source of constant wonder and distress*:
and often, very often did she feel the utmost surprise at
Berrendale's having appeared to Glenmurray a man likely
to make her happy. Often did she wonder how the
defects of Berrendale's character could have escaped his
penetrating eyes.

Adeline forgot that the faults of her husband were
such as could be known only by an intimate connexion,
and which cohabitation could alone call forth ;-faults,
the existence of which such a man as Glenmurray, who
never considered himself in any transaction whatever,
could not suppose possible ;-and which, though they
inflicted the most bitter pangs on Adeline, and gradually
untwisted the slender thread which had began to unite her
heart with Berrendale's, were of so slight a fabricas almost
to elude the touch, and of a nature to appear almost too
trivial to be mentioned in the narration of a biographer.
· But though it has been long said that trifles make the
sum of human things, inattention to trifles continues to
be the vice of every one; and many a conjugal union
which has never been assailed by the battery of crime,
has fallen a victim to the slowly undermining power of
petty quarrels, trivialunkindnesses and thoughtless neglect;
like the gallant officer, who, after escaping unhurt all
the rage of battle by land and water, tempest on sea and
earthquake on shore, returns perhaps to his native
country, and perishes by the power of a slow fever.
But Adeline, who, amidst all the chimæras of her
fancy and singularities of her opinions, had happily held
fast her religion, began at this moment to entertain a
belief that soothed in some measure the sorrows which it
could not cure. She fancied that all the sufferings she
underwent were trials which she was doomed to undergo,
as punishments for the crime she had committed in
leaving her mother and living with Glenmurray. She
therefore welcomed her afflictions, and lifted up her
meek eyes to her God and Saviour, in every hour of her
trials, with the look of tearful but grateful resignation.
. Meanwhile her child, whom, after her mother, she
called Editha, was nursed at her own bosom, and thrived
even beyond her expectations. Even Berrendale beheld
its growing beauty with delight, and the mulatto was
wild in praise of it; while Adeline, wholly taken up

all day in nursing and in working for it, and every even-
ing in writing stories and hymns to publish, which would,
she hoped, one day be useful to her own child as well as
to the children of others, soon ceased to regret her se-
clusion from society; and by the time Editha was a year
old she had learnt to bear with patience the disappoint-
ment she had experienced in Berrendale.
Soon after she became a mother she again wrote to
Mrs. Pemberton, as she longed to impart to her sympa-
thizing bosom those feelings of parental delight which
Berrendale could not understand, and the expression of
which he witnessed with contemptuous and chilling gravity.
To this letter she anticipated a most gratifying return;
but month after month passed away, and no letter from
Lisbon arrived. “ No doubt my letter miscarried,” said
Adeline to Savanna, " and I will write again :" but she
never had resolution to do so ; for she felt that her pros-
pects of conjugal happiness were obscured, and she
shrunk equally from the task of expressing the comfort
which she did not feel, or unveiling to another the errors
of her husbaud. The little regard, meanwhile, which
she had endeavoured to return for Berrendale soon
vanished, being unable to withstand a new violence offered
to it.
Editha was seized with the hooping-cough ; and as
Adeline had sold her last little volume to advantage,
Berrendale allowed her to take a lodging at a short dis-
tance from town, as change of air was good for the
complaint. She did so, and remained there two months.
At her return she had the mortification to find that her
husband, during her absence, had intrigued with the
servant of the house:-a circumstance of which she would
probably have remained ignorant, but for the indiscreet
affection of Savanna, who, in the first transports of her
indignation on discovering the connexion, had been un-
able to conceal from her mistress what drove her almost
frantic with indignation.

· But Adeline, though she felt disgust and aversion
swallowing up the few remaining sparks of regard for
Berrendale which she felt, had one great consolation
under this new calamity.—Berrendale had not been the
choice of her heart : “But, thank Heaven! I never
loved this man,” escaped her lips as she ran into her
own room; and pressing her child to her bosom, she
shed on its unconscious cheeks the tears which resent-
ment and a deep sense of injury wrung from her.—“Oh!
had I loved him," she exclaimed, “ this blow would
have been mortal!”
She, however, found herself in one respect the better
for Berrendale's guilt. Conscious that the mulatto was
aware of what had passed, and afraid lest she should
have mentioned her discovery to Adeline, Berrendale
endeavoured to make amends for his infidelity by attention
such as he had never shown her since the first weeks of
his marriage ; and had she not been aware of the motive,
the change in his behaviour would have re-awakened her
tenderness. However, it claimed at least complaisance
and gentleness from her while it lasted: which was not
long; for Berrendale, fancying from the apparent tran-
quillity of Adeline (the result of indifference, not
ignorance,) that she was not informed of his fault, and
that the mulatto was too prudent to betray him, began
to relapse into his old habits; and one day, forgetting
his assumed liberality, he ventured, when alone with
Savanna, who was airing one of Editha's caps, to ex-
patiate on the needless extravagance of his wife in trim-
ming her child's caps with lace.
This was enough to rouse the quick feelings of the
mulatto, and she poured forth all her long concealed
wrath in a torrent of broken English, but plain enough
to be well understood.-" You man !” she cried at last,
“ you will kill her ; she pine at your no kindness ;-and
if she die, mind me, man! never you marry aden.-You
marry, forsoot ! you marry a lady! true bred lady like

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
mine! No, man !—You best get a cheap miss from de
street and be content "
As she said this, and in an accent so provoking that
Berrendale was pale and speechless with rage, Adeline
entered the room; and Savanna, self-condemned already
for what she had uttered, was terrified when Adeline, in
a tone of voice unusually severe, said, “ Leave the room ;
you have offended me past forgiveness."
These words, in a great measure, softened the angry
feelings of Berrendale, as they proved that Adeline re-
sented the insult offered to him as deeply as he could
wish ; and with some calmness he exclaimed, “ Then I
conclude, Mrs. Berrendale, that you will have no ob-
jection to discharge your mulatto directly ?”
This conclusion, though a very natural one, was both
a shock and a surprise to Adeline; nor could she at first
reply.
"You are silent, madam,” said Berrendale ; “what
is your answer? Yes, or No ?”
“Yes,-yes,-certainly,” faltered out Adeline ; "she
-she ought to go-I mean that she has used very im-
proper language to you.”
«And, therefore, a wife who resents as she ought to
do, injuries offered to her husband, cannot hesitate for a
moment to discharge her.”
“True, very true in some measure,” replied Adeline;
“but ”
“But what?” demanded Berrendale. “O Berren-
dale !” cried Adeline, bursting into an agony of frantic
sorrow, “if she leaves me, what will become of me! I
shall lose the only person now in the world, perhaps,
who loves me with sincere and faithful affection !
Berrendale was wholly unprepared for an appeal like
this ; and, speechless from surprise not unmixed with
confusion, staggered into the next chair. He was con-
scious, indeed, that his fidelity to his wife had not been
proof against a few weeks' absence; but then, being,

233
like most men, not over delicate in his ideas on such
subjects, as soon as Adeline returned he had given up
the connexion which he had formed, and therefore he
thought she had not much reason to complain. In
all other respects he was sure that he was an exemplary
husband, and she had no just grounds for doubting his
affection. He was sure that she had no reason to ac-
cuse him of unkindness; and, unless she wished him to
be always tied to her apron-string, he was certain he had
never omitted to pay her all proper attention.
Alas! he felt not the many wounds he had inflicted by
" The word whose meaning kills; yet, told,
The speaker wonders that you thought it cold."
and he had yet to learn, that in order to excite or testify
affection, it is necessary to seem to derive exclusive en-
joyment from the society of the object avowed to be
beloved, and to seek its gratification in preference to
one's own, even in the most trivial things. He knew
not that opportunities of conferring large benefits, like
bank-bills for £1,000, rarely come into use ; but little
attentions, friendly participations and kindnesses, are
wanted daily, and like small change, are necessary to
carry on the business of life and happiness. .
· A minute more perhaps, elapsed, before Berrendale
recovered himself sufficiently to speak : and the silence
was made still more awful to Adeline, by her hearing
from the adjoining room the sobs of the mulatto. At
length, “I cannot find words to express my surprise at
what you have just uttered,” exclaimed Berrendale.
“My conscience does not reproach me with deserving
the reproof it contained.”
.“ Indeed !” replied Adeline, fixing her penetrating
eyes on his, which shrunk downcast and abashed from
her gaze. Adeline saw her advantage, and pursued it.
“Mr. Berrendale," continued she, “it is indeed true,
that the mulatto has offended both of us; for in offend-

ing you she has offended me; but, have you committed
no fault, nothing for me to forgive ? I know that you
are too great a lover of truth, too honourable a man, to
declare that you have not deserved the just anger of your
wife: but you know that I have never reproached you,
nor should you ever have been aware that I was privy to
the distressing circumstance to which I allude, but for
what has just passed : and, now, do but forgive the poor
mulatto, who sinned only from regard for me, and from
supposed slight offered to her mistress, and I will not
only assure you of my forgiveness, but, from this mo-
ment, will strenuously endeavour to blot from my remem-
brance every trace of what has passed,”
Berrendale, conscious and self-condemned, scarcely
know what to answer ; but, thinking that it was better
to accept Adeline's offer even on her own conditions, he
said, that if Savanna would make a proper apology, and
Adeline would convince her that she was seriously dis-
pleased with her, he would allow her to stay; and Adeline
having promised every thing which he asked, peace was
again restored.
“But what can you mean, Adeline,” said Berrendale,
“by doubting my affection ? I think I gave a sufficient
proof of that, when, disregarding the opinion of the
world, I married you, though you had been the mistress
of another : and I really think that, by accusing me of
unkindness, you make me a very ungrateful return."
To this indelicate and unfeeling remark Adeline vainly
endeavoured to reply; but, starting from her chair, she
paced the room in violent agitation. “Answer me,”
continued Berrendale, “name one instance in which I
have been unkind to you.” Adeline suddenly stopped,
and, looking steadfastly at him, smiled with a sort of
contemptuous pity, and was on the point of saying, “Is
not what you have now said an instance of unkindness ?”
But she saw that the same want of delicacy, and of that
fine moral tact which led him to commit this and similar

235
assaults on her feelings, made him unconscious of the
violence which he offered.
Finding, therefore, that he could not understand her
causes of complaint, even if it were possible for her to
define them, she replied, “Well, perhaps I was too hasty,
and in a degree unjust : so let us drop the subject ; and,
indeed, my dear Berrendale, you must bear with my
weakness: remember, I have always been a spoiled child.”
Here the image of Glenmurray and that of home, the
home which she once knew, the home of her childhood,
and of her earliest youth, pressed on her recollection.
She thought of her mother, of the indulgencies which she
had once known, of the advantages, of opulence, the
value of which she had never felt till deprived of them ;
and, struck with the comparative forlornness of her situa-
tion-united for life to a being whose sluggish sensi-
bilities could not understand, and consequently not
soothe, the quick feelings and jealous susceptibility of her
nature-she could hardly forbear falling at the feet of
her husband, and conjuring him to behave, at least, with
forbearance to her, and to speak and look at her with
kindness.
She did stretch out her hand to him with a look of
mournful entreaty, which, though not understood by
Berrendale, was not lost upon him entirely. He thought
it was a confession of her weakness and his superiority ;
and, flattered by the thought into unusual softness, he
caught her fondly to his bosom, and gave up an engage-
ment to sup at an oyster club, in order to spend the
evening tête-à-tête with his wife. Nay, he allowed the
little Editha to remain in the room for a whole hour,
though she cried when he attempted to take her in his
arms, and, observing that it was a cold evening, allowed
Adeline her due share of the fire-side.
These circumstances, trivial as they were, had more
than their due effect on Adeline, whose heart was more
alive to kindness than unkindness; and those paltry at-

tentions of which happy wives would not have been con-
scious, where to her a source of unfeigned pleasure-
As sailors are grateful, after a voyage unexpectedly long,
for the muddy water which at their first embarking they
would have turned from with disgust.
That very night Adeline remonstrated with the mulatto
on the impropriety of her conduct ; and, having con-
vinced her that in insulting her husband she failed in
respect to her, Savanna was prevailed upon the next
morning to ask pardon of Berrendale ; and, out of love
for her mistress, she took care in future to do nothing
that required forgiveness.
As Adeline's way of life admitted of but little variety,
Berrendale having persisted in not introducing her to
his friends, on the plea of not being rich enough to re-
ceive company in return, I shall pass over in silence
what occurred to her till Editha was two years old; pre-
mising that a series of little injuries on the part of Ber-
rendale, and a quick resentment of them on the part of
Adeline, which not even her habitual good humour could
prevent, had, during that time, nearly eradicated every
trace of love for each other from their hearts.
One evening Adeline as usual, in the absence of her
husband, undressed Editha by the parlour fire, and, play-
ing with the laughing child, was enjoying the rapturous
praises which Savanna put forth of its growing beauty;
while the tawny boy, who had spent the day with them,
built houses with cards on the table, which Editha threw
down as soon as they were built, and he with good-
humoured perseverance raised up again.
Adeline, alive only to the maternal feeling, at this mo-
ment had forgotten all her cares ; she saw nothing but
the happy group around her, and her countenance wore
the expression of recovered serenity.
At this moment a loud knock was heard at the door,
and Adeline, starting up, exclaimed, “It is my husband's
knock !”


## p. 237 (#253) ############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
237
“O! no :-he never come so soon,” replied the mu-
latto running to the door ; but she was mistaken-it was
Berrendale : and Adeline, hearing his voice, began in-
stantly to snatch up Editha's clothes, and to knock down
the tawny boy's newly-raised edifice : but order was not
restored when Berrendale entered ; and, with a look and
tone of impatience, he said, “So! fine confusion indeed!
Here's a fire-side to come to! Pretty amusement too, for
a literary lady-building houses of cards! Shame on your
extravagance, Mrs. Berrendale, to let that beat spoil
cards in that way!
The sunshine of Adeline's countenance on hearing this
Vanished : to be sure, she was accustomed to such
speeches ; but the moment before she had felt happy,
for the first time, for years. She, however, replied not;
but hurrying Editha to bed, ordering the reluctant tawny
boy into the kitchen, and setting Berrendale's chair, as
usual, in the warmest place, she ventured in a faint voice
to ask, what had brought him home so early.
- “ More early than welcome,” replied Berrendale, “if
I may judge from the bustle I have occasioned.”
" It is very true," replied Adeline, “ that, had I ex-
pected you, I should have been better prepared for your
reception; and then you, perhaps, would have spoken
more kindly to me.”
“ Theremthere you go again.-If I say but a word
to you, then I am called unkind, though I never speak
without just provocation : and, I declare, I came home
in the best humour possible, to tell you what may turn
out of great benefit to us both:--but when a man has an
uncomfortable home to come to, it is enough to put him
out of humour.”
· The mulatto, who was staying to gather up the cards
which had fallen, turned herself round on hearing this,
and exclaimed, “ Home was very comfortable till you
come ;” and then with a look of the most angry con-
tempt she left the room, and threw the door to with great
violence.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ But what is this good news, my dear?” said Ade-
line, eager to turn Berrendale's attention from Savanna's
insolent reply.
“ I have received a letter,” he replied, “ which, by
the by, I ought to have had some weeks ago, from my
father-in-law in Jamaica, authorising me to draw on his
banker for £900, and inviting me to come over to him ;
as he feels himself declining, and wishes to give me the
care of his estate, and of my son, to whom all his fortune
will descend : and of whose interest, he properly thinks,
no one can be so likely to take good care as his own
father.”
“And do you mean that I and Editha should go with
you ?” said Adeline turning pale.
- No, to be sure not,” eagerly replied Berrendale ;
“ I must first see how the land lies. But if I gomas
the old man no doubt will make a handsome settlement
on me-I shall be able to remit to you a very respectable
annuity."
Adeline's heart, spite of herself, bounded with joy at
this discovery ; but she had resolution to add,--and if
duplicity can ever be pardonable, this was,—“ So then
the good news which you had to impart to me was, that
we were going to be separated !” But as she said this,
the consciousness that she was artfully trying to impress
Berrendale with an idea of her feeling a sorrow which was
foreign to her heart, overcame her; and affected also at
being under the necessity of rejoicing at the departure of
that being who ought to be the source of her comfort,
she vainly struggled to regain composure, and burst into
an agony of tears.
But her consternation cannot be expressed, when she
found that Berrendale imputed her tears to tender anguish
at the idea of parting with him : and when, his vanity
being delighted by this homage to his attractions, he felt
all his fondness for her revive, and, overwhelming her
with caresses, he declared that he would reject the offer

239
entirely if by accepting it he should give her a moment's
uneasiness ; Adeline, shocked at his error, yet not daring
to set him right, could only weep on his shoulder in
silence : but, in order to make real the distress which he
only fancied so, she enumerated to herself all the diseases
incident to the climate, and the danger of the voyage.
Still the idea of Berrendale's departure was so full of
comfort to her, that, though her tears continued to flow,
they flowed not for his approaching absence. At length,
ashamed of fortifying him in so gross an error, she made
an effort to regain her calmness, and found words to
assure him, that she would no longer give way to such
unpardonable weakness, as she could assure him that she
wished his acceptance of his father-in-law's offer; and
had no desire to oppose a scheme so just and so profitable.
But Berrendale, to whose vanity she had never before
offered such a tribute as her tears seemed to be imputed
these assurances to disinterested love and female delicacy,
afraid to own the fondness which it felt; and the rest
of the evening was spent in professions of love on his
part, which, on Adeline's, called forth at least some
grateful and kind expressions in return.
Still, however, she persisted in urging Berrendale to
go to Jamaica : but, at the same time, she earnestly
begged him to remember, that temperance could alone
preserve his health in such a climate :-" or the use of
pepper in great quantities,” replied he,“ to counteract
the effects of good living?”—and Adeline, though con-
vinced temperance was the best preservation, was forced
to give up the point, especially as Berrendale began to
enumerate the number of delicious things for the table
which Jamaica afforded.
To be brief: Berrendale, after taking a most
affectionate leave of his wife and child, a leave which
almost made the mulatto his friend, and promising to
allow them £200, a-year till he should be able to send
over for them, set sail for Jamaica; while Adeline, the

night of his departure, endeavoured, by conjuring up all
the horrors of a tempest at sea on his passage, and of a
hurricane and an earthquake on shore when he arrived,
to force herself to feel such sorrow as the tenderness
which he had expressed at the moment of parting seemed
to make it her duty to feel.
But morning came, and with it a feeling of liberty and
independence so delightful, that she no longer tried to
grieve on speculation as it were ; but giving up her
whole soul to the joys of maternal fondness, she looked
forward with pious gratitude to days of tranquil repose,
save when she thought with bitter regret of the obdurate
anger of her mother, and with tender regret of the lost
and ever lamented Glenmurray.
Berrendale had been arrived at Jamaica some months,
when Adeline observed a most alarming change in
Savanna. She became thin, her appetite entirely failed,
and she looked the image of despondence. In vain did
Adeline ask the reason of a change so apparent : the
only answer she could obtain was, “ Me better soon;"
and, continuing every day to give this answer, she in a
short time became so languid as to be obliged to lie down
half the day.
Adeline then found that it was necessary to be more
serious in her interrogatories; but the mulatto at first
only answered, “No, me die, but me never break my
duty vow to you: no, me die, but never leave you.”
These words implying a wish to leave her, with a
resolution not to do so how much soever it might cost
her, alarmed in a moment the ever disinterested sensi-
bility of Adeline; and she at length wrung from her a
confession that her dear William, who was gone to
Jamaica as a servant to, a gentleman, was, she was
credibly informed, very ill and like to die.
“ You therefore wish to go and nurse him, I suppose,
Savanna?”
“Oh! me no wish ; me only tink dat me like to go

to Jamaica, see if be true dat he be so bad ; and if he
die, I den return and die wid you."
“Live with me, you mean, Savanna; for, indeed, I
cannot spare you. Remember, you have given me a
right to claim your life as mine; nor can I allow you to
throw away my property in fruitless lamentations, and
the indolent indulgence of regret. You shall go to
Jamaica, Savanna: Heaven forbid that I should keep a
wife from her duty! You shall see and try to recover
William if he be really ill,” (Savanna here threw herself
on Adeline's neck,) " and then you shall return to me,
who will either warmly share in your satisfaction or
fondly sooth your distress.”
" Den you do love poor Savanna ?”
“ Love you! Indeed I do, next to my child, and,
and my mother,” replied Adeline, her voice faltering.
“ Name not dat woman," cried Savanna hastily;
“ me will never see, never speak to her even in heaven.”
“ Savanna, remember, she is my mother.”
“Yes, and Mr. Berrendale be your husban; and yet,
who dat love you can love dem ?”
“ Savanna," replied Adeline, “ these proofs of your
regard, though reprehensible, are not likely to reconcile
me to your departure; and I already feel that in losing
you— ” Here she paused, unable to proceed.
“ Den me no go-me no go :--yet, dearest lady, you
have love yourself.”
“ Aye, Savanna, and can feel for you : so say no
more. The only difficulty will be to raise money enough
to pay for your passage, and expenses while there."
“Oh! me once nurse the captain's wife who now
going to Jamaica, and she love me very much; and he
tell me yesterday that he let me go for nothing, because
I am good nurse to his wife, if me wish to see
William.”
“ Enough,” replied Adeline: “ then all I have to do
is to provide you with money for your maintenance when

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
you arrive; and I have no doubt but that what I cannot
supply the tawny boy's generous patroness will.”
Adeline was not mistaken. Savanna obtained from
her son's benefactress a sum equal to her wants; and
almost instantly restored to her wonted health, by her
mind's being lightened of the load which oppressed it,
she took her passage on board her friend's vessel, and
set sail for Jamaica, carrying with her letters from Ade-
line to Berrendale; while Adeline felt the want of
Savanna in various ways, so forcibly, that not even
Editha could, for a time at least, console her for her loss.
It had been so grateful to her feelings to meet every day
the eyes of one being fixed with never-varying affection
on hers, that, when she beheld those eyes no longer, she
felt alone in the universe,—nor had she a single female
friend to whom she could turn for relief or consolation.
Mrs. Beauclerc, to whose society she had expected to
be restored by her marriage, had been forced to give up
all intercourse with her, in compliance with the peremp-
tory wishes of a rich old maid, from whom her children
had great expectations, and who threatened to leave her
fortune away from them, if Mrs. Beauclerc persisted
in corresponding with a woman so bad in principle, and
so wicked in practice, as Adeline appeared to her to be.
But, at length, from a mother's employments, from
writing, and, above all, from the idea that by suffering
she was making some atonement for her past sins, she
derived consolation, and became resigned to every evil that
had befallen, and to every evil that might still befall her.
Perhaps she did not consider as an evil what now took
place: increasing coldness in the letters of Berrendale,
till he said openly at last, that as they were, he was
forced to confess, far from happy together, and as the
air of Jamaica agreed with him, and as he was resolved
to stay there, he thought she had better remain in
England, and he would remit her as much money occa-
sionally as his circumstances would admit of.


## p. 243 (#259) ############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
243
But she thought this a greater evil than it at first
appeared ; when an agent of Berrendale's father-in-law
in England, and a friend of Berrendale himself, called
on her, pretending that he came to inquire concerning
her health, and raised in her mind suspicions of a very
painful nature.
After the usual compliments :-“I find, madam,"
said Mr. Drury, “ that our friend is very much admired
by the ladies in Jamaica.”
“ I am glad to hear it, sir,” coolly answered Adeline.
“ Well, that's kind and generous now,” replied Drury,
" and very disinterested.”
“ I see no virtue, sir, in my rejoicing of what must
make Mr. Berrendale’s abode in Jamaica pleasant to him.”
“ May be so ; but most women, I believe would be
apt to be jealous on the occasion.”
“ But it has been the study of my life, sir, to endeavour
to consider my own interest, when it comes in competi-
tion with another's, as little as possible ;—I doubt I
have not always succeeded in my endeavours : but on
this occasion I am certain that I have expressed no senti-
ment which I do not feel.”
« Then, madam, if my friend should have an oppor-
tunity, as indeed I believe he has, of forming a most
agreeable and advantageous marriage, you would not try
to prevent it?”
as Good heavens! sir,” replied Adeline ; “ What can
you mean? Mr. Berrendale form an advantageous mar-
riage when he is already married to me?”
“Married to you, ma'am !” answered Mr. Drury with
a look of incredulity. “Excuse me, but I know that
such marriages as yours may be easily dissolved.”.
At first Adeline was startled at this assertion ; but
recollecting that it was impossible any form or ceremony
should have been wanting at the marriage, she recovered
* herself, and demanded, with an air of severity, what Mr.
Drury meant by so alarming and ill-founded a speech.”

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“My meaning, ma'am,” replied he, “must be pretty
evident to you: I mean that I do not look upon you,
though you bear Mr. Berrendale's name, to be his lawful
wife; but that you live with him on the same terms on
which you lived with Mr. Glenmurray.”
“ And on what, sir, could you build such an erroneous
supposition ?”
"On Mr. Berrendale's own words, madam ; who
always spoke of his connexion with you, as of a con-
nexion which he had formed in compliance with love and
in defiance of prudence.”
" And is it possible that he could be such a villain ?”
exclaimed Adeline. « Oh my child! and does thy father
brand thee with the stain of illegitimacy ?-But, sir,
whatever appellation Mr. Berrendale might choose to
give his union with me to his friends in England, I am
sure he will not dare to incur the penalty attendant on a
man's marrying one wife while he has another living ;
for, that I am his wife, I can bring pretty sufficient
evidence to prove.” .!
“ Indeed, madam! You can produce a witness of the
ceremony, then, I presume?”
"No, sir; the woman who attended me to the altar,
and the clergyman who married us, are dead; and the
only witness is a child now only ten years old.”
" That is unfortunate!” (with a look of incredulity)
“but, no doubt, when you hear that Mr. Berrendale is
married to a West Indian heiress, you will come forward
with incontrovertible proofs of your prior claims; and
if you do that, madam, you may command my good
offices :—but, till then, I humbly take my leave.”-
Saying this, with a very visible sneer on his countenance
he departed, leaving Adeline in a state of distress-the
more painful to endure from her having none to participate
in it,- no one to whom she could impart the cause of it.
That Mr. Drury did not speak of the possible marriage
of Berrendale from mere conjecture, was very apparent;

245
243
and Adeline resolved not to delay writing to her husband
immediately, to inform him of what had passed, and put
before his eyes, in the strongest possible manner, the
guilt of what he was about to do; and also the utter
impossibility of its being successful guilt, as she was re-
solved to assert her claims for the sake of her child, if
not for her own. This letter she concluded, and with
truth too, with protestations of believing all Mr. Drury
said to be false : for, indeed, the more she considered
Berrendale's character, the more she was convinced that,
however selfish and defective his disposition might be,
it was more likely Mr. Drury should be mistaken, than
Berrendale be a villain.
But, where a man's conduct is not founded on virtu-
ous motives and immutable principles, he may not err
while temptation is absent; but once expose him to her
presence, and he is capable of falling into the very vices
the most abhorrent to his nature : and though Adeline
knew it not, such a man was Berrendale.
Adeline, having relieved her mind by this appeal to
her husband, and being assured that Berrendale could
not be married before her letter could reach him, as it
was impossible that he should dare to marry while the

ments again, and had recovered her tranquillity, when
an answer to her letter arrived ; and Adeline, being cer-
tain that the letter itself would be a proof of the mar-
riage, had resolved to show it, in justification of her
claims, to Mr. Drury.
What then must have been her surprise, to find it ex-
actly such a letter as. would be evidence against a mar-
riage between her and Berrendale having ever taken
place! He thanked her for the expressions of fond re-
gret which her letter contained, and for the many happy
hours which he owed to her society ; but hoped that, as
Fate had now separated their destinies, she could be as.

happy without him as she had been with him ; and
assuring her that he should, according to his promise,
regularly remit her £150 a-year if possible, but that he
could at present only inclose a draft for £50.
Adeline was absolutely stupified with horror at reading
this apparent confirmation of the villany of her husband
and the father of her child ; but roused to indignant ex-
ertion by the sense of Berrendale's baseness, and of what
she owed her daughter, she resolved to take counsel's
opinion in what manner she should proceed to prove her
marriage, as soon as she was assured that Berrendale's
(which she had no doubt was fixed upon) should have
taken place; and this intelligence she received a short
time after from the mulatto herself, who, worn out with
sorrow, sickness, and hardship, one day tottered into the
house, seeming as if she indeed only returned to die
with her mistress.
At first the joy of seeing Savanna restored to her
swallowed up every other feeling ; but tender apprehen-
sion for the poor creature's health soon took possession
of her mind, and Adeline drew from her a narrative,
which exhibited Berrendale to her eyes as capable of
most atrocious actions.
CHAPTER XIX.
It is very certain that when Berrendale left England,
though he meant to conceal his marriage entirely, he had
not even the slightest wish to contract another; and had
any one told him that he was capable of such wicked con-
duct, he would have answered, like Hazael, “ Is thy
servant a dog that he should do this thing ?” But he was
then unassailed by temptations :-and habituated as he
was to selfish-indulgence, it was impossible that to strong
temptation he should not fall an immediate victim.

247
This strong temptation assailed him soon after his
arrival, in the person of a very lovely and rich widow, a
relation of his first wife, who, having no children of her
own, had long been very fond of his child, then a very
fine boy, and with great readiness transferred to the father
the affection which she bore the son. For some time
conscience and Adeline stood their ground against this
new mistress and her immense property; but at length,
being pressed by his father-in-law, who wished the match,
to assign a sufficient reason for his coldness to so fine a
woman, and not daring to give the true one, he returned
the lady's fondness: and though he had not yet courage
enough to name the marriage day, it was known that it
would some time or other take place.
But all his scruples soon yielded to the dominion
which the attractions of the lady, who was well versed
in the arts of seduction, obtained over his senses, and to
the strong power which the sight of the splendour in
which she lived, acquired over his avarice; when, just
as every thing was on the point of being concluded, the
poor mulatto, who had found her husband dead, arrived
almost broken-hearted at the place of Berrendale's abode,
and delivered to him letters from Adeline.
Terrified and confounded at her presence, he received
her with such evident marks of guilty confusion in his
face, that Savanna's apprehensive and suspicious attach-
ment to her mistress took the alarm; and, as she had
seen a very fine woman leave the room as she entered,
she, on pretence of leaving Berrendale alone to read his
letters, repaired to the servants' apartments, where she
learnt the intended marriage. Immediately forgetting
her own distresses in those of Adeline, she returned to
Berrendale, not with the languid, mournful pace with
which she had first entered, but with the firm, impe-
tuous and intrepid step of conscious integrity going to
confound vice in the moment of its triumph. -
Berrendale read his doom, the moment he beheld her,

in her dark and fiery eye, and awaited in trembling
silence the torrent of reproaches that trembled on her lip.
But I shall not repeat what passed. Suffice that Ber-
rendale pretended to be moved by what she said, and
promised to break off the marriage, -only exacting from
Savanna, in return, a promise of not imparting to the
servants, or to any one, that he had a wife in England.
In the meanwhile he commended her most affection-
ately to the care of the steward; and confessing to his
intended bride that he had a mistress in England, who
had sent the mulatto over to prevent the match if pos-
sible, by persuading her he was already married, he con-
jured her to consent to a private marriage; and to prevent
some dreadful scene, occasioned by the revenge of dis-
appointed passion, should his mistress, as she had threat-
ened, come over in person, he entreated her to let every
splendid preparation for their nuptials be laid aside, in
order to deceive Savanna, and induce her to return
quietly to England.
The credulous woman, too much in love to believe
what she did not wish, consented to all he proposed :
but Berrendale, still fearful of the watchful jealousy of
Savanna, contrived to find out the master to whom she
belonged before she had escaped, early in life, with her
first husband to England ; and as she had never been
made free, as soon as he arrived, he, on a summons from
Berrendale, seized her as his property; and poor Savanna,
in spite of her cries and struggles, was conveyed some
miles up the country.
At length, however, she found means to escape to the
coast ; and, having discovered an old acquaintance in an
English sailor on board a vessel then ready to sail, and
who had great influence with the captain, she was by
him concealed on board, with the approbation of the
commander, and was on her way to England before Ber-
rendale was informed of her escape.
I will not endeavour to describe Adeline's feelings on

hearing this narration, and on finding also that Savanna
before she left the island had been assured that Berren-
dale was really married, though privately, but that the
marriage could not long be attempted to be concealed,
as the lady even before it took place was likely to become
a mother; and, that as a large estate depended on her
giving birth to a son, the event of her confinement was .
looked for with great anxiety.
Still, in the midst of her distress, a sudden thought
struck Adeline, which converted her anger into joy, and
her sorrow into exultation. “ Yes, my mother may now
forgive me without violating any part of her oath,” she
exclaimed.-" I am now forsaken, despised and dis-
graced !”—and instantly she wrote to Mrs. Mowbray a
letter calculated to call forth all her sympathy and af-
fection. Then, with a mind relieved beyond expression,
she sat down to deliberate in what manner she should
act to do herself justice as a wife and a mother, cruelly
aggrieved in both these intimate relations. Nor could
she persuade herself that she should act properly by her
child, if she did not proceed vigorously to prove her-
self Berrendale’s wife, and substantiate Editha’s claim
to his property; and as Mr. Langley was, she knew, a
very great lawyer, she resolved, in spite of his improper
conduct to her, to apply to him again.
Indeed she could not divest herself of a wish to let
him know that she was become a wife, and no longer
liable to be treated with that freedom with which, as a
mistress, he had thought himself at liberty to address
her. However, she wished that she had not been obliged
to go to him alone ; but, as the mulatto was in too weak
a state of health to allow of her going out, and she could
not speak of business like hers before any one else, she
was forced to proceed unaccompanied to the Temple ;
and on the evening of the day after Savanna's return,
she with a beating heart, repaired once more to Mr.
Langley's chambers.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; or,
Luckily, however, she met the tawny boy on her way,
and took him for her escort. “ Tell your master,” said
she to the servant, “ that Mrs. Berrendale wishes to
speak to him :” and in a few minutes she was introduced.
“ Mrs. Berrendale !” cried Langley with a sarcastic
smile; “ pray be seated, madam! I hope Mr. Berren-
dale is well.”
“ He is in Jamaica, sir,” replied Adeline.
“Indeed !” returned Langley, “May I presume so
far as to ask,-hem, hem,—whether your visit to me be
merely of a professional nature?”
“ Certainly, sir,” replied Adeline : “ of what other
nature should it be?”.
Langley replied to this only by a significant smile.
At this moment the tawny boy asked leave to walk in
the temple gardens; and Adeline, though reluctantly,
granted his request.
“Oh! à propos, John” cried Langley to the servant,
“ let Mrs. Montgomery know that her friend Miss
Mowbray, Mrs. Berrendale I mean, is here-she is
walking in the garden.”
“ My friend Mrs. Montgomery, sir! I have no friend
of that name.”
“No, my sweet soul? You may not know her by that
name; but names change, you know. You, for instance,
are Mrs. Berrendale now, but when I see you again you
may be Mrs. Somebody else.”
• Never, sir,” cried Adeline indignantly; " but,
though I do not exactly understand your meaning, I
feel as if you meant to insult me, and therefore "
“Oh no-sit down again, my angel; you are mis-
taken, and so apt to fly off in a tangent! But-50-
that wonderfully handsome man, Berrendale is off-heh?
Your friend and mine, heh! pretty one!”
“If, sir, Mr. Berrendale ever considered you as his
friend, it is very strange that you should presume to in-
sult his wife.”

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
251
“ Madam,” replied Langley with a most provoking
sneer, “ Mr. Berrendale's wife shall always be treated
by me with proper respect.”
“ Gracious Heaven!” cried Adeline, clasping her
hands and looking upwards with tearful eyes, “ when
shall my persecutions cease! and how much greater must
my offences be than even my remorse paints them, when
their consequences still torment me so long after the
crime which occasioned them has ceased to exist! But
it is Thy will, and I will submit even to indignity with
patience.”
There was a touching solemnity in this appeal to
Heaven, an expression of truth, which it was so impos-
sible for art to imitate, that Langley felt in a moment
the injustice of which he had been guilty, and an apology
was on his lips, when the door opened, and a lady rouged
like a French countess of the ancien régime, her hair
covered with a profusion of brown powder, and dressed
in the height of the fashion, ambled into the room ; and
saying, “How d’ye do, Miss Mowbray ?” threw herself
carelessly on the sofa, to the astonishment of Adeline,
who did not recollect her, and to the confusion of
Langley, who now, impressed with involuntary respect
for Adeline, repented of having exposed her to the scene
that awaited her : but to prevent it was impossible ; he was
formed to be a slave of woman, and had not courage to
protect another from the insolence to which he tamely
yielded himself.
Adeline at first did not answer this soi-disant acquaint-
ance of hers; but, in looking at her more attentively,
she exclaimed, “ What do I see? Is it possible that
this can be Mary Warner !”
“ Yes, it is, my dear, indeed,” replied she with a
loud laugh, “Mary Warner, alias Mrs. Montgomery;
as you, you know, are Miss Mowbray, alias Mrs.
Berrendale.”
Adeline, incapable of speaking, only gazed at her in

silences bime sit down amon
silence, but with “a countenance more in sorrow than
in anger.'
“ But, come sit down, my dear,” cried Mary; “ no
ceremony, you know, among friends and equals, you
know; and you and I have been mighty familiar, you
know, before now. The last time we met you called me
woman, you know—yes, “woman!' says you—and I
have not forgotten it, I assure you,” she added with a
sort of loud hysterical laugh, and a look of the most
determined malice.
“ Come, come, my dear Montgomery,” said Langley,
“ you must forget and forgive ;—I dare say Miss Mow-
bray, that is to say Mrs. Berrendale, did not mean—".
“What should you know about the matter, Lang. ?"
replied Mary; “I wish you would mind your own
business, and let me talk to my dumb friend here.-
Well, I suppose you are quite surprised to see how smart
I am !-seeing as how I once overhard you say to Glen-
thingymy, “How very plain Mary is !' though, to be
sure, it was never a barrel the better herring, and
'twas the kettle in my mind calling the pot-Heh,
Lang. ?”
Here was the clue to the inveterate dislike which this
unhappy girl had conceived against Adeline. So true is
it that little wounds inflicted on the self-love are never
forgotten or forgiven, and that it is safer to censure the
morals of acquaintances than to ridicule them on their
dress, or laugh at a defect in their person. Adeline, in-
deed, did not mean that her observation should be over-
heard by the object of it,—still she was hated : but many
persons make mortifying remarks purposely, and yet
wonder that they have enemies!
Motionless and almost lifeless Adeline continued to
stand and to listen, and Mary went on
“Well, but I thank you for one thing. You taught
me that marriage was all nonsense, you know; and so,
thought I, Miss Mowbray is a learned lady, she must

253
know best, and so I followed your example—that's all,
you know.”
This dreadful information roused the feelings of Ade-
line even to phrensy, and with a shriek of anguish she
seized her hand, and conjured her by all her hopes of
mercy to retract what she had said, and not to let her
depart with the horrible consciousness of having been
the means of plunging a fellow-being into vice and
infamy.
A loud unfeeling laugh, and an exclamation of “ The
woman is mad,” was all the answer to this.
“ This then is the completion of my sufferings,” cried
Adeline," this only was wanted to complete the misery
of my remorse.”
“ This is too much,” exclaimed Langley. “ Mary,
you know very well that—”.
“ Hold your tongue, Lang.; you know nothing about
the matter: it is all nothing, but that Miss Mowbray,
like a lawyer, can change sides, you see, and attack one
day what she defended the day before, you know; and
she has made you believe that she thinks now being kept
a shameful thing.”
“I do believe so," hastily replied Adeline; “ and if
it be true that my sentiments and my example led you to
adopt your present guilty mode of life, -oh! save me
from the pangs of remorse which I now feel, by letting
my present example recall you from the paths of error
to those of virtue."
“Well pleaded,” cried the cold-hearted Mary—“Lang.,
you could not have done't so well—not up to that.”
“Mrs. Montgomery,” said Langley with great severity,
“ if you cannot treat Mrs. Berrendale with more pro-
priety and respect, I must beg you to leave the room ;
she is come to speak to me on business, and—”
“ I sha’nt stir, for all that: and mark me, Lang., if
you turn me out of the room, you know, hang me if
ever I enter it again !”.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“But your little boy may want you; you have left him
now some time.”
“ Aye, that may be true, to be sure, poor little dear!
Have you any family, Miss Mowbray ?”—when, without
waiting for an answer, she added, “ My little boy have
got the small-pox very bad, and has been likely to die
from convulsion fits, you know. Poor dear! I had been
nursing it so long that I could not bear the stench of
the room, and so I was glad, you know, to come and
get a little fresh air in the gardens.”
At this speech Adeline's fortitude entirely gave way.
Her child had not had the small-pox, and she had been
for some minutes in reach of the infection; and with a
look of horror, forgetting her business, and every thing
but Editha, she was on the point of leaving the room,
· when a servant hastily entered, and told Mary that her
little boy was dead.
At hearing this, even her cold heart was moved, and
throwing herself back on the sofa she fell into a strong
hysteric; while Adeline, losing all remembrance of her
insolence in her distress, flew to her assistance ; and, in
pity for a mother weeping the loss of her infant, forgot
for a moment that she was endangering the life of her
own child.
Mr. Langley, mean time, though grieved for the death
of the infant, was alive to the generous forgiving dispo-
sition which Adeline evinced ; and could not help ex-
claiming, “Oh, Mrs. Berrendale! forgive us! we de-
served not such kindness at your hands :” and Adeline,
wanting to loosen the tight stays of Mary, and not
choosing to undress her before such a witness, coldly
begged him to withdraw, advising him at the same time
to go and see whether the child was really dead, as it
might possibly only appear so.
Revived by this possibility, Mr. Langley left Mary to
the care of Adeline, and left the room. But whether it
was that Mary had a mind to impress her lover and the

255
father of her child with an idea of her sensibility, or
whether she had overheard Adeline's supposition, certain
it is, that as soon as Langley went away, and Adeline
began to unlace her stays, she hastily recovered, and de-
clared her stays should remain as they were : but still
exclaiming about her poor dear Benny, she kept her arms
closely clasped round Adeline's waist, and reposed her
head on her bosom.
Adeline's fears and pity for her being thus allayed, she
began to have leisure to feel and fear for herself; and
the idea, that, by being in such close contact with Mary,
she was imbibing so much of the disease as must inevita-
bly communicate it to Editha, recurred so forcibly to her
mind, that, begging for mercy's sake she would loose
her hold, she endeavoured to break from the arms of her
tormentor.
But in vain. -As soon as Mary saw that Adeline
wished to leave her, she was the more eager to hold her
fast; and protesting she should die if she had the barba-
rity to leave her alone, she only hugged her the closer.
“ Well, then, I'll try to stay till Mr. Langley returns,”
cried Adeline : but some minutes elapsed, and Mr. Lang-
ley did not return ; and then Adeline, recollecting that
when he did return he would come fresh fraught with
the pestilence from the dead body of his infant, could
no longer master her feelings, but screaming wildly,-
“I shall be the death of my child ; let me go," she
struggled with the determined Mary. “You will drive
me mad if you detain me,” cried Adeline.
“You will drive me mad if you go," replied Mary,
giving way to a violent hysterical scream, while with suc-
cessful strength she parried all Adeline's endeavours to
break from her. But what can resist the strength of
phrensy and despair? Adeline, at length worked up to
madness by the fatal control exercised over her, by one
great effort threw the sobbing Mary from her, and, dart-
ing down stairs with the rapidity of phrensy, nearly

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
knocked down Mr. Langley in her passage, who was
coming to announce the restoration of the little boy.
She soon reached Fleet-street, and was on her road
home before Langley and Mary had recovered their con-
sternation: but she suddenly recollected that homewards
she must not proceed ; that she carried death about her;
and wholly bewildered by this insupportable idea, she
ran along the Strand, muttering the incoherencies of
phrensy as she went, till she was intercepted in her pas-
sage by some young men of ton, who had been dining
together, and, being half intoxicated, were on their way
to the theatre.
Two of these gentlemen, with extended arms, prevented
her further progress.
“Where are you going, my pretty girl,” cried one, “in
this hurry? shall I see you home? heh!"
“ Home!” replied Adeline; “name it not. My
child! my child! thy mother has destroyed thee.”
“So!” cried another, "actress, by all that's tragical !"
“Unhand me!” exclaimed Adeline wildly. “Do not
you know, poor babe, that I carry death and infection
about with me!”
“The devil you do!" returned the gentleman; “then
the sooner you take yourself off the better.”
“I believe the poor soul is mad,” said a third, making
way for Adeline to pass.
“ But,” cried the first who spoke, catching hold of
her, “ if so, there is method and meaning in her mad-
ness; for she called Jaby here a poor babe, and we all
know he is little better."
By this time Adeline was in a state of complete
phrensy, and was again darting down the street in spite
of the gentleman's efforts to hold her, when another gen-
tleman, whom curiosity had induced to stop and listen
to what passed, suddenly seized hold of her arm, and
exclaimed, “Good Heavens! what can this mean? It is
—it can be no other than Miss Mowbray.”


## p. 257 (#273) ############################################

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
257
At the sound of her own name Adeline started : but
in a moment her senses were quite lost again ; and the
gentleman, who was no other than Colonel Mordaunt,
being fully aware of her situation, after reproving the
young men for sporting with distress so apparent, called
a coach which happened to be passing, and desired to
know whither he should have the honour of conducting
her.
But she was too lost to be able to answer the question :
he therefore, lifting her into the coach, desired the man
to drive towards Dover-street; and when there, he
ordered him to drive to Margaret-street, Oxford-street;
when, not being able to obtain one coherent word from
Adeline, and nothing but expressions of agony, terror,
and self-condemnation, he desired him to stop at such a
house, and, conducting Adeline up stairs, desired the
first assistance to be procured immediately.
It was not to his own lodgings that Colonel Mordaunt
had conducted Adeline, but to the house of a convenient
friend of his, who, though not generally known as such,
and bearing a tolerably good character in the world,
was very kind to the tender distresses of her friends,
and had no objection to assist the meetings of two fond
lovers.
It is to be supposed, then, that she was surprised at
seeing Colonel Mordaunt with a companion, who was
an object of pity and horror rather than of love : but
she did not want humanity; and when the colonel
recommended Adeline to her tenderest care, she with
great readiness ordered a bed to be prepared, and assisted
in prevailing on Adeline to lie down on it. In a short
time a physician and a surgeon arrived ; and Adeline,
having been bled and made to swallow strong opiates,
was undressed by her attentive landlady; and though
still in a state of unconsciousness, she fell into a sound
sleep which lasted till morning.
But Colonel Mordaunt passed a sleepless night. The

258
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
sight of Adeline, even frantic and wretched as she ap-
peared, had revived the passion which he had conceived
for her ; and if on her awaking the next morning she
should appear perfectly rational, and her phrensy merely
the result of some great fright which she had received,
he resolved to renew his addresses, and take advantage
of the opportunity now offered him, while she was as it
were in his power.
But to return to the Temple.—Soon after Mr. Langley
had entered his own room, and while Mary and he were
commenting on the frantic behaviour of Adeline, the
tawny boy came back from his walk, and heard with
marks of emotion, apparently beyond his age, (for
though near twelve he did not look above eight years
old,) of the sudden and frantic disappearance of
Adeline.
“ Oh! my dear friend,” cried he, “ if, you are not
gone home you will break my poor mother's heart !
" And who is your mother?”
“ Her name is Savanna; and she lives with Mrs.
Berrendale.”
“ Mrs. Berrendale !” cried Mary, “ Miss Mowbray
you mean.”
“ No, I do not; her name was Mowbray, but is now
Berrendale."
“ What! is she really married ?” asked Langley.
“ Yes to be sure.”
“ But how do you know that she is ?”
« Oh! because I went to church with them, and my
mother cooked the wedding-dinner, and I ate plum-
pudding and drank punch, and we were very merry,
önly my mother cried, because my father could not come.”
is very circumstantial evidence, indeed!” cried Lang-
ley, “ and I am very sorry that I did not know so much
before. So you and your mother love this extraordinary
fine woman, Mrs. Berrendale, heh?”
“Love her! To be sure--we should be very wicked

if we did not. Did you never hear the story of the pine-
apple ?” said the tawny boy.
* Not I. What was it?” and the tawny boy, delighted
to tell the story, with sparkling eyes sat down to relate it.
“ You must know, Mr. Glenmurray longed for a pine-
apple.”
* Mrs. Glenmurray you mean,” said Mary laughing
immoderately.
“I know what I say,” replied the tawny boy angrily;
“ and so Miss Adeline, as she was then called, went out
to buy one ;-well, and so she met my poor father going
to prison, and I was crying after her, and so—” Here he
paused, and bursting into tears exclaimed, “And perhaps
she is crying herself now, and I must go and see for her
directly.”
“ Do so, my fine fellow,” cried Langley: “ you had
better go home, tell your mother what has passed, and
to-morrow (accompanying him down stairs, and speaking
in a low voice) I will either write a note of apology or
call on Mrs. Berrendale myself.”
The tawny boy instantly set off, running as fast as he
could, telling Langley first, that if any harm had hap-
pened to his friend, both he and his mother should lie
down and die. And this further proof of Adeline's merit
did not tend to calm Langley's remorse for having ex-
posed her to the various distresses which she had under-
gone at his chambers.

though weakened by the exertions which she had ex-
perienced the night before, and saw with surprise and
alarm that she was not in her own lodging.

awake, when Mrs. Selby, the mistress of the house,
appeared at her bed-side, and, seeing what was passing
in her mind by her countenance, explained to her as
delicately as she could the situation in which she had
been brought there.
“And who brought me hither?” replied Adeline,
dreadfully agitated, as the remembrance of what had
passed by degrees burst upon her.
“ Colonel Mordaunt of the guards," was the answer;
and Adeline was shocked to find that he was the person
to whom she was under so essential an obligation. She
then hastily arose, being eager to return home; and in a
short time she was ready to enter the drawing-room, and
to express her thanks to Colonel Mordaunt.
But in vain did she insist on going home directly, to
ease the fears of her family. The physician, who arrived
at the moment, forbade her going out without having
first taken both medicine and refreshment; and by the
time that, after the most earnest entreaties, she obtained
leave to depart, she recollected that, as her clothes were
the same, she might still impart disease to her child,
and therefore must on no account think of returning to
Editha.
" Whither, whither then can I go?” cried she, for-
getting she was not alone.
“Why not stay here?” said the colonel, who had
been purposely left alone with her. “O dearest of
women! that you would but accept the protection of a
man who adores you; who has long loved you ; who
has been so fortunate as to rescue you from a situation
of misery and danger, and the study of whose life it shall
be to make you happy.”
He uttered this with such volubility, that Adeline
could not find an opportunity to interrupt him ; but
when he concluded, she calmly replied, “ I am willing
to believe, Colonel Mordaunt, from a conversation which
I once had with you, that you are not aware of the

261
extent of the insult which you are now offering to me.
You probably do not know that I have been for years a
married woman?”
Colonel Mordaunt started and turned pale at this in-
telligence; and in a faltering voice replied, that he was
indeed a stranger to her present situation ;-for that,
libertine as he confessed himself to be, be had never yet
allowed himself to address the wife of another.
This speech restored him immediately to the confidence
of Adeline. “ Then I hope," cried she, holding out
her hand to him, which in spite of his virtue he pas-
sionately kissed, “ that, as a friend, you will have the
kindness to procure me a coach to take me to a lodging
a few miles out of town, where I once was before ; and
that you will be so good as to drive directly to my
lodgings, and let my poor maid know what is become of
me. I dread to think,” added she bursting into tears,
“ of the agony that my unaccountable absence must
have occasioned her.”
The colonel, too seriously attached to Adeline to know
yet what he wished, or what he hoped on this discovery
of her situation, promised to obey her, provided she
would allow him to call on her now and then; and Ade-
line was too full of gratitude to him for the service
which he had rendered her, to have resolution enough
to deny his request. He then called a coach for himself,
and for Adeline, as she insisted on his going immediately
to her lodgings : and also begged that he would tell the
mulatto to send for advice, and prepare her little girl for
inoculation directly.
Adeline drove directly to her old lodgings in the
country, where she was most gladly received ; and
the colonel went to deliver his commission to the
mulatto.
He found her in strong hysterics ; the tawny boy
crying over her, and the women of the house holding her
down on the bed by force, while the little Editha had been

conveyed to a neighbour's house, that she might not hear
the screams which had surprised and terrified her.
Colonel Mordaunt had opened the door, and was wit-
nessing this distressing scene, before any one was con-
scious of his presence; but the tawny boy soon discovered
him, and crying out-
“ Oh! sir, do you bring us news of our friend ?”
sprang to him, and hung almost breathless on his arm.
Savanna, who was conscious enough to know what
passed, though too much weakened from her own suf-
ferings and anxieties to be able to struggle with this
new affliction, started up on hearing these words, and
screamed out “ Does she live? Blessed man! but say
so, dat’s all,” in a tone so affecting, and with an ex-
pression of agonized curiosity so overwhelming to the
feelings, that Colonel Mordaunt, whose spirits were not
very high, was so choked that he could not immediately
answer her; and when at last he faltered out, “ She
lives, and is quite well,” the frantic joy of the mulatto
overcame him still more. She jumped about his neck,
she hugged the tawny boy; and her delight was as ex-
travagant as her grief had been ; till exhausted and silent
she sunk upon the bed, and was unable for some minutes
to listen quietly to the story which Colonel Mordaunt
came to relate.
When she was composed enough to listen to it, she
did not long remain so; for as soon as she heard that
Colonel Mordaunt had met Adeline in her phrensy, and
conveyed her to a place of safety, she fell at his feet,
embraced his knees, and, making the tawny boy kneel
down by her, invoked the blessing of God on him so
fervently and so eloquently, that Colouel Mordaunt wept
like a child, and, exclaiming, “ Upon my soul, my good
woman, I cannot bear this,” was forced to run out of
the house to recover his emotion.
When he returned, Savanna said “Well-now, blessed
sir, take me to my dear lady."

263
“ Indeed,” replied he, “I must not; you are for-
bidden to see her.”
“ Forbidden !” replied she, her eyes flashing fire ;
“ and who dare to keep Savanna from her own mistress?
-I will see her.”
“ Not if she forbids it, Savanna ; and if her child's
life should be endangered by it?”
“O, no, to be sure not,” cried the tawny boy, who
doted upon Editha, and, having fetched her back from
the next house, was lulling her to sleep in his arms.
Colonel Mordaunt started at sight of the child, and,
stooping down to kiss its rosy cheek, sighed deeply as
he turned away again.
“Well,” cried Savanna, “ you talk very strange-
me no understand.”
“But you shall, my excellent creature,” replied the
colonel, “ immediately.” He then entered on a full
explanation to Savanna; who had no sooner heard that
her mistress feared that she had been so much exposed
to the infection of the small-pox, as to make her certain
of giving it to her child, than she exclaimed, “ Oh, my
good God! save and protect her own self! She never
have it, and she may get it and die!”
“Surely you must be mistaken,” replied the colonel,
“ Mrs. Berrendale must have recollected and mentioned
her own danger if this be the case.”
“She !" hastily interrupted the mulatto, “she tink of
herself! Never—she only mind others' good. Do you
tink, if she be one selfish beast like her husban, Savanna
love her so dear? No, Mr. Colonel, me know her, and
me know though we may save the child we may lose the
mother.” Here she began to weep bitterly; while the
colonel, more in love than ever with Adeline from these
proofs of her goodness, resolved to lose no time in urging
her to undergo herself the operation which she desired
for Editha.
Then, begging the mulatto to send for a surgeon di-

rectly, in spite of the tears of the tawny boy, who
thought it cruel to run the risk of spoiling Miss Editha's
pretty face, he took his leave, saying to himself, “ What
a heart has this Adeline ! how capable of feeling affec-
tion! for no one can inspire it who is not able to feel it :-
and this creature is thrown away on a man undeserving
her, it seems !”
On this intelligence he continued to muse till he ar-
rived at Adeline's lodgings, to whom he communicated
all that had passed ; and from whom he learned, with
great anxiety, that it was but too true that she had never
had the small-pox ; and that, therefore, she should pro-
bably show symptoms of the disease in a few days : con-
sequently, as she considered it too late for her to be
inoculated, she should do all that now remained to be
done for her security, by low living and good air.
That same evening Colonel Mordaunt returned to Sa-
vanna, in hopes of learning from her some further par-
ticulars respecting Adeline's husband; as he felt that
his conscience would not be much hurt by inducing
Adeline to leave the protection of a man who was un-
worthy of possessing her. Fortunately for his wishes,
he could not wish to hear more than Savanna wished to
tell every thing relating to her adored lady: and Colonel
Mordaunt heard with generous indignation of the per-
fidious conduct of Berrendale; vowing, at the same time,
that his time, his interest, and his fortune, should all be
devoted to bring such a villain to justice, and to secure
to the injured Editha her rightful inheritance.
The mulatto was in raptures :-she told Colonel Mor-
daunt that he was a charming man, and infinitely hand-
somer than Berrendale, though she must own he was
very good to look at ; and she wished with all her soul
that Colonel Mordaunt was married to her lady; for then
she believed she would have never known sorrow, but
been as happy as the day was long.
Colonel Mordaunt could not hear this without a secret

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
265
pang. “Had I followed,” said he mentally, “the dic-
tates of my heart when I saw Adeline at Bath, I might
now, perhaps, instead of being a forlorn unattached be-
ing, have been a happy husband and father; and Ade-
line, instead of having been the mistress of one man, the
disowned wife of another, might have been happy and
beloved, and as respectable in the eyes of the world as
she is in those of her grateful mulatto.” .
However, there was some hope left for him yet.—
Adeline, he thought, was not a woman likely to be over-
scrupulous in her ideas ; and might very naturally think
herself at liberty to accept the protection of a lover,
when, from no fault of hers, she had lost that of her
husband. i
It is natural to suppose that, while elevated with these
hopes, he did not fail to be very constant in his visits to
Adeline ; and that at length, more led by passion than
policy, he abruptly, at the end of ten days, informed
Adeline that he knew her situation, and that he trusted
that she would allow him to hope that in due time his
love, which had been proof against time, absence, and
disdain, would meet with reward; and that, on his set-
tling a handsome income on her and her child for their
joint lives, she would allow him to endeavour to make
her as happy as she, and she only, could make him.
To this proposal, which was in form of a letter,
Colonel Mordaunt did not receive an immediate answer;
nor was it at first likely that he should ever receive an
answer to it at all, as Adeline was at the moment of its
arrival confined to her bed, according to her expecta-
tions, with the disease which she had been but too fear-
ful of imbibing: while the half-distracted mulatto was
forced to give up to others the care of the sickening
Editha, to watch over the delirious and unconscious
Adeline.
But the tawny boy's generous benefactress gave him
leave to remain at Adeline's lodgings, in order to calm

266
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
his fears for Editha, and assist in amusing and keeping
her quiet ; and if attention had any share in preserving
the life and beauty of Editha, it was to the affectionate
tawny boy that she owed them; and he was soon re-
warded for all his care and anxiety by seeing his little
charge able to play about as usual.
Colonel Mordaunt and the mulatto meanwhile did not
obtain so speedy a termination to their anxieties : Ade-
line's recovery was for a long time a matter of doubt;
and her weakness so great after the crisis of the disor-
der was past, that none ventured to pronounce her, even
then, out of danger.
But at length she was in a great measure restored to
health, and able to determime what line of conduct it
was necessary for her to pursue.—To return an answer
to Colonel Mordaunt's proposals was certainly her first
business ; but as she felt that the situation in which he
had once known her made his offer less affronting than
it would have been under other circumstances, she re-
solved to speak to him on the subject with gentleness,
not severity; especially as during her illness, to amuse
the anxiety that had preyed upon him, he had taken
every possible step to procure evidence of the marriage,
and gave into Savanna's hands, the first day that he was
permitted to see her, an attested certificate of it.
CHAPTER XXI.
The first question which Adeline asked on her recovery
was, Whether any letter had come by the general-post
during her illness; and Savanna gave one to her immedi-
ately.
It was the letter so ardently desired; for the direction
was in her mother's hand-writing! and she opened it
full of eager expectation, while her whole existence

267
seemed to depend on the nature of its contents. What
then must have been her agony on finding that the
enveloppe contained nothing but her own letter returned !
For some time she spoke not, she breathed not; while
Savanna mixed with expressions of terror, at sight of her
mistress's distress, poured execrations on the unnatural
parent who had so cruelly occasioned it.
After a few days' incessant struggle to overcome the
violence of her sorrow, Adeline recovered the shock, in
appearance at least : yet to Savanna's self-congratulations
she could not help answering (laying her hand on her
heart) “ The blow is here, Savanna, and the wound
incurable.”
Soon after she thought herself well enough to see
Colonel Mordaunt, and to thank him for the recent proof
of his attention to her and her interest. But no obliga-
tion, however great, could shut the now vigilant eyes of
Adeline to the impropriety of receiving further visits from
him, or to the guilt of welcoming to her house a man
who made open professions to her of illicit love.
· She however thought it her duty to see him once more,
in order to try to reconcile him to the necessity of the
rule of conduct which she was going to lay down for
herself ; nor was she without hope that the yet recent
traces of the disease, to which she had so nearly fallen
a victim, would make her appearance so unpleasing to
the eyes of her lover, that he would be very willing to
absent himself from the house, for some time at least,
and probably give up all thoughts of her.
But she did neither herself nor Colonel Mordaunt
justice.—She was formed to inspire a real and lasting
passion—a passion that no external change could destroy
-since it was founded on the unchanging qualities of
the heart and mind : and Colonel Mordaunt felt for her
such an attachment in all its force. He had always ad-
mired the attractive person and winning graces of Adeline,
and felt for her what he denominated love ; but that

268
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
rational though enthusiastic preference, which is desery-
ing of the name of true love, he never felt till he had
had an opportunity to appreciate justly the real character
of Adeline: still there were times when he felt almost
gratified to reflect that she could not legally be his; for,
whatever might have been the cause and excuse of her
errors, she had erred, and the delicacy of his mind re-
volted at the idea of marrying the mistress of another.
But when he saw and heard Adeline, this repugnance
vanished ; and he knew that, could he at those moments
lead her to the altar, he should not have hesitated to
bind himself to her for ever by the sacred ties which the
early errors of her judgment had made her even in his
opinion almost unworthy to form.
* At length a day was fixed for his interview with Adeline,
and with a beating heart he entered the apartment; nor
was his emotion diminished when he beheld not only the
usual vestiges of her complaint, but symptoms of debility,
and a death-like meagreness of aspect, which made him
fear that though one malady was conquered, another,
even more dangerous, remained. The idea overcame
him; and he was forced to turn to the window to hide
his emotion : and his manner was so indicative of ardent
yet respectful attachment, that Adeline began to feel in
spite of herself that her projected task was difficult of
execution.
For some minutes neither of them spoke : Mordaunt
held the hand which she gave him to his heart, kissed it
as she withdrew it, and again turned away his head to
conceal a starting tear : while Adeline was not sorry to
have a few moments in which to recover herself, before
she addressed him on the subject at that time nearest to
the heart of both. · At length she summoned resolution
enough to say :-
“ Much as I have been mortified and degraded, Colonel
Mordaunt, by the letter which I have received from you,
still I rejoice that I did receive it :-in the first place, I

269
rejoice, because I look on all the sufferings and mortifi-
cations which I meet with as merciful chastisements, as
expiations inflicted on me in mercy by the Being whom
I adore, for the sins of which I have been guilty; and,
in the second place, because it gives me an opportunity
of proving, incontrovertibly, my full conviction of the
fallacy of my past opinions, and that I became a wife,
after my idle declamations against marriage, from change
of principle, on assurance of error, and not from
interest, or necessity.”
Here she paused, overcome with the effort which she
had made; and Colonel Mordaunt would have interrupted
her, but, earnestly conjuring him to give her a patient
hearing, she proceeded thus :-
“ Had the change in my practice been the result of
any thing but rational conviction, I should now, un-
fortunate as I have been in the choice of a husband,
regret that ever I formed so foolish a tie, and perhaps
be induced to enter into a less sacred connexion, from
an idea that that state which forced me to drag out exist-
ence in hopeless misery was contrary to reason, justice,
and the benefit of society; and that, the sooner its ties
were dissolved, the better it would be for individual
happiness and for the world at large.”
"And do you not think so?” cried Colonel Mordaunt;
“ cannot your own individual experience convince you
of it?”
“ Far from it,” replied Adeline : « and I bless God
that it does not : for thence, and thence only, do I begin
to be reconciled to myself. I have no doubt that there
is a great deal of individual suffering in the marriage
state, from a contrariety of temper and other causes;
but I believe that the mass of happiness and virtue is
certainly increased by it. Individual suffering, therefore,
is no argument for the abolition of marriage, than the
accidental bursting of a musket would be for the total
abolition of fire-arms."

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“But, surely, dear Mrs. Berrendale, you would wish
divorce to be made easier than it is?”
“ By no means.” interrupted Adeline, understanding
what he was going to say : “to BEAR and FORBEAR I
believe to be the grand secret of happiness, and that it
ought to be the great study of life: therefore, whatever
would enable married persons to separate on the slightest
quarrel or disgust, would make it so much the less
necessary for us to learn this important lesson ; a lesson
so needful in order to perfect the human character, that
I believe the difficulty of divorce to be one of the greatest
blessings of society.”
" What can have so completely changed your opinions
on this subject ?” replied Colonel Mordaunt.
“Not my own experience,” returned Adeline; “ for
the painful situations in which I have been placed, I
might attribute, not to the fallacy of the system on
which I have acted, but to those existing prejudices in
society which I wish to see destroyed.”
“ Then, to what else is the change in your sentiments
to be attributed ?”.
“ To a more serious, unimpassioned, and unprejudiced
view of the subject than I had before taken : at present
I am not equal to expatiate on matters so important:
however, some time or other, perhaps, I may make
known to you my sentiments on them in a more ample
manner : but I have, I trust, said enough to lead you to
conclude, that though Mr. Berrendale's conduct to me
has been atrocious, and that you are in many respects
entitled to my gratitude and thanks, you and I must
henceforward be strangers to each other."
Colonel Mordaunt, little expecting such a total over-
throw to his hopes, was, on receiving it, choked with
contending emotions; and his broken sentences and
pale cheek were sufficiently expressive of the distress
which he endured. But I shall not enter into a detail of
all he urged in favour of his passion; nor the calm,

271
dignified, and feeling manner in which Adeline replied.
Suffice that, at last, from a sort of intuitive knowledge
of the human heart, as it were, which persons of quick
talents and sensibilities possess however defective their
experience, Adeline resolved to try to soothe the self-love
which she had wounded, knowing that self-love is
scarcely to be distinguished in its effects from love itself ;
and that the agony of disappointed passion is always
greater when it is inflicted by the coldness or falsehood
of the beloved object, than when it proceeds from
parental prohibition, or the cruel separation enjoined by
conscious poverty. She therefore told Colonel Mordaunt
that he was once very near being the first choice of her
heart : when she first saw him, she said, his person, and
manners, and attentions, had so strongly prepossessed
her in his favour, that he himself, by ceasing to see and
converse with her, could alone have saved her from the
pain of a hopeless attachment.
“ In pity, spare me,” cried Mordaunt, “the con-
templation of the happiness I might have enjoyed !”
“But you know you were not a marrying-man, as it is
called; and forgive me if I say, that men who can on
system suppress the best feelings of their nature, and
prefer a course of libertine indulgence to a virtuous con-
nexion, at that time of life when they might become
happy husbands and fathers, with the reasonable expecta-
tion of living to see their children grown up to manhood,
and superintending their education themselves--such
men, Colonel Mordaunt, deserve, in the decline of life,
to feel that regret and that self-condemnation which you
this moment anticipate.”
“ True—too true !" replied the colonel ; “but, for
mercy's safe, torture me no more.”
“ I would not probe where I did not intend to make
a cure,” replied Adeline.
“A cure !--what mean you ?”
“I mean to induce you, ere it be yet too late, to en-

deavour to form a virtuous attachment, and to unite
yourself for life with some amiable young woman who
will make you as happy as I would have endeavoured to
make you, had it been my fortunate lot to be yours :
for, believe me, Colonel Mordaunt,” and her voice fal-
tered as she said it, “had he, whom I still continue to
love with unabated tenderness, though years have elapsed
since he was taken from me,--had he bequeathed me to
you on his death-bed, the reluctance with which I went
to the altar would have been more easily overcome.”
Saying this, she suddenly left the room, leaving
Colonel Mordaunt surprised, gratified, and his mind
struggling between hopes and fears ; for Adeline was not
conscious that she imparted hope as well as consolation
by the method which she pursued; and though she sent
Savanna to tell the colonel she could see him no more
that evening, he departed in firm expectation that Adeline
would not have resolution to forbid him to see her again.
In this, however, he was mistaken; Adeline had learnt
the best of all lessons, distrust of her own strength ;-
and she resolved to put it out of her power to receive
visits which a regard to propriety forbade, and which
might injure her reputation, if not her peace of mind.
Therefore, as soon as Colonel Mordaunt was gone, she
summoned Savanna, and desired her to proceed to
business.
“ What!” cried the delighted mulatto, “are we going
to prosecu massa ?”.
“ No," replied Adeline, “we are going into the
country: I am come to a determination to take no legal
steps in this affair, but leave Mr. Berrendale to the
reproaches of his own conscience.”
“A fiddle's end!” replied Savanna, “ he have no
conscience, or he no leave you : better get him hang, if
you can ; den you marry de colonel.”
“ I had better hang the father of my child, had I,
Savanna?”

« Oh ! no, no, no, no,-me forget dat."
“ But I do not, nor can I even bear to disgrace the
fat her of Editha : therefore, trusting that I can dispose
of her, and secure her interest better than by forcing
her father to do her justice, and bastardize the poor
innocent whom his wife will soon bring into the world,
I am going to bury myself in retirement, and live the
short remainder of my days unknowing and unknown.”
CHAPTER XXII.
SAVANNA was going to remonstrate, but the words
“ short remainder of my days” distressed her so much,
that tears choked her words; and she obeyed in silence
her mistress's orders to pack up, except when she indulged
in a few exclamations against her lady's cruelty in going
away without taking leave of Colonel Mordaunt, who,
sweet gentleman, would break his heart at her departure,
especially as he was not to know whither she was going.
A postchaise was at the door the next morning at six
o'clock; and as Adeline had not much luggage, having left
the chief part of her furniture to be divided between the
mistresses of her two lodgings, in return for their kind at-
tention to her and her child, she took an affectionate leave
of her landlady, and desired the post-boy to drive a mile
on the road before him : and when he had done so, she
ordered him to go on to Barnet; while the disappointed
mulatto thanked God that the tawny boy was gone to Scot-
land with his protectress, asit prevented her having themor-
tification of leaving him behind her, as well as the colonel.
—“O had I such a lover,” cried she, (her eyes filling
with tears,) “me never leave him, nor he me!” and for
the first time she thought her angel-lady hard-hearted.
For some miles they proceeded in silence for Adeline
was too much engrossed to speak ; and the little Editha,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
being fast asleep in the mulatto's arms did not draw her
mother out of the reverie into which she had fallen.
“And where now?” said the mulatto, when the
chaise stopped.
“ To the next stage on the high north road.” And
on they went again : nor did they stop, except for refresh-
ments, till they had travelled thirty miles; when Adeline,
worn out with fatigue, staid all night at the inn where
the chaise stopped, and the next morning they resumed
their journey, but not their silence. The mulatto could
no longer restrain her curiosity ; and she begged to know
whither they were going, and why they were to be buried
in the country?
Adeline, sighing deeply, answered, that they were
going to live in Cumberland; and then sunk into silence
again, as she could not give the mulatto her true reasons
for the plan that she was pursuing without wounding
her affectionate heart in a manner wholly incurable.
The truth was, that Adeline supposed herself to be de-
clining: she thought that she experienced those dreadful
languors, those sensations of internal weakness, which,
however veiled to the eye of the observer, speak in
forcible language to the heart of the conscious sufferer.
Indeed, Adeline had long struggled, but in vain, against
feelings of a most overwhelming nature; amongst which,
remorse and horror, for having led by her example and
precepts an innocent girl into a life of infamy, were the
most painfully predominant: for, believing Mary War-
ner's assertion when she saw her at Mr. Langley's
chambers, she looked upon that unhappy girl's guilt as
the consequence of her own; and mourned, incessantly
mourned, over the fatal errors of her early judgment,
which had made her, though an idolater of virtue, a
practical assistant to the cause of vice. When Adeline
imagined the term of her existence to be drawing nigh,
her mother, her obdurate but still dear mother, regained
her wonted ascendancy over her affections; and to her,

275
the approach of death seemed fraught with satisfaction.
For that parent, so long, so repeatedly deaf to her
prayers, and to the detail of those sufferings which she
had made one of the conditions of her forgiveness, had
promised to see and to forgive her on her death-bed;
and her heart yearned, fondly yearned, for the moment
when she should be pressed to the bosom of a relenting
parent.
To Cumberland, therefore, she was resolved to hasten,
and into the very neighbourhood of Mrs. Mowbray;
while, as the chaise wheeled them along to the place of
their destination, even the prattle of her child could not
always withdraw her from the abstraction into which she
was plunged, as the scenes of her early years thronged
upon her memory, and with them the recollection of
those proofs of a mother's fondness, for a renewal of
which, even in the society of Glenmurray, she had con-
stantly and despondingly sighed.
As they approached Penrith, her emotion redoubled,
and she involuntarily exclaimed—“Cruel, but still dear,
mother, you little think your child is so near!”
“ Heaven save me!” cried Savanna; “ are we to go
and be near dat woman ?”
“ Yes,” replied Adeline. “ Did she not say she
would forgive me on my death-bed?”
“ But you not there yet, dear missess," sobbed
Savanna; “ you not there of long years !”
“ Savanna," returned Adeline, “ I should die con-
tented to purchase my mother's blessing and forgive-
ness.”
Savanna, speechless with contending emotions, could
not express by words the feeling of mixed sorrow and
indignation which overwhelmed her ; but she replied by
putting Editha in Adeline's arms; then articulating with
effort, “ Look there!” she sobbed aloud.
“ I understand you,” said Adeline, kissing away the
tears gathering in Editha's eyes, at sight of Savanna's
T

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
distress : “ but perhaps I think my death would be of
more service to my child than my life.”
" And to me too, I suppose,” replied Savanna re-
proachfully. “Well, me go to Scotland ; for no one
love me but the tawny boy."
“ You will stay and close my eyes first, I hope !"
observed Adeline mournfully.
In a moment Savanna’s resentment vanished. “Me
will live and die vid you,” she replied, her tears re-
doubling, while Adeline again sunk into thoughtful
silence.
As soon as they reached Penrith, Adeline inquired for
lodgings out of the town, on that side nearest to her
mother's abode; and was so fortunate, as she esteemed
herself, to procure two apartments at a small house within
two miles of Mrs. Mowbray's.
" Then I breathe once more the same air with my
mother !” exclaimed Adeline as she took possession of
her lodging. “ Savanna, methinks I breathe freer
already!"
“Me more choked,” replied the mulatto, and turned
sullenly away.
« Nay, I-I feel so much better, that to-morrow I will
-I will take a walk," said Adeline hesitatingly.
“ And where?” asked Savanna eagerly.
“Oh, to-night I shall only walk to bed,” replied
Adeline smiling; and with unusual cheerfulness she
retired to rest.
The next morning she arose early; and being informed
that a stile near a peasant's cottage commanded a view
of Mrs. Mowbray's house, she hired a man and cart to
convey her to the bottom of the hill, and with Editha by
her side she set out to indulge her feelings by gazing on
the house which contained her mother.
When they alighted, Editha gaily endeavoured to climb
the hill, and urged her mother to follow her ; but Adeline,
rendered weak by illness and breathless by emotion, felt

the ascent so difficult, that no motive less powerful than
the one which actuated her could have enabled her to
reach the summit.
At length, however, she did reach it :-and the lawn
before Mrs. Mowbray's white house, her hay-fields, and
the running stream at the bottom of it, burst in all their
beauty on her view.-"And this is my mother's dwelling !”.
exclaimed Adeline: “ and there was I born: and near
here” shall I die, she would have added, but her voice
failed her.
« Oh! what a pretty house and garden !” cried
Editha in the unformed accents of childhood ;" how I
should like to live there!”.
This artless remark awakened a thousand mixed and
overpowering feelings in the bosom of Adeline ; and,
after a pause of strong emotion, she exclaimed, catching
the little prattler to her heart—" you shall live there,
my child !-yes, yes, you shall live there!”
“ But when ? " resumed Editha.
“ When I am in my grave,” answered Adeline.
“ And when shall you be there?” replied the uncon-
scious child, fondly caressing her : “ pray, mamma-
pray be there soon!”
Adeline turned away, unable to answer her.
“ Look-look, mamma!”—resumed Editha : “ there
are ladies.-Oh! do let us go there now !-why can't we?”
« Would to God we could !” replied Adeline ; as in
one of the ladies she recognised Mrs. Mowbray, and stood
gazing on her till her eyes ached again: but what she
felt on seeing her she will herself describe in the suc-
ceeding pages : and I shall only add, that, as soon as
Mrs. Mowbray returned into the house, Adeline, wrapped
in a long and mournful reverie, returned, full of a new
plan, to her lodgings.
There is no love so disinterested as parental love; and
Adeline had all the keen sensibilities of a parent. To
make, therefore, “ assurance doubly sure that Mrs.

Mowbray should receive and should love her orphan
when she was no more, she resolved to give up the grati-
fication to which she had looked forward, the hope, before
she died, of obtaining her forgiveness—that she might
not weaken, by directing any part of them to herself,
those feelings of remorse, fruitless tenderness, and useless
regret in her mother's bosom, which she wished should
be concentrated on her child.
“ No,” said Adeline to herself, “ I am sure that she
will not refuse to receive my orphan to her love and pro-
tection when I am no more, and am become alike insen-
sible of reproaches and of blessings ; and I think that
she will love my child the more tenderly, because to me
she will be unable to express the compunction which,
sooner or later, she will feel from the recollection of her
conduct towards me: therefore, I will make no demands
on her love for myself; but, in a letter to be given her
after my decease, bequeath my orphan to her care;" —
and with this determination she returned from her ride.
“ Have you see her ?” said Savanna, running out to
meet her.
“ Yes-- but not spoken to her ; nor shall I see her
again.”
" What I suppose she see you, and not speak?”
« Oh, no; she did not see me, nor shall I urge her to
see me: my plans are altered,” replied Adeline.
“And we go back to town and Colonel Mordaunt?”
“No," resumed Adeline, sighing deeply, and pre-
paring to write to Mrs. Mowbray.
But it is necessary that we should for a short time go
back to Berrendale, and relate that, while Adeline and
Editha were confined with the small-pox, Mr. Drury re-
ceived a summons from his employer in Jamaica to go
over thither, to be intrusted with some particular
business : in consequence of this he resolved to call again
on Adeline, and inquire whether she still persisted in
styling herself Mrs. Berrendale; as he concluded that

279
Berrendale would be very glad of all the information re-
lative to her and her child which he could possibly pro-
cure, whether his curiosity on the subject proceeded from
fear or love.
It so happened, that as soon as Editha, as well as her
mother, was in the height of the disorder, Mr. Drury
called; and finding that they were both very bad, he
thought that his friend Berrendale was likely to get rid
of both his encumbrances at once; and being eager to
communicate good news to a man whose influence in the
island might be a benefit to hinı, he every day called to
inquire concerning their health.
The second floor in the house where Adeline lodged
was then occupied by a young woman in indigent circum-
stances, who, as well as her child, had sickened with the
distemper the very day that Editha was inoculated : and
when Drury, just as he was setting off for Portsmouth,
ran to gain the latest intelligence of the invalids, a char-
woman, who attended to the door, not being acquainted
with the name of the poor young woman and her little
girl, concluding that Mr. Drury, by Mrs. Berrendale
and miss who were ill with the small-pox, meant them,
replied to his inquiries,—“Ah, poor things! it is all
over with them, they died last night.”
On which, not staying for any further intelligence,
Drury set off for Portsmouth, and arrived at Jamaica
just as Berrendale was going to remit to Adeline å
draft for a hundred pounds. For Adeline and the
injury which he had done her, had been for some days
constantly present to his thoughts. He had been ill ;
and as indigestion, the cause of his complaints, is apt to
Occasion disturbed dreams, he had in his dreams been
haunted by the image of Glenmurray, who, with a
threatening aspect, had reproached him with cruelty and
base ingratitude to him, in deserting in such a manner
the wife whom he had bequeathed to him.
The constant recurrence of these dreams had depressed

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
his spirits and excited his remorse so much, that he could
calm his feelings in no other way than by writing a kind
letter to Adeline, and enclosing her a draft on his
banker. This letter was on the point of being sent when
Drury arrived, and, with very little ceremony, informed
him that Adeline was dead.
“Dead !” exclaimed Berrendale, falling almost sense-
less on his couch: “Dead !-Oh! for God's sake, tell
me of what she died Surely, surely, she” Here his
voice failed him.
Drury coolly replied, that she and her child both died
of the small-pox.
“But when? my dear fellow !-when? Say that they
died nine months ago (that was previous to his mar-
riage) and you make me your friend for life !” .
Drury, so bribed, would have said any thing; and,
with all the coolness possible, he replied, “Then be my
friend for life :--they died rather better than nine
months ago.”
Berrendale, being then convinced that bigamy was not
likely to be proved against him, soon forgot, in the joy
which this thought occasioned him, remorse for his con-
duct to Adeline, and regret for her early fate : besides,
he concluded that he saved £100 by the means ; for he
knew not that the delicate mind of Adeline would have
scorned to owe pecuniary obligations to the husband who
had basely and unwarrantably deserted her.
But he was soon undeceived on this subject, by a
letter which Colonel Mordaunt wrote in confidence to a
friend in Jamaica, begging him to inquire concerning
Mr. Berrendale's second marriage; and to inform him
privately that his injured wife had zealous and powerful
friends in England, who were continually urging her to
prosecute him for bigamy.
This intelligence had a fatal effect on the health of
Berrendale ; for though the violent temper and overbear-
ing disposition of his second wife had often made him

281
regret the gentle and compliant Adeline, and a separation
from her, consequently, would be a blessing, still he
feared to encounter the disgrace of a prosecution, and
still more the anger of his West Indian wife; who, it
was not improbable, might even attack his life in the
first moment of ungoverned passion.
And to these fears he soon fell a sacrifice; for a frame
debilitated by intemperance could not support the
assaults made on it by the continued apprehensions
which Colonel Mordaunt's friend had excited in him ;
and he died in that gentleman's presence, whom in his
last moments he had summoned to his apartment to wit-
ness a will, by which he owned Adeline Mowbray to be
his lawful wife, and left Editha, his acknowledged and
only heir, a very considerable fortune.
But this circumstance, an account of which, with the
will, was transmitted to Colonel Mordaun't, did not take
place till long after Adeline took up her abode in Cum-
berland.
CHAPTER XXIII.
But to return to Colonel Mordaunt. Though Adeline
had said that he must discontinue his visits, he resolved
to disobey her; and the next morning, as soon as he
thought she had breakfasted, he repaired to her lodgings;
where he heard, with mixed sorrow and indignation, that
she had set off in a post-chaise at six o'clock, and was
gone no one knew whither.
“But, surely she has left some note or message for
me !” exclaimed Colonel Mordaunt.
“Neither the one nor the other,” was the answer ;
and he returned home in no very enviable state of
mind.
Various, indeed, and contradictory were his feelings :
yet still affection was uppermost; and he could not but

respect in Adeline the conduct which drove him to
despair. Nor was self-love backward to suggest to him,
that had not Adeline felt his presence and attentions to
be dangerous, she would not so suddenly have withdrawn
from them; and this idea was the only one on which he
could at all bear to dwell : for, when he reflected that
day after day might pass without his either seeing or
hearing from her, existence seemed to become suddenly
a burthen, and he wandered from place to place with
joyless and unceasing restlessness.
At one time he resolved to pursue her ; but the next,
piqued at not having received from her even a note of
farewell, he determined to endeavour to forget her : 'and
this was certainly the wiser plan of the two : but the
succeeding moment he determined to let a week pass, in
hopes of receiving a letter from her, and, in case he did
not, to set off in search of her, being assured of succeeding
in his search of her, because the singularity of Savanna's
appearance, and the traces of the small-pox visible in the
face of Adeline, made them liable to be observed, and
easy for him to describe.
But before the week elapsed, from agitation of mind,
and from having exposed himself unnecessarily to cold,
by lying on damp grass at midnight, after having heated
himself by immoderate walking, Colonel Mordaunt be-
came ill of a fever; and when, after a confinement of
several weeks, he was restored to health, he despaired of
being able to learn tidings of the fugitives ; and disap-
pointed and dejected, he sought in the gayest scenes of
the metropolis and its environs to drown the remem-
brances, from which in solitude he had vainly endeavoured
to fly. At this time a faded but attractive woman of
quality, with whom he had formerly been intimate, re-
turned from abroad, and, meeting Colonel Mordaunt at
the house of a mutual friend, endeavoured to revive in
him his former attachment: but it was a difficult task
for a woman, who had never been able to touch the

283
heart, to excite an attachment in a man already senti-
mentally devoted to another.
Her advances, however, flattered Colonel Mordaunt,
and her society amused him, till, at length, their intimacy
was renewed on its former footing: but soon tired of his
mistress, and displeased with himself, he took an
abrupt leave of her, and throwing himself into his
post-chaise, retired to the seat of a relation in
Herefordshire.
Near this gentleman's house lived Mr. Maynard and
his two sisters, who had taken up their abode there im-
mediately on their return from Portugal. Major Douglas,
his wife, and Emma Douglas, were then on a visit to
them. Mordaunt had known Major Douglas in early
life; and as soon as he found that he was in the neigh-
bourhood, he rode over to renew his acquaintance with
him; and received so cordial a welcome, not only from
the major, but the master of the house and his sisters,
that he was strongly induced to repeat his visits, and not
a day passed in which he was not, during some part of
it, a guest at Mr. Maynard's.
· Mrs. Wallington and Miss Maynard, indeed, received
him with such pointed marks of distinction and prefer-
ence, as to make it visible to every observer that it was
not as a friend only they were desirous of considering
Colonel Mordaunt; while, by spiteful looks and acrimo-
nious remarks directed to each other, the sisters ex-
pressed the jealousy which rankled in their hearts, when-
ever he seemed by design or inadvertency to make one
of them the particular object of his attention.
Of Emma Douglas's chance for his favour, they were
not at all fearful :they thought her too plain, and too
unattractive, to be capable of rivalling them; especially
in the favour of an officer, a man of fashion ; and there-
fore they beheld without emotion the attention which
Colonel Mordaunt paid to her whenever she spoke, and
the deference which he evidently felt for her opinion, as

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
her remarks on whatever subject she conversed were
formed always to interest, and often to instruct.
One evening, while Major Douglas was amusing him-
self in looking over some magazines which had lately
been bound up together, and had not yet been deposited
in Mr. Maynard's library, he suddenly started, laid down
the book, and turning to the window, with an exclama-
tion of " Poor fellow !”-passed his hand across his
eyes, as if meaning to disperse an involuntary tear.
“ What makes you exclaim · Poor fellow ?'” asked
his lovely wife: “ have you met with an affecting story
in those magazines ?”
“ No, Louisa,” replied he, “but I met in the obituary
with a confirmation of the death of an old friend, which
I suspected must have happened by this time, though I
never knew it before ; I see by this magazine that poor
Glenmurray died a very few months after we saw him
at Perpignan.”
“ Poor fellow !” exclaimed Mrs. Douglas.
“ I wish I knew what is become of his interesting
companion, Miss Mowbray," said Emma Douglas.
“ I wish I did too,” secretly sighed Colonel Mordaunt:
but his heart palpitated so violently at this unexpected
mention of the woman for whom he still pined in secret,
that he had not resolution to say that he knew her.
“Become of her!” cried Miss Maynard sneeringly :
“ you need not wonder, I think, what her fate is : no
doubt Mr. Glenmurray's interesting companion has not
lost her companionable qualities, and is a companion
still.”
“Yes,” observed Mrs. Wallington ; “or, rather, I
dare say that angel of purity is gone upon the town.”
It was the dark hour, else Colonel Mordaunt's agita-
tion, on hearing these gross and unjust remarks, must
have betrayed his secret to every eye; while indignation
now impeded his utterance as much as confusion had
done before.

.." Surely, surely,” cried the kind and candid Emma
Douglas, “I must grossly have mistaken Miss Mowbray's
character, if she was capable of the conduct which you
attribute to her!”
: “ My dear creature !” replied Mrs. Wallington, “how
should you know any thing of her character, when it was
gone long before you knew her?—Character, indeed!
you remind me of my brother Mr. Davenport,"
continued she to a gentleman present, “ did you ever
hear the story of my brother and an angel of purity
whom he met with abroad?”
“ No-never.”
“ Be quiet,” said Maynard; “I will not be laughed
at.”
However, Mrs. Wallington and Miss Maynard, who
had not yet forgiven the deep impression which Adeline's
graces had made on their brother, insisted on telling the
story ; to which Colonel Mordaunt listened with eager
and anxious curiosity. It received all the embellish-
ments which female malice could give it; and if it amused
any one, certainly that person was neither Mordaunt,
nor Emma Douglas, nor her gentle sister.
“But how fortunate it was,” added Miss Maynard,
“ that we were not with my brother! as we should un-
avoidably have walked and talked with this angel.”
Mordaunt longed to say, “ I think the good fortune
was all on Miss Mowbray's side.”
But Adeline and her cause were in good hands : Emma
Douglas stood forth as her champion.“ We feel very
differently on that subject,” she replied. “ I shall ever
regret, not that I saw and conversed with Miss Mowbray,
but that I did not see and converse with her again and
again.”
At this moment Emma was standing by Colonel Mor-
daunt, who involuntarily caught her hand and pressed
it eagerly; but tried to disguise his motives by suddenly
seating her in a chair behind her, saying, “ You had

better sit down ; I am sure you must be tired with stand-
ing so long.”
“ No; really, Emma,” cried Major Douglas, “ you
go too far there; though to be sure, if by seeing and
conversing with Miss Mowbray you could have convinced
her of her errors, I should not have objected to your
seeing her once more or so.”
“ Šurely,” said Mrs. Douglas timidly, “we ought,
my love, to have repeated our visits till we had made a
convert of her.”
“A convert of her !” exclaimed Mr. Maynard's sisters,
“ a convert of a kept mistress !” bursting into a violent
laugh, which had a most painful effect on the irritable
nerves of Colonel Mordaunt, whose tongue, parched
with emotion, cleaved to the roof of his mouth whenever
he attempted to speak.
“ Pray, to what other circumstance, yet untold, do
you allude ?” said Mr. Davenport.
“Oh, we too had a rencontre with the philosopher
and his charming friend,” said Major Douglas, “and
but, Emma, do you tell the story.--'Sdeath Poor
fellow !-Well, but we parted good friends," added
the kind-hearted Caledonian, dispersing a tear; while
Emma, in simple but impressive language, related all
that passed at Perpignan between themselves, Adeline,
and Glenmurray; and concluded with saying, that,
“ from the almost idolatrous respect with which Glen-
murray spoke and apparently thought of Adeline, and
from the account of her conduct and its motives, which
he so fully detailed, she was convinced that, so far from
being influenced by depravity in connecting herself with
Glenmurray, Adeline was the victim of a romantic,
absurd, and false conception of virtue ; and she should
have thought it her duty to have endeavoured, assisted
by her sister, to have prevailed on her to renounce her
opinions, and, by becoming the wife of Glenmurray, to
restore to the society of her own sex, a woman formed

287
to be its ornament and its example. “ Poor thing!" she
added in a faltering voice, “would that I knew her fate!”
“I can guess it, I tell you,” said Mrs. Wallington.
“ We had better drop the subject, madam,” replied
Emma Douglas indignantly, “as it is one that we shall
never agree upon. If I supposed Miss Mowbray happy,
I should feel for her, and feel interest sufficient in her
fate to make me combat your prejudices concerning her;
but now that she is perhaps afflicted, poor, friendless,
and scorned, though unjustly, by every virtuous she
that knows her story,' I cannot command my feelings
when she is named with sarcastic respect, nor can I
bear to hear an unhappy woman supposed to be plunged
in the lowest depths of vice, whom I, on the contrary,
believe to be at this moment atoning for the error of her
judgment by a life of lonely penitence, or sunk perhaps
already in the grave, the victim of a broken heart." '..
Colonel Mordaunt, affected and delighted, hung on
Emma Douglas's words with breathless attention, resolv-
ing when she had ended her narration to begin his, and
clear Adeline from the calumnies of Mrs. Wallington
and Miss Maynard : but after articulating with some
difficulty-"Ladies,-1-Miss Douglas,-1-” he found
that his feelings would not allow him to proceed: there-
fore, suddenly raising Emma's hand to his lips, imprinted
on it a kiss, at once fervent and respectful, and, making
a hasty bow, ran out of the house.
Every one was astonished; but none so much as
Emma Douglas.
“Why, Emma!” cried the major, “who should have
thought it? I verily believe you have turned Mordaunt's
head ;-I protest that he kissed your hand :-I suppose
he will be here to-morrow, making proposals in form.”
“I wish he may !” exclaimed Mrs. Douglas.
“It is not very likely, I think,” cried Miss Maynard.
Mrs. Wallington said nothing; but she fanned her-
self violently.

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ How do you know that ? said Maynard. He kissed
your hand very tenderly-did he not, Miss Douglas ?
and took advantage of the dark hour: that looks very
lover-like.”
Emma Douglas, who, in spite of her reason, was both
embarrassed and flattered by Colonel Mordaunt's unex-
pected mode of taking leave, said not a word ; but Mrs.
Wallington, in a voice hoarse with angry emotion, cried:
" It was very free in him, I think, and very unlike
Colonel Mordaunt; for he was not a sort of man to take
liberties but where he met with encouragement."
“ Then I am sure he would be free with you, sister,
sometimes,” sarcastically observed Miss Maynard.
“ Nay, with both of you, I think,” replied Maynard,
who had not forgiven the laugh at his expense which
they had tried to excite; on which an angry dialogue
took place between the brother and sisters : and the
Douglases, disgusted and provoked, retired to their
apartment.
“ There was something very strange and uncommon,"
said Mrs. Douglas, detaining Emma in her dressing-
room, “in Colonel Mordaunt's behaviour-Do you not
think so, Emma ?-If it should have any meaning !”
“Meaning!” cried the major: “what meaning should
it have? Why, my dear, do you think Mordaunt never
kissed a woman's hand before ?”
“But it was so particular.–Well, Emma, if it should
lead to consequences !” .
“ Consequences !” cried the major: “my dear girl,
what can you mean?”
“ Why, if he should really love our Emma?”
“Why then I hope our Emma will love him.- What
say you, Emma?”
“ I say?-12" she replied : “ really I never thought
it possible that Colonel Mordaunt should have any
thoughts of me, nor do I now ;-but it is very strange
that he should kiss my hand!”

The major could not help laughing at the naivete of
this reply, and in a mutual whisper they agreed how
much they wished to see their sister so happily disposed
of; while Emma paced up and down her own apartment
some time before she undressed herself; and after seeming
to convince herself, by recollecting all Colonel Mordaunt's
conduct towards her, that he could not possibly mean
any thing by his unusual adieu, she went to sleep, ex-
claiming, “But it is very strange that he should kiss
my hand !”
CHAPTER XXIV.
The next morning explained the mystery : for breakfast
was scarcely over, when Colonel Mordaunt appeared ;
and his presence occasioned a blush, from different
causes, on the cheeks of all the ladies, and a smile on
the countenances of both the gentlemen.
“ You left us very abruptly last night,” said Major
Douglas.
“ I did so," replied Mordaunt with a sort of grave
smile.
“ Were you taken ill?” asked Maynard.
“I-I was not quite easy,” answered he: “but,
Miss Douglas, may I request the honour of seeing you
alone for a few minutes ?”
Again the ladies blushed, and the gentlemen smiled.
But Emma's weakness had been temporary : she had
convinced herself that Colonel Mordaunt's action had
been nothing more than a tribute to what he fancied her
generous defence of an unfortunate woman : and with
an air of unembarrassed dignity she gave him her hand
to lead her into an adjoining apartment.
“This is very good of you,” cried Colonel Mordaunt:
“ but you are all goodness !—My dear Miss Douglas,

had I not gone away as I did last night, I believe I
should have fallen down and worshipped you, or com-
mitted some other extravagance.”
“ Indeed !- What could I say to excite such enthu-
siasm !” replied Emma deeply blushing.
“ What ! -Oh, Miss Douglas!”—Then after a few
more ohs, and other exclamations, he related to her the
whole progress of his acquaintance with an attachment
to Adeline, adding as he concluded, “ Now then judge
what feelings you must have excited in my bosom :-
yes, Miss Douglas, I reverenced you before for your own
sake, I now adore you for that of my lost Adeline.”
“So!” thought Emma, “ the kiss of the hand is
explained,”—and she sighed as she thought it; nor did
she much like the word reverenced: but she had ample
amends for her mortification by what followed.
“ Really,” cried Colonel Mordaunt, gazing very
earnestly at her, “ I do not mean to flatter you, but
there is something in your countenance that reminds me
very strongly of Adeline.”
* Is it possible?” said Emma, her cheeks glowing
and her eyes sparkling as she spoke: “ you may not
mean to flatter me, but I assure you I am flattered; for
I never saw any woman whom in appearance I so much
wished to resemble.”
“ You do resemble her indeed,” cried Colonel Mor-
daunt, “ and the likeness grows stronger and stronger.”
Emma blushed deeper and deeper.
“ But come,” exclaimed he,“ let us go; and I will —
no, you shall—relate to the party in the next room what
I have been telling you, for I long to shame those d ”
“ Fye!” said Emma smiling, and holding up her hand
as if to stop the coming word. And she did stop it;
for Colonel Mordaunt conveyed the reproving hand to
his lips; and Emma said to herself, as she half frowning
withdrew it, “ I am glad my brother was not present.”
Their return to the breakfast-room was welcome to

every one, from different causes, as Colonel Mordaunt's
motives for requesting a tête-à-tête had given rise to
various conjectures. But all conjecture was soon
lost in certainty : for Emma Douglas, with more than
usual animation of voice and countenance, related what
Colonel Mordaunt had authorized her to relate ; and the
envious sisters heard, with increased resentment, that
Adeline, were she unmarried, would be the choice of the
man whose affections they were eagerly endeavouring to
captivate.
* You can't think,” said Colonel Mordaunt, when
Emma had concluded, leaving him charmed with the
manner in which she had told his story, and with the
generous triumph which sparkled in her eyes at being
able to exhibit Adeline's character in so favourable a
point of view, “ you can't think how much Miss Douglas
reminds me of Mrs. Berrendale!”
“ Lord !” said Miss Maynard with a toss of the head,
“ my brother told us that she was handsome!”
“And so she is,” replied the colonel provoked at this
brutal speech : “ she has one of the finest countenances
that I ever saw,—a countenance never distorted by those
feelings of envy, and expressions of spite, which so often
disfigure some women,-converting even a beauty into a
fiend ; and in this respect no one will doubt that Miss
Douglas resembles her:
• What's female beauty-but an air divine,
Thro’ which the mind's all gentle graces shine ?'
says one of our first poets: therefore, in Dr. Young's
opinion, madam," continued Mordaunt, turning to Emma,
“ you would have been a perfect beauty.”
This speech, so truly gratifying to the amiable girl to
whom it was addressed, was a dagger in the heart of
both the sisters.. Nor was Emma's pleasure unalloyed
by pain ; for she feared that Mordaunt's attentions
might become dangerous to her peace of mind, as she

could not disguise to herself, that his visits at Mr.
Maynard's had been the chief cause of her reluctance to
return to Scotland whenever their journey home was
mentioned. For, always humble in her ideas of her
own charms, Emma Douglas could not believe that
Mordaunt would ever entertain any feeling for her at all
resembling love, except when he fancied that she looked
like Adeline.
But however unlikely it seemed that Mordaunt should
become attached to her, and however resolved she was
to avoid his society, certain it is that he soon found he
could be happy in the society of no other woman, since
to no other could he talk on the subject nearest his
heart ; and Emma, though blaming herself daily for her
temerity, could not refuse to receive Mordaunt's visits :
and her patient attention to his conversation, of which
Adeline was commonly the theme, seemed to have a
salutary effect on his wounded feelings.
But the time for their departure arrived, much to the
joy of Mrs. Wallington and her sister, who hoped when
Emma was gone to have a chance of being noticed by
Mordaunt.
What then must have been their confusion and disap-
pointment, when Colonel Mordaunt begged to be allowed
to attend the Douglases on their journey home, as he
had never seen the Highlands, and wished to see them
in such good company! Major Douglas and his charming
wife gave a glad consent to this proposal : but Emma
Douglas heard it with more alarm than pleasure ; for,
though her heart rejoiced at it, her reason condemned it.
A few days, however, convinced her apprehensive
delicacy, that, if she loved Colonel Mordaunt, it was not
without hope of a return.
Colonel Mordaunt declared that every day seemed to
increase her resemblance to Adeline in expression and
manner; and in conduct his reason told him that she
was her superior ; nor could he for a moment hesitate to

prefer as a wife, Emma Douglas who had never erred,
to Adeline who had.
Colonel Mordaunt felt, to borrow the words of a cele-
brated female writer, * that “ though it is possible to
love and esteem a woman who has expiated the faults of
her youth by a sincere repentance; and though before
God and man her errors may be obliterated; still there
exists one being in whose eyes she can never hope to
efface them, and that is her lover or her husband.” He
felt that no man of acute sensibility can be happy with
a woman whose recollections are not pure : she must
necessarily be jealous of the opinion which he entertains
of her; and he must be often afraid of speaking, lest he
utter a sentiment that may wound and mortify her.
Besides, he was, on just grounds, more desirous of
marrying a woman whom he “ admired, than one whom
he forgave;” and therefore, while he addressed Emma,
he no longer regretted Adeline.
In short, he at length ceased to talk of Emma's re-
semblance to Adeline, but seemed to admire her wholly
for her own sake; and having avowed his attachment, and
been assured of Emma's in return, by Major Douglas, he
came back to England in the ensuing autumn, the happy
husband of one of the best of women.
CHAPTER XXV.
We left Adeline preparing to address Mrs. Mowbray and
recommend her child to her protection :-but being
deeply impressed with the importance of the task which
she was about to undertake, she timidly put it off from
day to day; and having convinced herself that it was her
duty to endeavour to excite her busband to repentance,

and make him acknowledge Editha as his legitimate
child, she determined to write to him before she ad-
dressed her mother, and also to bid a last farewell to
Colonel Mordaunt, whose respectful attachment had
soothed some of the pangs which consciousness of her
past follies had inflicted, and whose active friendship
deserved her warmest acknowledgment. Little did she
think the fatal effect which one instance of his friendly
zeal in her cause had had on Berrendale ; unconscious
was she that the husband, whose neglect she believed to
be intentional, great as were his crimes against her, was
not guilty of the additional crime of suffering her to pine
in poverty without making a single inquiry concerning
her, but was convinced that both she and her child were
no longer in existence.
In her letter to him, she conjured him by the love
which he always bore Glenmurray, by the love he once
bore her, and by the remorse which he would sooner or
later feel for his conduct towards her and her child, to
acknowledge Editha to be his lawful heir, but to suffer
her to remain under that protection to which she meant
to bequeath her; and on these conditions she left him
her blessing, and her pardon.
The letter to Colonel Mordaunt was long, and perhaps
diffuse : but Adeline was jealous of his esteem, though
regardless of his love; and as he had known her while
acting under the influence of a fatal error of opinion,
she wished to show him that on conviction she had
abandoned her former way of thinking, and was candid
enough to own that she had been wrong.
" You, no doubt," she said, “are well acquainted with
the arguments urged by different writers in favour of
marriage. I shall therefore only mention the argument
which carried at length full conviction to my mind, and
conquered even my deep and heartfelt reverence for the
opinions of one who long was, and ever will be, the
dearest object of my love and regret. But he, had he

lived, would I am sure have altered his sentiments; and
had he been a parent, the argument I allude to, as it is
founded on a consideration of the interest of children,
would have found its way to his reason, through his
affections.
" It is evident that on the education given to children
must depend the welfare of the community; and, con-
sequently, that whatever is likely to induce parents to
neglect the education of their children must be hurtful
to the welfare of the community. It is also certain, that
though the agency of the passions be necessary to the
existence of all society, it is on the cultivation and
influence of the affections that the happiness and im-
provement of social life depend.
“Hence it follows that marriage must be more
beneficial to society in its consequences, than connexions
capable of being dissolved at pleasure ; because it has a
tendency to call forth and exercise the affections, and
control the passions. It has been said, that, were we
free to dissolve at will a connexion formed by love, we
should not wish to do it, as constancy is natural to us,
and there is in all of us a tendency to form an exclusive
attachment. But though I believe, from my own
experience, that the few are capable of unforced con-
stancy, and could love for life one dear and honoured
object, still I believe that the many are given to the love
of change ;—that, in men especially, a new object can
excite new passion ; and, judging from the increasing
depravity of both sexes, in spite of existing laws, and in
defiance of shame,–I am convinced, that if the ties of
marriage were dissolved, or it were no longer to be
judged infamous to act in contempt of them, unbridled
licentiousness would soon be in general practice. What,
then, in such a state of society, would be the fate of the
children born in it?-_What would their education be?
Parents continually engrossed in the enervating but
delightful egotism of a new and happy love, lost in selfish

indulgence, the passions awake, but the affections slam-
bering, and the sacred ties of parental feeling not having
time nor opportunity to fasten on the heart,—their
offspring would either die the victims of neglect, and the
very existence of the human race be threatened; or,
without morals or instruction, they would grow up to
scourge the world by their vices, till the whole fabric of
civilized society was gradually destroyed.
“On this ground, therefore, this strong ground, I
venture to build my present opinion, that marriage is a
wise and ought to be a sacred institution ; and I bitterly
regret the hour when, with the hasty and immature
judgment of eighteen, and with a degree of presumption
scarcely pardonable at any time of life, I dared to think
and act contrary to this opinion and the reverend
experience of ages, and became in the eyes of the world
an example of vice, when I believed myself the champion
of virtue.”
She then went on to express the following sentiments.
“ You will think, perhaps, that I ought to struggle
against the weakness which is hurrying me to the grave,
and live for the sake of my child.-Alas! it is for her
sake that I most wish to die.
“ There are two ways in which a mother can be of use
to her daughter: the one is by instilling into her mind
virtuous principles, and by setting her a virtuous example:
the other is, by being to her in her own person an awful
warning, a melancholy proof of the dangers which attend
a deviation from the path of virtue. But, oh! how
jealous must a mother be of her child's esteem and
veneration ! and how could she bear to humble herself in
the eyes of the beloved object, by avowing that she had
committed crimes against society, however atoned for
by penitence and sorrow! I can never, now, be a correct
example for my Editha, nor could I endure to live to be
a warning to her.—Nay, if I lived, I should be most
probably a dangerous example to her; for I should be

(on my death-bed I think I may be allowed the boast)
respected and esteemed; while the society around me
would forget my past errors, in the sincerity of my
repentance.
" If then a strong temptation should assail my child,
might she not yield to it from an idea that one false
step may be retrieved,' and cite her mother as an example
of this truth? while, unconscious of the many secret
heart-aches of that repentant mother, unconscious of the
sorrows and degradations she had experienced, she
regarded nothing but the present respectability of her
mother's life, and contented herself with hoping one day
to resemble her.
“Believe me, that were it possible for me to choose
between life and death, for my child's sake, the choice
would be the latter. Now, when she shall see in my
mournful and eventful history, written as it has been by
me in moments of melancholy leisure, that all my sorrows
were consequent on one presumptuous error of judgment
in early youth, and shall see a long and minute detail of
the secret agonies which I have endured, those agonies
wearing away my existence, and ultimately hurrying me
to an untimely grave; she will learn that the woman who
feels justly, yet has been led even into the practice of
vice, however she may be forgiven by others, can never
forgive herself; and though she may dare to lift an eye
of hope to that Being who promises pardon on repent-
ance, she will still recollect with anguish the fair and
glorious course which she might have run: and that,
instead of humbly imploring forbearance and forgiveness,
she might have demanded universal respect and esteem.
“ True it is, that I did not act in defiance of the
world's opinion, from any depraved feeling, or vicious
inclinations : but the world could not be expected to
believe this, since motives are known only to our own
hearts, and the great Searcher of hearts : therefore, as
far as example goes, I was as great a stumbling-block to

others as if the life I led had been owing to the influence
of lawless desires ; and society was right in making, and
in seeing, no distinction between me and any other woman
living in an unsanctioned connexion.
“But methinks I hear you say, that Editha might
never be informed of my past errors. Alas! wretched
must that woman be whose happiness and respectability
depend on the secrecy of others ! Besides, did I not
think the concealment of crime in itself a crime, how
could I know an hour of peace while I reflected that a
moment's malice, or inadvertency, in one of Editha's
companions might cause her to blush at her mother's
disgrace?—that, while her young cheek was flushed
perhaps with the artless triumphs of beauty, talent, and
virtue, the parent who envied me, or the daughter who
envied her might suddenly convert her joy into anguish
and mortification, by artfully informing her, with feigned
pity for my sorrows and admiration of my penitence,
that I had once been a disgrace to that family of which
I was now the pride ?-No-even if I were not for ever
separated in this world from the only man whom I ever
loved with passionate and well-founded affection, united
for life to the object of my just aversion, and were I
not conscious (horrible and overwhelming thought !) of
having by my example led another into the path of sin,
--still, I repeat it, for my child's sake I should wish
to die, and should consider, not early death, but
lengthened existence, as a curse.”
So Adeline reasoned and felt in her moments of
reflection : but the heart had sometimes dominion over
her; and as she gazed on Editha, and thought that Mrs.
Mowbray might be induced to receive her again to her
favour, she wished even on any terms to have her life
prolonged.

CHAPTER XXVI.
HAVING finished her letter to Colonel Mordaunt and
Berrendale, she again prepared to write to her mother ;
a few transient fears overcoming every now and then
those hopes of success in her application, which, till she
took up her pen, she had so warmly encouraged.
Alas! little did she know how erroneously for years
she had judged of Mrs. Mowbray. Little did she suspect
that her mother had long forgiven her; had pined after
her; had sought, though in vain, to procure intelligence
of her; and was then wearing away her existence in
solitary woe, a prey to self-reproach, and to the corroding
fear that her daughter, made desperate by her renunciation
of her, had, on the death of Glenmurray, plunged into
a life of shame, or sunk, broken-hearted, into the grave !
for not one of Adeline's letters had ever reached Mrs.
Mowbray; and the mother and daughter had both been
the victims of female treachery and jealousy.
Mrs. Mowbray, as soon as she had parted with Adeline
for the last time, had dismissed all her old servants, the
witnesses of her sorrows and disgrace, and retired to
her estate in Cumberland, an estate where Adeline had
first seen the light, and where Mrs. Mowbray had first
experienced the transports of a mother. This spot was
therefore ill calculated to banish Adeline from her mother's
thoughts, and to continue her seclusion from her
affections.
On the contrary, her image haunted Mrs. Mowbray:
--whithersoever she went, she still saw her in an attitude
of supplication; she still heard the plaintive accents of her
voice ;--and often did she exclaim, “My child, my child!
wretch that I am! must I never see thee more !"
These ideas increased to so painful a degree, that,
finding her solitude insupportable, she invited an orphan

relation in narrow circumstances to take up her abode
with her.
This young woman, whose ruling passion was avarice,
and whose greatest talent was cunning, resolved to spare
no pains to keep the situation which she had gained,
even to the exclusion of Adeline, should Mrs. Mowbray
be weak enough to receive her again. She therefore
intercepted all the letters which were in or like Adeline's
hand-writing; and having learnt toimitate Mrs. Mowbray's,
she enclosed them in a blank cover to Adeline, who,
thinking the direction was written in her mother's hand,
desisted, as the artful girl expected she would do, from
what appeared to her a hopeless application.
And she exulted in her contrivance ;—when Mrs.
Mowbray, on seeing in a magazine that Glenmurray was
dead, (full a year after his decease,) bursting into a
passion of tears, protested that she would instantly invite
Adeline to her house.
“ Yes,” cried she, “ I can do so without infringement
of my oath.—She is disgraced in the eye of the world
by her connexion with Glenmurray, and she is wretched
in love; nay, more so, perhaps, than I have been ; and
I can, I will invite her to lose the remembrance of her
misfortunes in my love!”
Thus did her ardent wish to be re-united to Adeline
deceive her conscience; for by the phrase " wretched in
love,” she meant, forsaken by the object of her attach-
ment, and that Adeline had not been : therefore her
oath remained in full force against her. But where could
she seek Adeline ?—Dr. Norberry could, perhaps, give
her this information; and to him she resolved to write-
though he had cast her from his acquaintance: “ but
her pride,” as she said, “ fell with her fortunes ;” and
she scrupled not to humble herself before the zealous
friend of her daughter. But this letter would never
have reached him, had not her treacherous relation been
ill at the time when it was written.

Dr. Norberry had recovered the illness of which Adeline
supposed him to have died: but as her letter to him, to
which she received no answer, alluded to the money
transaction between her and Mrs. Norberry; and as she
commented on the insulting expressionsin Mrs. Norberry's
note, that lady thought proper to suppress the second
letter as well as the first ; and when the doctor, on his
recovery, earnestly demanded to know whether any
intelligence had been received of Miss Mowbray, Mrs.
Norberry, with pretended reluctance, told him that she
had written to him in great distress, while he was
delirious, to borrow money; that she had sent her ten
pounds, which Adeline had returned, reproaching her
for her parsimony, and saying that she had found a friend
who would not suffer her to want.
“But did you tell her that you thought me in great
danger ?”
« I did.”
“ Why, what, woman ! did she not, after that, write
to know how I was?”
" Never.”
“ I could not have thought it of her!” answered the
doctor—who could not but believe this story for the sake
of his own peace, as it was less destructive to his
happiness to think Adeline in fault, than his wife or
children guilty of profligate falsehood : he therefore, with
a deep sigh, begged Adeline's name might never be
mentioned to him again ; and though he secretly wished
to hear of her welfare, he no longer made her the
subject of conversation.
But Mrs. Mowbray's letter recalled her powerfully
both to his memory and affections, while, with many a
deep-drawn sigh, he regretted that he had no possible
means of discovering where she was ;—and with a heavy
heart he wrote the following letter, which Miss Woodville,
Mrs. Mowbray's relation, having first contrived to
open and read it, ventured to give into her hands,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
as it contained no satisfactory information concerning
Adeline.
“I look on the separation of my mother and me in
this world to be eternal,” said the poor dear lost Adeline
to me, the last time we met. “You do!” replied I:
“ then, poor devil! how miserable will your mother be
when her resentment subsides !-Well, when that time
comes, I may, perhaps see her again,” added I, with a
queer something rising in my throat as I said it, and
your poor girl blessed me for the kind intention.—(Pshaw!
I have blotted the paper: at my years it is a shame to
be so watery-eyed.) Well,—the time above-mentioned
is come-you are miserable, you are repentant-and you
ask me to forget and forgive.--I do forget, I do forgive :
some time or other, too, I will tell you so in person;
and were the lost Adeline to know that I did so, she
would bless me for the act, as she did before for the
intention. But, alas ! where she is, what she is, I
know not, and have not any means of knowing. To
say the truth, her conduct to me and mine has been
odd, not to say wrong. But, poor thing! she is either
dead or miserable, and I forgive her :-80 I do you, as I
said before, and the Lord give you all the consolation
which you so greatly need !
Yours once more,
In true kindness of spirit,
JAMES NORBERRY.”
This letter made Mrs. Mowbray's wounds bleed afresh,
at the same time that it destroyed all her expectations of
finding Adeline; and the only hope that remained to
cheer her was, that she might perhaps, if yet alive,
write sooner or later, to implore forgiveness, but month
after month elapsed, and no tidings of Adeline reached
her despairing mother.
She then put an advertisement in the paper, so worded
that Adeline, had she seen it, must have known to whom

it alluded; but it never met her eyes, and Mrs. Mowbray
gave herself up to almost absolute despair; when
accident introduced her to a new acquaintance, whose
example taught her patience, and whose soothing
benevolence bade her hope for happier days.
One day as Mrs. Mowbray, regardless of a heavy
shower, and lost in melancholy reflections, was walking
with irregular steps on the road to Penrith, with an
unopened umbrella in her hand, she suddenly raised her
eyes from the ground, and beheld a Quaker lady pur-
sued by an over-driven bullock, and unable any longer
to make an effort to escape its fury. At this critical
moment Mrs. Mowbray, from a sort of irresistible
impulse, as fortunate in its effects as presence of mind,
yet scarcely perhaps to be denominated such, suddenly
opened her umbrella ; and, approaching the animal,
brandished it before his eyes. Alarmed at this unusual
appearance, he turned hastily and ran towards the town,
where she saw that he was immediately met and
secured.
“ Thou hast doubtless saved my life," said the Quaker,
grasping Mrs. Mowbray's hand with an emotion which
she vainly tried to suppress ; "and I pray that thine
may be blest!”
Mrs. Mowbray returned the pressure of her hand,
and burst into tears; overcome with joy for having
saved a fellow-creature's life; with terror, which she was
now at leisure to feel for the danger to which she had
herself been exposed; and with mournful emotion from
the consciousness how much she needed the blessing
which the grateful Quaker invoked on her head.
“ Thou tremblest even more than I do,” observed the
lady, smiling, but seeming ready to faint ; “I believe we
had better, both of us, sit down on the bank; but it is
So wet that perhaps we may as well endeavour to reach
my house, which is only at the end of yon field.” Mrs.
Mowbray bowed her assent; and, supporting each other,

they at length arrived at a neat white house, to which
the Quaker cordially bade her welcome.
“ It was but this morning,” said Mrs. Mowbray,
struggling for utterance, “ that I called upon Death to
relieve me from an existence at once wretched and
useless.” Here she paused :- and her new acquaint-
ance, cordially pressing her hand, waited for the con-
clusion of her speech ;-“ but now,” continued Mrs.
Mowbray, “I revoke, and repent my idle and vicious
impatience of life. I have probably saved your life, and
something like enjoyment now seems to enliven mine.”
“I suspect,” replied the lady, “ that thou hast
known deep affliction; and I rejoice that at this moment,
and in so providential a manner, I have been introduced
to thy acquaintance :--for I too have known sorrow,
and the mourner knows how to speak comfort to the
heart of the mourner. My name is Rachel Pemberton;
and I hope that when I know thy name, and thy story,
thou wilt allow me to devote to thy comfort some hours
of the existence which thou hast preserved.” She then
hastily withdrew, to pour forth in solitude the breathings
of devout gratitude :-while Mrs. Mowbray, having com-
muned with her own thoughts, felt a glow of unwonted
satisfaction steal over her mind; and by the time Mrs.
Pemberton returned, she was able to meet her with
calmness and cheerfulness.
“ Thou knowest my name," said Mrs. Pemberton as
she entered, seating herself by Mrs. Mowbray, “but I
have yet to learn thine.”
“ My name is Mowbray,” she replied sighing deeply.
“ Mowbray !—The lady of Rosevalley in Gloucester-
shire; and the mother of Adeline Mowbray ?” exclaimed
Mrs. Pemberton.
“ What of Adeline Mowbray? What of my child ?”
cried Mrs. Mowbray, seizing Mrs. Pemberton's hand.
“ Blessed woman! tell me,- Do you indeed know her ?
-can you tell me where to find her?”

“I will tell thee all that I know of her,” replied
Mrs. Pemberton in a faltering voice; “but thy emotion
overpowers me.-I-I was once a mother, and I can feel
for thee.” She then turned away her head to conceal a
starting tear; while Mrs. Mowbray, in incoherent eager-
ness, repeated her questions, and tremblingly awaited
her answer.
“ Is she well? Is she happy !-say but that!” she
exclaimed, sobbing as she spoke.
“ She was well and contented when I last heard from
her, replied Mrs. Pemberton calmly.
“ Heard from her ? Then she writes to you! Oh,
blessed, blessed woman! show me her letters, and tell
me only that she has forgiven me for all my unkindness
to ber=” As she said this, Mrs. Mowbray threw her
arms round Mrs. Pemberton, and sunk half-fainting on
her shoulder.
« I will tell thee all that has ever passed between us,
if thou wilt be composed,” gravely answered Mrs. Pem-
berton; “ but this violent expression of thy feelings is
unseemly and detrimental.”
“ Well—well—I will be calm,” said Mrs. Mowbray;
and Mrs. Pemberton began to relate the interview which
she had with Adeline at Richmond.
“ How long ago did this take place ?” eagerly inter-
rupted Mrs. Mowbray.
* Full six years."
“Oh, God !” exclaimed she, impatiently,—“. Six
years! By this time then she may be dead—she
may-
- Thou art incorrigible, I fear,” said Mrs. Pem-
berton, “but thou art afflicted, and I will bear with
thy impatience :—sit down again and attend to me,
and thou wilt hear much later intelligence of thy
daughter."

eagerness ;—and Mrs. Pemberton, overcome with the

manner in which she spoke, could scarcely falter out,
“ Within a twelvemonth I have heard of her.”
“ Within a twelvemonth!” joyfully cried Mrs. Mow-
bray: but, recollecting herself, she added mournfully-
but in that time what-what may not have happened!”
« I know not what to do with thee nor for thee,”
observed Mrs. Pemberton; “but do try, I beseech thee,
to hear me patiently!”
Mrs. Mowbray then re-seated herself; and Mrs. Pem-
berton informed her of Adeline's premature confinement
at Richmond ; of her distress on Glenmurray's death,
and of her having witnessed it.
“ Ah! you acted a mother's part—you did what I
ought to have done,” cried Mrs. Mowbray, bursting into
tears, but, go on-I will be patient."
Yet that was impossible ; for, when she heard of
Adeline's insanity, her emotions became so strong that
Mrs. Pemberton, alarmed for her life, was obliged to
ring for assistance.
When she recovered, " Thou hast heard the worst
now," said Mrs. Pemberton, “and all I have yet to say
of thy child is satisfactory."
She then related the contents of Adeline's first letter,
informing her of her marriage :-and Mrs. Mowbray,
clasping her hands together, blessed God that Adeline
was become a wife. The next letter Mrs. Pemberton
read informed her that she was the mother of a fine girl.
“A mother!” she exclaimed, “Oh, how I should
like to see her child!”-But at the same moment she
recollected how bitterly she had reviled her when she
saw her about to become a mother, at their last meeting ;
and, torn with conflicting emotions, she was again insen-
sible to aught but her self-upbraidings.
“ Well—but where is she now? where is the child?
and when did you hear from her last?” cried she.
“I have not heard from her since," hesitatingly
replied Mrs. Pemberton.

“ But can't you write to her ?”
“ Yes ;-but in her last letter she said she was going
to change her lodgings, and would write again when
settled in a new habitation.”
Again Mrs. Mowbray paced the room in wild and
violent distress : but her sorrows at length yielded to
the gentle admonitions and soothings of Mrs. Pemberton,
who bade her remember, that when she rose in the
morning she had not expected the happiness and conso-
lation which she had met with that day; and that a
short time might bring forth still greater comfort.
« For," said Mrs. Pemberton, “ I can write to the
house where she formerly lodged, and perhaps the person
who keeps it can give us intelligence of her.”
On hearing this, Mrs. Mowbray became more composed,
and diverted her sorrow by a thousand fond inquiries con-
cerning Adeline, which none but a mother could make,
and none but a mother could listen to with patience.
While this conversation was going on, a knock at the
door was heard, and Miss Woodville entered the room in
great emotion ; for she had heard, on the road, that a
mad bullock had attacked a lady; and also that Mrs.
Mowbray, scarcely able to walk, had been led into the
white house in the field by the road side.
Miss Woodville was certainly as much alarmed as she
pretended to be : but there was a somewhat in the ex-
pression of her alarm which, though it gratified Mrs.
Mowbray, was displeasing to the more penetrating Mrs.
Pemberton. She could not indeed guess that Miss
Woodville's alarm sprung merely from apprehension lest
Mrs. Mowbray should die before she had provided for
her in her will: yet, notwithstanding, she felt that her
expressions of concern and anxiety had no resemblance
to those of real affection; and in spite of her habitual
candour, she beheld Miss Woodville with distrust.
But this feeling was considerably increased on ob-
serving, that when Mrs. Mowbray exultingly introduced

her, not only as the lady whose life she had been the
means of preserving, but as the friend and correspondent
of her daughter, she evidently changed colour ; and, in
spite of her habitual plausibility, could not utter a single
coherent sentence of pleasure or congratulation :-and it
was also evident, that, being conscious of Mrs. Pem-
berton's regarding her with a scrutinizing eye, she was
not easy till, on pretence of Mrs. Mowbray's requiring
rest after her alarm, she had prevailed on her to returi
home.
But she could not prevent the new friends from parting
with eager assurances of meeting again and again ; and
it was agreed between them, that Mrs. Pemberton should
spend the next day at the Lawn.
Mrs. Pemberton, who is thus again introduced to the
notice of my readers, had been, as well as Mrs. Mowbray,
the pupil of adversity. She had been born and educated
in fashionable life; and she united to a very lovely face
and elegant form, every feminine grace and accomplish-
ment.
When she was only eighteen, Mr. Pemberton, a young
and gay Quaker, fell in love with her; and having in-
spired her with a mutual passion, he married her, not-
withstanding the difference of their religious opinions,
and the displeasure of his friends. He was consequently
disowned by the society: but being weaned by the hap-
piness which he found at home from those public amuse-
ments which had first lured him from the strict habits of
his sect, he was soon desirous of being again admitted a
member of it; and in process of time he was once more
received into it ; while his amiable wife, having no wish
beyond her domestic circle, and being disposed to think
her husband's opinions right, became in time a convert
to the same profession of faith, and exhibited in her
manners the rare union of the easy elegance of a woman
of the world with the rigid decorum and unadorned dress
of a strict Quaker.

But in the midst of her happiness, and whilst looking
forward to a long continuance of it, a fever, caught in
visiting the sick bed of a cottager, carried off her husband,
and next two lovely children ; and Mrs. Pemberton
would have sunk under the stroke, but for the watchful
care and affectionate attentions of the friend of her youth,
who resided near her, and who, in time, prevailed on
her to receive with becoming fortitude and resignation
the trials which she was appointed to undergo.
During this season of affliction, as we have before
stated, she became a minister in the Quaker society: but
at the time of her meeting Adeline at Richmond, she
had been called from the duties of her public profession
to watch over the declining health of her friend and
consoler, and to accompany her to Lisbon.
There, during four long years, she bent over her sick
couch, now elated with hope, and now sunk into
despondence; when, at the beginning of the fifth year,
her friend died in her arms, and she returned to England,
resolved to pass her days, except when engaged in active
duties, on a little estate in Cumberland, bequeathed to
her by her friend on her death-bed. But ill health and
various events had detained her in the west of England
since her return ; and she had not long taken possession
of her house near Penrith, when she became introduced
in so singular a manner to Mrs. Mowbray's acquaintance
-an acquaintance which would, she hoped, prove of
essential service to them both ; and as soon as her guest
departed, Mrs. Pemberton resolved to inquire what
character Mrs. Mowbray bore in the neighbourhood, and
whether her virtues at all kept pace with her misfortunes.
Her inquiries were answered in the most satisfactory
manner; as, fortunately for Mrs. Mowbray, with the
remembrance of her daughter had recurred to her that
daughter's benevolent example. She remembered the
satisfaction which used to beam from Adeline's coun-
tenance when she returned from her visits to the sick

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
and the afflicted ; and she resolved to try whether those
habits of charitable exertion which could increase the
happiness of the young and light-hearted Adeline, might
not have power to alleviate the sorrows of her own
drooping age, and broken joyless heart.
“Sweet are the uses of adversity!”-She who, while
the child of prosperity, was a romantic, indolent theorist,
an inactive speculator, a proud contemner of the dictates
of sober experience, and a neglecter of that practical
benevolence which can in days produce more benefit to
others than theories and theorists can accomplish in
years—this erring woman, awakened from her dreams
and reveries, to habits of useful exertion, by the stimu-
lating touch of affliction, was become the visitor of the
sick, the consoler of the sorrowful, the parent of the
fatherless, while virtuous industry looked up to her with
hope; and her name, like that of Adeline in happier
days, was pronounced with prayers and blessings.
But, alas ! she felt that blessing could reach her only
in the shape of her lost child : and though she was con-
scious of being useful to others, though she had the
satisfaction of knowing that she had but the day before
been the means of preserving a valuable life, she met
Mrs. Pemberton, when she arrived at the Lawn, with a
countenance of fixed melancholy, and was at first disposed
to expect but little success from the project of writing to
Adeline's former lodgings in order to inquire. .
The truth was, that Miss Woodville had artfully
insinuated the improbability of such an inquiry's suc-
ceeding; and, though Mrs. Mowbray had angrily asserted
her hopes when Miss Woodville provokingly asserted her
fears, the treacherous girl's insinuations had sunk deeply
into her mind, and Mrs. Pemberton saw, with pain and
wonder, an effect produced of which the cause was
wholly unseen. But she at length succeeded in awaken-
ing Mrs. Mowbray's hopes; and in a letter written by
Mrs. Pemberton to the mistress of the house whence

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
311
Adeline formerly dated, she enclosed one to her daughter
glowing with maternal tenderness, and calculated to
speak peace to her sorrows.
These letters were sent, as soon as written, to the post
by Mrs. Mowbray's footman ; but Miss Woodville con-
trived to meet him near the post-office, and telling him
she would put the letter in the receiver, she gave him a
commission to call at a shop in Penrith for her, at which
she had not time to call herself.
: Thus was another scheme for restoring Adeline to her
afflicted mother frustrated by the treachery of this
interested woman; who, while Mrs. Pemberton and Mrs.
Mowbray looked anxiously forward to the receipt of an
answer from London, triumphed with malignant pleasure
in the success of her artifice.--But, spite of herself, she
feared Mrs. Pemberton, and was not at all pleased to
find that, till the answer from London could arrive, that
lady was to remain at the Lawn.
She contrived, however, to be as little in her presence
as possible ; for, contrary to Mrs. Pemberton's usual
habits, she felt a distrust of Miss Woodville, which her
intelligent eye could not help expressing, and which con-
sequently alarmed the conscious heart of the culprit.
Being left therefore, by Miss Woodville's fears, alone
with Mrs. Mowbray, she drew from her, at different
times, ample details of Adeline's childhood, and the
method which Mrs. Mowbray had pursued in her
education. ,
"Ah! 'tis as I suspected,”' interrupted Mrs. Pemberton
during one of these conversations. “Thy daughter's
faults originated in thee! her education was cruelly
defective."
“No!” replied Mrs. Mowbray with almost angry
eagerness, “whatever my errors as a mother have been,
and for the rash, marriage which I made I own myself
culpable in the highest degree, I am sure that I paid the
greatest attention to my daughter's education. If you

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
were but to see the voluminous manuscript on the subject,
which I wrote for her improvement-
“But where was thy daughter; and how was she
employed during the time that thou wert writing a book
by which to educate her ?”
Mrs. Mowbray was silent: she recollected that, while
she was gratifying her own vanity in composing her
system of education, Adeline was almost banished her
presence; and, but for the humble instruction of her
grandmother, would, at the age of fifteen, have run a
great risk of being both an ignorant and useless being.
“Forgive me, friend Mowbray,” resumed Mrs. Pem-
berton, aware in some measure of what was passing in
Mrs. Mowbray's mind—“forgive me if I venture to
observe, that till of late years a thick curtain of self-love
seems to have been dropped between thy heart and
maternal affection. It is now, and now only, that thou
hast learned to feel like a true and affectionate mother !”
“Perhaps you are right,” replied Mrs. Mowbray
mournfully, “still, I always meant well; and hoped that
my studies would conduce to the benefit of my child.”
"So they might, perhaps, to that of thy second, third,
or fourth child, hadst thou been possessed of so many;
but, in the meanwhile, thy first-born must have been
fatally neglected. A child's education begins almost
from the hour of its birth; and the mother who under-
stands her task, knows that the circumstances which
every moment calls forth, are the tools with which she
is to work in order to fashion her child's mind and cha-
racter. What would you think of the farmer who was
to let his fields lie fallow for years, while he was employed
in contriving a method of cultivating land to increase
his gains ten-fold ?”
"But I did not suffer Adeline's mind to lie fallow.-
I allowed her to read, and I directed her studies.”
· "Thou didst so ; but what were those studies ? and
didst thou acquaint thyself with the deductions which

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
313
her quick mind formed from them ? No-thou didst
not, as parents should do, inquire into the impressions
made on thy daughter's mind by the books which she
perused. Prompt to feel, and hasty to decide, as Adeline
was, how necessary was to her the warning voice of
judgment and experience!”
." But how could I imagine that a girl so young should
dare to act, whatever her opinions might be, in open
defiance of the opinions of the world ?”
. “But she had not lived in the world; therefore,
scarcely knew how repugnant to it her opinions were;
nor, as she did not mix in general society, could she
care sufficiently for its good opinion, to be willing to act
contrary to her own ideas of right, rather than forfeit
it: besides, thou ownest that thou didst openly profess
thy admiration of the sentiments which she adopted ;
nor, till they were confirmed irrevocably hers, didst thou
declare, that to act up to them was, in thy opinion,
vicious. And then it was too late : she thought thy
timidity, and not thy wisdom, spoke, and she set thee
the virtuous example of acting up to the dictates of con-
science. But Adeline and thou are both the pupils of
affliction and experience; and I trust that, all your
errors repented of, you will meet once more to expiate
your past follies by your future conduct.”
“I hope so too,” meekly replied Mrs. Mowbray, whose
pride had been completely subdued by self-upbraidings
and distress : “Oh! when-when will an answer arrive
from London ?”
CHAPTER XXVII.
ALAS! day after day elapsed, and no letter came; but
while Mrs. Mowbray was almost frantic with disappoint-
ment and anxiety, Mrs. Pemberton thought that she

314
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
observed in Miss Woodville's countenance a look of
triumphant malice, which ill accorded with the fluent
expressions of sympathy and regret with which she
gratified her unsuspicious relation, and she determined
to watch her very narrowly ; for she thought it strange
that Adeline, however she might respect her mother's
oath, should never, in the bitterness of her sorrows, have
unburthened her heart by imparting them to her: one
day, when, as usual, the post had been anxiously expected,
and, as usual, had brought no letter from London con-
cerning Adeline; and while Miss Woodville was talking
on indifferent subjects with ill suppressed gaiety, though
Mrs. Mowbray, sunk into despondence, was lying on the
sofa by her; Mrs. Pemberton suddenly exclaimed-
“There is only one right way of proceeding, friend
Mowbray,-tbou and I must go to London, and make
our inquiries in person, and then we shall have a great
chance of succeeding.” As she said this, she looked
steadfastly at Miss Woodville, and saw her turn very
pale, while her eye was hastily averted from the
penetrating glance of Mrs. Pemberton; and when she
heard Mrs. Mowbray, in a transport of joy, declare that
they had better set off that very evening,-unable to
conceal her terror and agitation, she hastily left the
room.
Mrs. Pemberton instantly followed her into the apart-
ment to which she had retired, and the door of which
she had closed with much violence. She found her
walking to and fro, and wringing her hands, as if in
agony. On seeing Mrs. Pemberton, she started, and
sinking into a chair, she complained of being very ill,
and desired to be left alone.
“Thou art ill, and thy illness is of the worst sort, I
fear,” replied Mrs. Pemberton ; “but I will stay, and be.
thy physician.”
* You, my physician ?" replied Miss Woodville, with
fury in her looks; “You?”

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
315
“Yes-I-I see that thou art afraid lest Adeline
should be restored to her paternal roof.”
“ Who told you so, officious, insolent woman ?”
returned Miss Woodville.
“ Thy own looks—but all this is very natural in thee :
thou fearest that Adeline's favour should annihilate
thine.”
“ Perhaps I do," cried Miss Woodville, a little less
alarmed, and catching at this plausible excuse for her
uneasiness ; “ for, should I be forced to leave my cousin's
house, I shall be reduced to comparative poverty and
solitude again.”
“ But why shouldest thou be forced to leave it? Art
thou not Adeline's friend ?”
“ Ye-yes,” faltered out Miss Woodville.
“ But it is uncertain whether we can find Adeline
still we shall be very diligent in our inquiries ; yet it is
so strange that she should never have written to her
mother, if alive, that perhaps—"
“Oh, I day say she is dead,” hastily interrupted Miss
Woodville.
“ Has she been dead long, thinkest thou ?”
“ No—not long—not above six months, I dare say.”
“ No!—Hast thou any reason then for knowing that
she was alive six months ago ?” asked Mrs. Pemberton,
looking steadily at Miss Woodville, as she spoke.
“I?-Lord-no-How should I know?" she replied,
her lip quivering, and her whole frame trembling.
“ I tell thee how.-Art thou not conscious of having
intercepted letters from thy cousin to her relenting
parent?” .
Mrs. Pemberton had scarcely uttered these words,
when Miss Woodville fell back nearly insensible in her
chair-a proof that the accusation was only too well
founded. As soon as she recovered, Mrs. Pemberton
said, with great gentleness, “ Thou art ill,-ill indeed,
but, as I suspected, thy illness is of the mind; there is

316
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
a load of guilt on it; throw it off then by a full confes-
sion, and be the sinner that repenteth.”
In a few moments Miss Woodville, conscious that her
emotion had betrayed her, and suspecting that Mrs.
Pemberton had by some means or other received hints of
her treachery, confessed that she had intercepted and
destroyed letters from Adeline to her mother; and also
owned, to the great joy of Mrs. Pemberton, that
Adeline's last letter, the letter in which she informed
Mrs. Mowbray, that all the conditions were then fulfilled,
without which alonė she had sworn never to forgive her,
had arrived only two months before; and that it was
dated from such a street, and such a number, in
London."
“ My poor friend will be so happy!” said Mrs.
Pemberton ; and, her own eyes filling with tears of joy,
she hastened to find Mrs. Mowbray.
“ But what will become of me?" exclaimed Miss
Woodville, detaining her—“ I am ruined-ruined for
ever!”
“ Not so," replied Mrs. Pemberton, “thou art saved,
- saved, I trust, for ever.—Thou hast confessed thy
guilt, and made all the atonement now in thy power.
Go to thine own room, and I will soon make known to
thee thy relation's sentiments towards thee."
So saying, she hastened to Mrs. Mowbray, whom she
found giving orders, with eager impatience, to have
post horses sent for immediately.
“ Then thou art full of expectation, I conclude, from
the event of our journey to town?” said Mrs. Pemberton,
smiling.
“To be sure I am,” replied Mrs. Mowbray.
“ And so am I,” she answered, "for I think that I
know the present abode of thy daughter.”
Mrs. Mowbray started—her friend's countenance
expressed more joy and exultation than she had ever
seen on it before ; and, almost breathless with new

317
hope, she seized her hand and conjured her to explain
herself.
The explanation was soon given ; and Mrs. Mowbray's
joy, in consequence of it, unbounded.
“ But what is thy will,” observed Mrs. Pemberton,
“ with regard to thy guilty relation?”
“I cannot-cannot see her again now, if ever ;--and
she must immediately leave my house."
“ Immediately?”
“ Yes, but I will settle on her a handsome allowance;
for my conscience tells me, that, had I behaved like a
mother to my child, no one could have been tempted to
injure her thus.-I put this unhappy woman into a state
of temptation, and she yielded to it :--but I feel only too
sensibly, that no one has been such an enemy to my
poor Adeline as I have been ; nor, conscious of my
own offences towards her, dare I resent those of
another.”
“I love, I honour thee for what thou hast now uttered,"
cried Mrs. Pemberton with unusual animation.-" I see
that thou art now indeed a Christian; such are the breath-
ings of a truly contrite spirit; and, verily, she who can so
easily forgive the crimes of others may hope to have her
own forgiven.”
Mrs. Pemberton then hastened to speak hope and
comfort to the mind of the penitent offender, while Mrs.
Mowbray ran to meet her servant, who, to her surprise,
was returning without horses, for none were to be
procured ; and Mrs. Mowbray saw herself obliged to
delay her journey till noon the next day, when she was
assured of having horses from Penrith. But when, after
a long and restless night, she arose in the morning,
anticipating with painful impatience the hour of her
departure, Mrs. Pemberton entered her room, and in-
formed her that she had passed nearly all the night at
Miss Woodville's bed-side, who had been seized with a
violent delirium at one o'clock in the morning, and in

318
ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
her ravings was continually calling on Mrs. Mowbray,
and begging to see her once more.
“I will see her directly,” replied Mrs. Mowbray,
without a moment's hesitation ; and hastened to Miss
Woodville's apartment, where she found the medical
attendant whom Mrs. Pemberton had sent for just arrived.
He immediately declared the disorder to be an inflam-
mation on the brain, and left them with little or no hope
of her recovery.
Mrs. Mowbray, affected beyond measure at the pathetic
appeals for pardon addressed to her continually by the
unconscious sufferer, took her station at the bed-side ;
and, hanging over her pillow, watched for the slightest
gleam of returning reason, in order to speak the pardon
so earnestly implored : and while thus piously engaged,
the chaise that was to convey her and her friend to
London, and perhaps to Adeline, drove up to the gate.
“ Art thou ready?” said Mrs. Pemberton, entering
the room equipped for her journey.
At this moment the poor invalid reiterated her cries
for pardon, and begged Mrs. Mowbray not to leave her
without pronouncing her forgiveness.
Mrs. Mowbray burst into tears; and though sure that
she was not even conscious of her presence, she felt
herself almost unable to forsake her :-still it was in
search of her daughter that she was going—nay, perhaps,
it was to her daughter that she was hastening; and, as
this thought occurred to her, she hurried to the door
of the chamber, saying she should be ready in a
moment.
But the eye of the phrensied sufferer followed her as
she did so, and in a tone of unspeakable agony she
begged, she entreated that she might not be left to die
in solitude and sorrow, however guilty she might have
been.—Then again she implored Mrs. Mowbray to speak
peace and pardon to her drooping soul; while, unable
to withstand these solicitations, though she knew them

319
to be the unconscious ravings of the disorder, she slowly
and mournfully returned to the bed-side.
“ It is late," said Mrs. Pemberton—" we ought ere
now to be on the road.”
.:How can I go, and leave this poor creature in such
a state? -But then should we find my poor injured
child at the end of the journey! Such an expectation
as that!
“ Thou must decide quickly,” replied Mrs. Pemberton
gently.
“ Decide ! Then I will go with you.—Yet still should
Anna recover her senses before her death, and wish to
see me, I should never forgive myself for being absent
-it might soothe the anguish of her last moments to
know how freely I pardon her.—No, no :-after all, if
pleasure awaits me, it is only delaying it a few days ;
and this, this unhappy girl is on her death-bed.—You,
you must go without me."
As she said this, Mrs. Pemberton pressed her hand
with affectionate eagerness, and murmured out in broken
accents, “I honour thy decision, and may I return with
comfort to thee!”
“Yet though I wish you to go,” cried Mrs. Mowbray, “I
grieve to expose you to such fatigue and trouble in your
weak state of health, and "
“ Say no more," interrupted Mrs. Pemberton, “I
am only doing my duty; and reflect on my happiness
if I am allowed to restore the lost sheep to the fold
again!”-So saying she set off on her journey, and
arrived in London only four days after Adeline had
arrived in Cumberland.
Mrs. Pemberton drove immediately to Adeline's lodg-
ings, but received the same answer as Colonel Mordaunt
had received ; namely, that she was gone no one knew
whither. Still she did not despair of finding her: she,
like the Colonel, thought that a mulatto, a lady just
recovered from the small-pox, and a child, were likely

to be easily traced ; and having written to Mrs.
Mowbray, owning her disappointment, but bidding
her not despair, she set off on her journey back,
and had succeeded in tracing Adeline as far as an inn on
the high North road,—when an event took place which
made her further inquiries needless.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
ADELINE, after several repeated trials, succeeded in
writing the following letter to her mother :-
“ Dearest of Mothers,
“ When this letter reaches you, I shall be no
more; and however I may hitherto have offended you,
I shall then be able to offend you no longer; and that
child, whom you bound yourself by oath never to see or
forgive but on the most cruel of conditions while living,
dead you may perhaps deign to receive to your pardon
and your love.- Nay, my heart tells me that you will do
more,—that you will transfer the love which you once
felt for me, to my poor helpless orphan; and in full
confidence that you will be thus indulgent, I bequeath
her to you with my dying breath.-0! look on her, my
mother, nor shrink from her with disgust, although you
see in her my features ; but rather rejoice in the resem-
blance, and fancy that I am restored to you pure, happy,
and beloved as I once was.--Yes, yes, it will be so: I
have known a great deal of sorrow-let me then indulge
the little ray of pleasure that breaks in upon me when I
think that you will not resist my dying prayer, but
bestow on my child the long arrears of tenderness due
to me.
.“ Yes, yes, you will receive, you will be kind to her ;

THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
321
and by so doing you will make me ample amends for all
the sorrow which your harshness caused me when we
met last.—That was a dreadful day! How you frowned
on me! I did not think you could have frowned so
dreadfully—but then I was uninjured by affliction, unal-
tered by illness. Were you to see me now, you would
not have the heart to frown on me : and yet my letters
being repeatedly returned, and even the last unnoticed
and unanswered, though it told you that even on your
own conditions I could now claim your pardon, for that
I had been “ wretched in love," and had experienced
“the anguish of being forsaken, despised, and disgraced
in the eye of the world,” proves but too surely that
the bitterness of resentment is not yet passed !—But on
my death-bed you promised to see and forgive me and
I am there, iny mother !! Yet will I not claim that
promise ;-I will not weaken, by directing it towards
myself, the burst of sorrow, of too late regret, of self-
upbraidings, and long-restrained affection, which must
be directed towards my child when I am not alive to
profit by it. No:—though I would give worlds to
embrace you once more, for the sake of my child I resign
the gratification.
“Oh, mother! you little think that I saw you, only a
few days ago, from the stile by the cottage which over-
looks your house : you were walking with a lady, and
my child was with me (my Editha, for I have called her
after you.) You seemed, methought, even cheerful,
and I was so selfish that I felt shocked to think I was so
entirely forgotten by you; for I was sure that if you
thought of me you could not be cheerful. But your
companion left you; and then you looked so very sad,
that I was wretched from the idea that you were then
thinking too much of me, and I wished you to resume
your cheerfulness again.
“ I was not cheerful, and Editha by her artless prattle
wounded me to the very soul.—She wished, she said, to

live in that sweet house, and asked why she should not
live there? I could have told her why, but dared not
do it; but I assured her, and do not for mercy's sake
prove that assurance false ! that she should live there
one day.
«« But when—when ?' she asked.
“ When I am in my grave,' replied I : and, poor
innocent! throwing herself into my arms with playful
fondness, she begged me to go to my grave directly. I
feel but too sensibly that her desire will soon be accom-
plished.
“ But must I die unblest by you? True, I am watched
by the kindest of human beings! but then she is not
my mother-that mother, who, with the joys of my
childhood and my home, is so continually recurring to
my memory. Oh! I forget all your unkindness, my
mother, and remember only your affection. How I
should like to feel your hand supporting my head, and
see you perform the little offices which sickness requires !
-And must I never, never see you more? Yes ! you will
come, I am sure you will : but come, come quickly, or
I shall die without your blessing.
o I have had a fainting fit-but I am recovered, and
can address you again. -Oh! teach my Editha to be
humble, teach her to be slow to call the experience of
ages contemptible prejudices ; teach her no opinions
that can destroy her sympathies with general society,
and make her an alien to the hearts of those amongst
whom she lives.
“ Be above all things careful that she wanders not in
the night of scepticism. But for the support of religion,
what, amidst my various sorrows, what would have
become of me?
« There is something more that I would say. Should
my existence be prolonged even but a few days, I shall
have to struggle with poverty as well as sickness ; and
the anxious friend (I will not call her servant) who is

now my all of earthly comfort, will scarcely have money
sufficient to pay me the last sad duties; and I owe her,
my mother, a world of obligation! She will make my
last moments easy, and you must reward her. From
her you will receive this letter when I am no more, and
to your care and protection I bequeath her. She is—
my eyes grow dim, and I must leave off for the
present.”
On the very evening in which Adeline had written
this address to her mother, Mrs. Mowbray had received
Mrs. Pemberton's letter; and as Miss Woodville had
been interred that morning, she felt herself at liberty to
join Mrs. Pemberton in her search after Adeline. While
various plans for this purpose presented themselves to
her mind, and each of them was dismissed in its turn as
fruitless or impracticable, full of these thoughts she
pensively walked along the lawn before her door, till sad
and weary she leaned on a little gate at the bottom of it;
which, as she did so, swung slowly backwards and
forwards, responsive as it were to her feelings.
But, as she continued to muse, and to recall the varied
sorrows of her past life, the gate on which she leaned
began to vibrate more quickly ; till, unable to bear the
recollections which assailed her, she was hastening with
almost frantic speed towards the house, when she saw
a cottager approaching, to whose sick daughter and
helpless family she had long been a bountiful benefactress:
• What is the matter, John ?” cried Mrs. Mowbray,
hastening forward to meet him—" you seem agitated.”
“My poor daughter, madam ;” replied the man,
bursting into tears.
At the sight of his distress, his parental distress, Mrs.
Mowbray sighed deeply, and asked if Lucy was worse.
“ I doubt she is dying," said the afflicted father.
“Heaven forbid !” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray, throwing
her shawl over her shoulders ; “ I will go and see her
myself.”

ADELINE MOWBRAY;' OR,
“ What, really ?—But the way is so long, and the
road is so miry?”
“ No matter-I must do my duty.”
“ God bless you, and reward you!” cried the grateful
father—" that is so like you! Lucy said you would
come !!!
Mrs. Mowbray then filled a basket with medicine and
refreshments, and set out on her charitable visit.
She found the poor girl in a very weak and alarming
state; but the sight of her benefactress, and the tender
manner in which she supported her languid head, and
administered wine and other cordials to her, insensibly
revived her; and while writhing under the feelings of
an unhappy parent herself, Mrs. Mowbray was soothed
by the blessings of the parent whom she comforted.
At this moment they were alarmed by a shriek from
a neighbouring cottage, and a woman who was attending
on the sick girl ran out to inquire into the cause of it.
She returned, saying that a poor sick young gentle-
woman, who lodged at the next house, was fallen back
in a fit, and they thought she was dead.
“ A young gentlewoman,” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray,
" at the next cottage !” rising up.
" Aye sure,” cried the woman, “she looks like a
lady for certain, and she has the finest child I ever saw.”
“ Perhaps she is not dead,” said Mrs. Mowbray :-
“ let us go see.”
CHAPTER XXIX.
LITTLE did Mrs. Mowbray think that it was her own
child whom she was hastening to relieve ; and that,
while meditating a kind action, recompense was so near.
Adeline, while trying to finish her letter to her mother,
had scarcely traced a few illegible lines, when she fell

back insensible on her pillow; and at the moment of
Mrs. Mowbray's entering the cottage, Savanna, who
had uttered the shriek which had excited her curiosity,
had convinced herself that she was gone for ever.
The woman who accompanied Mrs. Mowbray entered
the house first; and opening a back chamber, low-roofed,
narrow, and lighted only by one solitary and slender
candle, Mrs. Mowbray, beheld through the door the
lifeless form of the object of her solicitude, which Savanna
was contemplating with loud and frantic sorrow.
“ Here is a lady come to see what she can do for your
mistress,” cried the woman, while Savanna turned hastily
round:-"Here she is—here is good Madam Mowbray."
« Madam Mowbray !” shrieked Savanna, fixing her
dark eyes fiercely on Mrs. Mowbray, and raising her
arm in a threatening manner as she approached her:
then snatching up the letter which lay on the bed,
“ Woman!” she exclaimed, grasping Mrs. Mowbray's
arm with frightful earnestness, " read dat-'tis for
you!”
Mrs. Mowbray, speechless with alarm and awe, invo-
luntarily seized the letter—but scarcely had she read the
first words, when uttering a deep groan she sprung
forward, to clasp the unconscious form before her, and
fell beside it equally insensible.
But she recovered almost immediately to a sense of her
misery; and while, in speechless agony, she knelt by the
bed-side, Savanna, beholding her distress, with a sort of
dreadful pleasure exclaimed, “Ah! have you at last learn
to feel ?!
"But is she, is she indeed gone ?”' cried Mrs. Mow-
bray, “is there no hope ?” and instantly seizing the
cordial which she had brought with her, assisted by the
woman, she endeavoured to force it down the throat of
Adeline.
Their endeavours were for some time vain: at length
however, she exhibited signs of life, and in a few minutes

more she opened her sunk eye, and gazed unconsciously
around her.
“My God! I thank you !” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray,
falling on her knees; while Savanna, laying her mis-
tress's head on her bosom, sobbed with fearful joy.
“Adeline ! my child, my dear, dear child !" cried Mrs.
Mowbray, seizing her clammy hand.
That voice, those words which she had so long wished
to hear, though hopeless of ever hearing them again,
seemed to recall the fast fading recollection of Adeline :
she raised her head from Savanna's bosom, and, looking
earnestly at Mrs. Mowbray, faintly smiled, and endea-
voured to throw herself into her arms,—but fell back
again exhausted on the pillow.
But in a few minutes she recovered so far as to be able
to speak; and while she hung round her mother's neck,
and gazed upon her with eager and delighted earnestness,
she desired Savanna to bring Editha to her immediately.
.“Will you, will you," said Adeline, vainly trying to
speak her wishes, as Savanna put the sleeping girl in
Mrs. Mowbray's arms: but she easily divined them ;
and, clasping her to her heart, wept over her convul-
sively—“She shall be dear to me as my own soul !” said
Mrs. Mowbray.
" Then I die contented,” replied Adeline.
“Die !” exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray hastily : “no, you
must not, shall not die; you must live to see me atone
for—"
“It is in vain,” said Adeline faintly. “I bless God
that he allows me to enjoy this consolation-say that
you forgive me.”
“Forgive you ! Oh, Adeline! for years have I forgiven
and pined after you ; but a wicked woman intercepted
all your letters; and I thought you were dead, or had
renounced me for ever.”
“Indeed !” cried Adeline. “Oh! had I suspected
that !”

“Nay more, Mrs. Pemberton is now in London, in
search of you, in order to bring you back to happiness !"
As Mrs. Mowbray said this, Savanna, drawing near, took
her hand and gently pressed it.
Adeline observed the action, and seeing by it that
Savanna’s heart relented towards her mother, said, “I
owe that faithful creature more than I can express; but
to your care I bequeath her.”
“I will love her as my child,” said Mrs. Mowbray,
" and behave to her better than I did to—"
“Hush !” cried Adeline, putting her hand to Mrs.
Mowbray's lips.
“But you shall live! I will send for Dr. Norberry ;
you shall be moved to my house, and all will be well-
all our past grief be forgotten,” returned Mrs. Mowbray
with almost convulsive eagerness.
· Adeline faintly smiled, but repeated that every hope
of that kind was over, but that her utmost wish was
gratified in seeing her mother, and receiving her full
forgiveness.
"But you must live for my sake!” cried Mrs. Mow-
bray: “and for mine," sobbed out Savanna.
"Could you not be moved to my house?” said Mrs.
Mowbray. “There every indulgence and attention that
money can procure shall be yours. Is this a place,-is
this poverty—this,” Here her voice failed her, and
she burst into tears.
.“Mother, dearest mother,” replied Adeline, “I see
you, I am assured of your love again, and I have not a
want beside. Still, I could like, I could wish, to be once
more under a parent's roof.”
In a moment, the cottager who was present, and
returning with usury to Mrs. Mowbray's daughter the
anxious interest which she had taken in his, proposed
various means of transporting Adeline to the Lawn; a
difficult and a hazardous undertaking: but the poor
invalid was willing to risk the danger and the fatigue;

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
and her mother could not but indulge her. At length
the cottager, as it was for the general benefactress, hava
ing with care procured even more assistance than was
necessary, Adeline was conveyed on a sort of a litter,
along the valley, and found herself once more in the
house of her mother; while Savanna, sharing in the joy
which Adeline's countenance expressed, threw herself on
Mrs. Mowbray's neck, and exclaimed, “ Now I forgive
you !”
« Mother, dear mother," cried Adeline, after having
for some minutes vainly endeavoured to speak “I am
so happy! no more an outcast, but under my mother's
roof -Nay, I even think I can live now,” added she
with a faint smile.
Had Adeline risen from her bed in complete health
and vigour, she would scarcely have excited more joy in
her mother, and in Savanna, than she did by this ex-
pression.
“Can live!” cried Mrs. Mowbray, “O! you shall,
you must live.” And an express was sent off imme-
diately to Dr. Norberry too, who was removed to Kendal,
to be near his elder daughter, lately married in the
neighbourhood.
Dr. Norberry arrived in a few hours. Mrs. Mowbray
ran out to meet him ; but a welcome died on her tongue,
and she could only speak by her tears. '
“There, there, my good woman, don't be foolish,"
replied he: “it is very silly to blubber, you know :
besides, it can do no good,” giving her a kiss, while the
tears trickled down his rough cheek. “So, the lost
sheep is found ?”
“But, O! she will be lost again,” faltered Mrs. Mow-
bray; “I doubt nothing can save her!"
“No!” cried the old man, with a gulp, “no! not my
coming so many miles on purpose ?-Well, but where is
she ?”
“She will see you presently, but begged to be excused

for a few minutes.” “You see,” said he, “by my dress,
what has happened,” gulping as he spoke. “I have
lost the companion of thirty years I-and-and—” here
he paused, and after an effort went on to say, that his
wife in her last illness had owned that she had suppressed
Adeline's letters, and had declared the reason of it-
“But, poor soul !" continued the doctor, “it was the
only sin against me, I believe, or any one else, that she
ever committed-80 I forgave her : and I trust that God
will.”
Soon after they were summoned to the sick room, and
Dr. Norberry beheld with a degree of fearful emotion,
which he vainly endeavoured to hide under a cloak of
pleasantry, the dreadful ravages which sorrow and sick-
ness had made in the face and form of Adeline.
“So, here you are at last !” cried he, trying to smile
while he sobbed audibly, “and a pretty figure you make,
don't you ?—But we have you again, and we will not
part with you so soon, I can tell you (almost starting as
the faint but rapid pulse met his fingers)—that is, I
mean,” added he, “unless it please God.” Mrs. Mow-
bray and Savanna, during this speech, gazed on his
countenance in breathless anxiety, and read in it a con-
firmation of their fears. “But who's afraid ?” cried the
doctor, forcing a laugh, while his tone and his looks
expressed the extreme of apprehension, and his laugh
ended in a sob.
Mrs. Mowbray turned away in a sort of desperate
silence; but the mulatto still kept her penetrating eye
fixed upon him, and with a look so full of woe!
“I'll trouble you, mistress, to take those formidable
eyes of yours off my face,” cried the doctor pettishly;
« for I can't stand their inquiry !—But who the devil
are you?”
“She is my nurse, my consoler, and my friend,” said
Adeline.
“ Then she is mine of course," cried the doctor,

ADELINE MOWBRAY; OR,
“ though she has a terrible stare with her eyes :--but
give me your hand, mistress. What is your name?”
“Me be name Savanna,” replied the mulatto; “and
me die and live wid my dear mistress,” she added, burst-
ing into tears.
“Pshaw !” cried the doctor, “ I can't bear this--here
I came as a physician, and these blubberers melt me
down into an old woman. Adeline, I must order all
these people out of the room, and have you to myself, or
I can do nothing."
He was obeyed; and on inquiring into all Adeline's
symptoms, he found little to hope and every thing to
fear-“ But your mind is relieved, and you have youth
on your side; and who knows what good air, good food,
and good nurses may do for you!”
.“ Not to mention a good physician,” added Adeline,
smiling, “and a good friend in that physician.”
« This it be to have money,” said Savanna, as she
saw the various things prepared and made to tempt
Adeline's weak appetite :-“ poor Savanna mean as
wellher heart make all these, but her hand want
power.”
During this state of alarming suspense Mrs. Pemberton
was hourly expected, as she had written word that she
had traced Adeline into Lancashire, and suspected that
she was in her mother's neighbourhood,-It may be
supposed that Mrs. Mowbray, Adeline, and Savanna,
looked forward to her arrival with eager impatience;
but not so Dr. Norberry-he said that no doubt she was
& very good sort of woman, but that he did not like
pretensions to righteousness over much, and had a
particular aversion to a piece of formal drab-coloured
morality.
Adeline only laughed at these prejudices, without
attempting to confute them ; for she knew that Mrs.
Pemberton's appearance and manners would soon anni-
hilate them. At length she reached the Lawn; and

Savanna, who saw her alight, announced her arrival to
her mistress, and was commissioned by her to introduce
her immediately into the sick chamber.—She did so ;
but Mrs. Pemberton, almost overpowered with joy at
the intelligence which awaited her, and ill fortified by
Savanna's violent and mixed emotions against the in-
dulgence of her own, begged to compose herself a few
moments before she met Adeline: but Savanna was not
to be denied; and seizing her hand she led her up to the
bedside of the invalid.—Adeline smiled affectionately
when she saw her; but Mrs. Pemberton started back,
and, scarcely staying to take the hand which she offered
her, rushed out of the room, to vent in solitude the
burst of uncontrollable anguish which the sight of her
altered countenance occasioned her.—Alas ! her eye had
been but too well tutored to read the characters of death
in the face, and it was some time before she recovered
herself sufficiently to appear before the anxious watchers
by the bed of Adeline with that composure which on
principle she always endeavoured to display.--At length,
however, she re-entered the room, and approaching the
poor invalid, kissed in silence her wan flushed cheek.
“I am very different now, my kind friend, to what I
was when you first saw me,” said Adeline, faintly smiling.
To the moment when they last met, Adeline had not
resolution enough to revert, for then she was mourning
by the dead body of Glenmurray.
Mrs. Pemberton was silent for a moment; but, making
an effort, she replied, “ Thou art now more like what
thou wert in mind, when I first met thee at Rosevalley,
than when I first saw thee at Richmond. At Rosevalley
I beheld thee innocent, at Richmond guilty, and here I
see thee penitent, and, I hope, resigned to thy fate.”—
She spoke the word resigned with emphasis, and Adeline
understood her.
“I am indeed resigned,” replied Adeline in a low
voice : “nay, I feel that I am much favoured in being

spared so long. But there is one thing that weighs
heavily on my mind; Mary Warner is leading a life of
shame, and she told me when I last saw her, that she
was corrupted by my precept and example: if so "
“ Set thy conscience at rest on that subject,” inter-
rupted Mrs. Pemberton: “ while she lived with me, I
discovered, long before she ever saw thee, that she had
been known to have been faulty.”
“Oh! what a load have you removed from my mind !”
replied Adeline. “Still it would be more relieved, if
you would promise to find her out; and she may be heard
of at Mr. Langley's chambers in the Temple. Offer her
a yearly allowance for life, provided she will quit her
present vicious habits; I am sure my mother will gladly
fulfil my wishes in this respect.”
.“ And so will I,” replied Mrs. Pemberton. “ Is there
any thing else that I can do for thee?”
“ Yes : I have two pensioners at Richmond,-a poor
young woman, and her orphan boy,—an illegitimate
child,” she added, deeply sighing, as she recollected
what had interested her in their fate. “I bequeath them
to your care: Savanna knows where they are to be found.
And now, all that disturbs my thoughts at this awful
moment is, the grief which my poor mother and Savanna
will feel ;—nay, they will be quite unprepared for it;
for they persist to hope still, and I believe that even Dr.
Norberry allows his wishes to deceive his judgment.”
“ They will suffer, indeed!” cried Mrs. Pemberton :
“ but I give thee my word, that I will never leave thy
mother, and that Savanna shall be our joint care.”
“ It is enough-I shall now die in peace,” said
Adeline ; and Mrs. Pemberton turned away to meet Mrs.
Mowbray, who, with Dr. Norberry at that moment
entered the room. Mrs. Mowbray met her, and welcomed
her audibly and joyfully : but Mrs. Pemberton, aware of
the blow which impended over her, vainly endeavoured
to utter a congratulation; but throwing herself into

Mrs. Mowbray's extended arms, she forgot her usual
self-command, and sobbed loudly on her bosom.
Dr. Norberry gazed at the benevolent Quaker with
astonishment. True, she was “ drab-coloured;" but
where was the repulsive formality that he had expected ?
“ This woman can feel like other women, and is as good
a hand at a crying-bout as myself.” But Mrs. Pemberton
did not long give way to so violent an indulgence of her
feelings ; and gently withdrawing herself from Mrs.
Mowbray's embrace, she turned to the window, while
Mrs. Mowbray hastened to the bed-side of Adeline.
Mrs. Pemberton then turned round again, and, seizing
Dr. Norberry's hand, which she fervently pressed, said
in a faltering voice, “ Would thou couldst save her!”
“And—and can't I ? can't I?” replied he, gulping.
Mrs. Pemberton looked at him with an expression which
he could neither mistake nor endure; but muttering in
a low tone, " Po! dear, sweet soul! I doubt I can't, I
doubt I can't, by the Lord !” he rushed out of the
room.
From that moment he never was easy but when he
could converse with Mrs. Pemberton; for he knew that
she, and she only, sympathized in his feelings, as she
only knew that Adeline was not likely to recover. The
invalid herself observed his attention to her friend, nor
could she forbear to rally him on the total disappearance
of his prejudices against the fair Quaker; for, such was
the influence of Mrs. Pemberton's dignified yet winning
manners, and such was the respect with which she
inspired him, that, if he had his hat on, he always took
it off when she entered the room, and never uttered any
thing like an oath, without humbly begging her pardon;
and he told Adeline, that were all Quakers like Mrs.
Pemberton, he should be tempted to cry. “ Drab is your
only wear.” .
Another and another day elapsed, and Adeline still
lived. On the evening of the third day, as she lay half-

ADELINE MOWBRAY, ETC.
slumbering with her head on Savanna's arm, and Mrs.
Mowbray, lulliug Editha to sleep on her lap, was watch-
ing beside her, glancing her eye alternately with satisfied
and silent affection from the child to the mother, whom
she thought in a fair way of recovery; while Dr.
Norberry, stifling an occasional sob, was contemplating
the gronp, and Mrs. Pemberton, her hands clasped in
each other, seemed lost in devout contemplation, Adeline
awoke, and as she gazed on Editha, who was fondly
held to Mrs. Mowbray's bosom, a smile illumined her
sunk countenance. Mrs. Mowbray at that moment
eagerly and anxiously pressed forward to catch her
weak accents, and inquire how she felt. “I have seen
that fond and anxious look before, she faintly articulated,
“but in happier times! and it assures me that you love
me still."
“Love you still !" replied Mrs. Mowbray with pas-
sionate fondness :-“never, never were you so dear to
me as now !”
Adeline tried to express the joy which fushed her
cheek at these words, and lighted up her closing eyes :
but she tried in vain. At length she grasped Mrs.
Mowbray's hand to her lips, and in imperfect accents
exclaiming “ I thank thee, blessed Lord !” she laid her
head on Savanna's bosom, and expired.

“ How fortunate it is for me, with my impatient spirit,”
said Ronald Breadalbane to General Monthermer, as they
were travelling from Portsmouth to London, “that I
have you with me as a companion to beguile the length
of the way!”
“I can echo your words with perfect sincerity,"
replied the general ; “as after a residence in India of
sixteen years and upwards, my eagerness to reach Lon-
don and get my business transacted there, that I may
hasten to my native place, is as great as yours.”
" Aye!” replied the enthusiastic and national Bread-
albane, who was many years younger than the general:
“ but my native place, my Highland home, is such an
enchanting spot? O Scotland, dear Scotland ! land of
the mountain and the vale, land of beautiful women and
brave men! land of genius and of song! land of
kindness and hospitality! I bring to thee an unchanged
heart, my country, and a conviction that there is nought
like thee upon the habitable globe!”
Had Breadalbane been so fortunate as to have read
the eulogium lately passed by a certain orator on this
loved land of his birth, in his admirable speech on the
education of the poor, he would, perhaps, have borrowed
his language ; and would have exclaimed, “What part
of the world into which Scotchmen have emigrated, have
they not benefitted ? What part where they have
emigrated, have they not conferred more benefits upon
than they have reaped ?”

General Monthermer, who loved his own country too
well not to be able to make allowances for national pride
in others, replied with a benevolent smile, “I fully admit
the truth of what you have said of Scotland; for I have
gazed enamoured on its women, listened with delight to
the eloquence of its orators, have hung enraptured on
its melodies, and read with ever new transport the works
of its poets and its writers. I have also had my inmost
soul warmed by its hospitality ;-and who that has ever
seen and been welcomed to the metropolis of your
country, Breadalbane, but must remember it with grateful
pleasure to the end of his existence, and almost pine to
behold Edinburgh again!”
“ Thank you, thank you, dear general,” cried the
warm-hearted Caledonian, grasping his hand eagerly;
“ then let me one day welcome you there.”
“ But tell me," said the general, laughing, “ can you
not in return say something in praise of poor Old
England ?”
“Oh! much, much : but you are yourself such an
eulogy on your country, that I need say nothing, except
that amongst the other obligations which she has con-
ferred on the world, I rank very highly indeed that of
her having produced a General Monthermer.”
“ You make me blush, Breadalbane,” replied Mon-
thermer, “ and I know not how to show my sense of
such courtesy."
“ I will tell you how; come and visit me in my own
dear little Highland home, and let me show you to my
family and my friends. Oh! it is such a scene! I
cannot think of it without tears of rapture. The rocks,
the glen, the lake, Oh !do not think me a romantic
idiot when I own that I pity every one who is not born
in a mountainous country. It is so impossible, I thiuk,
for a man to be as much attached to a flat unpic-
turesque home, as to one like mine. I doubt, whether
one's affection for one's relations is not stronger,

'when one associates their image with that of fine country,
and—and—Ah! I see you laugh, general, and I dare say
you think that you are as impatient to see your parents
and relations in the flat part of England in which they
live, as I am to revisit mine and the girl of my heart,
residing amidst all the prodigality of nature.”
“I am sure of it,” replied the general with a sigh.
“ Parents, alas ! I have not now to welcome me,” he
added, passing the back of his hand across his eyes :
“ they are dead.”
“ But I hope they lived long enough to hear of your
successes abroad, and of your large acquisition of fortune?”'
“ They did; and to profit by the latter. Ours is a
decayed family; but now it will, I trust, be re-instated
in its former splendour; and I have the satisfaction of
knowing, that before they died, my beloved parents were
restored, through my means, to some of the habitual
state of their ancestors.”
“ Happy, happy Monthermer!”.
“ Yes, happy so far I am ; and believe me, I feel my
happiness as deeply, and that it is as great, as if I had been
born on a Highland mountain, and my parents had lived
upon its side. No, no; believe me the affections are wholly
independent of scenery. Were you, on your return
home, to find your parents dead, your mistress false, and
your friends exiled, — do you think that the scenery would
give you pleasure ?”
« No : at least not so much.”
“ Yet you must feel that it would, in order to prove
that it at all heightens the present glow of the affections ;
and I maintain, that if I find those friends yet left to
me,--well, faithful, and affectionate, I shall be quite as
happy on my barren, treeless abode, the ungraceful town
of my nativity, with its bleak surrounding marshes and
its flat shores, as you amidst your picturesque
mountains and lofty rocks.”
“ I am not convinced,” replied Breadalbane, “and I

still bless Heaven for having made me a denizen of the
mountains.”
“I bless it,” returned Monthermer, “ for having
given me affections, and preserved to me some objects,
I trust, to engage and gratify them, whether it be in
the land of the mountain or the plain.”
At length the travellers reached London; and after
having finished their business, Breadalbane set off for
Scotland, and the general for his nearer and less beau-
tiful home: but they did not part till they had promised
to keep up, by letters, that acquaintance which had
begun in India, and which a long voyage together in
the same ship had matured into intimacy.
A two days' journey brought General Monthermer in
sight of his native place ; whose spires he saw many
miles before him, rising darkly on the glowing back-
ground made by the setting sun.
“ That is one advantage I have over Breadalbane,"
said the general to himself, while his lip quivered with
strong and affectionate emotion : “ As my native place is
on a dead flat, I can see it so much sooner than he can
his. Mistaken young man !-to be sure he has more and
nearer relations to welcome him than I have; but can
his heart beat more strongly at the thought of re-union
with them, than mine does this moment?”
At length the general called to the postillions to stop,
and draw up to a little gate by a gentle acclivity within
one mile of the place of his destination : there he
alighted, and desired the drivers to wait till he returned.
This gate led to the church-yard in which the remains
of General Monthermer's parents were deposited ; and
where, till his return, he had desired that a simple stone
alone should mark the spot out where they were laid. To
this spot he now directed his steps, and bent over the
unconscious sod in a paroxysm of filial tenderness and
grief. Still they were not altogether unpleasing tears.
He felt pious thankfulness subdue the murmur of regret,

339
when he recollected that he had been permitted to cheer
their declining years by bestowing on them a large portion
of his affluence; and he also joyed to think that it was
allowed to them to hear and to glory in the military fame
of their son.
" There is one more duty to perform towards them.”
said he to himself: “ I will raise a monument to their
memory;" and then with a sigh of mingled feelings he
retraced his steps towards the gate.
On his way he had nearly trod on a toad, which
crawled across his path; and with a feeling of impulsive,
or rather, I hope, of principled humanity, he stooped
down and removed the poor reptile off the path, that it
might avoid a recurrence of the danger.
« Oh, now I'm sure 'tis he !” exclaimed a voice
behind him. “It can be nobody but Mr. George Monther-
mer; that was so like you, sir. God bless your honour!
and welcome back to old England !”
Monthermer turned round, and saw a shabbily-dressed
woman, with a mob-cap flying open ; and who with a
torn and coloured apron was now wiping away the tears that
seemed to welcome him as much as her words had done.
“I thank you, my good woman,” said he, stopping
and surveying her earnestly ; “ I thank you ; but I do
not recollect you, and I wonder you recollect me.”
“Oh! how could I fail to know you, sir, when I saw
your kindness to that nasty thing? It was so like what
I have seen you do before! But no wonder you don't
recollect me : times are changed with me, and with many
others, you know, since your honour went away. Have
you quite forgotten Lucy Simmons ?”
“ Lucy !-my good woman, is it you ?” cried the
general kindly ; “ you, whom I left so well settled ? I
wonder no one wrote me word that things did not go
right with you. But come, sit down on this grave-stone,
and tell me what changes I am to expect. You, you
know, will not want a friend now I am come.”

Poor Lucy's heart was now too full for utterance
immediately: but when she recovered she answered, and
sometimes anticipated Monthermer's questions.
“ Aye, your honour,” said she, “it would have gone
very hard with me when my husband died and left me
without a penny, and six children to maintain, but for
Miss Marian Trelawney."
“How !” exclaimed the general starting; “why I
thought Mr. Trelawney spent all his personal property,
and died in debt ; and that his daughters, as the estates
went to the male heir, have little or nothing to live
upon ?”
“ Yes, that is only too true, sir; but then, if Miss
Marian had only a guinea in the world, you know, sir,
she would give part of it to those who wanted it. Besides,
sir, they are not so badly off neither; and Miss Marian
would do very well if it was not for her sister, I fancy,
who was, you know, sir, a beauty, and so her father
and mother spoiled her; and so, sir, she must have her
whims and her nice things still, sir : and I believe, for
that reason, that she may spoil her sister as I call it.
Miss Marian keeps a day-school.”
“ Keeps a school!” cried the general. “ Marian
Trelawney keep a school?”
“Yes, sir; she keeps a school in the day for gentle-
folks, and for money, and twice a week in the evening
she teaches poor folks' children for loye, and mine
amongst the rest; and that is a great help to me, sir,
besides having her washing and her sister's, and a few
broth now and then, and such like-But dear heart, how
glad she and Miss Trelawney will be to see you !”
“ Where do they live?”
Lucy told him, and he started again at the humility
of their abode.
“We have been expecting you, you know, sir," she
continued ; " and the house is ready.”
“But I was not expected so soon,” he replied.

“ No, not for some days. Well, dear me! how dif-
ferent your honour will find things! There's the
Aislabies that used to hold their head so high, all ruined
and gone! and there's the Bensons living in a little hole
of a house!”
“ Indeed!” cried the general in an absent manner.
“ But tell me, are my brother and sister and their children
at home?”
“ No, sir; they went out of town a week ago to their
country-house.”
At this moment a shout was heard from the town.
“ What noise is that ?” cried the general; “it seemed
like a shout!”
“Dear me, yes, and so it was! that ever I should
forget to tell your honour! They are shouting for you!”
“For me!”
“ Yes; one of the old members is dead, and they
have put you up for a parliament-man; and every body
is so glad !-80 you are sure to get it !”
“ Me!” faltered out the general, choked with no
unpleasant feeling at this proof of his fellow-citizens'
regard : “ and did my brother know of it?”
“ No, sir ; but I hear he is sent for; and I believe he
is expected to-morrow.”
" That is well,” he replied. “But come, I must go,
the air grows chill.”
“ Oh dear! yes, do go," cried Lucy. “ How glad
the folks will be to see you drive in! I am sure they
will know you directly; and then they will drag your
honour into the town.”
“ They shall do no such thing," cried the general.
“ And mark me, Lucy, as you value my favour, keep my
arrival secret till to-morrow.”
Lucy said it would be very hard to do it, as so many
would rejoice to know his honour was come; but if she
must, she must.
Monthermer then slipped some money into her hand;

and desiring the postillions to drive slowly to the prin-
cipal inn, and to be sure not to name him to any body,
he wished Lucy good-night, and with his handkerchief
at his face hurried towards the town.
“ And so I am to represent my native town!” thought
he. “Would that my parents had lived to see this day !
how pleased they would have been!”
He then hastened still more rapidly on, to escape
from the poignancy of that regret.
“ And so my brother and his family are not at home!
Well then, I may go first to call on the Trelawneys."
And in a few moments more he found the knocker of
the door in his hand.
Instead of the powdered footman that used to answer
a knock at the door, it was now answered by a servant
girl, who told him both the ladies were at home; and if
he would walk into the parlour, she would let them
know. " But who shall I say is here, sir?”.
“ An old friend,” replied Monthermer in a hoarse
voice. But hoarse as it was, it was recognised by
Marian Trelawney.
“ Oh! it is he! it is George Monthermer !” she ex-
claimed : and regardless of her dress and her occupation,
(for she was making pastry for the morrow,) she ran
from the kitchen into the parlour. But when she saw
Monthermer she could not utter one word of welcome,
and she received his affectionate salute in silence and in
trembling. The servant now brought candles in ; and
Marian found voice enough to desire the servant to tell
her sister General Monthermer was there.
Miss Trelawney knew it already ; but she could not
think of making her appearance till she had done
something to her dress, and repaired the faded roses on
her cheek: and having done so, she sailed into the room
with her usual dignity as a Trelawney and a beauty.
Meanwhile neither the general nor Marian had said
much ; for both were thinking of the altered fortunes of

343
the latter, and of relatives and friends, dead, ruined, and
dispersed since the hour when they last met; while
Marian at length uttered, “You find us much altered in
situation!”
“Pshaw !” cried the general in reply, closely grasping
her hand as she spoke : then dropping it again, he added,
“ Don't talk of that,—don't talk of that : you are
unchanged ! you really look as young as when we parted,
Marian. Countenance never grows old, mere features do.”
“ You are changed in manners, though not in person
much,” replied Marian smiling through her tears ; " for
you are grown a flatterer, general.”
“ General !-call me Monthermer if you please.” And
it was at this moment that Miss Trelawney entered.
The general certainly did not receive her as he did her
sister. His salute was colder, and his manner more
distant; and her welcome to him was one of many words.
“ Dear me!” cried Marian smiling, “ my sister looks
80 smart and so neat, I must apologize for my appear-
ance : but really when I heard your voice, my dear
friend, I forgot I had an apron on, and that my hands
were covered with flour,—and only see how I have floured
the sleeve of your coat!”
“ Monthermer looked as if he had a mind to kiss the
soft small hand which now pointed to the mischief it
had done. But he did not: he contented himself with
kissing the flour on his sleeve, and then with a sigh he
brushed it off.
“ And so you are grown quite notable, are you?”
cried he: while Marian busied herself in untying her
apron. “ And you pretend to make pies and puddings,
I suppose?”
“ It is no pretence,” said Marian cheerfully, “ for I
have no one to do it for me:-besides, my kind sister
fancies no one's pie-crust so good as mine ; therefore
vanity makes me notable.”
Monthermer sighed, and almost frowned; for he

recollected what Lucy had said, and fancied Marian was
indeed spoiling her sister, and subservient to her whims.
But he resolved to think of other things; and was putting
question after question to them, and they were answering
them, when they were suddenly interrupted by a sound
of many voices and of many feet; and in a moment they
heard a violent knock at the door, which was, however,
nearly drowned in shouts of “ Monthermer for ever!”
The servant-girl now opened the door; and “ Is not
General Monthermer here?” was asked by more voices
than one. And no sooner was the question answered,
than in rushed two or three of the principal gentlemen
of the town; while the narrow hall was filled with
people.
The gentlemen exclaimed, “ General Monthermer,
welcome to England and to us!” The general accepted
and pressed their tendered hands, but only bowed in
return; while Marian turned away to hide her tears, and
Miss Trelawney looked her offended dignity at the
intrusion.
“ General,” added one of the gentlemen, “ your
postillions, finding it was the new candidate whom they
had driven, could not help betraying the secret of your
arrival, and you must come with us and show yourself
to the people.”
“No, no, impossible !--not to-night,” replied the
general, shrinking perhaps from the word must; having
so lately come from a country where he ruled instead
of obeying. But the gentlemen persisted with such
friendly violence, that the general, being conscious also
of an obligation to them, at length consented to accom-
pany them ;—when, with the feeling of a true gentleman,
he turned gracefully round to apologize to the ladies,
for the liberty which zeal for him and his cause had
occasioned his friends to take with them and their house.
The gentlemen were forced to act on the hint he gave,
and they made their excuses acceptable even to the

345
haughty Miss Trelawney, whose “ pride fell not with
her fortune.” Monthermer then told them he would
see them the next day, and departed with his friends.
· It was late, very late that night ere the shouts ceased
of “ Monthermer for ever!” But however they might
disturb the sleep of her sister, Marian was glad to be so
kept awake. No one was more gratified by being the
discoverer of General Monthermer's having arrived that
night than Lucy Simmons, as she was now at liberty to
own she had seen him, and she had longed to tell all
about the toad—and all the says I's and says he's—and
the promised kindnesses and the given money. And
here let me add, that the bounty of the general was not
slow to gladden her widowed abode, and that he caused
“ the widow's heart to sing for joy."
The next day General Monthermer was so engrossed
with the interests of his election, that he could not call
on the sisters till two o'clock, and then he found them at
dinner. But Marian insisted on his coming in, though
Miss Trelawney's dignity was a little offended by the
intrusion.
“ I had not an idea that you dined so early,” said the
conscious general.
“ No,” replied Miss Trelawney; “no one could
suspect us of dining at so vulgar an hour ; but as Marian
chooses to keep school, we must keep school-mistress's
hours, you know.”
While she was speaking, the general looked at the
dinner, and saw that before her stood a nice roasted
spring chicken and young potatoes, and a pint bottle of
white wine: while Marian's fare was evidently a mutton-
chop and a decanter of water.
“So!” thought the general, “I suspect that Marian
chooses to keep school that you (her sister) may be in-
dulged in dainties !”
Marian saw the general look at the chicken and the
wine with a peculiar expression of countenance, and she

answered his thoughts as it were by saying, “ My sister
has delicate health, and a still more delicate appetite;
and she can only eat chickens, and those kind of things :
I, you know, was always robust, and could eat any thingſ'
“Is it forbidden me to partake of your mutton-chop?”
said he, sitting down to the table; “for I am to dine late.”
Miss Trelawney smiled, and very graciously proffered
him a share of her chicken and her wine. But the general
accepted only the wine; and it was in order to have an
excuse for tasting that, that he sat down.
“Do not you drink wine?” said he to Marian.
“ No; very rarely. I do not want it; and it costs
money, you know.”
“ This is not good wine, Miss Trelawney,” cried he,
tasting it : “ and if you are an invalid, it is not what
you ought to drink. I must insist on prescribing to you
some excellent Maderia, of which I have a large cargo
now in the harbour; and I will send you some of it as
soon as it is unpacked : and then perhaps, for the sake
of an old friend, your sister may be prevailed on to
drink some.”
Miss Trelawney expressed her gratitude loudly and
warmly. But Marian did not speak at first; and then
she only said, “ No; even a present from you will not
tempt me to indulge in a luxury so expensive; for I
make it a principle to have as few wants and indulgences
as I can.”
“ Well,” replied Monthermer warmly, “ you may go
without wine on principle and from choice, if you
please ; but I cannot bear that you should do it from
necessity.”
Marian looked at him with grateful emotion, then rose,
and left the room awhile : and Miss Trelawney took the
opportunity of her absence to assure him that there was
really no occasion for Marian to slave as she did, and
deny herself so many things; but it was her will, and
she would do it.

347
The general did not reply, though much tempted to
do so; and he was very glad when Marian came back.
- When she was forced to go to her scholars, he took
his leave.
At night he sent the promised wine : and though
Miss Trelawney was pleased, Marian was hurt at the
number of the dozens, and did not like to accept so
magnificent a present from any one. “ Still, if I must
be obliged,” she said to herself, “ I had rather be so to
him than to any one else.”
That day had not only re-united the general to a
brother whom he dearly loved, but had introduced him
to his brother's wife and children, amongst whom was
a tall girl of fifteen, who Mrs. Monthermer assured him
was so well and notably brought up, that, young as she
was, she was able to manage a family, and that she
had found her the sweetest little nurse that ever she saw.
“ So, so !” thought the general, “ I see I have a
housekeeper and nurse already provided for me.” And
he was not slow to discover, that this lady, whose well-
written and apparently well-felt letters to him in India
had impressed him powerfully in her favour, was in
reality a cold-hearted selfish woman, keeping a watchful
eye on the nabob brother and uncle.
Mr. Monthermer was the direct opposite to his wife
-Generous, disinterested, affectionate; and instead of
wishing his brother to continue single for the sake of
his children, he earnestly hoped he would marry as soon
as he arrived. While her husband uttered this folly (as
she thought it) to herself alone, Mrs. Monthermer did
not mind it: but as he at last thought proper to hold the
same language to his brother, when the bustle of the
election was over and General Monthermer was the
returned member, she was quite astonished to see how
little her husband considered his own and his children's
interests.
“ Well, George,” said Mr. Monthermer to his brother,

348
THE WELCOME HOME.
“ now you are a general and a rich nabob, to be sure
you will think of being a better thing still—and that is
a husband?”
“ If I can find a woman who will love me for myself
alone, and can convince me that she does so—perhaps I
may marry,” replied the general. .
"And pray why should you doubt it? You are a very
handsome fellow yet, George, and not by any means old;
two years my junior, you know; and that I think young:
four-and-forty is not old for a man :--but I do not know
where to find any one worthy of you. I used to think
before you went abroad that you had a secret liking for
that admirable woman Marian Trelawney; and for aught
I see, she is quite as good-looking as she was then, and
single still.”
- Yes,” cried Mrs. Monthermer, “that she may easily
be, and not good-looking either :—but then she is not
quite so young as she was then. Dear me! how could
you think the general could ever think of such a plain
person as that, and now too that she is old !”
“Old She is some years younger than George.”
“ If the general must have one of the sisters, to be
sure he would prefer the elder, as she has been a beauty,
and has fine remains still.”
“ What! prefer a wreck of charms ?-prefer a faded
beauty to a first-rate agreeable in fine preservation ? No,
no, Eliza; my brother is too wise for that; and you under-
rate poor Marian.—Marian Trelawney, brother, is—is
she not?-one of those women in whom her own sex see
nothing, and ours everything ;-—that is, in point of
attraction I mean. She may be what they call plain ;
yet I scarcely ever knew a man who did not, after con-
versing with her half an hour, from the play of her
features and her charm of manner, fancy her almost
handsome.”
“They must have lively imaginations then,” replied
Mrs. Monthermer angrily; "and I dare say the general

349
thinks as I do: but I always thought you bewitched to
the person in question.”
The general for some cause or other was disinclined to
talk on this subject at all :-but now he found himself
called on to reply. “I remember Miss Trelawney,"
said he, “by far the most beautiful woman I ever saw.
Still she had never that charm which her sister has; and
which I do not presume to define,” he added, “though I
feel it powerfully."
“You need not trouble yourself to do it,” said his
brother smiling : “Homer has done it for you, when he
describes his cestus of Venus, without which even the
Goddess of Beauty was not paramount in attraction, and
with which the haughty Juno became irresistible.”
General Monthermer now tried to change the subject :
but his brother persisted to recommend a wife to him,
and named many young ladies who might suit him.
But not one of them escaped Mrs. Monthermer's cen-
sure ;—one had madness in her family ; another
scrofula ; and another had a secret attachment. In
short, the general saw very clearly, and wondered his
brother did not, that Mrs. Monthermer would never
recommend a wife to him.
With what pleasure did he turn from an interested,
detracting woman like this, to the simple-minded and
benevolent Marian Trelawney! How did he prefer to
Mrs. Monthermer's welcome, even that of the proud and
repellent Miss Trelawney herself!
It is not to be supposed that General Monthermer
could escape the matrimonial designs of the ladies in the
town of — ; nor that he should not receive many
invitations and many civilities from the inhabitants both
of that and the environs; and as his house was now
newly painted and furnished, (the house in which his
father resided,) he resolved to give a ball and supper.
Therefore, having previously consulted his brother,
his cards of invitation were soon circulated, and filled

with joyful expectation many a young and many an
elderly woman.
He carried a card written by himself to the sisters;
and presenting it to Miss Trelawney with much respect,
he hoped she and her sister would do him the honour of
gracing his ball with their presence.
Miss Trelawney bowed, but did not speak, and
coloured highly as if from some unpleasant feelings.
Marian did the same; and then in a low voice she told
him, that under their present circumstances they made
it a point to decline all such invitations.
“What is it I hear?” cried the general : “and what ·
can you mean?”
« That, fallen as we are in fortune, and I obliged to
earn my own living, I do not feel that I should now be
in my place at an assembly such as yours will be; and
sure am I, that my appearance there would call forth
many invidious remarks, to which you would be sorry
to be the means of exposing us.”
“And do you really think, and can I believe, that the
Miss Trelawneys can ever be deemed intruders, and as
out of their proper place, in any society ?”
“ I do ;--and my sister will tell you, that having once
ventured to a public assembly here, since I commenced
my present mode of life, she heard her dress so severely
criticized, and her coming to the ball under her circum-
stances so severely censured, that she and her chaperone
were glad to retire early; and the latter advised her
never to expose herself to such illiberality, as she called
it, again.
The general listened in perplexed and angry silence
and surprise. At length he started up, and exclaimed,
“I solemnly swear that if you, my oldest and dearest
friends, cannot and may not come to my ball, I will
have no ball at all.” Then, suddenly rushing from the
house, he went home; and before night all those who
had been invited received a card to say that the ball of

351
General Monthermer was unavoidably postponed ; and
he came to announce this change of plan in person to
the Trelawneys: but the cause of it he would not dis-
close even to his brother, who wondered and interrogated
in vain. “No,” said he to himself; “no feast given
by me shall make them feel yet more than they now do
their altered state, nor shall that noble-minded woman
for a moment regret that her active virtue has excluded
her from a scene which otherwise she would have rejoiced
to witness. And what is the sacrifice to me? Nothing :
for how could I enjoy a pleasure purchased by one pang
to Marian Trelawney?".
Marian and her sister both deeply felt this marked
proof of regard shown them by Monthermer; and Marian
eagerly tried to persuade him to alter his determination
but in vain. He told them it was a sacrifice which
friendship required of him, and make it he would.
The general spoke with vehemence; and having un-
consciously, in his eagerness, crumpled up one piece of
paper, the blank part of a letter which with some others
was lying on the table, was about to crumple up another,
when Marian laughing took it out of his hand, and
begged he would do no more mischief.
“Mischief !” cried he, “what mischief have I done?”
“ Not much ; only you have been guilty of unneces-
sary waste : I can make something useful of these papers
which you treat with so little ceremony.” And in a
short time after, by putting the direction at the bottom,
and painting a little flower on the blank side, she soon
cut and pinched the paper into a neat little box; and the
other papers, by aid of her scissors, and the assistance
of her painting brush, she soon made into tapers to
light candles with.
“ And pray,” said the general, admiring her econo-
mical ingenuity, “what do you do with these things
when they are done?”
“Oh,” cried Miss Trelawney, “they serve as rewards
.

to her children : and trumpery as they are, I assure you
they are valued by them. They know Marian can't
afford to give better presents now, and they appreciate
the goodwill, and are proud of the distinction : besides,
in these little boxes she teaches them to put litters,-
such as ends of tape, or thread ; and as they know what
they are made of, it also inculcates in them a habit of
not wasting any thing, as even old cards will turn to
account.”
“Yes,” interrupted Marian, smiling; "and General
Monthermer's elegant invitation, otherwise so thrown
away on me, may serve a useful purpose, by making the
sides of a pincushion or a needle-book.”
“So, then, you teach moral principles, do you,” said
the general, “ by means of a bit of paper ?”
“I try to do it: and in addition to my other efforts,
I make all my pupils learn Miss Edgeworth's inimitable
tale of Waste not, Want not !”
(Had Teresa Tidy been published then, no doubt
Marian Trelawney would have recommended that also
to her pupils.)
The general listened to his amiable friend, and
admired and revered her more than ever. Insensibly,
too, he fell into reverie; and remembered the hour when -
he, a poor lieutenant of dragoons, sighed bopelessly
and in secret for Marian Trelawney, the co-heiress of
the rich Mr. Trelawney. But though he had always lived
with the sisters on the most intimate footing, Monther-
mer was not only withheld by a consciousness of poverty
from disclosing his passion to Marian, but he, in com-
mon with many others, believed her attached to a
gentleman her equal in fortune: and at this moment of
suspence and increased despair, Monthermer's regiment
was ordered to Indią. But Marian had not married,
and that gentleman married another woman. Since he
returned, too, he had heard her being still single
accounted for, by her having been long attached to

353
another gentleman, who was, it was said, trying to make
up his mind to marry her. This expression the general
never could hear without a feeling almost insupportable
to him; as if marrying such a woman was a thing so
dreadful, that it was necessary for a man to try to make
up his mind to it: and he felt that if this was true, he
should find it difficult to help affronting the man should
he ever be in company with him.
In the meanwhile attentions and invitations to General
Monthermer were not confined to the town of X. A
nobleman, whose mansion in the country was at that
season of the year the resort of beauty, fashion and wit,
and who had daughters to dispose of, invited the general
to join the festive scene. And so many persons had
recommended his daughters as charming and superior
women, and as likely to make excellent wives, from the
education which they had received from an admirable
mother, that he resolved he would put himself in the way
of liking and of being liked, and see if that one image,
which had so long stood sentinel over his heart, in
Europe and in Asia, could be displaced by the force of
youthful beauty. And as soon as his plans were fixed,
he went to call on the Trelawneys.
He found Miss Trelawney alone. “General,” said
she, “I am very glad to have an opportunity of speaking
to you when my sister is not present; as I consider you
as our best friend.” The general bowed, and she pro-
ceeded thus: “You must observe, general, how painful
it is to me to see a descendant of such a family as ours
keeping a school; while so many persons here, whom
formerly we should not have noticed, are living in com-
parative splendour, and keeping carriages. Indeed,
indeed, general, I feel it hard enough to go on foot,
though born to keep my coach-and-four, without the
additional pain of hearing my sister teach A B C.” Here
she burst into tears; and the general, who deeply felt
for her altered state, expressed his sincere sympathy with
her feelings.
2 A

“Now, general,” she resumed, “what I think is this :
Marian has great talents for drawing and painting; and
as it is less degrading for a gentlewoman to be an artist
than keep a school, I wish her to make drawings and
paintings for sale ; and with patronage, no doubt she
might succeed.”
“No doubt: I like the scheme much. But in what
style does your sister excel ??:
"Oh, general, she can take likenesses in miniature
admirably. She does not succeed so well in painting
women as men, I think; but the latter I am sure she
would succeed in to admiration.”
“What, madam !” cried the general hastily, “would
you have your sister set up as a painter of gentlemen's
portraits ?”
“ Not them only,” replied Miss Trelawney; “but I
will, though I know she would not like it, show you one
she did many years ago from memory, which I discovered
by chance, for I assure you she hides her talent in a
napkin ;-and it is such a likeness! She has another of
the same person, which she thinks more like ; therefore,
knowing how highly I should value it, was willing to
give me this.”
“Now then, perhaps," thought the general, “I shall
see the happy man whom Marian loves !” and his heart
beat painfully and tumultuously, when Miss Trelawney
unlocked a cabinet, and presented the miniature to him.
The general started when he unclosed the case, and could
scarcely believe the evidence of his eyes,- for it was his
own picture.
“Did Marian do this,” he exclaimed, “and from
memory?”
“Yes; not long after you went to India, I believe,
but it is not many years since I discovered it; I never
suspected that she had the talent. Since then she has
painted me, but not like. Here it is.”
The general took the picture ; but he found that

355
though Marian had flattered him, she had not flattered
her sister. “She has done me more than justice,” said
he, as he returned Miss Trelawney's picture ; “but you
much less.” And he could not help saying to himself,
“In what bright and pleasing colours must I have lived
in her remembrance !”
“But see, general! here is another proof of her
talents, in which I surprised her the other day, and
really forced her to show me. She then went into a
little back room where Marian kept her books and other
things, and out of the drawer of her painting-box she
took an unfinished miniature. Again the general beheld
himself, but as he now was ; and he stood gazing at this
new proof of accurate remembrance, with a feeling of
gratification which deprived him of utterance; when au
exclamation of “Come, give me the pictures in a moment,
here is Marian coming,” roused him from his pleasing
trance, and he tried to compose his feelings before she
arrived.
She came in smiling with her usual calm sweetness ;
but her quick eye soon discovered that her sister looked
rather fluttered, and the general a good deal. What
could have passed between them? Could the report
which she had just heard be true, that the general
admired her sister? If so, she ought to rejoice. But
no: it was mere gossip, and perhaps she was mistaken ;
and they were really as composed as she was.
At this moment two carriages passed each other
before the window, and the general starting up asked
“whose carriages they were, as the livery was new to him.”
“Oh!” cried Miss Trelawney, “no wonder you do
not know the livery, for I believe their owners wore a
livery when you went away. They are the carriages of
some of our parvenus, our new rich people, of whom we
have plenty."
"Well,” said Marian, “it is pleasant to see industry
meet its reward; it is much to a man's credit to be the
2 A 2

architect of his own fortune ; and we ought to rejoice
in his success.”
“But that is not quite so easy under our circum-
stances,” said Miss Trelawney.
“ And indeed, my dear friend,” said the general, “it
is more painful, believe me, to witness the fall of some,
than it is pleasant to behold the rise of others.”
“No doubt,” said Marian : “but there are some feel-
ings one ought to strive against.”
At this moment the same carriages repassed, and Miss
Trelawney pettishly exclaimed, “I declare those people's
carriages make twice the noise of those of other people.”
“ The carriages of parvenus, I suspect,” observed
Marian with a melancholy and meaning smile, “ always
grate more on the nerves than those of others.”
“I really think so,” replied her sister, unconscious of
Marian's meaning; “ for coaches and chariots do not
seem so well hung now, as they were when our coach
was built.”
No one replied, and here the conversation dropped.
Miss Trelawney meanwhile had resolved to be in-
genuous; and in order to take advantage of the certainty
she had that the general approved the new plan for
Marian, she determined to propose it to her in Monther-
mer's presence.
Accordingly she told her, she had shown the general
her own picture.
“ Your own picture! Harriet,” cried Marian turning
pale, and then red, “how could you ?—You know that"
---here she looked earnestly at the countenance of both,
and saw clearly that she was informed of only half the
truth. “Nay, Harriet,” she exclaimed in a faltering
voice, “ this was not fair—it was very unkind—very.”
“What was unfair and unkind ? to show our good
friend here how well you paint, and, and—”
“No; but you showed him, I suppose, more than
your own picture.”

"I did.”
“I did not think, sister, you would have done such a
thing,” said Marian, turning to the window to hide her
confusion.
“ How can you be so unkind,” cried the general,
affected and gratified by her emotion, “as to be angry
with your sister for giving me so much pleasure ? Little
did I think that I was so well remembered by you,
Marian: If I had, the thought would have gladdened
many a mournful hour.”
Marian now hastily ran into her own little room; and
having examined the drawer of her painting-box, she
saw the unfinished likeness had been meddled with;
and returning, looking even paler than before, she just
had power to say, “ Indeed ! indeed! I know not how
to forgive this !” and then sunk on her chair in an agony
of tears.
Though grieved to see her so distressed, Monthermer
was pleased also. To have painted his likeness, and to
have shown it, would have only proved her power and
vanity as an artist; but to have painted it in secret, to
have succeeded, and yet never have vaunted of what she
had done ; to have wished to conceal it from every eye,
and to be agonized at having it exposed to his ;—this
proved unquestionably, he hoped, the secret tenderness
of a delicate and feeling woman, afraid, and conscious,
that her secret was discovered. And while her sister
hung over her, affectionately apologizing and regretting
that she had distressed her, Monthermer grasped her
hand, and pressed it to his lips.
Marian then suddenly rose and left the room.
“I am so sorry that my sister is thus overpowered,"
observed Miss Trelawney ; “ for I wanted to discuss the
subject of her becoming a regular artist before you, as
you approve the plan.”
“I approve the plan! I approve your sister's having
men to sit to her for their pictures ?' Oh! no, madam,


## p. 358 (#374) ############################################

such a scheme is too indelicate for me to approve it, I
assure you. But tell me, madam, has your sister never
painted any other gentleman from memory?"
“ No, sir I believe never.”
“ When I went abroad she was talked of for Mr.
Montague, and was I thought to have—m-married him."
“ Yes, so we all thought; but when he offered to her,
she refused him.”
“ Refused him!”
“ Yes, and no one knew why."
“ But, madam, the world here says that there is
another gentleman who is sure not to be refused if he
offers,—Mr. Ainslie.”
“ The world here is a very meddling world. Mr.
Ainslie has offered, and was refused at once, much to my
distress. But remember, general, I say this to you in
confidence. It is very wrong, you know, to tell of such
things. Yes, Marian certainly has always stood in her
own light (as the saying is) as well as myself; but then
I was ambitious; and had I believe pretensions to look
high. But Marian was not ambitious; and I know not
to what to attribute her dislike to marry, except she has
an attachment: and that I think I must have found
out,” she added with an expression of confidence in her
own penetration.
Marian now re-entered the room, but evidently avoided
meeting the general's eye ; and sat in painful con-
sciousness. He now told them he was going to Lord
M.'s the next day, and should probably be away two
months : and he saw Marian turn pale, while her sister
said, “ Lord M. has two beautiful and accomplished
daughters, I think.”
“ He has; I have heard them much praised.”
“ How does your sister-in-law, general, like the idea
of this visit ? for, as she spares nobody, nobody spares
her ;-and-you understand me, general—”.
“ I do, madam,” he replied with an arch smile :


## p. 359 (#375) ############################################

359
“ and she does not like the visit at all :--but I do; and
that is enough for me.”
Marian tried to laugh, but could not: and the general,
saying he would call the next day before he set off, took
his leave.
Before they met again, Marian, used to conquer her
feelings, received him with her usual composure. Still
her look had somewhat of resignation in it, as if she
had made up her mind to bear an expected evil : and
long after he had taken his leave, and ceased to see her,
that touching look of meek resignation haunted his fancy.
During the general's absence, the sisters received
many calls—not from friendship, but curiosity in the
callers; and some fancying Miss Trelawney, if not Miss
Marian, had hopes of marrying their old friend, had an
amiable gratification in assuring them (finding he had
not written to either of them) that he was certainly
going to be married to Lady Laura M— ..
“ Very likely," was Marian's calm reply: but her
sister, who really had flattered herself the general
seriously admired her beauty, was scarcely able to
restrain her anger, as she protested she did not believe
the report was true.
But at length it was so positively asserted, that even
Miss Trelawney was convinced; and Mrs. Monthermer,
though the general had not acquainted her husband
with his prospects, called on the sisters, in order to
mortify them as she hoped, if they had had any expecta-
tions, by telling them she had little doubt of the fact,
for she had a great antipathy towards Marian; because,
though she saw nothing in her, she found she was a
general favourite with men, and particularly with her
husband. But Marian's mild and open eye shrunk not
from hers, and Miss Trelawney's pride kept her calm
while Mrs. Monthermer talked of the dear general's
happy prospects : adding, “ As he would play the fool
and marry, which certainly we could not wish at his time

of life, and with his yellow skin, indicative no doubt of
a liver complaint, I am glad he marries a young lady of
rank, one whose alliance one can be proud of. I should
have been sorry if he had married beneath him in any
respect.”
So should I,” replied Marian ; and Mrs. Mon-
thermer, mortified at their composure, took her leave.
A day or two after, the general returned, and his first
visit was to the sisters. It was now the beginning of
December; and Parliament being unexpectedly called
together, he was going that week to London, but he
wished to visit his friends before he went.
Though Marian received Mrs. Monthermer without
emotion, she was not so self-possessed when she saw
the general, and she grieved to think she had lost the
power of receiving him with composure ; but she soon
resumed her look of mild resignation. “Ha! that look
again!” thought the general.
Miss Trelawney was, he saw, evidently fluttered, and
full of some particular meaning: at last she said, “ Well,
general, out with it! tell us yourself, though I assure
you we know it already.”
“ Know what?”
“ That you are going to be married to Lady Laura
M "
Marian tried to look arch, and to smile ; but she did
not succeed.
“ Lady Laura M— is very charming," replied the
general ; “but I am not going to be married to her.”
“ Well, but you are going to be married to some
one?"
“I have not made my proposals yet to any one,”
replied the general ;-" I have not upon my honour.”
« Well, but,”
“ But what? Surely, dear madam, even you, my
old and very dear friend, have no right to interrogate me
further."

« Right? No, General Monthermer, I don't claim any
right; only as a friend, anxious for your welfare,
1-”
“Well, dear madam, I know and respect your friendly
anxiety; and in return I assure you again, on my
honour, that when I am an accepted lover you shall be
the first person informed of it, should that happy event
ever take place.”
“ There, Harriet, are you not satisfied now?” said
Marian ; her own mind, she scarcely knew why, con-
siderably lightened of its burden.
The general, whose observations did not sleep during
this scene, now suddenly turned to her and said,
“ Marian, I know you do not mind wind and weather:
and I think a walk on the beach would do us both
good. Do you not think, Miss Trelawney, Marian would
be better for the walk ?”
"Miss Marian will accompany you, I dare say,” she
replied in her most freezing manner.
What is the matter?” cried the general, “ and how
have I offended?”
“Oh! do not be alarmed,” said Marian laughing;
“ but that dear particular creature does not approve
your calling me Marian, that is all.”
« No! Well, I am very sorry to hear it ; but I assure
you, dear Miss Trelawney, I shall never presume to call
you Harriet, and that degree of decorum must, I believe,
content you.”
“ As to decorum, sir," said Miss Trelawney, “I
rather suspect both you and my sister are going to violate
it, by walking together alone. The X — people do
talk of you and us already.”
“Do they? Then they shall talk still more; and after
I return with Marian, if you will walk with me also, we
shall puzzle them completely, and the power of gossip
will, by that means, be neutralized.”
- Miss Trelawney could not laugh at any thing so serious

as a breach of decorum ; but Marian smiling took the
general's arm, and hastened with him to the beach.
Their walk was long; so long, that when they returned,
Miss Trelawney had waited dinner a whole hour; and
poor Marian, in blushing distress, earnestly urged her
sister to forgive her first fault in that way, “ for you
know,” said she, “ I never made dinner wait before.”
“ And I will almost venture to promise she will never
do it again,” said the general
Miss Trelawney was vexed, but she was soon appeased;
especially as Marian, overcome with some internal emotion,
called for a glass of wine, and seemed rather faint. The
general staid till she was quite recovered, and then took
his leave ; saying as he did so, “ Remember! only to
her!”
The next day he went to London, and did not return
till the Christmas holidays ; nor till the delighted Miss
Trelawney had heard her sister say, to the great distress
of her little pupils and their parents, that she should
keep school no more.
The general, before his return, had ordered invitations
to be sent out for an evening party, which he meant to
give during the recess of Parliament; and he now arrived
to superintend the preparations. The sisters left X-
for a few days just before he came, and returned the
day he did.
The day of the party now arrived ; and as many new
dresses were made up for it, as for a court presentation :
for now it was well known that General Monthermer was
not going to be married, and hope was again alive in the
hearts of the young and the elderly.
To this soirée the sisters consented to go, and brave
all remarks ; and their appearance ‘at it, and their dress,
did indeed excite considerable notice, and call forth
rather severe animadversions; for Miss Trelawney was
splendidly attired in a silver muslin, and her sister in
white satin ; while her fine throat was encircled by a row

363
of orient pearls, and her fine hair fastened up with a
diamond comb.
“ I begin to think,” whispered Mrs. Monthermer,
who did the honours, and received the sisters very coldly,
“ I begin to think the general is not a marrying man :
-you understand me!” and the whisper was not slow,
in circulating round the room, though there were few
present who gave any credence to so vile an insinuation.
Still, so general is the tendency to detraction, that many
spread the sneer, who did not believe what it implied,
and Marian found herself in a very trying situation ;
especially as the general paid her such marked attention
as could not but attract general notice.
At length, at one o'clock in the morning, supper was
announced; and then, to the surprise of every one, and
to no one more than to Mrs. Monthermer, Mr. Mon-
thermer took the hand of Marian and led her down
stairs, and to the head of the principal supper-table ;
while the general seated himself at the bottom of it:
and when the company had all taken their seats, he
filled a glass, and called on all the guests to drink to
the health of the bride and bridegroom, General and
Mrs. George Monthermer.
Surprise, not unmixed with consternation, now kept
every one silent till the toast was repeated ; and then it
was drunk with an universal cheer from the gentlemen.
Mr. Monthermer whispered his indignant wife to keep
her own counsel, and no one would know she had not
been in the secret, and she wisely took the hint ; for by
this means she avoided the disgrace of having attacked
the fame of Marian or her sister, as she would seem to
have been purposely imposing on those who had dis-
seminated her base whisper.
The general had now a pride and a pleasure in declar-
ing that he had married the only woman he had ever loved,
and whose image had prevented his ever marrying
before ; while his happy wife was not slow to own, that

it was for his sake, hopeless as was her attachment, that
she had refused offers which she should otherwise have
been proud to accept. Monthermer had gone to Lord
M's purposely to expose his constancy to the temptations
which awaited him there, and had found it proof against
everything; he had then returned, sure of himself, to
prove the heart of Marian, which he fancied he had read
aright before he departed : and then, having drawn
from Marian an exact detail of what had been said,
purposely to wound her and her sister's feelings, if they
were vulnerable on that subject, by his sister-in-law
and others, he devised the scene of the supper and its
painful surprise, as a merited and unexpected mortifi-
cation to them.
Accordingly he had fixed to meet the sisters, and had
met them with a special license at a very picturesque
village, well known to them and him in the days of
their youth, the scene of many a rural frolic; and there
he received the hand of the woman whom he had loved
through every change of scene, of climate, and of
fortune.
Six months had now elapsed since the general parted
with Ronald Breadalbane; but though he had written
to him, he had never received a letter in return, and he
began to fear that he was either ill or unhappy. Still he
thought it right to impart to him the happy change in
his situation, and to offer to visit him with his bride in
the summer recess of Parliament. In this letter the
general assured him no beauty of scenery was necessary
to heighten his sense of heart-felt happiness, and that
if he would deign to visit the flat plains and shores of
X- he hoped he should be able to convince him,
that the affections flourished as luxuriantly on the land
of the plain, as on the land of the rock and the
mountain.
This letter was crossed on the road by one from
Breadalbane, sealed with black : it told a tale of sorrows

and disappointments. “I found,” said he, “the friends
of my childhood dead or emigrated, the girl of my heart
false, and just married to another; and I fell ill in conse-
quence of this second blow. But my parents still lived,
and hung over my fevered couch ; therefore I was not
yet desolate; but when I recovered, their health, which
had been gradually declining, and which anxiety for
mine had helped to injure, soon began to decay percep-
tibly to my view; and they did not long survive each
other. O Monthermer, how forcibly have your words
ever since recurred to me! How true do I feel your
observations in our last journey together!
“ Yes; I now own it is only too true, that unless
inhabited by objects whom one loves, the finest scenery
becomes insipid and uninteresting; and I believe,
therefore, that the most flat and dreary of abodes, if
cheered by the looks of affection, may seem an earthly
paradise.
“Dear general, Scotland is still indeed the land of the
mountain and the valley, and dear to the soul and the
eye of the poet and the painter ; but to me it is now also
the land of disappointment, of solitude and desolation,
and I must quit it till I can form new ties, or forget
those which exist no more.”
The general could not receive this melancholy letter
without feeling the tenderest sympathy for the writer ;
and he lost not a moment in inviting Breadalbane,-
now Sir Ronald Breadalbane, —to change the scene
entirely by coming to him ; and he trusted that time and
new ties would restore to the mourner, feelings more
consonant to his years and his nature; and that the
lesson of experience would teach him still more, that on
the proper and complete exercise of the affections alone,
the best happiness of life depends. And as the meanest
scrap of gauze, of bead, or of tinsel, looks beautiful and
costly through the reflecting mirror of the kaleidoscope,

so does the most common and dreary scene acquire
attraction and value, when beheld through the beautify-
ing medium of gratified affection.

THE QUAKER,
AND THE
YOUNG MAN OF THE WORLD.
THERE is nothing, perhaps, which occasions so curious
a mixture of heterogeneous characters, as travelling in
stage coaches, and persons meet there, whom the chances
of life could not well bring together in any other place.
A very fine-looking young man, whose dress bespoke
him to be a beau of the first order, found himself one
day in a stage coach, tête-à-tête with an elderly man
belonging to the people called Friends; or, to speak in
a more intelligible language to my readers in general,
with a plain Quaker, that is, a Quaker dressed according
to the strictest rules of the society to which he belongs.
It was very soon evident to the Quaker that his young
companion was unhappy; and as benevolence was a
leading trait in his character, he wished, no doubt, as
Sterne says, that it was now as it was in the days of
Esdras, and that he could have said to him, “ Brother,
what aileth thee, and wherefore art thou disquieted ?”
But the common usages of society forbade him thus
to speak. However, all he could do, he did : he tried
to draw him from the indulgence of his own painful
thoughts into conversation, and sometimes he succeeded.
The conversation, too, was such as to give each a
favourable impression of the other, as they agreed, they
found, on some subjects of importance.


## p. 368 (#384) ############################################

THE QUAKER, AND THE
While the coach stopped for the coachman to deliver
parcels, not long after they first set off, a poor lame
negro came and begged at the door; and both the
gentlemen took out money to relieve him, for Disease
seemed to have marked him for his own; but before any
questions could be put to him, the coachman smacked
his whip, and there was only time for the donations to
be dropped in his hat.
“ It is certainly wrong,” observed the Quaker, “ to
encourage beggars in general; but this poor man was so
evidently diseased, I could not help giving him a little
assistance, because thou knowest he may not be able to
work.”
" True, sir : besides he was a black man ; and when-
ever one of that injured race begs of me, I cannot refuse
him, because I remember the original cruelty and injus-
tice which probably brought him and his parents into a
strange land, and made him an object of charity.”
“I sympathize with thee on that subject, and am glad
to hear thee admit the poor African's claim to be con-
sidered as “a man and a brother.” This led to a wide
discussion of abolition, emancipation, and so on. Cruelty
to animals was next expatiated upon : and as our travel-
lers agreed thoroughly on these subjects, it is to be
supposed that each thought the other very sensible and
very humane.
The prepossession on one side was soon after consider-
ably strengthened by an accident. The coachman drove
against a post; and before our travellers could get the
glasses down, (which the rain had forced them to draw
up,) the coach overturned with great violence.
The young man, whose name was Frank Warburton,
was not at all hurt himself ; but he was much distressed
at seeing that the glass had cut open the forehead of the
Quaker, and on hearing him say, that in falling he had
dislocated his wrist. As soon therefore as they could
quit the coach, Warburton mounted one of the horses;

369
and asking where the nearest surgeon could be found,
he galloped off full speed to a distance of near two miles
in search of him ; while the good Quaker looked after
him with grateful emotion, and said to himself, “ Thou
art truly kind, poor youth! I wish I knew what ails
thee!”
Warburton returned at as full speed as he went, and
brought word that the surgeon was coming.
“I am obliged to thee, much obliged to thee,” said the
Quaker. “But do sit down. Dear, dear, how hot thou
art! I fear thou wilt suffer for thy kindness, and that
would grieve me.”
The surgeon arrived soon after; and having dressed
the wound and pulled in the wrist, the Quaker, whose
name was John Reynolds, declared himself quite able to
resume his journey as soon as the coach was made fit to
go in.
"And will you venture in the coach again ?” said
Warburton.
“ If thou dost, why should not I ?”'
“I, sir, have no reason to fear, as I have escaped so
well.”
“I ask thy excuse there, for thy turn to be hurt is
still to come, and mine is over : but I think the best
security for us both is, that the driver's recent accident
will make him doubly careful."
“But, sir, will not the jar of the coach hurt your
limb ?”
“So would the jar of a chaise; therefore I am willing
to go on in the coach, as thou art.”
“For my own part, sir, I care not how I go,” replied
the young man, “provided I go with you.”
“I thank thee, friend—What is thy name?”.
'“ Frank Warburton.”
“Well, I thank thee, Frank Warburton. I do think,”
he added, looking in the glass, “I have a very warlike
appearance from this patch on my forehead, for a man

THE QUAKER, AND THE
of my peaceful persuasion :—what will Friends think
when I appear at our quarterly meeting to-morrow ?”
The coach was now ready to set off, and our travellers
proceeded on their journey.
The young man's attention to his companion now
became truly gratifying to the latter, and honourable to
himself. He insisted on holding up the elbow of the
dislocated wrist, in order to keep it steady, and was con-
tinually calling out to the driver to avoid the stony parts
of the road.
There is not in the daily intercourse of life any charm
like attention—and attention in trifles; and a heart so
given to be kind itself, as that of the Quaker's, was
formed to feel deeply, benevolent attention from another :
and again and again the good man said to himself, “I
wonder, poor youth! if thou needest a friend, and if I
could be a friend to thee?”
While these thoughts were passing in the Quaker's
mind, he sunk into silence; and (as he always did, when
not roused by his companion's questions, or his anxiety
for him) Warburton fell into a reverie, from which he
occasionally abruptly started; then by throwing himself
about, and heaving very deep sighs, he convinced the
Quaker more than ever that his mind was painfully
burthened.
“ I will try,” thought Mr. Reynolds, “ to find out
what is the matter with him, and youth is usually com-
municative.”
The coachman now stopped to throw a parcel down
for a young woman to catch ; but she missed it, and as
it fell into the road she took it up quite covered with mud.
“I thought she would miss it,” cried Warburton
with an unusual expression of sarcastic bitterness on
his face ; “ women are always so awkward ! they are to
be trusted neither in great nor little things :-they are
all alike,” he added, beating his boots very audibly with
a small stick which he had in his hand.


## p. 371 (#387) ############################################

YOUNG MAN OF THE WORLD.
371
“ So so!” thought the Quaker, " then a woman
some way or other is at the bottom of this kind boy's
uneasiness ;- then I fear I can do little for him : but
I owe him some kindness in return for his, and I
will see what I can do." And while he was thus
ruminating, Warburton was muttering between his
closed teeth, “ Who lost Mark Antony the world ? A
woman!”
“ That Mark Antony was but a silly fellow,” observed
the Quaker smiling : “ and thou art but young in life
yet, to have had reason to entertain such a low opinion
of women as thou seemest to do :—thou must have
been unfortunate in thy associations, Frank War-
burton?”
“ Not more than most other men, I dare say.”
“ I am obliged to thee, then, for giving me a new
cause for thankfulness ; for, if association with women
gives most men reason to think ill of them, my happier
experience has made me value them the more, the more
I have known of them; and I think this a favour.”
“And so it is. But, sir, if you had ever suffered
like me—had you loved, revered a being as I have done,
and then been forced to forego your high opinion of that
beloved being, and to find that she whom you thought
superior to the rest of her sex, was weak, like the
weakest of them,—then, sir, you would not wonder
that I execrate the whole sex for her sake.”
“ Yes, I should; for I always wonder at injustice :
and I cannot, to oblige thee, think ill of my mother,
my wife, and my daughter, even couldest thou prejudice
me against the rest of the sex.”
“ Your mother, sir! Have you a mother?”
“ No, not now.”
“ And was she a good woman, sir?”
“I believed her so, according to the usual acceptation
of the word good.”
“ Believed her so ! but was she really good ?”

THE QUAKER, AND THE
“ Yes, in my opinion she was; and I thought her the
more so, because she did not think herself so.”
“ And before she died, sir, she did nothing to forfeit
your good opinion ?”.
“ Nothing, but much to increase it.”
“ Happy you, sir! But do not talk of your mother's
goodness to me, sir, as I can't bear it, indeed I can't!”
The good friend looked at him in amazement, and
coolly replied, “I ask thy excuse ; but how could I
be aware that I should distress thee, by assurances of
my mother's goodness ?” .
Here the coach stopped, and the travellers alighted.
Warburton had always intended to dine at this place,
though the Quaker had not : however, as he was kindly
curious to know more of his fellow-traveller, he resolved
to dine there also, though his own carriage was waiting
for him at the inn. The young man had by this time
found that the conversation of his companion was better
than his own thoughts, he was therefore very glad of
this respite from them; and the dinner meal passed
pleasantly away. But the cloth was scarcely removed,
and the wine set on the table, when Warburton sunk
into reverie again ; and starting up, he traversed the
room with hasty strides, exclaiming,
“No, I never never will forgive her! I never will see
her again while I live! To form such a marriage !—No,
it is not to be pardoned ! and while I live, I never never
will forgive her!" So saying, he re-seated himself.
“Though thou hast not addressed thy discourse to
me, I shall act,” said the Friend, “ as if thou hadst done
so, and reply to it. Thy resolve is a very unchristian
one :-And who is it that thou wilt never forgive ? Is
it thy affianced mistress ? has she married another, and
forgotten thee ?”
“Oh, no! I have no mistress, and never was in love
yet."
“Well well, it is thy sister, perhaps, who has married

373
to displease thee, and whom thou wilt not forgive,
though thou art commanded to be reconciled to thy
brother.'”
“My sister! No, I have no sister. The person whom
I will never see, and never forgive, is my mother.”
“Thy mother !” cried the Quaker in a tone of excessive
surprise; “poor, unfortunate woman ! how ill she must
have brought thee up!”
“Sir, I do not understand what you mean by that.
My mother is a very clever woman, and a good woman,
sir, and has been a good mother."
“So, then, it is a good mother whom thou wilt never
forgive? Worse and worse! But I tell thee she has not
been a good mother : she has not done her duty by thee,
if she has not taught thee, and from the best authority,
to forgive injuries.”
“She has not taught me to forgive such injuries as
she has done my brother and me.”
“That is, she has not taught thee one of the first of
duties—to honour thy father and thy mother.”
“I suppose, sir, you are preaching to me,” replied
Warburton angrily.
“ Yes, according to thy ideas of preaching, I am ;
but not according to mine. But come, I am pleased
with thy bearing my interference so well; and I really
wish to serve thee in return for thy service to me; so do
sit down and tell me thy complaint against thy poor
mother."
“Why, sir, she is married ! married to a man who
was only my father's clerk originally, and then was his
partner; a man of no family !-And to think of her
giving us such a father-in-law a man whom I am sure
she could not love. What her motive could be we cannot
imagine ; but we shall both be of age in two years, and
have our fortunes, and then we mean to leave England,
and never see her more. In the meanwhile-

“Oh no-turned fifty.”
“ Is her husband rich ?”
“ Very.”
“Is she well jointured ?”
“ Yes.”
“Did she love thy father?”
“ Tenderly.”
“ Is her husband an artful man ?”
“ No; and till this event my brother and myself
thought highly of him, and he has always been truly
kind to us.”
“The marriage surprises me. But very likely there
are palliating circumstances we know not of. Still its
strangeness ought not to lead thee to such undutiful
violence against thy mother. Dost thou forget who
teaches us to 'forgive our enemies as we hope to be for-
given ?'—and is a child not to forgive his parent?”!
“Well well, I may forgive her; but I will never see
her again."
“ Then thou dost not forgive. True forgiveness can
only show itself by an overt act; and if thou wilt not
see, thou hast not forgiven thy mother. And really I
cannot see the great hardship of the case. Thou and
thy brother have independent fortunes; and thy mother
has married a rich and respectable man, whose only
faults are, that he was once a clerk in the house where
he is now a principal; that is, that he learnt his business
before he undertook it, and that he is become thy father-
in-law !”
“But, sir, for an elegant woman like my mother to
marry a man who really is not presentable!”
“Not presentable ! what may that be, pray? Dost
thou mean not presentable at court? But is he pre-
sentable as much as frail man can be in the highest of
all courts ? that is the only important capability, and
that thou dost not deny. But keep thy seat, and do
not shake thy knee in that unquiet manner. I will tell

thee my story in return for thine.—I lost my father
when I was about thy age; and he was a father to be
proud of, if pride were not a feeling to be conquered :
and I had also pride in my mother, and I loved her
dearly. I left home about two years after my father's
removal, in order to establish some commercial cor-
respondences, when news reached me from my mother
of her intention of marrying Robert Hickman, a man
inferior to herself in situation ;-an honest man, but
scarcely in the line of a gentleman amongst us, and with
a large family of children by a first wife! and she added,
that she was then going before meetings.”
“Shocking !" exclaimed Warburton. “Why this was
a worse marriage than my mother's.”
“Much worse.”
“ Well, sir, to be sure you did not forgive her soon,
or see her soon ?”'
“Young man, it never came into my head to conceive
it possible that a Christian should not forgive any one ;
how then was it possible for me not to forgive a parent ?
And after a few hours of painful reflection, I wrote
kindly to her, earnestly hoped that the step which she
was going to take would make her happy; and being at
Norwich at the time, I sent her a piece of light-coloured
and dark-coloured bombazeen for wedding-gowns.”
“Astonishing indulgence indeed, sir! Before I would
have given my mother a wedding-gown, I would—”.
“Have let her perish, no doubt,” replied the Friend,
smiling sarcastically. “Well, it was good for the
Norwich weavers that I was of a contrary opinion ; and
I had resolution to return home time enough to be at
her wedding: but I must own it was a trial to me,
though it was softened to me when I found Robert
Hickman had been her first love ;-still it was a trial.”
" And one no power on earth could have made me to
undergo.”
“Nor me. The power that influenced me to bear it

was not of earth : but she was my mother, and I did my
best to 'honour her.' —But thou hast yet to hear more
of my misdeeds as thou wilt call them. I had scarcely
been settled two years in a business in London, when
my father-in-law died, leaving his affairs much disordered,
and my mother his five children to maintain.”
“ It served her right.”
“ Poor thing! she thought so too, I fear.”
“ Well, what did you do for her, sir?”
“ The only thing that I could do. I gave up my own
business :-I left London and took the management of
her husband's trade and affairs, and I worked to help
her to maintain her husband's children.”
“No!—did you really ?”
“ I did.”
“ Sir,” said Warburton, squeezing the good man's
hand till he almost made him call out, “ I honour, but
I cannot imitate you.”
“ That is unfortunate ; for I wished thee to imitate
and not honour me:-for what honour is there due to
simply doing one's duty? Honour, indeed! Ah, that is
worldly language, and means little!”
“ Means little! Indeed I mean what I say; I never
say what I do not mean.”
“ Yes, thou dost; for thou sayest thou wilt never see
thy mother, and never forgive her: and yet I dare say
thou wouldst gladly go and throw thyself on her neck
this moment.”
“ You are mistaken, sir ; though I must own I do not
feel as angry as I did.”
« Well, I will go on with my story.—I left off at my
taking my father-in-law's business.- I was active and
cautious, and I restored order to the affairs. In short,
we got money : I portioned off two of the girls, put the
two boys into trade, and— But I am really afraid of
telling thee what I did by the third girl, thou wilt think
it such a high crime and misdemeanour.”

“ Indeed, sir!”
“ Yes; for I made her my wife! There was another
mis-alliance, thou seest."
“Well, sir, I can only hope that the young lady was
deserving of you.”
“ She is one of the best of wives :--but it is wrong
to boast.”
“ Then, sir, you have been well rewarded for your
goodness.”
« I wish thou wouldst not use such strong words as
goodness in such a light manner; but that is the fault of
thy education and thy association with worldlings.”
“ I am but a worldling myself.”
“ I know it; and so much the worse for thee:-yet I
see much about thee that I like; and now, Frank War-
burton, attend to the conclusion of my story. My poor
mother after a lingering illness lay on the bed of death;
and then it was that I reaped what thou wouldst call the
reward of all that I had done for her;—for she thanked
me so touchingly, owned her weakness in marrying, but
could not regret it, as it had proved my love for her, and,
as she was pleased to say, tried and shown my worth.
I will not, cannot, ought not to tell thee all she said :
but it was sweetly soothing to hear such words from a
parent; a dying parent too; and when I looked my last
look at her coffin, as the first dust was thrown on it, I
turned away with such a feeling of satisfaction here "
(laying his hand on his heart.) “Now listen to me,
Frank Warburton :-If thy mother were to be suddenly
called away, would thy feelings be as comfortable as
mine?”
Warburton could not speak; but he laid his head on
the table and burst into tears. When he recovered him-
self, he owned in the agony of his feelings, that he had
written in the first paroxysm of his anger, in his brother's
name and his own, a very severe letter to his mother,
renouncing her as a parent, and vowing he would never

enter the doors of the man whom she had disgraced
herself by marrying.
“ Poor thing! how I feel for her! It must be so bit-
terly painful for a parent to be renounced by a child;
and thee, poor rash boy! how I pity thee! If she should
fall ill, and if thy letter should destroy her!”
" Sir, if you have any humanity, do not conjure up
that horrible image again.”
“ Not if thou wilt conjure it away thyself, by writing
another and a better letter to thy mother.”
“ I should be ashamed to write such a one so soon
after the other.”
“No: it is of the first letter thou shouldst be
ashamed, not of the second. Come, write ; I beg thee
to write : for I tell thee, if thou dost not write thou wilt
live to repent it. Suppose thy mother ”.
“ Hush do not say that again, and I will do any thing."
Warburton then threw himself on his feelings; blamed
his own impetuosity, implored his mother's pardon for
the offensive expressions in his last, and offered to come
and see her whenever she would receive him. But the
good old man could not prevail on him to name her
husband, or apologize to him. However, he had done
more than he expected, and he tried to be satisfied.
“ And now," said he, “I do hope thou wilt have no
reason to regret meeting with John Reynolds. But
whither art thou going now?”
“I am going to a friend's house in the neighbourhood;
and I shall come hither again the day after to-morrow to
see for letters, and await here an answer to my letter of
to-day.”
" I shall return hither at the same time. Shall we
dine together, all things permitting?”
“With all my heart; and believe me, dear sir, I can
never forget your kind interest in a thoughtless young
man like me.”
“ If thou wert only thoughtless, I should have not

taken interest in thee, but I believed there was something
in thee that was well worth the trouble of bringing out,
and I was not deceived. I have probed thy heart, and
I find it sound at bottom. Farewell! we shall meet
again, I trust.”
They then went their separate ways; and at the
appointed time they met again at the inn.
* Well,” said Mr. Reynolds, “ hast thou any thing
new to tell me?”
“ No; the post is not in yet. But I fear I can't have
an answer to my last letter to-day, though my mother is
only five-and-twenty miles off : because there is no cross
post, the letter must go to London.”
“ That is a pity, as I should like to have known what
her answer was.”
The post now came in, and a letter was brought to
Warburton. “ It is that horrid fellow's ugly hand,”
said he, throwing it down; “and what can he have to
say to me? Why does not my mother write herself?
I can't bear to open it.”
“ Let me see the address. An ugly hand! Thou art
fastidious, friend Warburton : it is a very good hand.
Perhaps thy mother is ill, and can't write. It must
have been a very powerful reason, indeed, to make her
allow her husband to degrade himself by writing to thee
so soon after thy lowering expressions towards him.
Pray open thy letter.-I feel anxious.”
“ And you have made me so.”
He opened the letter, and read as follows :-
“Mr. Frank Warburton—Sir,
“ I am desired by my dear wife, who has been very
ill ever since the receipt of your terrible letter (her own
word), to tell you that she thinks she is dying ; and
therefore she conjures you to let her see you as soon as
possible: as, though you and your brother (to whom I
also write) have cast off your living mother, she is sure

you will forgive a dying one; and she has something to
impart to you. Be not afraid, sir, that I shall intrude
myself into your presence: but I beg you to consider
my house as yours as long as you please.
- B. B.”
Warburton had not read further than the third line,
before he had rung the bell almost off, and desired a
post-chaise-and-four to be got ready directly; and then
gave way to such a violent paroxysm of feeling, that
Mr. Reynolds, used only to live with persons of subdued
emotions, feared his reason was affected.
“O sir! read that,” said he, “and be assured that
I shall always bless your name. Had I not written to
her before I received this, I should have been distracted.”
Reynolds read the letter, and with much emotion.
He too then rang the bell; and casting a look of great
pity on his agitated companion, he desired the waiter to
put a pair of posters to his horses, which were quite
fresh, and that would save time.
“ I will not, nay I cannot let thee go alone, with thy
mind in this state : I am the father of sons, and I know
how I should have wished another to behave to a son of
mine under such circumstances: so, though thou art a
stranger to me, I will be thy companion.”
« Õ sir, you are too good.”
“ Dear me, what with thy ohs and ahs, and thy
exaggerated expressions, thou art really a trial, poor
child, to my patience. But I can't help liking thee
notwithstanding, especially as in all thy violence thou
never yet hast taken the Great Name in vain. Besides,
I recollect thou art very young---not a man yet in the
eye of the law, thou knowest."
“ But I am old enough, sir, to value you as you
deserve, and to value also your admonitions ; and I will
profit by them if I can.")"
“ That ' if I can pleases me far more than a positive

381
assurance of thy hope to profit by them would have
done, as it shows self-knowledge and self-distrust."
The chariot now came round, and the travellers set
off. On the road Mr. Reynolds beguiled the time, and
tried to divert Warburton's attention from himself, by
asking him details of his family, pursuits, and prospects
in life; from which he learnt that he was well born,
would have a handsome fortune when of age, and that
his mother had been only too tender and too indulgent.
“Aye, so indulgent that she spoiled thee; and so the
order of nature was reversed, and she became subservient
to thee, and not thou to her. Poor thing! It is a good
proverb—that slaves make tyrants, and not tyrants
slaves. Had she properly corrected thee when thou wert
young, thou wouldst not have dared thus to reprove and
treat her with indignity now she is old. What a pity it
is, that mothers will not remember, that though it is sweet
to be beloved, love itself is in danger of being worn
away, except it is fenced round by well-merited respect!”
“Well, sir, my mother might be weakly indulgent ;
but I assure you she has noble qualities; though I own
that maternal affection has been in her too much of a
passion perhaps.”
“A passion! it had better have been a principle ;
for I see it has ended in mischief and misery, as all
passions do.”
They were now approaching the abode of Mrs. Black-
more, and Warburton's emotions became almost uncon-
trollable.
“ If I should come too late! if "
“ Still remember thy last letter has probably been
received, and it would serve to heal her wounded spirit.”
“ Her wounded spirit! Yes—yes—her wounded
spirit :- but who wounded it ? Wretch ! Parricide! Oh!”
“ Well, Frank, if thou hast any comfort in calling
thyself names, I will not try to prevent thee; but thou
art afflicting thyself too soon. And see, convince thine

eyes, poor boy! we are driving up to the house ; and
indeed it does not look like the house of death.”
The carriage stopped :--but Warburton could not pre-
vail on himself to speak, or to alight till his kind friend
had gone in to ask a few questions. As the servant was
long in coming, and the door stood open, the good man
let himself out, and met the servant in the hall.
“ Thy mistress is alive, I trust ? ”
“O yes, and better, sir. She thinks herself better.”
“ Since when?”
“ Since yesterday, sir.”
“ Did she get a letter by the post ?”
“ Yes, sir; and she said, “This has done me much
good!' and she has been better ever since.”
Mr. Reynolds, who had quieted Warburton's fears by
an encouraging nod as soon as his first question had
been so satisfactorily answered, now hastened to the
carriage, drawing, as he did so, his hand across his eyes.
- Pshaw !” said he ; “ I believe thou hast infected
me with thy weakness.”
“ Well, sir!”
“ Wait a moment. Thy mother is better-Better, it
seems, poor fond soul, since she received thy letter.”
Here he paused, for Warburton's emotions were now
contagious.
“ Ăh, we parents are sad weak creatures, to have life
and death thus seemingly dependent on the caprice of
such shatter-brained folks as thou art. But do behave
like a man for once-wipe thine eyes and get out."
He then walked into the house: but Warburton sprung
after him, and rushed into the left-hand parlour.
“ Let thy mistress be told her son Frank is here."
“ Now do, Frank, remember, when thou seest her, a
sick woman has not my iron nerves; and even those thy
violence has weakened a little.”.
The servant now returned to tell Warburton that Mrs.
Rlackmore wished to see him instantly.

- What a good thing,” thought Mr. Reynolds, as he
walked up and down the room, “it would have been for
that impetuous youth to have been brought up amongst
FRIENDS!”
In twenty minutes Warburton returned, but worse
than when he went away. He oh'd and he ah'd more
than ever. He sobbed, he walked up and down the
room, and “I shall never forgive myself !” was all that
was intelligible.
“Dear, dear, what is the matter? Is thy mother
worse?”
“Oh, no, better !-Oh, I shall never forgive myself !”
“Really, dear boy, thou art quite unintelligible now.
First thou couldst not forgive thyself because thou hadst
made her ill; and now thou canst not forgive thyself
because thou hast made her well. Do explain.”
“I cannot yet ;-only that she is the noblest of beings,
and I the most ungrateful.”
Here he elevated his arms, struck his forehead, and
gave way to all that exuberance of feeling, to which
persons untaught to subdue their passions are apt to
yield.
“ Thou must excuse me, Frank, if I say that, though
I never saw a stage-player, I fancy thee to resemble one,
for I have seen mummers on stages in a fair. A few
tears may be pardoned, nay approved ; for we know
WHO ONCE WEPT : but these contortions, my good
Frank, do put a stop to ; and by making only one effort
to explain their cause to me, they will be at an end.”
Here the door opened, and Mr. Blackmore entered ;
but started back and would have retired on seeing War-
burton. Warburton, however, would not suffer him;
for springing forwards he seized his hand, grasped it to
his heart, and with difficulty articulated, “O, sir, forgive
me!”
Blackmore struggled to withdraw his hand, and said,
with deep feeling, "Rash boy! I do forgive you, as you

have not killed your mother.” He then suddenly left
the room.
“So that is thy father-in-law ! I liked his letter, but
I do not approve his speech to thee; and I agree with
thee in not liking his appearance much.
“O sir, say nothing against him, for I can't bear it.
He is the kindest and most generous of men !"
“He! what, that man whom it was a disgrace to thy
mother to marry ? Frank Warburton, canst thou be
talking of the sanie man to-day whom thou wert talking
of two days ago ?”
Blackmore now entered again, to apologize to Mr.
Reynolds, — whom kindness to his son-in-law had
brought thither, he found, for not having been able to
pay him proper attention, but that dinner was nearly
ready, and he hoped he would do him the honour of
partaking it.
“ I shall do myself honour, if I sit down to table
with the the kindest and most generous of men,' as
thy son-in-law calls thee.”
* Does he? Then his tone is a little altered.”
“It is :—but as he is very apt to use bouncing, high-
sounding epithets; and as he declares himself unable to
explain, perhaps thou wilt ; for really I am very im-
patient to know the right, and be able to reconcile con-
tradictions."
“ Yes, do explain, dear Mr. Blackmore,” cried
Frank; “ it would be too trying for me to do it; and
where you do not do yourself justice, I will.”
“ It is very disagreeable to talk of one-self: but if I
must I must ;- and I must say that there is a great deal
of fuss about nothing. You may know, sir, perhaps,
that I owe every thing to the late Mr. Warburton. He
educated me; he made me his clerk; he took me into
his business, that of an American merchant; and when
he left the business, I became the principal partner in
the house. He died about three years ago ; and while

385
arranging his affairs I had frequent opportunities of
seeing and being with his widow; and though I never
then thought of venturing to pay my addresses to her, I
became strongly attached to her; and for the mother's
sake I loved the children still more than I had ever done
--and I had always loved them tenderly.”
Here he paused in strong emotion, and Warburton
grasped his hand, while Mr. Reynolds looked out of the
window.
“ Time went on. I continued to see Mrs. Warburton,
and she could not but discover that attachment which
was so visible to others : but she gave me no encourage-
ment, and I remained silent. Things were in this state
when I heard a most painful piece of news. Mr. War-
burton had placed his son's fortunes in the hands of
_ and Co. much against my advice, to receive so
much per cent. till a favourable opportunity offered to
buy into the funds : but when he died, I, as executor,
wished to reclaim the money, as I preferred trusting
public rather than private security ; but I tried in vain
to get it back; and this circumstance alarmed me :-for
surely, thought I, if these men can't pay back a deposit
like this, they cannot be in a very good way: and the
event proved I was right; for I was privately informed
that in a few months, if not weeks, there would be a
crash in that quarter. I therefore went to Mrs. War-
burton with these documents; and as her jointure,
though handsome for herself, would be very little when
divided between her sons, she was overwhelmed with
distress at this utter blight to their prospects, especially
as she knew that their habits were expensive, and their
ambition great.”
“Well, friend Blackmore, go onWhy dost thou
pause?”
“Because now I must talk of myself. Seeing her so
distressed, I told her that as I owed all I had to her
husband, all I had was at the disposal of his children;

and that if she would suffer it, I would replace half the
money out of my savings, which her sons would lose by
the impending bankruptcy, and contrive to do it un-
known to them; and to make up to them at my death
the rest of their losses.”
“ And still not one word of thy love?”
“Not one :-it would have been very mean and very
ungenerous to urge my suit at such a moment.”
The good Friend now rose from his chair, and taking
Blackmore's hand said, “I truly respect thee. But
what said thy friend's widow ?”
“She thanked me, and said all she ought to have
said ; but owned her pride revolted, and she knew her
sons' pride would revolt, from owing such an obligation.
In vain I urged and entreated : she was resolute; and I
left her, resolving when I was gone to endeavour to dis-
close their ruined fortunes to her sons, then at college.
But to be brief : I now saw an opening for my suit
which I had not had before; so I wrote her word, that
though as Mrs. Warburton she could not accept obliga-
tions from me either for herself or sons, yet there was a
way to remove all obstacles : and then I pleaded my
love.”
“ And successfully?”
“Yes; that is to say, she owned that she loved the
memory of her husband too tenderly to love another man;
and that she had resolved never to marry : but that she
would make any sacrifice for the sake of her children;
and that she would marry me, as I promised to consider
her children as mine: and we were married privately about
ten days ago. But delicacy towards me made her resolve
to hide even from them the motives of her marriage.
Nor would she ever have told them,—though when she
announced it to them Frank wrote that letter, —had she
not believed herself on her death-bed ; and then to quiet
her poor mind I urged her to reveal them, to justify
herself in the eyes of her rashly-judging children. I

have no more to tell. The rest you know ; except that
the bankruptcy of and Co. is in the paper to-day,
and that it is feared they will not pay five shillings in the
pound.”
“ Friend Blackmore,” said Mr. Reynolds, “ give me
thy hand again : I do not tell thee, like my friend Frank
here, that thou art “the most kind and generous of
men,' because there may be many such in the world;
but I do tell thee that I am glad to have seen thee and
known thee, and that, but for private reasons of my
own, I would cultivate the acquaintance of thee and thy
family.”
“ And will you not do so, sir?” said Blackmore;
« shall we not see you here again ?”
" I do not say that exactly.”
“Oh, dear sir, my kind friend and monitor, do you
really mean to say that our acquaintance is to end here?”
exclaimed Warburton.
“ See! there he is again with his ohs and his violence.
Listen, Frank, I will be very honest with thee :- I have
a daughter; and as she is of the Society of Friends, and
I wish her to remain so, I do not choose to expose her
to the risk of becoming attached out of the Society; and
thou really art a fine young man, Frank, and as the
father cannot help liking thee, I am wisely afraid that
the daughter might like thee still better, and too well,
and thou her. Therefore, till Rachel Reynolds becomes
Rachel somebody else, or thou art thyself a husband,
we will correspond occasionally, if thou wishest it; but
not be visiting acquaintances at each other's houses : for
it is a maxim with me, that parents should never expose
their children to the risk of forming attachments which,
when formed, they must in conscience disapprove—And
now thou knowest the truth.”
“A truth flattering, yet painful, to me, sir : but I
hope Rachel Reynolds will soon be no more, and then
we may meet.”

“ But sir,” said Blackmore, “ you may occasionally
visit us.”
“ True; and I will come some day, perhaps, to see
thy wife, when she gets well again. But now I must
prepare to go, as I have a long journey to take.—But
see, who have we here?”.
“A post-chaise, with four horses covered with foam,
now stopped at the door, and a young man, jumping
out of it, ran into the hall, exclaiming to the servant,
“ Am I too late? Is she alive?” Then, on hearing
the reply, he uttered, “ Thank God!”—and almost
staggered into the room; where Frank Warburton,
nearly as much affected as his poor brother, led him to a
chair.
Charles Warburton had not the gift of tears like his
brother, and therefore probably he suffered more.—“O
Frank! what I have gone through since I received that
terrible letter !” said he, looking fiercely at Blackmore,
of whom he took no notice.
“ You have much to hear,” said Frank, who had
observed the look; “ therefore let me tell you all in
another room.” Then taking his brother's arm, he said
to Blackmore as he passed them, “ Rely on it, dear sir,
he will learn to feel towards you as I do.” He then
led his wondering and half-indignant brother into the
garden.
“ How necessary has been, and how salutary will be,
the chastisement which these youths have received in the
loss of their property !” said Mr. Reynolds : “their
pride wanted humbling. What a look did that lad give
thee !- Is aught composed of frail mortality justified in
looking so at a brother mortal ?”
“My good sir, both these brothers have their weak-
nesses, but they are really worthy lads on the whole ;
and remember, they are very young, and have been
much indulged.”
“ It is kind in thee to remember it, however; and I

389
feel assured that if they can but conquer their pride of
heart—and I do think that poor Frank's is gone already
—they will be the better for their late trial.”
Before Blackmore could reply, Frank came in to
say that his brother wished to see him alone. And the
good Friend had the satisfaction of seeing Charles
Warburton fly to meet his father-in-law with all the out-
ward signs of reconciliation.
Mr. Reynolds's carriage now returned to the door,
but waited till he had dined with Blackmore and Frank;
Charles being still too much agitated to sit down to
table, as he was expecting every moment a summons to
his mother.
“I must go now, indeed,” said Mr. Reynolds,
reluctantly rising; “ but I trust that some day or other
we shall meet again in peace and love. Farewell, friend
Blackmore; and farewell dear Frank ! and remember
that if thou ever needest a friend, thou wilt find one in
me But I will write to thee- and once more,
farewell.”
He departed; and Warburton looked after the
carriage with a grateful heart and a tearful eye.
Some letters did pass between them ; monitory and
affectionate on one side, and respectful, grateful, and
confidential on the other.
But both the young men were of age before they saw
Mr. Reynolds again; and then he called on them
unexpectedly one day at their house in where
Blackmore's business was carried on. He was accom-
panied by his daughter and her husband.
“ Well,” said he, “as Rachel is married, I am come
to see you all : and I have brought her and her husband
with me.”
Blackmore, his wife, and the two sons were present
when they arrived ; and their guests received the wel-
come which they deserved.
“ Oh! I see, sir,” said Frank aside to Mr. Reynolds,

THE QUAKER, AND THE
“ that it was for me you feared, and not for your
daughter. How beautiful she is !”
"There, there! say comely," he replied; “but
indeed I feared for both.”
“ Well; how goes on business, Frank ?"
“ Admirably."
Charles and Frank had very properly refused to
accept, even from their mother's husband, so consider-
able a pecuniary donation ; but, as their fortunes were
much diminished, they wisely resolved to become men
of business, and they accepted Blackmore's offer of a
share in his. Nor was it unworthily bestowed; for
improved by adversity, and excited to emulation by the
conduct and example of their father-in-law, they were
remarkable not only for their attention to business but
for their skill in it, and for the great prosperity which
attended their undertakings.
“Well, all I hear of you, young men, pleases me,”
said Mr. Reynolds ; "and thou art, I trust, friend
Emma Blackmore, a happy mother.”
“I am indeed: and, believe me, I shall never forget
that I owe the first step to my recovery from illness, and
misery (as my son tells me) to your kind admonitions to
him, sir.”
“Not so, I trust : had there not been materials to
work with, I could not have worked, thou knowest; and
I believe all the service I did was bringing his heart
round sooner than it would otherwise have come. Now
my next wish is to see thy sons married and settled.
Frank smiles and looks knowing—Is there anything of
the sort going forward ?”
“Yes, sir ; your history of yourself was not lost on
me in any way, I trust, nor on my brother: for, as you
married one of your father-in-law's daughters, we con-
trived to fall in love with our father-in-law's nieces ;
from whose fortunes, at his death, that generous man
was willing to take one-half, for our sakes; and as he

and my mother are now not present, I will add, that
they are well-connected on the mother's side, and, having
been educated by her relations, 'are highly accomplished.”
“ I shall not take what they are on thy word, Frank,
but judge for myself; and I invite you all to pass part of
the honey-moon at my house. How truly do I rejoice
to see you all once more a family of love !-for widely
indeed do we wander from the right path, and the path
of happiness, even here, when we give way to the
bitterness of resentment, and forget the newest and most
alluring of all the commandments' THAT YE LOVE
ONE ANOTHER.'”
THE END.
