FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 
 Whom when I asked, from what place he came, 
 
 And how he hight himself, he did y-cleep 
 The Shepherd of the Ocean, by name, 
 
 And said he came far from the main sea deep. 
 
 Colin ClouVs come home again . — Spenser. 
 
 Early in the nineteenth century, in an autumnal 
 month, a corvette (a light-built Spanish vessel) passed 
 the Bar of Dublin, and, with all her canvas crowded, 
 rode gallantly into the bay, after having weathered, 
 for a period of five days, one of those tremendous gales 
 which occasionally agitate the Irish seas. A southern 
 port of Ireland had been her original destination. 
 Stress of weather had driven her up the Channel; 
 and the injury she had received in her unequal con- 
 test with the elements, rendered it necessary that she 
 should undergo repair before she proceeded on her 
 coasting voyage. On her stern she bore the name 
 of u II Librador and, though now unarmed, and 
 the property of a private individual, she had evidently 
 been a sloop of war in some foreign service.

 The dawn was breaking in tints of gold and crim- 
 son as the corvette cut her way through the bright- 
 ening waves ; and the happiest aspect of the Irish 
 coast presented itself to the view of two persons who 
 stood in silence at the helm ; — who had stood there 
 since the first pale flush of light had thrown its 
 silvery line along the eastern horizon. 
 
 The elder of the two was the master of the vessel, 
 lie was still in the very prime of life and flower of 
 manhood; and as each lovely feature of the Irish 
 shore gradually developed itself, and arose bright and 
 fresh from the mists of the morning upon his eager 
 gaze, he presented, in his own person, an image that 
 denoted the intention of the Creator, when he made 
 man supreme above all, to reign over His fair creation. 
 
 He stood erect, his arms so folded as to give to his 
 square chest and shoulders a peculiar muscularity and 
 breadth of outline. His fine bust, indicating extraor- 
 dinary strength, would have been almost dispropor- 
 tioned to his stature, which rose not much above the 
 middle height, but that the loftiness of his air, and the 
 freedom of his carriage, conferred an artificial eleva- 
 tion on his figure, and corrected what might be 
 deemed imperfect in his actual structure. His large 
 eyes were rather deep set than protuberant; and 
 their glances, rather sidelong than direct, flashed 
 from beneath his dark impending brows, like the 
 lightnings which fringe the massive vapors of a 
 tropical atmosphere. His mouth had a physiognomy 
 of its own — it was what the eye is to other laces — 
 and the workings of the nether lip, in moments of 
 emotion, indicated the influence of vehement pas- 
 sions, habitually combated, though rarely subdued.

 The expression of his countenance was more intel- 
 lectual than gracious ; and was calculated to strike 
 rather than to please. But his rare and singular 
 smile (a smile so bland, it might well have become 
 even a woman’s lip) wholly changed its character; 
 and the full-displayed teeth, of splendid whiteness, 
 produced perhaps even too strong a contrast with a 
 complexion, which southern suns, and climes of 
 scorching ardor, had bronzed into a dark, deep, but 
 transparent olive. No tint, no hue warmed or varied 
 this gloomy paleness, save when the tide of passion, 
 rushing impetuously from the heart, colored for a 
 moment, with a burning crimson, the livid cheek ; 
 and then, as promptly ebbing back to its source, left 
 all cold and dark as before. 
 
 F rom his accent or manner, it would have been 
 difficult to assign him to any particular country. He 
 seemed rather to belong to the world ; — one of those 
 creatures formed out of the common mould, whom 
 nature and circumstances combine to lit for deeds of 
 general import and universal interest. Neither could 
 the term “ gentility” be appropriately applied to an 
 appearance which had a character beyond it. He 
 might have been above or below heraldic notices, and 
 genealogical distinctions ; but he was evidently inde- 
 pendent of them. His mate, an old but hale man, 
 with whom he conversed in Spanish (but who had 
 English enough to work the ship, and sufficient know- 
 ledge of the Irish seas to steer it with skill,) respect- 
 fully addressed him by the title of “ the Commodore 
 and the crew (a few English sailors, to whom he 
 seemed, even by name, a stranger) adopted the same 
 appellation. But he issued Ids clear, prompt orders,

 with the air and decision of one to whom higher titles 
 of command were familiar, lie was a good sailor, 
 fearless in danger, calm and sell-possessed in diffi- 
 culty ; and, to the only passenger who accompanied 
 him (one courteously and accidentally admitted on 
 board his ship), he spoke of himself as a man fond of 
 the sea from boyhood, making voyages of pleasure 
 when he could, and now uniting an old habit of re- 
 creation with the urgency of pressing business. He 
 was on his way from a West India island, on a secret 
 mission, of importance to himself; but he neither 
 mentioned his own name, nor inquired that of the 
 young passenger, whom he had taken out of a wherry 
 in Plymouth Sound, — the port whence he had last 
 sailed, and where the stranger had vainly sought the 
 passage now granted him to Ireland, by the com- 
 mander of II Librador. 
 
 The appearance of this person, who ha 1 voluntarily 
 announced himself by the name of De Vere, though 
 infinitely interesting, was perhaps less striking than 
 that of the Commodore. It was also of a more defi- 
 nite stamp and character; more assignable to a class, 
 a cast, a country. Though there was little of con- 
 ventional mannerism about him, — though his elegant 
 and thorough-bred air was wffiolly unmarked by the 
 overcharged fashioning of any country, — yet, to those 
 acquainted with the first class of British distinction, 
 he was easily cognizable in accent, dress, air, and 
 physiognomy, as an Englishman of rank and fashion, 
 the liomnu comme il faut of the highest circles. 
 
 There was, however, in the countenance and modes 
 of this distinguished young stranger, something more 
 than the mere characteristics of country and rank —

 a sort of fantastic pensiveness, a real or affected ab- 
 straction, a something imaginative and ideal in his 
 maniere d'etre , that indicated a great eccentricity, if 
 not peculiarity of mind. He seemed a compound of 
 fancy and fashion ; a medium between the conscious- 
 ness of rank, and the assumption and possession of 
 genius, placing him out of the common muster-roll of 
 society : — a being vain of standing aloof ; untractable 
 to the world’s laws, and therefore believing himself 
 beyond them. In his conversations with the Com- 
 modore, he spoke in parodox, had systems out of the 
 common scale, and theories of alembicated refine- 
 ment. An idealist, in the fullest sense of the word, 
 in his philosophy he talked as one who believed that 
 “ nothing is, but thinking makes it so :” and occupied 
 by an “ ideal presence,” he affected to live distinct 
 and independent of all human interests. 
 
 The structure of his fine head was such as physiog- 
 nomists assign to superior intellect ; and the precise 
 arrangement of its glossy auburn curls left it difficult 
 to decide whether its fanciful and fashionable posses- 
 sor was more fop or philosopher, dandy or poet. His 
 valet-de-chambre, a Frenchman, presided with in- 
 variable punctuality at his toilette, twice a day, when 
 the uncivil elements did- not interfere with such ar- 
 rangements; and the rest of his time was spent in 
 musing, reading Spenser’s “Faery Queen,” and “ State 
 of Ireland,” and occasionally conversing with the 
 commander of the vessel, who seemed to inspire him 
 with sentiments of curiosity and admiration, not usual 
 to his ordinary habits of feeling. Mr. De Yere, after 
 a long silence, usually preserved, addressed his com- 
 panion, by observing :

 FLORENCE MACARTHT. 
 
 * There is to me a singular attraction in the aspect 
 of an unknown firmament ; for it tells of distance from 
 scenes, and objects long marked by sameness, and 
 distinguished only by satiety.” 
 
 “ It tells, too,” replied the Commodore, “ of remote- 
 ness from objects, precious by interest or habit. The 
 
 * Cross of the south,’ first seen in tropical climates, 
 draws tears to the eyes of the Spanish seaman ; its 
 image recalling remembrances of his distant country.” 
 
 “ Remembrances of country, however, are usually 
 the finger-posts to ennui. One wears out everything 
 in one’s own country, before one leaves it; and, there- 
 fore, it is left. Country ! all countries are alike : little 
 masses of earth and water ; where some swarms of 
 human ants are destined to creep through their span 
 of ephemeral existence : coming, they know not 
 whence; going they know not where.” 
 
 “ These little masses of earth and water,” said the * 
 Commodore, “ are therefore precious and important 
 to the ants that creep on them; and each little hill is 
 dear to the swarm that inhabits it, as much from that 
 very ignorance as from interest.” 
 
 After a short pause, Mr. De Yere resumed: 
 
 “ Can you not credit then the existence of a creature 
 placed by nature or circumstances beyond the ordi- 
 nary pale of humanity, shaking off 1 his poor estate 
 of man,’ scarcely looking upon that spot, called earth, 
 with human eyes, nor herding with his species in 
 
 * human sympathy — one so organized, so worked on by 
 events, so thwarted in feelings, and blasted in his bud 
 of life, as to stand alone in creation, matchless, or at 
 least unmatched — one, whose joys, whose woes, whose 
 sentiments, whose passions, are not those of other

 men, but all his own ; beyond the reach of affection, 
 or the delusions of hope ?” 
 
 “ A being, thus constituted,” rejoined the Commo- 
 dore, “ could not be man. lie, who wants the appe- 
 tites and passions common to all men, with the sym- 
 pathies and affections that spring from them, is some- 
 thing better or worse, angel or demon, but he is not 
 man.” 
 
 “You deny then the possibility of such an exist- 
 ence ?” 
 
 “ Nay — madmen may fancy such a combination, 
 poets feign it, or vain men affect it ; but it has no real 
 existence in nature or society. Man is always man; 
 and he who pretends to be more, is rarely placed by 
 nature at the head of his species — he is in fact usually 
 less.” 
 
 Before Mr. De Yere could reply, a question from a 
 sailor interrupted the conversation, which was one of 
 many held in the same tone and spirit. The Commo- 
 dore was the next moment busied in giving orders for 
 tacking. lie addressed his mate in pure Spanish, 
 chided the French valet out of his way in good 
 French, and fell foul of a lubberly sailor in broad nau- 
 tical English. 
 
 “There is somewhere,” said Mr. De Yere, turning 
 over the pages of Spenser’s Ireland, and resuming his 
 conversation with the commander of the vessel, as he 
 returned to his station at the helm — “ there is some- 
 where, through the quaint pages of Spenser, an ad- 
 mirable description of the natural advantages of Ire- 
 land, which I cannot find.” 
 
 “Look around you,” answered the Commodore: 
 “ you will find them here.”

 FLORENCE MACAUTHY. 
 
 “ I prefer looking through the spectacles of books. 
 I like the prismatic hues thrown by authorship upon 
 places and facts.” 
 
 “ Indeed ! that is strange ! But in viewing Ireland 
 through Spenser’s pages, you will see it, as children 
 do an eclipse through a smoked glass. He was one 
 of those, whose policy it was to revile the country lie 
 preyed upon, — to spoil, and then to vituperate. No 
 Englishman can fairly estimate this island who cornea 
 not unshackled by his own interests. Spenser, the 
 deputy of a deputy, the secretary, whose servile flat- 
 tery of the viceroy, his master, was rewarded with a 
 principality (soon lost indeed, but most unfairly won), 
 is no author for impartiality to judge by; and when 
 he stoops to eulogize the ‘dreadless might’ of his 
 ferocious patron, Grey, one of Ireland’s Herods — 
 when he defines power to be 
 
 1 The right hand of Justice truly hight,’ 
 
 however he may please as a poet, he is contemptible 
 as an historian, and infamous as a politician.” 
 
 “ Oh ! as an historian or politician I give him up, 
 because both characters are equally ridiculous : the 
 politician always guided by prejudice and interest, 
 the historian always immersed in ignorance and error. 
 Time discovers and shames both : and thus it is with all 
 that bears upon human facts. The imagination alone 
 is always right ; its visions are alone imperishable. 
 The Faery Queen of Spenser will thus survive, when 
 his State of Ireland shall be wholly forgotten : and, 
 for my own part, so much do I prefer the visions of 
 his fancy to the historical relations of any period con- 
 nected with the history of men, that I would go a

 thousand miles to visit the ruins of his Irish Kilcole - 
 man * where once 
 
 1 He sat, as was his trade, 
 
 Under the foot of Mole, that mountain hoar/ 
 
 where 
 
 * Allured by his pipe's delight, 
 
 Whose pleasing soundly-shrilled far about, 
 
 the gallant Raleigh found him. But I am not sure 
 that I would turn one point out of my way to tread 
 upon the sj)ot where legitimate despotism signed the 
 fiat of its own destruction, and gave Magna Charta 
 to an emancipated nation.” 
 
 The vessel at that moment touched the pier. 
 
 The Commodore had sprung upon land ; and he 
 stood for a moment on the spot that had received the 
 first pressure of his footstep. To judge by the dark- 
 ling of his eye, and the motion of his lip, some strong 
 and powerful feeling occupied his mind ; but it was 
 of brief duration. Emotions unconnected with ac- 
 tion seemed not made for him : by the tossing back 
 of his head he appeared to give thought to the 
 winds, and plunged into all the bustle and activity of 
 the circumstances in which he was placed. 
 
 The Holyhead packet was not yet visible ; and the 
 
 * Originally the principality of the Macarthies More ; aftei> 
 wards the Palatinate of the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond ; 
 forfeited by them and given to new spoliators, among whom 
 was the thriftless adventurer Raleigh, who in Ireland acted 
 the part of a freebooter. The spoils which fell to the poet 
 Spenser, as secretary to Lord Arthur Grey (the “ Sir Artigall ” 
 of his dreary legend of that name), were three thousand acres 
 of rich land in the county of Cork, with the beautiful Castle 
 of Kilcoleman, the seat of the Earl of Desmond.

 earliness of the hour still left the pier in quietude. 
 
 The land-waiter had been called to go through tho 
 necessary forms ; and of him the Commodore asked 
 some questions, with eager curiosity, clearness, and 
 rapidity of utterance, as if life were too short to 
 suffer one moment to pass by unoccupied or unin- 
 structed ; then, as if impatient of the drawling replies, 
 and anticipating the answers, he started new inqui- 
 ries of local reference. Meantime Mr. De Yere had 
 landed ; but wholly abstracted from the noise and 
 activity that surrounded him, he stood, turning over 
 the leaves of his Spenser, while the valet was receiv- 
 ing parcels, portmanteaux, and portfolios from a 
 sailor, who was flinging them on shore, and exclaim- 
 ing, as he appropriated, or rejected each several 
 article, “ C'es: a nous” — “ Ce n'est pas a nous” 
 With the exception of “got dam,” the Frenchman 
 had not yet acquired a single word of English. But 
 with this small portion of the language, and his own 
 very expressive gesticulations, he had succeeded so 
 well, as almost to think with Figaro, that this em- 
 phatic imprecation was the basis of the tongue ; and 
 that with it “ on ne manque de ricn , nulle part” 
 
 “ Will I step in for a jingle for your honor ?” de- 
 manded a voice, in the broad languid drawling of the 
 genuine patois of Dublin, addressing the full force of 
 its brogue to the delicate ears of Mr. De Yere. 
 
 “ Will I, plaze your honor, sir ?” 
 
 This question, several times repeated, at last ob- 
 tained notice by its reiteration. The young stranger ' 
 raised his eyes for a moment to the face of him who 
 thus unceremoniously proffered his services, but he 
 withdrew them again in disgust. The object of this

 ungracious glance had stood its inquiry with great 
 coolness. He was leaning, and had been leaning, 
 since the dawn, against one of the posts of the pier, 
 and had watched the approach of It Librudor idly 
 and patiently, for more than an hour, partly for the 
 gratification of his curiosity, and partly in the hope 
 of earning some trifle by going for a vehicle, or by 
 carrying into the town some luggage for the passen- 
 gers. There is scarcely any place so lonely, or hour 
 so unseasonable, at which some one of these genuine 
 lazzaroni of the Irish metropolis may not be found 
 lounging away time, between hope and idleness, in 
 the enjoyment of doing nothing, or in the vague ex- 
 pectation of having something to do. 
 
 Miserably clad, squalid, meagre, and famished, the 
 petitioner for employment had yet humor in his eye, 
 and observation in his countenance. Occasionally 
 ready to assist, and always prompt to flatter, he did 
 neither gratuitously. Taunt and invective seemed the 
 natural expression of his habit : for though dcbasingly 
 acquiescent to a destiny which left him without mo- 
 tive for industry, in a country where industry is no 
 refuge from distress, he yet preserved the vindictive- 
 ness of conscious degradation ; and there was a deep- 
 seated sincerity in his freqrent curse, which was some- 
 times wanting to his purchased benediction. Idleness 
 had become the custom of his necessity ; and his wants 
 were so few, that a trifling exertion could supply 
 them. Yet he sought early and late for employment; 
 and he had probably wants more urgent than his own 
 to satisfy. 
 
 This unfortunate representative of his class had hi- 
 therto lolled on the pier, a listless spectator of the

 scene which was going forward, muttering at intervals 
 a shrewd observation, laughing deridingly as he threw 
 his eyes over the French valet, whose foreign air and 
 dress were peculiarly notable ; and again composing 
 his sharp features into a look of respectful deference, 
 as he reiterated his question to him whom he sup- 
 posed the master. “ Will I step in for a jingle, your 
 honor ? will I, sir ?” “ Step in !” at last repeated Mr. 
 
 De Yere, struck, perhaps, by the calm, steady perse- 
 verance of his intrusion — “ step in where, friend ?” 
 “Step into Dublin, plaze your honor, for a jingle, sir, 
 or a hackney !” 
 
 “ Is Dublin so near, then?” 
 
 “ It is, plaze your honor, hard by, sir, quite conva- 
 nient : yez won’t miss me, your honor, till I’m back 
 wid ye.” 
 
 “If Dublin is so near,” said Mr. De Yere, closing 
 his book, and addressing the Commodore, who now, 
 with his rapid step, approached him, after having given 
 his orders to his mate and men — “ if Dublin is so near, 
 I should prefer walking, to trusting to any filthy ve- 
 hicle we may be able to procure at this unseasonable 
 hour.” 
 
 “ I meant to propose it,” was the reply ; and the 
 active, animated speaker, taking a rich pelisse from 
 his mate, which he drew over his ship dress, and ex- 
 changing his cap for a round hat, gave some addi- 
 tional orders in Spanish, and desired the sailor, who 
 stood beside him with a large valise on his shoulder 
 and writing-case in his hand, to follow him to Dublin. 
 The two gentlemen then proceeded, arm-in-arm, to 
 town, furnished by the officers of the customs with a 
 card of one of the many hotels in the patrician streets

 of Dublin, the former mansions of the banished no- 
 bility. 
 
 Mr. De Yere, to whom the vulgar exertions of 
 every-day life were all unknown, and even unguessed 
 at, had left everything to a valet as helpless as him- 
 self. For the first time since he had come into his 
 master’s service, he was deprived of the assistance of 
 a certain Portuguese lackey, one who spoke all lan- 
 guages, performed all services, and united all the in- 
 trigue, roguery, and ingenuity of the Pedrillos and 
 Lazarillos of the Spanish comedy. This man had been 
 dismissed for malpractices at the moment his master 
 was leaving the port of Lisbon for that of Plymouth ; 
 and since that period the Frenchman had acted with- 
 out deputy or interpreter. But as almost the whole 
 of the interval had been passed at sea (for his master 
 had remained a few hours only at Plymouth), he had 
 but slightly felt the inconvenience. Now, however, 
 left to act, not only for his master but for himself, he 
 remained standing on the pier, in all the embarrass- 
 ment of books, parcels, and the splendid neccssaire of 
 the portable toilette. He had alternately taken up 
 and laid down a valise, a dressing-box, and a pocket 
 edition of Zamora’s Spanish Plays; accompanying 
 each movement with a “ sacre ,” u diantre” or “ jieste 
 de mon ame ,” slowly rolled forth from between his 
 closed teeth ; when the English sailor, jerking his own 
 load on his shoulders, exclaimed, “ Come, come, 
 mounseer, know your own mind ; either wait till we 
 sends a coach for you and your trumpery, or get some 
 un to help you.” 
 
 “ Shure I’ll carry in them portmantles to town for 
 you, mounseer, and the leather box to boot, for a

 trifle,” observed the Irishman, who, disappointed in 
 the commission he had sought, had remained motion- 
 less and silent till the hope of his services being again 
 accepted suggested itself; and he repeated his pro- 
 posal three several times, each louder than the other, 
 as if the louder he vociferated, the better chance he 
 had of being understood by the foreigner. 
 
 “ Do you hear me now, mounseer ?” he screamed 
 close in the Frenchman’s ear, who, stamping his feet 
 with anger, exclaimed, “ Paix ! paix /” 
 
 “ Pay, pay,” reiterated the Irishman : “ I’ll engage 
 you will, dear, and well.” Then, without further ce- 
 remony, hoisting the valise on his shoulders, taking a 
 portfolio under his arm, and carrying the dressing- 
 box by its handle, he nodded his head to the parcel 
 of books, which were enclosed in a leather strap, ob- 
 serving, “ Now, mounseer, I’ll throuble you just to 
 take them bits of books in your daddle ; and what 
 would ail us, but we’d take in th’ other trifles of 
 things betwixt us aisy enough, plaze God; I’ll engage 
 we will. So now, my lad,” (addressing the sailor,) 
 “ follow me, and I’ll show you the road.” 
 
 The Frenchman comprehended the arrangements 
 of the Irishman better than his language, grinned ap- 
 plause, muttered a good-humored “go* dam” in token 
 of approbation, and, taking up the books, these three 
 singular representatives of the three nations pro- 
 ceeded towards Dublin, following close on the steps 
 of the gentlemen who had inquired their route and 
 were some paces in advance. 
 
 The Irish lounger, no lounger now, stepped on 
 lightly with his burden, in that short quick trot with 
 which the lower Irish perform long journeys, and

 frequently addressing his companions with a sort of 
 sly, indirect curiosity. 
 
 “ I’ll engage, mounseer,” he observed, first attack- 
 ing the Frenchman, “yez was never in ould Ireland 
 afore, far as you’ve travelled ; and yez 
 
 1 May travel the wide world over, 
 
 And sail from France to Balm-robe.’ 
 
 as the song says, afore ye’ll see the likes of it again, 
 anyway.” 
 
 “ Bon , bon," returned the Frenchman, supposing 
 that he communicated the joyful intelligence of their 
 speedy arrival. li Bon, fen suis charmi 
 
 “ Why then it will charmy ye more every step ye 
 take — for there isn’t her match, by say or land, with 
 her beautiful eye there, like a unicorn’s, in the front

 “ Comment done ?” demanded the Frenchman, de- 
 noting his ignorance of this detailed description by 
 the perplexity of his looks. “ Och bother,” returned 
 the Irishman, out of all patience at what appeared to 
 him obstinate stupidity.

 “ Bodere, bodere,” reiterated the Frenchman, indig- 
 nant at what lie saw was intended for insult.” “ Com- 
 ment done 1 bode re'! gueux que tu es ?” 
 
 “ Cut away yourself,” replied the Irishman, laugh- 
 ling good humoredly, or troth, you’ll be in too late 
 for the fair, honey !” 
 
 The Frenchman, supposing that these words, and 
 the conciliating laugh which accompanied them, indi- 
 cated an apology, took off his hat with great polite- 
 ness, and accepted the fancied excuses*, with “mats 
 voila ) mon ami , qui est Hen? 
 
 “ Och, your humble servant to command, mo un- 
 seer,” returned the Irishman dropping his load to make 
 an imitative bow : “ troth you do your dancing-mas- 
 ter every justice, whoever he was.” 
 
 The English sailor, much amused by this inter- 
 change of civility in his two companions, observed, 
 “ aye, aye, sir, let the moun seers alone for bowing and 
 scraping, and the likes. Never a dancing dog at 
 Bartlemy fair will beat them at that, I’ll warrant.” 
 “Why then I’ll engage,” replied the Irishman, 
 “ that yellow, swarthy, portly gentleman there, your 
 captain, wouldn’t be a Frenchman, with his elegant 
 surtout, for all he has a Frenchified air about him.” 
 
 “ What, he ; Lord help your heart, not he — no 
 more a Frenchman nor I am, lad.” 
 
 “ Och ! he’d be very sorry, I’ll engage ; though he 
 has an outlandish look with him, for all that.” 
 
 “ Why, aye sure, because he corned from the Hin- 
 dies, d’ye see; the West Ilindies, — or Spanish Am- 
 erica'. It’s all one for that ; come from where he will, 
 he’s a hearty true blue, every bit of him.”

 “ And is yourself come all the ways with him, dear, 
 from the Western Indies?” 
 
 “ Not I. I was lying in dock; for it is not now all 
 as one as formerly — all goes by luck and fashion now. 
 Somehow, one hears no more of the Howes, and the 
 Hothams, and the Nelsons, and the wooden walls of 
 old England. The jacket, the old true blue’s worn 
 out, sir. So this ere gem’man, who owns that tight 
 bit of timber, every splinter of her, himself', it seems, 
 put into our Plymouth Sound, three weeks ago, bound 
 from Demerara, and sent back his Spanish crew in a 
 Cadiz merchantman, (excepting old Grim Groudy, the 
 mate), and paid ’em like a prince. So then he set 
 sail for London, aloft on the mail; and when he came 
 back, he manned this little vessel with a handful of 
 us Plymouth boys, and we heaved anchor six days 
 agone for Ireland ; and this I’ll say for him, a better 
 commander never stepped on forecastle, or walked 
 the quarter-deck.” 
 
 “ See that now,” replied the Irishman, quietly, “ and 
 hasn’t he a mild look with him, then, for all that ; 
 only mighty stern. He wouldn’t be a slave driven 
 from the Western Indies, sir, I suppose?” 
 
 “ What, he ! not he, bless the heart of him ; no 
 more nor I bees; not but he’s hard enough some- 
 times, and hates a lubber as he hates poison; but 
 goes our halves in hard work.” 
 
 “ See that, now, sir : och, he has a fine look with 
 him, and mighty portly ; and has a great name upon 
 him, if a body knew it, I’ll engage.” 
 
 “ Can’t tell ye that, though,” replied the sailor, 
 “ because why, I don’t know it myself. They 
 called’n 1 the Don’ at the King’s Arms in Plymouth —

 the Spanish don, though he speaks as good English 
 as the best. And then, when one asks a question of 
 Grim Groudy, whs knows all about him, he only an- 
 swers one in his d — d lingo.” 
 
 “And that tail slinder young man, dear, with his 
 head in the clouds, as if he’d snuff the moon, fairly— 
 he’s his comrade, I’ll engage.” 
 
 “ What, yon fair weather, fresh water bird there, 
 mounseer’s master ? — Oh, I knows nothing of he, nor 
 Commodore, nor mate neither, for the matter o’ that ; 
 he’s a bird of passage, lad, a God send, d’y see. Why, 
 just as we had given Edystone lighthouse the go-by, 
 out comes old Jack Andrews’s wherry, the Shark, 
 rowing at the race of ten knots an hour ; and when it 
 came alongside the Librador, yon spark, there, stands 
 bolt upright, and begs a passage for his self and our 
 mounseer here, to Ireland, palavering about no packets 
 plying from Plymouth to Dublin, and being in haste 
 to get there. So the Commodore has him hauled up, 
 and gives him the state cabin ; a cabin fit for an Eng- 
 lish Admiral ; and so they’ve gone on well enough, 
 yard arm and yard arm, jawing together, fore and aft, 
 first in one lingo, and then in another ; and what with 
 mounseer there, that has not a word of English to 
 throw to a dog, and the Spanish mate, who has bare 
 sufficient to work the ship, why the vessel’s like to 
 the town of Babylon. But wdiat’s most oddest, is, 
 that for all mounseer and Grim Groudy’s gibberish- 
 ing it so with their own masters, shiver me if they 
 understand one another a bit. Ha ! ha ! ha !” 
 
 “ Why, then,” returned the Irishman, “ it’s mighty 
 odd, and very remarkable ; for if foreigners won’t un- 
 derstand one another, who do they expect will, I

 wonder. And so yez are all going to put up in 
 Dublin? Why, then, yez are in great luck.” 
 
 “ Luck ! no such luck neither ; but needs must when 
 the old one drives. Why, sir, we have been pelted 
 about this little basin of dirty water these five days, 
 and last night were fairly driven up the Channel, 
 blown to shivers, tattered to rags, and must now put 
 into dock here, till all’s made right and tight ; and 
 then, we’re under orders to weigh anchor with old 
 Grim Groudy, and sail for Dungarvan.” 
 
 “ Troth, then, if yez will take a fool’s advice, yez 
 will stay where ye are ; for yez may go farther and 
 fare worse than stopping in Dublin; only maybe, 
 your business doesn’t lie here, sir.” 
 
 “ Why, for business, I don’t believe we have much 
 business here ; only just a voyage of pleasure. Why 
 that’s all the go now. The agreeablest trip I 
 ever made was with a young Irish lord to the Medi- 
 terranean, just for sport like ; round the world for 
 sport.” 
 
 “ Why, then, it’s purty sport that gives a man the 
 say-sickness. But its ill wind blows nobody good ; 
 and only for it, sorrow bit of Ringsend yez had seen 
 this day, and here it is.” 
 
 The two gentlemen in advance had at this moment 
 halted at the entrance of one of the most wretched 
 suburbs that ever deformed or disgraced the metro- 
 polis of any country; and the Commodore, whose 
 quick and often back-glancing eye had long since dis- 
 cerned the reinforcement obtained to the party, by 
 the addition of the lounger at the pier, now called, 
 and desired him to lead the way. “ I will, plaze your 
 honor,” he replied, trotting briskly on, while the

 wearied Frenchman “ toiled after him in vain;” and 
 even the sailor made an exertion to keep pace with 
 him. “ 111 only just step in, sir, by your leave, to 
 get my morning, for I hasn’t broke my fast yet, sir.” 
 
 “ Broke his fast !” reiterated the Commodore, shrug- 
 ging his shoulders, as he observed his newly consti- 
 tuted guide “ step in” to a little shop, whose gaudy 
 placard of “ licensed to sell spirituous liquors” was 
 further illustrated by a range of glasses on the coun- 
 ter, filled with whiskey. The guide tossed one off, 
 observing to the dirty, lazy-looking woman, who 
 stood wiping a jug with her apron, “ I’ll pay you 
 when I come back, Mrs. Hurley, dear.” With this 
 assurance from her wretched, but well known customer, 
 Mrs. Hurley appeared satisfied; aware from expe- 
 rience, that, in his instance, punctuality was guaran- 
 teed by self-interest. 
 
 “ Break his fast ?” repeated the Commodore : “ what 
 a mode of breaking fast!” 
 
 “As good as any,” replied Mr. DeVere: “it all 
 comes to the same thing in the end. Habit and cir- 
 cumstances determine the mode and means, without 
 our consent or will ; and gin, or glory, 
 
 ‘ Leads but to the grave.’ ” 
 
 The two travellers now followed their guide with 
 difficulty through collected heaps of mud and filth. 
 The very air they breathed was infected by noxious 
 vapors, which the morning sun drew up from piles 
 of putrid matter. The houses, between which they 
 passed, were in ruins; the sashless windows were 
 stuffed with straw; the unhinged doors exposed the 
 dark and dirty stairs, leading to dens still more dun

 and foul. Here, if “lonely misery retired to die,” 
 living wretchedness could scarcely find a shelter. 
 Yet many an haggard face, many an attenuated form, 
 marked by the squalor of indigence, and by the harsh- 
 ness of vice, evinced that even here was a crowded, 
 superabundant population. The guide, who, as he 
 proceeded through this wretched suburb, saluted 
 several among those whose idle curiosity had drawn 
 them from their holes, betrayed a courtesy of manner 
 curiously contrasted with his own appearance, and 
 with that of the persons he addressed. Everybody 
 was “ Sir,” or “ Ma’am and the children were either 
 “ Miss,” or “ Master,” or were saluted with epithets 
 of endearment and familiarity. 
 
 “Morrow, Dennis, dear, how is it with you?” 
 “ Morrow, kindly, Mrs. Flanagan : I hope I see you 
 well, Ma’am.” “ Oh, you’re up with the day, Mr. 
 Geratty. How’s the woman that owns you ?” 
 “ Here’s a fine morning, Miss Costello, God bless it : 
 is your mother bravely, Miss ?” “ Eh ! then Paddy, 
 
 you little garlagh, why isn’t it after the cockles ye are 
 the day, and the tide on the turn ?” 
 
 While, however, he seemed occupied with “ an un- 
 wearied spirit of doing courtesies,” he occasionally 
 threw his shrewd, but sunken eye, over the persons 
 he was conducting; and faithfully translating the ex- 
 pression of the Commodore’s looks, he observed : 
 
 “ Och ! it's a poor place, sir, sure enough, and no 
 poorer room-keepers, your honor, than the Rings* 
 end’s, God help ’em, not even in the vaults, sir.” 
 
 “ The vaults ?” 
 
 “ Och ! yes, indeed, the vaults under the fine new 
 streets, sir, that isn’t built, where there’s nothing to

 pay; only in respect of being mighty damp. Wait a 
 taste, your honor, till yez get an, sir, and yez ‘ill see 
 them swarm out in great style, the craturs !” 
 
 “ And sure it is a most beautiful and sweet coun- 
 try,” read aloud Mr. De Yere, who had now found 
 out the passage he had hitherto vainly sought in Spen- 
 ser, and was treading a clear pathway as they left the 
 miserable outlets of Ringsend and Irishtown behind 
 them. “ A most beautiful and sweet country as any 
 under heaven, being stored throughout with many 
 goodly rivers, with all sorts of fish, most abundantly 
 sprinkled with many very sweet islands, and goodly 
 lakes, like little inland seas, that will carry even shippes 
 upon their waters, adorned with goodly woods, even 
 fit for building houses and shippes, so commodiously, 
 as that if som£ princes in the world had them, they 
 would soon hope to be lords of all the seas, and ere 
 long of all the world — also full of very good ports 
 and havens, opening into England, as inviting us to 
 come into them, to see what excellent commodities 
 that country can afford. Besides, the soyle itself, 
 most fertile, fit to yield all kinds of fruit that shall be 
 committed thereunto; and lastly, the heavens, most 
 mild, though somewhat more moist than the parts 
 towards the west.” 
 
 “ So much for the Natural State of Ireland,” said 
 the Commodore, as the peripatetic student closed his 
 book, to which the guide had given a very humorous 
 attention. So much for the natural state. Behold 
 the groupings of its social, its political condition.” 
 As he spoke, they entered one of those long laid-out 
 streets, whose houses, in the course of many years, 
 had not advanced beyond the foundations. From the

 vaults, the thick smoke of burning straw or rubbish 
 was emitted through holes, perforated in the pave- 
 ment ; while hordes of wretched and filthy creatures 
 crept from beneath the dark roofs of their earthly 
 dwellings, to solicit the charity of those who passed 
 above them. One from among the number, who had 
 been less alert in picking up some scattered small 
 change, flung among them by the gentlemen, conti- 
 nued to run beside them, begging for a “ halfpenny to 
 buy bread.” It was a little shivering, half-naked girl, 
 pretty but filthy and emaciated. As the guide came 
 up she retreated, and a significant glance passed 
 between them, which drove her at once back to her 
 den ; but not before she had picked up a silver six- 
 pence flung after her. 
 
 “ God bless your honor,” said the guide, in a tre- 
 mulous voice ; “ that is a greater charity than you i 
 think, sir.” 
 
 “ This is all very bad,” said Mr. De Vere, “ dis- 
 gustingly bad. Short of actual offensive disgust, 
 affecting the health and organs, I have, myselx, no 
 positive objection to suburban wretchedness. There 
 is sometimes a sort of poetical misery in such scenes, 
 very effective to contemplate ; not altogether so 
 coarse and squalid as Crabbe’s Borough Scenery, but 
 a species of picturesque wretchedness, that has its 
 merit — rags well draped, misery well chiselled, afford- 
 ing a study for the painter’s pencil, or a model to the 
 poet’s eye.” 
 
 “ But who,” asked the Commodore with emphasis, 
 
 “ can see such wretchedness as this, with a man’s eye, 
 and not feel it with a man’s heart ? The mind starts 
 beyond the mere impulse of sympathy here ; it rushes

 at once from the effect to the cause. Indignation 
 usurps the seat of pity, and the spirit rests upon those 
 who have afflicted, not on those who suffer.” 
 
 “ Yes, but even so, you go but half-way. All is 
 evil in political institutes ; because all is bad in moral, 
 as all is disgusting in physical nature. All realities 
 are evil, and the whole system, as we know it, but a 
 fortuitous combination of corrupting particles : the 
 brightest specks, the most lucent points, are but the 
 shining glitter of putresceney, and even 
 
 ‘ The brave o’erkanging firmament. 
 
 The majestic roof, fretted with golden fires, 
 
 A foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.’ ” 
 
 “ This is Merrion Square, plaze your honor,” inter- 
 rupted the guide, coming forward, “ where the quality 
 lives. And there’s Sir John’s* fountain, your honor, 
 so beautiful ! and cost a power ! and wouldn’t get 
 lave to build a taste of it, only he declared to God, 
 and upon his honor, he never would allow a thimble- 
 ful of water to come out of it, in respect of a sup 
 never going in. And there it is to this day, a great 
 job, by Jagurs ; why wouldn’t it ?” 
 
 The gentlemen, in their way to the hotel, in Sack- 
 ville street, now passed through that line of the Irish 
 metropolis, which brings within the compass of a coup 
 cPoril some as noble public edifices and spacious 
 streets as are to be found in the most leading cities 
 
 * Sir J.. afterwards Lord de B , the anecdote is a fact. 
 
 It is curious to observe, that the lowest classes of the popula- 
 tion of Dublin are perfectly acquainted with the jobbing sys- 
 tems under which all public transactions are effected in that 
 metropolis : they also discuss them with a mixture of humor 
 and anger that is extremely characteristic.

 of Europe. All, however, was still, silent, and void. 
 The guide, walking parallel to the travellers, with his 
 eyes furtively glancing on them, evidently watched 
 the effect which the beauty of his native city (a 
 beauty of which he was singularly proud) made upon 
 their minds ; and when they had reached that im- 
 posing area, which includes so much of the architec- 
 tural elegance and social bustle of Dublin, (the area 
 flanked by its silent senate-house, and commanded by 
 its venerable university,) he paused, as if from weari- 
 ness, leaned his burthen against the college ballus- 
 trade, and drew upon the attention of the strangers 
 (who also voluntarily halted to look around them), by 
 observing, as he pointed to the right, “ That’s the ould 
 parliament-house, sir. Why, then, there was grate 
 work going on there oncet, quiet and aisy as it stands 
 now, the cratur ! grate work, shure enough ! and 
 there’s the very lamp-post I climbed up the night of 
 the Union. Och ! then you’d think the murther of 
 the world was in it; and so it was, shure enough, — 
 that of Ireland, your honor ; God help her ! And 
 there we were, from light to light, and long after, 
 watching, ay, and praying too; and grate pelting, 
 shurely, when they came out, the thieves, that sould 
 us fairly. And troth, if we’d have known as much as 
 we know now, it isn’t that a- way they’d have got off. 
 And never throve from that hour, nor cared to cry 
 ‘ the Freeman with the parliament debates not in it, 
 nor Counsellor Grattan. Och, the trade was ruined 
 entirely ; and from that day to this, never hawked

 the bit of paper, nor could raise a tinpenny, only just 
 on arrands, long life to your honors ; and that’s what 
 the Union has brought us to ; and sorrow paper they 
 need print at all, at all, now, only in respect of the 
 paving board, and Counsellor Gallagher’s illigant 
 speeches.”! 
 
 “ And what use is made of that magnificent build- 
 ing ?” asked Mr. De Yere, who stood gazing upon it 
 with evident admiration. 
 
 “ What use is it they make of it, your honor ? 
 Why, then, sorrow a use in life, only a bank, sir ; the 
 Bank of Ireland ; w r hat less use could they make of 
 it ? And for all that,” added the guide significantly, 
 “ it cost a power to make it what it is.” 
 
 “ It is a beautiful thing of its kind,” said De Yere, 
 rather apostrophizing the building than addressing 
 his companion, who stood silent and self-wrapped. 
 “ Beautiful even now, entire and perfect in all its 
 parts — what will it be centuries hence, when its co- 
 lumns, touched by the consecrating hand of time, 
 shall lie prostrate, and its pediments and architraves 
 be broken and moss-grown — when all around it shall 
 be silence and desolation ? Then, haply, some strife 
 of elements may conduct the enterprising spirit of 
 remote philosophy to these coasts ; may cast some 
 future Volney of the Ohio or Susquehannah upon the 
 shores of this little Palmyra, when he may surmise 
 and wonder, may dream his theories, and calculate 
 his probabilities ; and, bending over these ruins, may 
 see the future in the past, and apostrophize the in- 
 evitable fate of existing empires.” 
 
 “ Or an American freeman,” observed the Commo- 
 dore, “ the descendant of some Irish exile, may

 voluntarily seek the bright green shores of his 
 fathers, and, in this mouldering structure, behold the 
 monument of their former degradation.” 
 
 “ Why, then, long life to your honors,” added the 
 guide, who, with the subtility incident to his class 
 and country, drew ingenious, and sometimes exact 
 conclusions, from very scanty premises ; and who now 
 believed that the strangers were predicting the ruin 
 of Ireland from the event of the Union (an event exe- 
 crated by all the lower orders of the country). 
 “Why, then, long life to your honors, it’s true for 
 you; and was said long ago, that after the Union, 
 the grass would grow high in Dublin streets; and 
 would this day, plaze God, only in respect of the 
 paving board, that keeps rippin’ up the streets, and 
 layin’ down the streets, from June to January, just 
 for the job, by Jagurs !” 
 
 “Well, there is ould Trinity,” he continued, turn- ( 
 ing towards the college, as he again raised his load 
 upon his shoulders : “ the boys that used to bate the 
 world before them oncet with their fun and their 
 laming, are now down, like the rest — and doesn’t 
 know one of them myself now, barrin Collagian 
 Barrett.” 
 
 “By the by,” said Mr. De Yere, “is not this Irish 
 College Smart’s ‘ Temple of Dulness,’ in the eyes of, 
 whose learned doctors Swift and Goldsmith could 
 find no favor ? I have little respect myself for incor- 
 porated learning, or for literature and taste acquired 
 by act of parliament.” 
 
 “Intellectual illumination,” replied the Commo- 
 dore, “like other things, would, perhaps, best find 
 its maximum when independent of legislative inter-

 ference. There is an education belonging to the spirit 
 of the age and carried on by its influence, far beyond 
 the rules of these worn-out monastic institutions.' ” 
 
 “ Och ! it’s an ould place, shure enough,' 5 g&id the 
 guide, “ and least said about it is soonest mended. 
 Now, plaze your honors, I'm finely rested, many 
 thanks to yez, and so is mounseer too, and will attind 
 you, and lafe ould nosey there to put on; for they’ve 
 begun to deck the lad, early as it is.” 
 
 As he spoke, he directed the observation of the 
 gentlemen to the equestrian statue of King William 
 the Third, which two men were now busily engaged 
 in decorating with orange and blue ribbons.* 
 
 “ What does it mean?’ 5 demanded Mr. De Yere. 
 
 “ What does it mane ? why it manes to vex the 
 papists sore, your honor, shure that’s the ascendancy, 
 sir; only for it, and the likes of it, wouldn't we be 
 this day hand and glove, orange and green, sorrow 
 one color you’d know from the other. Och ! but 
 that wouldn’t do — where would the ascendancy be ? — 
 only all Irishmen then.” 
 
 * This ludicrous and offensive spectacle is exhibited at the 
 expense of the civil magistrate, on the anniversary of events 
 connected with the triumph of the revolution party, and the 
 downfall of the Jacobites. To the Catholics, who behold in 
 this outward sign a token of their political annihilation, and 
 an insulting arrogation of the supremacy of the minority over 
 the majority, it is a source of heart-burnings, and an incentive 
 to discord. As, however, its continued exhibition is a proof 
 of narrow intellect and bad feelings in the individuals who per- 
 sist in repeating it, the oppressed party would do well to turn 
 the laugh against their enemies, by ridiculing the taste, and 
 mocking the vanity which finds pleasure in thus disfiguring the 
 statue.

 The gentlemen at length reached their hotel, which 
 might have been taken for, what it had once been, the 
 splendid mansion of a resident nobleman, but for the 
 show-board, which designated its present public use 
 and object. 
 
 Several idle persons stood lounging about the 
 door of the hotel. The only person whom the guests 
 wished to see (the master), did not appear; and they 
 had to wait some time before the head waiter could 
 be found, to tell them whether they could be accom- 
 modated. What is called the dead time of the year, 
 is usually that in which Ireland is most visited by 
 curious strangers (who choose that period as the best 
 for visiting Killarney and the Giant’s Causeway), and 
 by necessitous absentees, who, driven to look for their 
 rents, or to canvass their county, select that time for 
 their penance, which they cannot well employ else- 
 where, and make a snatch at Ireland in the interval 
 between the London and watering-place seasons. 
 
 While the gentlemen walked up and down the hall, 
 with every symptom of impatience, the guide applied 
 for payment to the exhausted Frenchman, who was 
 now lying full length on a bench, uttering many ex- 
 clamations of annoyance and fatigue. When he un- 
 derstood the meaning of the Irishman’s extended 
 hand, he gave him what he considered a sufficient re- 
 ward for his services. But as this sum was barely 
 what the Irishman expected, he returned it carelessly, 
 with “ Here, mounseer ! I’ll make you a present of it.” 
 “ Mats , comment done , mon ami , qidest ce que tfest ?” 
 “What is it I say , is it? Why then, it’s what I 
 say, I wouldn’t dirty my fingers with it.” 
 
 “ Then,” said one of the waiters, impatient to £et

 him out of the hall, and snatching the portmanteau 
 out of his hand, “ I say, that if you won’t take that, 
 I’d give you nothing.” 
 
 “ Wouldn’t you, Mr. Connolly?” he replied coolly. 
 
 “ Why then, faith, it’s often you gave us that. Mister 
 Connolly, and will again, plaze God.” 
 
 The laugh which this observation excited in the by- 
 standers raised Mr. Connolly’s choler, and he now en- 
 deavored to hustle the guide out of the hall ; but he 
 stood his ground firmly, exclaiming with great cool- 
 ness, “ I won’t go till I’m ped, Mr. Connolly ; not a 
 foot, sir, nor wouldn’t quit, if your master was in it 
 hingdelf.” 
 
 The Commodore now came forward to learn the 
 cause of the scuffle, and having heard both parties, 
 he turned abruptly to the guide, and demanded, 
 “ What employment are you fit for ?” 
 
 “What employment am I fit for? every employ- 
 ment in life, sir, good or bad.” 
 
 “ Would you like to go into service ?” 
 
 “ Is it into the reglar sarvice, your honor ? Och,. 
 then, I never favored that much.” 
 
 “ Will you go on board ship ?” 
 
 “Is it on board ship, sir?” (rubbing round his 
 shoulders and smiling), “ Och, plaze your honor, I 
 oncet went a long voyage sir, and the say sickness 
 didn’t agree with me.” 
 
 “Well,” said the Commodore, impatiently, “if there 
 was one inclined to be of service to you, to enable 
 you to get some more certain mode of subsistence 
 than that you pursue, what line of life would you 
 prefer ?” 
 
 “ Why, then, long life to your honor, I pray God*

 and if there was a gentleman would have the great 
 kindness to lind me a trifle to get my rags out of 
 pledge, that I might go back to the trade nate and 
 dacent, as my ould father did afore me, I would choose, 
 } bove all the employments in life, sir, to stand at the 
 post-office and cry the Freeman's Journal , plaze your 
 honor.” 
 
 “And what sum will do this for him?” asked the 
 Commodore of the head waiter, who now appeared. 
 
 “ God bless you, sir, a pound note would make his 
 fortune ; and I would be his banker, and see it laid 
 out to advantage.” 
 
 The Commodore silently presented the pound note, 
 and was moving away, when the guide, following him 
 a few steps, dropped on his knees, and seizing the 
 skirts of his pelisse, remained for a moment struggling 
 for utterance, while the tears stood in his hollow eyes. 
 “ Should I return to Dublin,” observed the Commo- 
 dore, touched, perhaps, by the silent emotion of feel- 
 ings so prompt and ardent, so opposed to the poor 
 man’s former gay and jocose acuteness, “ should I re- 
 turn, I will inquire for you here ; and if I find you 
 have given up breaking your fast with whiskey ” 
 
 “ My fast, your honor, that’s all for the whole day, 
 
 sir, mate or drink, and the rest goes — Plaze your 
 
 honor, the little bit of a naked girl, at the vault, that’s 
 my child, sir, and four of them — only dacency, your 
 honor, and a bit of pride, and the childre, and the 
 pound note, sir ; oh ! its too much goodness intirely.’ 
 
 The Commodore drew back from his grasp, and 
 motioning him to rise, added, “In that case, — four 
 children you say.” He then gave another note, and 
 walked rapidly away.

 “ God bless you, sir,” said the waiter, who ran be- 
 fore, and conducted the gentlemen up stairs. “ You 
 have made one poor man happy this morning, at all 
 events.” 
 
 “ You have had a scena ,” observed Mr. De Yere, 
 languidly. 
 
 “ Almost,” he replied, with a deep sigh. “ Absen- 
 tee ! yes, well may they be absentees that can ! what 
 is that degree of enjoyment and individual happiness, 
 which a man may procure, who is liable every day to 
 behold such misery as we have witnessed, within the 
 last short hour ; or who is led to reflect for a moment 
 on the train of misrule, of the collision of interests, 
 prejudices, and feelings, which have produced such a 
 state of society in this fine country ?” 
 
 This speech was pronounced after they had entered 
 a handsome drawing-room, and wdtile each took pos- 
 session of a lounge. The waiter then began a long 
 string of apologies. “ Dressing-rooms would be got 
 ready in a few minutes, as soon as the Marquis of In- 
 chigeela and his son, Lord Dun man a way, were gone ; 
 and his lordship’s travelling carriage was at that 
 moment at the door: but the house was -so full; a 
 number of persons from England arrived by the last 
 packet : others about to depart for Holyhead ;” and 
 he added, in an “ aside” whisper, “ the elderly gentle- 
 woman would be off in a jiffy, as her pocliay wa- 
 ordered, and she had only stepped into the best draws 
 ing-room to write a letter.” He then added aloud, 
 that he would just run down himself and introduce 
 the French valet to the French cook, store the gen- 
 tlemen’s things in the dressing-room, and order break- 
 fast.

 The waiter then shuffled off, impressed with a high 
 opinion of the consequence of the strangers, from the 
 petulance of the one, and the haughty look of the 
 other ; and believing them well worth attending to 
 from the extraordinary liberality of the Commodore, 
 who, by an act well adapted to Irish feelings, had 
 bought golden opinions from all who had witnessed it. 
 
 The mention made by the waiter of the “ elderly 
 gentlewoman,” was the first intimation the strangers 
 received that such a person was present. They now 
 threw their eyes round the spacious room, and a 
 figure, which answered to the description, appeared 
 seated in one of its remote corners at a Tvriting table. 
 They turned their eyes instantly away, to a very fine 
 map of Ireland which hung on the wall, and near to 
 which they sat. The Commodore took it down, and 
 began to trace his route with a pencil, while Mr. De 
 Yere followed his track with his eye, as he looked 
 over his shoulder. 
 
 Meantime the gentlewoman resembled, as she sat, 
 one of those wax-work figures, which, at once gro- 
 tesque and natural, are colored to the life, yet inani- 
 mate as death. For she remained, for a considerable 
 time after the strangers had entered the room, with 
 her eyes riveted on their persons, and her pen sus- 
 pended above the paper upon which she had been 
 writing. There was an intensity in her fixed look, 
 that implied something more than mere idle curiosity. 
 In whatever manner their sudden appearance had af- 
 fected her, they seemed to hold her senses in suspen- 
 sion: and many minutes had elapsed, the strangers 
 had travelled, on paper, over the whole province of

 Munster, before she resumed, with a long-drawn sigh, 
 her interrupted occupation. 
 
 In her person this elderly gentlewoman was low 
 and somewhat bulky ; her head-dress was a tete, with 
 side curls powdered, surmounted by a small high 
 crowned beaver hat, laid fiat upon the head. She 
 vfore a black crape veil, so fastened up in the centre 
 as to expose a very red nose, and a very large pair of 
 dark green spectacles ; her chin was sunk in her cra- 
 vat, whose long fringed ends belonged to other epochs 
 of fashion than the present. The immense chitterling 
 of her habit shirt appeared through her single-breasted, 
 long-waisted, brass-buttoned, camblet Joseph. Her 
 whole appearance, though most risibly singular, was 
 such as would have been scarcely deemed extraordi- 
 nary in the remote counties of Ireland, twenty or thirty 
 years back, when old fashions and old habits remained 
 in full force among the provincial gentry, who pre- 
 served the faith, principles and costume of their an- 
 cestors alike unchanged. Even still such figures are 
 occasionally seen in the middle ranks of rural life, 
 riding on a pillion to Mass on a holiday, or making 
 one of a congregation of ten in some remote and soli- 
 tary church, whose parish, though it bring a large 
 revenue to its non-resident incumbent, may not con- 
 sist of as many Protestant families.* 
 
 The impatience of the travellers for the refresh- 
 ment of the toilette and the breakfast table was now 
 considerably abated by the occupation which the map 
 afforded them. The Commodore had traced with his 
 pencil the great Munster road as far as Cashel ; then

 since this was written.

 diverged by cross ways towards the Galtee Moun- 
 tains to the towns of Doneraile and Buttevant. 
 From this point he was proceeding towards Kerry 
 when his companion interrupted him by observing : 
 
 “ I perceive we are proceeding by the same route 
 as far as Buttevant; I am going to the south and 
 shall halt at Kilcolman — the reposoir , where, in the 
 course of my pilgrimage through this Island of Saints, 
 my imagination will do homage to the memory of 
 Spenser. If you have not any objection I should like 
 much to accompany you so far, but you will reject 
 the proposal with the same frankness it is made, if it 
 is the least gene to you.” 
 
 “ On the contrary, I shall accept it with pleasure, 
 as far as Buttevant; but from thence my uncertain 
 route, through a wild country, will be passed on 
 horseback; and the business of an ardent research 
 would leave me no time for the enjoyment of your 
 society, from which I have already derived so much. 
 But,” he added, after an abrupt pause, and suddenly 
 speaking in Spanish, “ you are ignorant of my name 
 and situation. You may dislike this equivocal posi- 
 tion, in which I am necessarily thrown ; for it would 
 not suit my views or my convenience to reveal either. 
 To the title, however, of Commodore, given me by 
 my crew, I have a right ; for the rest you must take 
 me as I am and upon trust.” ^ 
 
 “ I take you upon your own terms,” rwas the reply, 
 “ and I adopt them as my own : to confess the truth 
 I like the mystery and romance of our connexion. It 
 is foreign to the established forms of the world’s cal- 
 culated ties ; and, whether or no, when we part, we 
 ever meet again, I shall look upon the accident which

 brought me acquainted with the Commander of 11 
 Librador as among the pleasantest events of my life, 
 I am weary of the stale forms of what is falsely called 
 civilized society ; and he who picks me up unknown, 
 unnamed, in the middle of the ocean r receiving me 
 between sky and sea, a wanderer in the elements — 
 giving me the rites, of hospitality, communicating 
 with me frankly, cherishing no suspicion, seeking no 
 confidence, nor obtruding any, connects himself, in 
 my imagination, with a state of things, often dreamed 
 of but rarely realized. Ties, formed under such cir- 
 cumstances, are precious as they are rare; and by 
 me, at least, are valued accordingly.” 
 
 “ And I,” said the Commodore, wuth his splendid 
 smile brightening the severity of his singular counte- 
 nance, “ have just romance enough to enter into your 
 feeling ; for I once made a friendship in swimming 
 down the Oronoko, which influenced the fortune and 
 bent of my future life.”] 
 
 They then agreed to leave Dublin in two hours ; 
 and Mr. De Yere asked, “What do you do with 
 your servant ?” “ I have none but my Spanish mate, 
 
 whom I leave to take the command of my vessel 
 when she is ready for sea.” 
 
 “ Then I also will leave my ridiculous Frenchman 
 behind me till I arrive at my place of destination ; a 
 period ^ still hanging in the stars.’ The master of 
 this hotel will take care of him, I suppose, if well 
 paid, as he would of my grey parrot, green monkey, 
 or any other exotic animal I might consign to him. 
 I have not the least idea, though, how I shall do with- 
 out a servant ; but the situation will be new, and so 
 far, good.”

 Here the waiter entered, and inquired of the “ el- 
 derly gentlewoman,” as if merely to make an excuse 
 to get her out of the room, “ Have you any luggage. 
 Ma’am, to nut up ?” To this question she replied 
 angrily, and interrupting her reassumed letter, which, 
 by the motion of her hand, appeared to consist of 
 characters complex as the ancient Ogham. “ Have I 
 any luggage ! have I ? Then do you take me for a 
 snail, why ! with all my goods on my back ?” The 
 rich round Munster brogue in which this question 
 was asked, the guttural accentuation of the “ you” 
 and the “ why,” peculiar to that province, and the 
 sharp key in which it was uttered, made the gentle- 
 men start; while the impertinent waiter took no 
 pains to conceal his ready laughter. 
 
 “ You are mighty pert, sir,” said the old lady, toss- 
 ing a black wafer about her mouth, and sealing and 
 soiling the ill-folded letter with it : she then gathered 
 up her papers (some printed tracts which lay on the 
 table), and corking her ink-horn, which dropped into 
 her capacious pocket, as a pebble falls into the bot- 
 tom of a deep well, she lowered her veil, resumed a 
 black silk, rabbit-skinjined cardinal cloak, and wad- 
 dling to the door, turned full round, and made a 
 formal courtesy to the gentlemen; the gentlemen 
 bowed, and she retired. 
 
 The French valet had now prepared the apparatus 
 for the toilette : but before the gentlemen adjourned 
 to their dressing-rooms, the waiter returned and pre- 
 sented a note, illegibly written upon a dirty card, 
 which Mr. He Yere took between his finger and 
 thumb, and read, first eagerly to himself, and then

 aloud, with a look of disgust, amounting almost to 
 nausea ; it ran as follows : 
 
 “ Mistress Magillicuddy presents her respects, on 
 her way to Munster, would make a third in a chay, as 
 far as Tipperary town, if agreeable. N. B. no luggage 
 to signify, foreby a portmantle and bandbox, also a 
 magpie and cage, would hang outside, if not agreeable 
 within : would prefer the gentlemen if serious : begs 
 your acceptance of a religious tract, and am, gentle- 
 men, Yours, &c., Molly Magillicuddy.” 
 
 The waiter chuckled, and observed : “ The lady 
 says she forgot to mention the bird and bandbox are 
 to be taken up in Thomas street.” Mr. De Yere 
 tossed the note on the table, and went to his dressing- 
 room ; and the Commodore, with more good breed- 
 ing, or,* rather, with more good nature, desired the 
 waiter to say that previous arrangements obliged 
 them to decline the honor intended them by Mrs. 
 Magillicuddy. 
 
 This singular-looking lady had come by the Holy- 
 head packet the night before, and had ordered a chaise 
 previous to the arrival of the gentlemen. The freedom 
 with which they had discussed their route before her 
 had probably suggested the idea of economizing her 
 travelling expenses by joining them. She might also 
 have had some more important views than those 
 which were prudently directed to their purses; for 
 her inquiry as to their being “ serious” (a technical 
 term in a particular new light), indicated her calling ; 
 and it was possible she believed herself the elected 
 agent of salvation to them, as to many others — the 
 Krudner or Johanna Southcote of some Munster vil- 
 lage, to which she might now be returning, laden witli

 sectarian tracts, and Irish snuff, bohea tea, and into- 
 lerance. 
 
 When the waiter delivered a negative answer to 
 her card, she shook her head, and said : “ In their 
 blindness they know not what they reject, why ! but 
 the sickle will go forth, and the harvest will yet be 
 reaped.” 
 
 She shortly after set off for Naas, accusing the 
 waiters of sauciness and extravagant charges, talking 
 Irish with the driver, and lecturing the beggars on 
 the sin of idleness. She accompanied her admonition 
 with some small change ; at the same time accounting 
 selfishly for her donation by observing, “ He that 
 giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.” “ O ! I en 
 gage,” said the waiter as he drove off, “ it's little 
 you’d give, if you didn't expect it back with interest 
 tenfold — and that’s, now, what the likes of her calls 
 charity? It’s the charity that begins at home, ay, and 
 ends there too. Commend me to the gentleman 
 above stairs that gave his two pound notes, and never 
 canted nor preached about it. That’s the real charity, 
 long life to him !” 
 
 To this ejaculation an “ amen” was repeated by all 
 present, who had witnessed the liberality of the Com- 
 modore, and heard the departing apostrophe of the 
 “ elderly gentlewoman.”'

CHAPTER H.

 curante ! Rien ne pent lui plaire. 
 
 Voltaire. 
 
 The two distinguished strangers, whom chance had 
 so singularly united, and who had mutually chosen, 
 from caprice or prudence, to hang the veil of mystery 
 over their respective situations, appeared to touch on 
 the extremes of human character. But there was, 
 notwithstanding, an obvious dove-tailing in their dis- 
 similitudes ; and their moral disagreements, like some 
 musical discords, produced a combination more gra- 
 cious than the utmost perfection of a complete and 
 blended harmony could effect. The one seemed a 
 brilliant illustration of physical and intellectual en- 
 ergy, thrown into perpetual activity; the other a 
 personification of moral abstraction, originating inge- 
 nious reveries, which, though sometimes founded in 
 fact, were generally inapplicable in practice. The 
 fortunes of life seemed to have formed the one, and 
 to have spoiled the other. The one thought, sympa- 
 thized, and acted; the other mused, dreamed, and 
 was passive. Their first half-hour’s communication, 
 however, on board ship, was a reciprocation of 
 mutual good will. Each felt he was associated with 
 a gentleman ; and in that confidence had suffered in- 
 timacy to grow with a rapidity disproportioned to its

 duration. But though opinions were freely discussed, 
 and almost always opposed ; though sentiments were 
 broadly debated, and principles vehemently canvass- 
 ed; yet in the conversations held by the midnight 
 moon, or the day’s preclusive dawn, no circumstance 
 of personal communication had ever passed between 
 them : mutually in possession of each other’s leading 
 opinions, and features of character, they were igno- 
 rant of all else beside. 
 
 Both gentlemen spoke Spanish and French fluently; 
 but the Commodore had a foreign pronunciation of 
 some particular English words, which denoted him to 
 have been long absent from the countries where 
 English is the vernacular tongue. The reading of 
 the younger stranger seemed stupendous. It included 
 the classics, ancient and modern, with the whole belles 
 lettres of European and Oriental literature. The 
 studies of the Commodore were evidently more con- 
 fined to the exact sciences ; and, with the exception 
 of Shakspeare, Milton, and Ossian, and of some old 
 quaint English prose writers (the chroniclers of Ire- 
 land’s hapless story, the Campions, Spencers, and 
 Hanmers), his course of English reading seemed cir- 
 cumscribed. The conversation of the one, therefore, 
 was more elegant, ornamented, and detailed ; that of 
 the other more original, energetic, and concise. The 
 one spoke in epic, the other in epigram. They had 
 both travelled much, and far ; the one, it should seem, 
 from choice; the other from necessity: and the re- 
 sult appeared to be that the one had stored his mind 
 with images, the other strengthened his judgment by 
 observations. Such as they were, they were both 
 evidently “ out of the common roll of men” — and

 alike distinguished by personal and mental supe- 
 riority. 
 
 The Commodore had dressed, breakfasted, made 
 the necessary arrangements for their journey to Mun- 
 ster, and gone abroad, before his fellow-traveller had 
 gotten half-way through his toilette, even with the 
 assistance of monsieur, his valet. Mr. De Yere had 
 indeed but just sat down to his coffee, and his 
 “ Faery Queen,” when the elder stranger returned, 
 after an absence of near two hours. 
 
 “ Have you seen much of Dublin ?” asked the 
 younger traveller, laying down his book. 
 
 “ Yes, I believe I have been half through it.” 
 “What impression does it give you upon the 
 whole ?” 
 
 “ Why, with its extremes of poverty and splendor, 
 the wretchedness of a great part of its inhabitants, 
 and the magnificence of its buildings, it is to me a 
 Grecian temple turned into a lazaretto. One-third 
 of its population are in an actual state of pauperism : 
 one-half of its trading streets exhibits as many bank- 
 rupt sales as open shops ; the best houses are to be 
 let, and the debtor’s prisons are overflowing.” 
 
 “ Have you then had time to visit the prisons ?” 
 
 “ Business brought me to one ; business w r ith the 
 high sheriff of a county, who has delivered himself up 
 for the purpose of a 4 whitewashing’ under the insol- 
 vency act, as he termed it.” 
 
 “ Ha ! ha ! ha ! an high sheriff in prison — that’s sin- 
 gular enough.” 
 
 1 Hot so singular in Ireland; for two other sheriffs 
 were confined in the same room with him, and for the 
 same purposes.”

 “ The laws must he well administered. But doubt- 
 less they are all honorable men.” 
 
 “ They are loyal men (as my friend the sheriff told 
 me), though under a little present difficulty.” 
 
 “You have purchased a pocket telescope, I per- 
 ceive.” 
 
 “Yes, and a little information from the intelligent 
 optician from whom I bought it. I went into his 
 shop as the tax-gatherer was carrying out of it several 
 articles, which he had seized for non-payment. The 
 -owner was looking on calmly, and to some observa- 
 tion of mine, he replied, 1 1 have not the money sir •

 all, we shall be at rest ; we cannot be worse.’ To my 
 remark on the supposed tendency of the Union, so 
 often vaunted in newspapers, and in debate, that it 
 would bring English capital into Irish trade, he 
 answered, ‘ The effect of the Union is ruin to Ireland :* 
 since that epoch, her debt has increased, her resources 
 diminished, her taxes augmented, her manufactures 
 languishing, her gentry self exiled, her peasantry tur- 
 bulent from distress, and her tradesmen, like myself, 
 drained to the last farthing, and sighing to remove to 
 that country, where they will not be obliged to pay a 
 large rent to the government for leave to live — to 
 America.! But all cannot do this.’ I note these ob- 
 servations as being curious from one of his class.”

 The waiter now entered, presented the bill, and an- 
 nouncer] that all was ready for their departure. The 
 landlord, who in his communication with Mr. De 
 Yere on the subject of his valet, had decided at once 
 that he was a man of rank and fashion, now attended, 
 and did the honors of his house in the usual style of 
 Irish hyperbole. 
 
 “ Upon my credit, gentlemen, I’m heartily sorry 
 we’re losing the honor of your company so soon ; and 
 think I could make the place plazing to you, if you 
 would do me the honor, on your return from the 
 Lakes (for supposes it is to them you’re going), and 
 am sorry you make such a short stay, without seeing 
 the Rotunda, and the College, and the Dublin Society 
 House, and the statues.” 
 
 “Statues! what statues?” demanded the younger 
 stranger, catching at the sound, and stopping short. 
 
 “ The statues, sir, at our society house, that’s kept 
 in the greatest style, and gets a touch up whenever 
 the place is painted. That’s by order, as we say, in 
 the society house.” “ By what order ?” was demand- 
 ed, with a smile. “ By order of the committee of 
 fine arts ; and myself was one, until business came on 
 me so thick, and took up my attention ; and has a

 brother that 1 shows’ at the exhibition every year, a 
 great artist. Indeed, I think you’d be plazed, gentle- 
 men, if you were to stop and see the exhibition this 
 saison, and portrait No. 2, full length of Mr. Roger 
 O’Rafferty, of the Back-lane division, auxiliary yeo- 
 manry corps, in full regimentals, standing quite quiet, 
 and a cannon going off in the Phanix ;* that’s by my 
 brother, sir.” This detailed statement of the cogno- 
 scente landlord to prove the flourishing state of the 
 arts in Ireland, the country which has given to the 
 English school of painting a Barry, a Shee, and a 
 Tresham,f seemed quite sufficient to satisfy the 
 curiosity of the strangers, who passed on, through 
 files of beggars, to their carriage : they threw some 
 silver among them, and hastily drew up the windows, 
 to exclude the infected air, as they drove away. 
 
 “ Pa !” said the finer gentleman of the two, “ this 
 is breathing pestilence.” 
 
 “ And witnessing its causes in all their most shock- 
 ing details : look, what a splendid scene for such a 
 grouping ! what a noble street, and what a mendicant 
 population !” 
 
 As they passed through the southern suburb, the 
 Commodore demanded of the postillion the name and 
 purposes of an immense building on the opposite side 
 of the water. 
 
 “ Is it that forenent us, plaze your honor, acrass the

 there’s the Richmond barracks ; and if your honor 
 could see behind you, sir, you'd see the Porto Bello 
 barracks, and there afore you is Island Bridge bar- 
 racks, and the barracks in the town ; and musha, my- 
 self doesn’t know the half o’ them. You might travel 
 in the county Dublin mountains, rising there on your 
 lift, from barrack to barrack, and never get sight of 
 inn, or house, man or baste, only sogers, sir.” 
 
 “ From this sample,” said the Commodore, address- 
 ing his companion, “ we might suppose the whole 
 country to be one great fortress, as it was in Eliza- 
 beth’s day, when the population was divided into the 
 1 English rebel,’ and the 1 Irish enemy.’ What an 
 expense this army of occupation must prove to an 
 impoverished country !” 
 
 “I have myself,” returned Mr. De Yere, “no ob- 
 jection to a military government : ’tis at least pictur- 
 esque : it affords something to look at, and to de- 
 scribe. I like military architecture, battlements and 
 ramparts, watch-towers and bastions. The military

 “ England is hastening fast to this ; but she will

 “ And I trust an appropriate spirit too ! Look at

 familiars and inquisitors for ministers of state, and

 “ Spain, for example ? for though your fertile imagi- 
 nation invent, as it may, sources of oppression and 
 degradation to man, there are still governments in 
 Europe to leave mere fahle far behind.” 
 
 “Well, after all, call governments by what name 
 you will, they all alike leave man as they find him, 
 feeble and selfish.” 
 
 “Yes, because he is man. But in following the 
 natural order of things, you at least make him all he 
 is capable of being. Nature is the great legislator. 
 In creating man free, she commanded him to remain 
 so : and reaction, sooner or later, follows the violation 
 of this her first great edict.” 
 
 “ This is Naas, your honor,” observed the postillion, 
 addressing himself to the Commodore, at the end of 
 more than an hour’s silence, interrupted only by oc- 
 casional questions, addressed to the driver, relative to 
 the surrounding objects — 4 and there is more bar- 
 racks, sir;” and he pointed to a handsome square 
 building, in itself almost a town: and there’s the 
 
 jail, sir, an iligant fine building, and a croppy’s head 
 spiked on the top of it. I’ll engage,” he added, 
 opening the door (for Naas was their first stage); 
 “I’ll engage he’ll rue the day he saw Vinegar-hill, 
 anyhow, wherever he is, poor lad.”

 (the noon-day sunbeam. Turning away his eyes in 
 disgust, he passed under the fine arch of a ruined

 feelings to associate with less frightful images of death 
 in its retired cemetery, than to behold them connect- 
 ed with such horrific associations, exposed in the high 
 road of a public thoroughfare, a frightful landmark 
 for an unfortunate country. 
 
 The travellers proceeded on their journey towards 
 the province of Munster, a province peculiarly inter- 
 esting for its historical recollections, and for those 
 scenes, alternately wild and picturesque, which attract 
 to its site the footsteps of taste and curiosity, and 
 furnish to foreign artists so many combinations of 
 scenic loveliness. Conversation had been frequently 
 dropped and renewed ; and the travellers had again 
 remained silent for some miles, when they overtook a 
 chaise, from which Mrs. Magillicuddy formally saluted 
 them. The elder stranger, recognizing the green 
 spectacles and chitterling (the most conspicuous parts 
 of her figure), answered her salutation with a bow ; 
 the younger turned away his head in disgust. 
 
 “ An ounce of civet would not sweeten my imagi- 
 nation,” he observed, “ from the infection communi- 
 cated to it by the idea of that horrible old Irishwoman, 
 shut up in this chaise with her and her magpie ! ! 
 Do you know, this image has haunted me ever since 
 she made the frightful proposal.” 
 
 The smile of his companion indicated his conscious- 
 ness of this avowed prejudice ; and the attention of 
 the travellers became again engaged with the passing 
 scene. The various objects which presented them- 
 selves to their view, both moral and physical, were 
 seen by each through such mediums as their respect- 
 ive peculiarity, taste, and temperament, were likely to 
 produce. The one, rapid in perception, instinctively

 just in inference, quick, curious, active, inquiring, di- 
 rected the whole force of his acute, prompt observa- 
 tion, to the people and their localities, as both ap- 
 peared upon the surface. He turned his eyes to the 
 peasant’s hut : it was the model of the “ mere Irish- 
 man’s” hovel, as it rose amidst scenes of desolation 
 during the civil wars of Elizabeth’s reign. It was the 
 same described by William Lithgow, the Scotch pil- 
 grim, the noted traveller of that remote day. “A 
 fabric erected in a single frame of smoke-torn straw, 
 green, long-pricked turf, and rain-dropping wattles; 
 where, in foul weather, its master can scarcely f nd a 
 dry place to repose his sky-baptized head upon.” 
 
 He beheld the tenant of this miserable dwelling 
 working on the roads, toiling in the ditches, laboring 
 in the fields, with an expression of lifeless activity 
 marking his exertions, the result of their deepfelt in- 
 adequacy : his gaunt, athletic frame was meagre and 
 fleshless, his color livid, his features sharpened : his 
 countenance, though readily brightening into smiles 
 of gaiety or derision, expressed the habitual influence 
 of strong dark passions. The quick intelligence of 
 his careless glances mingled with the lurking slyness 
 of distrust — the instinctive self-defence of conscious 
 degradation. He beheld multitudes of half-naked 
 children, the loveliness of their age disfigured by 
 squalid want, and by the filthy drapery of extreme 
 poverty, — idle and joyless, loitering before the cabin 
 door, or following in the train of a mendicant mother. 
 Her partner in misery had haply gone to seek employ- 
 ment from the English harvest, where his hire would 
 be paid with the smile of derision; and where he 
 would be expected to excite laughter by his blunders,

 who might well command tears by his wretchedness. 
 
 In the proclaimed districts, the misery of the peas- 
 ant population was most conspicuous. For he to 
 whom 
 
 •* The world was no friend, nor the world’s law.” 
 
 might well set both at defiance. The forfeit of life 
 could be deemed but a small penalty to him, who in 
 preserving it “ showeth a greater necessity he hath to 
 live, than any pleasure he can have in living.” 
 
 The few vehicles, public or private, observable on 
 the high roads, and the total absence of a respectable 
 yeomanry, marked the scantiness of a resident gentry, 
 ana the want of that independent class, “ a country’s 
 boast and pride.” Yet many stately edifices, the 
 monuments of ancient splendor, or of modern taste, 
 rose along the way ; the former in ruins, the latter al- 
 most invariably unfinished. The castle of the ancient 
 chief, and the mansion of the existing landlord, were 
 alike desolated and deserted. Town succeeding town, 
 marked the influence and power of the great English 
 palatines, who drew their wealth and luxury from a 
 land to which, like their forefathers, for generations 
 back, they were strangers ; and the name and arms 
 of the English nobility, suspended over inns, embla- 
 zoned over court-houses, and fixed in the walls of 
 churches, or shining above their altars, called atten- 
 tion to the extensive territories of these descendants 
 of the undertakers, and grantees of the Elizabeths, 
 the Jameses, and the Charleses. The surface of the 
 country contained the leading facts of its history, and 
 those who ran might read. He who now read, stu- 
 died (not without a comment) that text, whose spirit 
 and whose letter were misrule and oppression.

 The young stranger saw with other eyes, and by 
 the illusory lights of a sleepless imagination. But 
 his philosophy, though cynical, was not the cynicism 
 of experience ; it was the satiety of early excited and 
 promptly exhausted sensations. Man, with him, was 
 everywhere as well off as he deserved to be, because 
 nowhere did “ man delight” him : all references came 
 home to his own enjoyment, and were appreciated, 
 as they extended or curtailed its sphere. He looked 
 only to that which could gratify the dominant faculty 
 of his existence ; and while he found 
 
 “ Nature wanted stuff, 
 
 To vie strange forms with fancy,” 
 
 he sought in the combinations of art, as formed under 
 various epochs of society, for such objects and images 
 as embodying events long passed, were consecrated, 
 and preserved in memory and imagination alone. 
 
 He had induced his companion to lengthen and 
 diverge from their route by visiting the town of 
 Kildare, once a city of historical and monastic im- 
 portance; because, there, his road-book told him, 
 were still visible some remains of the “ Firehouse” — 
 a Christian temple, where the nuns of St. Bridget, 
 like the heathen priestesses of Vesta, kept watch 
 over the sacred flame, which was afterwards extin- 
 guished by the English bishop, Henri de Londres (2). 
 He found a little town, ruinous and wretched, with 
 many symptoms of poverty, and few of antiquity; 
 and he hurried from it in disappointment and dislike 
 He insisted on stopping the first night at Kilkenny, 
 f >r the purpose of viewing its feudal castle of the 
 Butlers and the splendid ruins of its abbeys. But,

 even here, imagination had got the start of fact; 
 and, though a busy fancy peopled the silent aisles of 
 St. Francis and St. John’s with 
 
 “ eremites and friars, 
 
 White, black and grey, with all their trumpery ; ” 
 though he garrisoned the ramparts with “ Irish 
 kernes and galloglaces,” imagination ever left possi- 
 bility behind. Disappointment hung like a noxious 
 vapor upon his steps ; and he everywhere found rea- 
 son, or sought it, to scoff at the folly and feebleness 
 of man, who, under all stages of society, he esteemed 
 the victim of a blindness, beyond his power to dis- 
 pel : alternately tyrant or slave, impostor or dupe — 
 neither by his own free will 
 
 Views thus opposed, and sentiments thus contrast- 
 ed, naturally begot frequent and long-protracted dis- 
 cussions, as fresh objects afforded themes for obser- 
 vation or reflection. The travellers had passed the 
 boundaries of the frequently-proclaimed county of 
 Tipperary, without interruption to their debate or 
 any impediment to their journey (such as have been 
 supposed the inevitable concomitants of Irish post- 
 ing), when the postillion, alighting to lead his horses 
 over a bad step, startled them by exclaiming aloud— 
 “ Why, then, the curse of Cromwell on ye Longford- 
 pass, for you’ve joulted the very life out of me so 
 you have then, having desired his horses to “ get 
 along out of that,” he dropped back, and, laying his 
 hand upon the carriage window, entered into conver- 
 sation with the gentlemen, by strongly advising them 
 , to give up the iday of making Thurles their sleeping 
 stage : first, becaise it was the same to his employer 
 whether they went a few miles one way or t’other ;

 and, secondly, becaise that Thurles town would be 
 full of tlf army, in respect of changing quarters ; two 
 regiments marching to Cork and Kerry to be sprin- 
 kled among the towns and mountain barracks ; and 
 there will be grate billetting the night, and the inn 
 taken up entirely with the officers; and what matter? 
 Shure Holycross was but a (V,ny* bit further, and 
 wouldn’t make an hour’s differ. There was a new 
 opposition inn in the neighborhood, set up against 
 Thurles, and kept by the maister’s cousin-germain, 
 Mr. Dooly, where everything was nate. and clane, 
 and quiet. 
 
 “ Is Holycross a town?” demanded Mr. De Yere, 
 caught by the religious romance of its name (3). 
 
 “ It is, your honor ; that is, not a town, sir, only a 
 township and chapelry; and blessed ground every 
 foot of it, and well it may be. Isn’t there a great big 
 piece of the holy cross itself, the wood of life, buried 
 in the fine ancient ould abbey there, that the travel- 
 lers do be coming to see, far and near? And its 
 that, why, plaze your honors, that of all places in the 
 world round, the devil (Christ save us !) daren’t show 
 the track of his hoof near that township : and troth, 
 gentlemen dear, it would be worth while to go ten 
 mile round any time to see it, only in respect of the 
 lovely fine tomb of th’ ould king that’s in it, my 
 namesake, Donogh O Brien, King of Limerick. 
 Which road shall I take, sir? There, lies the turn 
 to Thurles, and there, to Holycross, your honor.” 
 
 “I think the quiet inn, the ruined abbey, and 
 O'Brien s tomb, decide it,” said the Commodore. 
 
 “ Unquestionably,” replied his companion ; and the

 driver received his orders for Holycross. As he 
 turned his horses’ heads, a chaise passed before them, 
 taking the Thurles road ; and the spectacles, tele , and 
 high crowned hat of Mrs. Magillicuddy, appeared 
 above the magpie’s cage, which was suspended at the 
 side of one of the windows. 
 
 u Raison de plus ” said Mr. De Vere, sinking back 
 in the carriage. “ I would rather fall in with a legion 
 of marching regiments, than come in the way of that 
 horrible old woman, and a renewal of her terrifying 
 proposition.” 
 
 The Commodore smiled. He was amused to 
 observe that Mrs. Magillicuddy and her magpie had 
 taken possession of his companion’s susceptible im- 
 agination; that the idea of an intimate association 
 with her had become as much the “ chimcera dire” of 
 his fancy, as her actual presence would have been the 
 annoyance of his senses, and the destruction of his- 
 ease and comfort ; he had more than once alluded to 
 the disgust of an atmosphere of Irish snuff and mar- 
 row pomatum, to the uninviting images of spectacles 
 and pocket handkerchiefs, pious tracts and fusty bird 
 cages. The accident of her going the same route, 
 and her being enabled to keep pace with them, by 
 their delay at Kildare and Kilkenny (for till the last 
 stage they had travelled with four horses), were con- 
 jured into nothing less than a fatality; and even her 
 innocent magpie was considered as an oiseau de 
 mauvais augure . 
 
 “You are certain,” said the younger traveller, ad- 
 dressing the driver, and pointing to the route taken 
 by the old lady’s chaise, “that that road leads to 
 Thurles V

 <( Shure and sartin, your honor, straight on fore- 
 went, and a turn in it to the lift, that lades to the 
 nunnery, sir.” 
 
 “What nunnery? Are there nunneries in this 
 country ?” 
 
 “ Is it nunneries, sir ? There is— plenty : there is 
 one there, off to the left, between Thurles road and 
 Holycross, that’s the convent of Our Lady of the An- 
 nunciation.” He now jumped upon the wooden bar, 
 which served him as a seat, and giving his horses the 
 whip, proceeded at a rapid pace. 
 
 As the travellers approached the miserable little 
 village of Holycross, the sun’s last rays had with- 
 drawn from the horizon, in all the mild and melan- 
 choly gloom of an autumnal evening. The grey tints 
 of the clouded atmosphere were reflected in shadows 
 on the bosom of the Suir, along whose banks arose the 
 stately ruins of the abbey. The inn, recommended by 
 the driver, the only inn, was a small house leading to 
 the village, and bearing the sign of the Mitre and 
 Crozier, as appropriate to its site. 
 
 The approach of a chaise was evidently no common 
 event ; for the landlord, his wife, a ragged old waiter, 
 with a bare-footed girl (the bar-maid, house-maid, and 
 kitchen-maid of the establishment), had stood at the 
 door for some time, eagerly watching its approach. 
 All were instantly in employment, carrying in the 
 portmanteaux, conducting the travellers to their room, 
 and knocking their heads together, in a confusion, 
 increased by their efforts to do the honors to such 
 unusual guests. The travellers perceived that they 
 were also the only guests ; and they were not dis- 
 pleased by a circumstance which ensured not only

 their quietude, but their accommodation : in Ireland, 
 inns are good in proportion as they are unfrequented. 
 The humble innkeeper of Holycross had recently 
 fitted up a couple of bedrooms in what had lately 
 been a mere shebeen house (4), and dignified with the 
 name of inn the little building, which had been for 
 half a century a noted baiting place for foot and horse 
 travellers, and for such pious pilgrims (and they were 
 not few) as still came to visit the shrine of the holy 
 relic. 
 
 A few inquiries, and the ordering of a late dinner, 
 took up a quarter of an hour ; after which the travel- 
 lers proceeded to visit the abbey. The twilight was 
 thickening into darkness, but the air was fresh and 
 balmy; and motion and activity were positive enjoy- 
 ments to those who had for many hours suffered the 
 cramping restraint and fatiguing dislocation of an 
 Irish post-chaise. 
 
 The inn lay half a mile from the abbey, to which 
 they passed over a bridge, thrown across the river 
 Suir, which formed a communication between the 
 village and the abbey grounds. The ruins covered a 
 considerable tract, and were contrasted in their im- 
 posing magnitude by a few wretched hovels construct- 
 ed out of their fragments. This consecrated pile is 
 among the few interesting monuments of antiquity 
 now extant in a country that, according to the state- 
 ments of the biographer of St. Rumoldi, once con- 
 tained some of the most magnificent religious edifices 
 of Europe. 
 
 Raised by the piety and power of an Irish provin- 
 cial prince, Donagh Carbraigh O’Brien, for monks of 
 the Cistercian order, and consecrated to the Holy

 Cross, St. Mary, and St. Benedict, it owed its princi- 
 pal consequence to the relic of the cross incased in 
 gold and precious stones, given by Pope Paschal II. 
 to Mac Morragh, the predecessor of Carbraigh. The 
 charms of the beautiful architecture must, in days so 
 rude, have contributed not a little to its fame ; and 
 the devotion paid to the relic it enshrined has been 
 declared by an*English minister* to have been univer- 
 sal throughout the island. 
 
 The strangers contemplated for a considerable time 
 the broken mass of its dark exterior, and the high 
 steeple, supported by beautiful Gothic arches. They 
 entered the broad nave, but, like the rest of the ruin, 
 it was wrapt in one undistinguishable hue ; and the 
 majesty of darkness succeeded to the deep and misty 
 forms of twilight. 
 
 “ Darkness,” said the younger stranger, after a 
 silence of some minutes, “ is decidedly the source of 
 the true sublime.” 
 
 “ And light,” replied the Commodore, “ of beauty : 
 light is life, the source of forms and motions ; dark- 
 ness is death : I abhor it.” 
 
 “And I love it. I love the uncertainty of this 
 mysterious ' dimness (for instance), where everything 
 is guessed and nothing known ; where at every doubt- 
 ful step, 
 
 ‘ Solemn and slow the shadows blacker fail, 
 
 And all is awful listening gloom around.’ ” 
 
 A deep sigh, heard near and distinct, answered as he 
 spoke. 
 
 “ Did you sigh ?” he asked quickly.

 “ No : did not yon?” was the reply. 
 
 “ Not I. Yet some one sighed most assuredly. 57 
 
 “ ’Tis the wind among the ruins,” said the Com- 
 modore, carelessly. 
 
 “ No, the air is breathless. It was a human, per- 
 haps a superhuman respiration.” 
 
 “ That is physically impossible : respiration is or- 
 ganization : spirits have none. But do you believe in 
 superhuman agency ?” 
 
 “ I believe, and I deny nothing. I resign myself 
 passively to events, moral and physical, as they oc- 
 cur. This, I fancy, was the original intention of pro- 
 vidence with respect to man, when it made him dark, 
 and left him so ; — -the child of ignorance, and its 
 victim.” 
 
 “ Then why endow him with faculties, which impel 
 him to inquiry, and force him into action, which lead 
 him to dispel his darkness, and rise above his 
 nature ?” 
 
 11 Hush f there again ! I am certain I heard the 
 heavings of a short convulsive respiration. ’Tis most 
 singular !” 
 
 “ The place affects you. We will return, and view 
 it by daylight.” 
 
 “ No,” said Mr. De Vere, seating himself on a frag- 
 ment of the ruin ; “ this is to me positive enjoy- 
 ment.” 
 
 As he spoke, the dispersion of a dense cloud, which 
 had long scowled over the darkened landscape, and 
 which now breaking into fleecy vapor, displayed the 
 broad bright moon, as it rose in splendor above the 
 roofless ruin. A sheet of light fell upon the nave, 
 which the strangers occupied, leaving in shadow the

 lateral aisles, that formed a pillared arcade on either 
 side. Parts of the ruin remained black and massive, 
 while the shrine of the holy relic stood illuminated ; 
 and broken rays and silvered points glittered on the 
 projected tracery of the arches and twisted pillars, 
 which supported the canopy of the royal tomb. 
 
 Both travellers had been some moments silent, 
 when suddenly the younger spoke. He sighed pro- 
 foundly, and asked : “ Is not this the twenty-fifth of 
 August ?” 
 
 “ I believe so,” was the reply. 
 
 “ ’Tis a curious coincidence : on this day, at this 
 hour, seven years ago (my birthday, too, the 
 day I came of age), being in Galicia in Spain, 
 chance led me to the site of a Moorish ruin, adjoin- 
 ing the cloisters of the church of the convent of 
 Nuestra Senora de las Angustius.* I passed, musing 
 on the course of things, from the fragments of Ara 
 bic taste and Mahometan superstition, into the tern 
 pie of Christian rites. Vespers were just celebrated t 
 A few stragglers, who had remained after service, 
 gradually disappeared. I was still examining monu- 
 ments, gazing on pictures, and numbering columns, 
 when darkness fell around me. The different ave- 
 nues of entrance were closed, all save one, which led 
 to what had once been a Moorish orangeries this 
 formed a part of the pleasure-grounds and cemetery 
 of the adjoining convent. While I looked round for 
 some means of egress (twilight rendering ail objects 
 dim and uncertain), sounds that seemed to come from 
 heaven met my ear : the next moment my eye fell 
 upon the minstrel. By the white veil and rosary,

 it was an unprofessed novice : she was seated on the 
 fragment of a Moorish bath, leaning her cheek close 
 
 to the lute, from which she had drawn such enchant- 
 
 • » 
 
 mg harmony ; as if she were childishly, yet prettily 
 charmed with the sound herself had made.” 
 
 “ It is a pretty image, altogether,” said his auditor, 
 seating himself beside him, among the ruins, “ and it 
 reminds me of a famous picture by Rosso Florentine, 
 of a seraph listening to its own lute.” 
 
 “ The resemblance was so great,” returned the nar- 
 rator, “ that I had that design copied on this box, 
 with the little alteration of substituting the novice’s 
 veil for the wing of the cherub, and the head of a 
 lovely woman for that of a seraph.” 
 
 As he spoke, he drew from his pocket a superb 
 gold box, surmounted with the picture he had de- 
 scribed, done in enamel. The moonlight fell full 
 upon its surface ; and in the position in which the 
 Commodore held it, it was distinctly visible. “ Is 
 this head a portrait ?” he demanded. 
 
 “Not exactly. It was done from the idea I gave 
 the artist ; an idea in every sense ; for though the 
 form and outline of the fair original, her fairy step- 
 ping, her aerial motions, became too soon well known, 
 yet the features which that envious veil concealed 
 were never but dimly seen, half shrouded, half re- 
 vealed, pale in the moon’s uncertain light, dark under 
 the shadows of the monumental cypress. In the 
 stolen and dangerous interviews which followed the 
 first accidental meeting, amidst scenes of silence, 
 mystery, and death, that face was never fully revealed. 
 Oh ! there was in that sweet, pure, and short-lived 
 communion, a fanciful and unearthly charm, which I

 have often since vainly sought. It was associated 
 with scenes impressive on the imagination : it was 
 pure as a spirit’s love : no sordid view nor selfish 
 feeling polluted the bright spring of genuine passion. 
 I was loved for myself; nor knew I the name of my 
 concealed mistress, save that which the Church had 
 given her— the Sister Benedicta.” 
 
 “ Then you wooed, and won this mysterious saint ?” 
 asked the Commodore, impatiently. “Wooed! yes; 
 wooed, and weaned the soul of this consecrated being 
 from her heavenly spouse, ‘ her spouse in vain ;’ but 
 my conquest stopped there. I proposed to carry my 
 young novice to South America ; and in some of the 
 Eden clifts of the cloud-embosomed Cordilleras, to 
 lead with her that blessed life of free, unfettered 
 passion, which nature dictated to the first created 
 pair. Pride, and bigotry, which she doubtless digni- 
 fied with the name of virtue, triumphed over love. 
 We parted: I found her innocent, I left her so; I 
 found her happy too, at least contented and deceived ; 
 and it is not long since I ordered a Spanish friend to 
 erect a cenotaph to her memory, in the cemetery of 
 her convent, with this device — a lily fading beneath 
 a sunbeam ; and with this motto, 1 Sic me Phoebus 
 amat .’ ” 
 
 “ You know then that she died, and think ’twas of 
 a broken heart ?” asked his auditor. 
 
 “ I cannot doubt it ; though I have never heard 
 from the friend to whom I trusted my sad commis- 
 sion ; and to tell you the truth, the conviction still 
 haunts my imagination, with a melancholy force, that 
 grows with what it feeds on.”

 “ Oh ! your imagination !” repeated the Commo- 
 dore, significantly, as he returned the box. 
 
 “ Yes,” continued the narrator; “ and in sketching 
 the story, which I have given to the world anony- 
 mously, the description of her death-bed scene almost 
 drove me mad.” 
 
 A short wild laugh now rang through the ruins, as 
 if some malignant fiend had formed a part of the au- 
 dience, and scoffed at the fantastic folly of human 
 vanity, the short-lived influence of human passion. 
 
 The strangers both started, and remained for a 
 moment silent and motionless. 
 
 “ We have been overheard,” said the elder. 
 
 “ I should say by nothing human,” replied his com- 
 panion. “ Look round you : see, we are alone : all is 
 now silence and solitude.” 
 
 “Now, perhaps, but not a moment back. Look 
 there, something is in motion.” 
 
 They both darted forward. The moon had sunk 
 in clouds, the stars were few, the pavement broken, 
 and their steps uncertain. Still the Commodore at- 
 tained the object of his pursuit. It was an old mule 
 grazing on the scanty herbage which sprang up 
 among the ruins. 
 
 “ This is a most ludicrous adventure !” said the 
 Commodore ; “ and we had better terminate it by 
 returning to our inn and our supper.”

 Butteyant was the last stage which the travellers 
 had agreed to pass together ; and whether a feeling 
 of regret attended this conviction, or other causes se- 
 cretly operated to protract their departure, they left 
 Holycross at an hour comparatively iate, to begin a 
 journey of some distance, through one of the wildest 
 mountain tracts, and least frequented cross roads, in 
 the province of Munster^ 
 
 Their next stage, however, was excellent : it was 
 only to Cashel; and to judge from the group of 
 sturdy fellows who lurked about the door of the inn, 
 to which the travellers were driven, that town 'was 
 not without its due portion of idlers — a natural cir- 
 cumstance in the capital of a grazing county. As the 
 chaise stopped, the gentlemen were looking over 
 their travelling map. They had marked out their 
 route by the road-book, and had chosen the most pic- 
 turesque, rather, perhaps, than the best line of pro- 
 gress. To cross the elevated chain of the Galtees, 
 they had selected the road by Gaul Bally (the town 
 of the Gauls or Celts), with its monastic ruins, in pre- 
 ference to the Glen of Agherlow, a valley on the op-

 posite side of the mountains, which, though it would 
 have lengthened their route, would have presented a 
 more beaten track. Whichever way they took, the 
 driver assured them that they would reach Buttevant 
 by sunset, “ God'willing, and barring accident.” 
 
 As they descended, therefore, from their carriage, 
 they ordered a chaise and horses for Gaul Bally, to 
 be ready against their return from the Rock.* 
 
 “ Certainly, sir,” said the landlord,! slightly touch- 
 ing his hat, and resuming his conversation with a 
 man-of-business-looking person, who was talking to 
 him at the door. “ Barney, a chaise on to Gaul Bally.” 
 Barney, having taken due time to consume a por- 
 tion of tobacco, called out in his turn to a driver near 
 him, “Tim, honey, just call out a chay to Gaul Bally.” 
 Tim, who was seated on the steps of a horse-post, 
 playing with a large dog, addressed himself to a blind 
 beggar, with “ Step into the yard, and tell Corney 
 Doolin a chay’s wanting to Gaul Bally.” 
 
 “ What is the distance to Gaul Bally ?” asked the 
 Commodore, who, as well as his fellow-traveller, had 
 observed the progress of these deputed orders with 
 impatience and irritation. 
 
 “ What is the distance to Gaul Bally ?” returned 
 the landlord with sang-froid, as he now first observed 
 them : “ upon my word and reputation, sir, I can’t

 f As inns, in common with the royal caravanseras of the east- 
 ern apologue, are subject to a frequent change of masters, it is 
 probable that some such revolution has occurred at the inn at 
 Cashel since these events took place : at least, the author has no 
 reason to charge its present occupants with incivility.

 Bay — -that is really, — Gaul Bally. Barney, can you 
 answer these gentlemen ?” 
 
 “ Och, sir, shure you don’t post to Gaul Bally at all, 
 at all : there’s no posting there, sir, nor wasn’t many 
 a year. If the gentlemen bes going to Doneraile or 
 Buttevant, they’d best go the low road, and take the 
 Glen of Agherlow to Mitchelstown.” 
 
 “ We are resolved not to take any road but that 
 we’ve fixed on ; and I suppose we can have a chaise 
 and horses to what stage and place we choose, no 
 matter where, if we pay for them.” 
 
 This observation, made with haughtiness and petu- 
 lance by Mr. De Yere, induced the landlord to un- 
 cover his head, and to reply : “ Certainly, sir : if you 
 indemnify me, sir, I can let you have every accom- 
 modation in life ; up to the top of Mangerton, if you 
 please ; only there is no posting, I give you my word, 
 gentlemen, on these cross roads in Munster : that is, 
 I don’t send out my cattle by the mile ; but you can 
 have them by the job, or day, and welcome.” 
 
 “ Why, then, job or day,” said Barney, with a sig- 
 nificant look at his master, “ if the chay goes by Gaul 
 Bally, it’s on a low-backed car it will come back.” 
 
 “ Shure enough,” said Tim, rubbing round his 
 shoulders, “ and wouldn’t care to be the driver, bar- 
 ring I was well ped, and left my throat behind me, 
 specially near Kilbalogue, the thieves’ wood, down 
 there below.” 
 
 “ I came that way in my gig from Kilfinnon ,” said 
 the man of business, “ and found it good enough, and 
 two dragoons with me.” 
 
 “ Och, then, it behoves you, and the likes of you, 
 Mr. Fogarty,” said Tim, “to look to that, sir; for the

 times never ran so hard against the excise as now : 
 in respect of bringing down the military, and the 
 grate still-hunting, and fining the townlands to ruina- 
 tion. ” 
 
 “ Will you take the chay on to Buttevant, gentle- 
 men ?” asked the innkeeper. 
 
 “ To Buttevant, certainly — perhaps further,” re- 
 plied the younger traveller. 
 
 “ I don’t think I could give it under seven or eight 
 guineas a day,” he returned, musing ; “ but I’ll let 
 you know in a minute ;” and he entered the house, 
 followed by Tim, Barney, and the exciseman, to hold 
 a council. 
 
 “ Eight guineas a day ! sorrow send it to you, Mr. 
 Collogon ! — eight guineas ! Dioul ! !” 
 
 This apostrophe was made by a person who leaned 
 against the back of the strangers chaise. He was 
 wrapped in a huge frieze coat, wore a slouched hat 
 over a grey wig, and stood slashing a long cutting 
 ■whip against the pavement. When, however, he 
 perceived the travellers proceeded towards the Rock 
 of Cashel without noticing him, he followed them, 
 touched his hat, and said, “ I’ll drive your honors to 
 Buttevant, and that to your hearts’ contint, for half 
 the money, and has as illigant a chay, and as nate a 
 pair of mountain cattle as any in Condon’s country ; 
 and keeps myself, your honor, hard by, convanient 
 to Buttevant, near Kilcolman, sir, and runs my ga- 
 rans on my own account, and came with a fare to 
 Cashel, the day before yesterday, and was waiting 
 for a return, your honor, which would sarve me en- 
 tirely, sir.”

 “ Do you know the route well through the 
 
 Galtees ?” 
 
 “Do I, is it, sir? Och! maybe I don’t, and would 
 go it my lone blindfold from Galtimore to Mizen- 
 head; and from Knockmelldown to the Reeks in 
 Killarney ; and that’s a brave step, sir.” 
 
 “ I should like to disappoint that nonchalant host 
 of the Star, and his imposing driver,” said the elder 
 traveller. 
 
 “ And this man residing near Kilcolman,” said the 
 younger, “ has a classical interest with me. I shall 
 probably engage him while I reside in the neighbor- 
 hood of Spenser’s fairy ground.” 
 
 The bargain was instantly made, and the chaise 
 ordered to be at the inn-door in half an hour, the 
 time assigned to visit King Cormac’s Chapel. . Mean- 
 time, the master of the Kilcolman chaise undertook 
 to inform the host of the Star that his horses would 
 not be wanting; and when the travellers returned 
 from their antiquarian visit they found all ready for 
 their departure. 
 
 While the light luggage was removing into the 
 new vehicle, the appearance of that vehicle, its 
 horses and driver, was a source of affected entertain- 
 ment to the disappointed landlord and his satellites. 
 
 “ Barney, that’s a nate article of a chay,” observed 
 Tim. “Troth, I would not wonder if it was ould 
 Cormac MacColeman’s travelling landau when he 
 went the pilgrimage to Holycross.” 
 
 “ Faith, Tim, lad, you’re not much out, I believe ; 
 for there’s a crown on it, shure enough, which shows, 
 it belonged to th’ ould kings of Munster, anyhow 
 King Fiann or Brian Borru, maybe.”

 “ Why, then, for all that, Barney, I wisht I had all 
 the chickens that ever was hatched in it, grand as it 
 is. And look at the garans* sir ; och ! but they’re 
 grate bastes and warranted not to draw. I’ll engage 
 they’d rather die than run, and no ways skittish, 
 that’s certain, anyway.” 
 
 The owner of this equipage, against which so many 
 sarcasms were launched, was hitherto coolly rubbing 
 down his horses with a wisp of straw, and singing, 
 or rather humming, 
 
 “ I’m a rake and a rambling boy, 
 
 My lodgings ’tis near Aughnaghcloy.” 
 
 He now paused, however, to observe, “ The cattle’s 
 shurely not so fine as them was shot in the mail, near 
 Kihvorth, Mr. Barney Hefiernan, but they are good 
 mountain cattle, for all that, and will take the gentle- 
 men better through the Galtees, and safer too, than 
 handsomer bastes, plaze Jasus !” 
 
 The former part of this observation had caused a 
 very obvious revulsion in the color of Mr. Hefiernan’s 
 face, who, drawing some straws from between the 
 wheels of the chaise, said, in a conciliating voice, 
 “ I’m glad to see you about the world again, Owny— 
 when did you set up driver ?” 
 
 “A little after the tithe-proctor’s business in the 
 murdering glen below, in the county of Waterford,” 
 replied Owny, significantly. 
 
 Barney Hefiernan slunk away, and no further sar- 
 casm was launched against Owny’s “ set-out ,” which 
 both the gentlemen stood for some minutes examin- 
 ing with curiosity ; the Commodore wiping with his

 handkerchief the dust from the panel on which the 
 coronet, alluded to by the drivers, was visible, sur- 
 mounting a defaced crest and armorial bearing. The 
 chaise was indeed of a very singular and antique 
 build; low, angular, with a projecting roof. The 
 large windows, which once perhaps entitled it to the 
 appellation of a glass coach, were now partly filled up 
 with wooden panels ; and through the rents of the 
 coarse check modern lining, remnants of crimson 
 velvet, and rich, but threadbare, livery lace, spoke 
 its former gentility. The travellers had proceeded 
 some miles from Cashel, in a silence which the 
 younger seemed little inclined to break, when the* 
 falling down of an old green silk blind roused him 
 from his reverie. 
 
 “ This curious old vehicle,” he observed, “ doubtless 
 belonged to some noble family. Did you perceive a 
 baron’s coronet on the side panel, and a crest beneath 
 it?” 
 
 Yes, a dexter arm, issuing out of a cloud, and 
 holding a naked sword, all proper, with the motto, 
 Vigueur de dessus — the cognizance and motto of some 
 N orman adventurer, who formerly ravished this coun- 
 try, and who, like more modern victors, took the 
 sanction of heaven for their deeds of violence, and 
 believed, or affected to believe, that, “Dim est 
 toujour s 'pour les gros bataillons .” 
 
 “ It is the motto and crest of the Fitzadelm family, 
 of the present Marquis of Dunore, the representative 
 of that family,” said de Vere. 
 
 A silence of a few minutes followed this observa- 
 tion, and the Commodore then carelessly added — 
 “ The Fitzadelms ! a branch of the far-spreading

 Geraldines? Yes, they got their portion of this fair 
 province by grant from Henry the Second, to whom 
 they were sewers, as the Ormond family were butlers ; 
 and shared with Hamo de Valois, Philip of Wor- 
 cester, William de Barri, and other Norman adven- 
 turers, the princely palatinates of the Macarthies 
 More, once chiefs or kings of Desmond.” 
 
 “ It is in the order of things,” said de Vere coolly. 
 
 “ Oh ! exactly ; the 1 vigueur de dessusj which may 
 be translated c might, not right,’ has been the same 
 in all ages ; but it is peculiarly prominent in the con- 
 quest of Ireland ; the causes of Ireland’s misfortunes 
 ’are so deep-seated, that every page in her history is 
 a palliation of her faults : for the gravest errors of 
 the people will be found in the misrule of her gov- 
 ernment.” 
 
 “ Better governed, she would be more prosperous,” 
 said the young traveller, “ and less interesting and 
 less amusing. As it is, she is c melancholy and gen- 
 tlemanlike,’ a thing to make one laugh and cry in a 
 breath.” 
 
 “ Them is the Galtees, plaze your honor,” said the 
 driver, “ among the clouds. There, sir, not a moun- 
 tain in the province will bate them, anyhow, let alone 
 Mangerton.” 
 
 “ They are, indeed, truly respectable mountains for 
 this little island,” said the young traveller, directing 
 his glance to a range of bold, romantic, perpendicular 
 acclivities, whose conic pinnacles were lost in the 
 clouds, and whose dark stupendous range might 
 have formed a natural and impregnable boundary be- 
 tween rival and contending states. 
 
 At the village of Gaul Bally they found only the

 ruins of some religious houses, a barrack, and a little 
 shebeen house, where the driver stopped for a few 
 minutes to refresh his horses and himself. They soon 
 recommenced their mountain journey, doubling a 
 formidable ridge, and ascending a gentle acclivity, 
 while the driver, almost throwing the reins upon the 
 horses’ necks, sat with his arms folded, and recom- 
 menced, for the twentieth time since they had left 
 Cashel, 
 
 “ The groves of Blarney, they are so charming.” 
 
 “ This will never do,” said the Commodore, letting 
 down the front glass. “ Why, my friend, your horses 
 seem tired already.” 
 
 “ They do, plaze yer honor,” was the cool reply. 
 “And do you know the raison of that same, sir? 
 Why, then, it’s because they’re on level ground, sir, 
 sorrow a fhing else ails them. Och ! the craturs are 
 kind andHazy, like myself, and quite untractable to a 
 smooth level plain ; but w r ait till, yez gets up among 
 the glens and precipices. It’s then, sir, you w r ill see 
 them bate the reg’lar posters, why ! entirely ; for they 
 knows the wa rs of the place, and little fear for the 
 chay being left in smithereens,* on the top of a rock, 
 there, or at the bottom of that hollow, down in the 
 Divil’s Glin to your lift, sir.” 
 
 “ It’s very evident,” said the Commodore, “that 
 this fellow r is as untractable as his horses. There is a 
 dogged indifference about him, a good-humored per- 
 tinacity of manner, with wdiich it would clearly be in 
 vain to contend ; it were best, therefore, to leave him 
 to his song and his waywardness.”

 “ Oh ! I hold no contention with travelling contin- 
 gencies,” replied De Yere; “ through life, as through 
 a journey, the 1 Laissez-aller' is my device. Who 
 would take the trouble, if even willing, when a pebble 
 under your chaise wheel may set volition at nought ? 
 Who would contend with accidents and events, un- 
 certain and incalculable as the elements on which they 
 so often depend ?” 
 
 “ This is a fine road, your honors,” said the driver, 
 breaking off his song abruptly, and applying his re- 
 mark to a rude, rough, narrow acclivity, moss-grown 
 and torrent-worn, and becoming every moment more 
 difficult of ascent. “ Balleagh-na-Tierna ’tis called, in 
 respect of being cut across the side of the Galtees by 
 the Tierna-Dhu, that is the Black Baron, as they 
 named him in his own country here below.” 
 
 “ Black Baron !” said De Yere; “that sounds w^ell 
 among these wild scenes. Does the Black Baron live 
 in these mountains, friend ?” 
 
 “ He does, sir ; that’s he did, but he’s dead, sir, and 
 doing bravely these twenty years and more, and so is 
 his brother Tierna-Ruadh, the Red Baron, that fol- 
 lowed him, whose son is now the Marquis Dunore ! 
 divil set his foot after them all, for it’s little good ever 
 they did the country yet, them Fitzadelms !” (5.) 
 
 The two travellers, as if moved by the same mecha- 
 nical impulse, started, leaned forward, and then sunk 
 back in the chaise — “ At least,” said the elder, “ it was 
 doing good to cut a road through this wild region, 
 friend.” 
 
 “Sorrow much then, sir, anyhow; in respect of 
 never finishing it, no more nor that inn there, fore- 
 nent you to the left.” Here the driver pointed to the

 77 
 
 ruins of some dreary walls, whicli added to the deso- 
 lateness of the scene. 
 
 “ This Balleagh, I heard tell, was to join the low 
 road, and was made in a great hurry, to have a short 
 cut for the Lord Lieutenant, and the quality that 
 came down in oceans from Dublin to the stage plays 
 at Court Fitzadelm ; and the inn was to bait at ; for, 
 barring Lis-na-sleugh, sorrow baiting place in the 
 Galtees at all, at all ; and that was no place for quality 
 to stop in.” 
 
 “ What an heterogeneous association of images !” 
 said the Commodore; “ mountain regions and private 
 theatricals ! A poor Irish lord beginning a work fit 
 for an emperor, and leaving it unfinished, a monu- 
 ment of his uncalculating extravagance, of that wild- 
 ness and refinement, that uncivilized dissipation, which 
 characterized the provincial nobility of Ireland fifty 
 years back, and arose from the degradation in which 
 they were held.” 
 
 “ Oh, it’s delicious !” replied De Yere. “I should 
 like to know how the descendant or representative 
 of these noble Fitzadelms would feel, in thus acci- 
 dentally hearing what we have now heard, and seeing 
 what we see.” 
 
 “ If he was a vain man, flattered and spoiled by 
 fortune,” replied the Commodore, emphatically, “ he 
 
 would feel deep mortification ; but if he were” he 
 
 paused abruptly, and demanded of the driver : “Does 
 Court Fitzadelm lie in the neighborhood of these 
 mountains ?” 
 
 “ It does, sir, fifteen miles off, in the valley, down 
 below, between the Galtees and Gotroes, and the Bal- 
 li-Howries, cribbed round with them, and the beauti-

 ful Avon Florae, or ‘ fair water,’ running under the 
 castle bawn, — that's all that’s left of it, sir. For sure 
 after the lord’s death, it was broken up into smithe- 
 reens, and scarce a skreed* of it left to the fore.” 
 
 “ And who has carried it away ?” asked De Vere. 
 
 “ Why, Darby Crawley has, sir, and his father be- 
 fore him, ould Pat ; and hasn’t left a taste, but what’s 
 in their own hands this day. And the chay your 
 honor’s driving in, shure it was from him ’twas bought, 
 at the auction. Troth, and if the young lord that got 
 the title, or his brother was in it, they’d be entirely 
 amazed to see their crown and arms running the road 
 this day, that’s the Galtees, sir.” 
 
 To this observation the travellers made no rejoinder. 
 The horses now toiled slowly and painfully up a road 
 which every moment became more steep and laborious. 
 On either side, the mountain scenery opened into in- 
 creasing wildness and sublimity. Innumerable defiles 
 boldly diverged to ascending regions, while altitudes 
 still greater, blue, misty, and cloud-capped, terminated 
 these natural vistas. The ascent had now become so 
 steep and dangerous, that the travellers had not only 
 alighted, but were frequently obliged to assist in lift- 
 ing the chaise over deep ruts, cut by the torrents, but 
 which the driver simply called “ sore bits.” He fre- 
 quently assured them that a little further on, a small 
 quarter of a mile, the lord’s Balleagh would come 
 down upon the Cloghniah-Cluain, the “ lurking place 
 of the noisy water” (a torrent he affected every mo- 
 ment to hear), and then they would be upon the low 
 road, which would bring them on the high posting 
 road to Doneraile and Buttevant.

 Obliged to pin their faith upon a guide of whom 
 they now began to entertain seme suspicion, the 
 travellers beheld one small quarter of a mile succeed 
 to another, and heard and lost repeatedly the fall of 
 many dashing torrents, until, as they ascended among 
 the romantic elevations of the Galtees, they lost sight 
 of the inconvenience and tediousness of their journey, 
 in admiration of the scenery. They even permitted 
 the horses to halt in a narrow glen, while they pro- 
 ceeded to examine regions, where nature reigned in 
 all her wildest magnificence ; and they ascended from 
 one commanding altitude to another, till th$ whole 
 stupendous chain of mountains broke gradually upon 
 them, spreading far and wide in bold fantastic forms, 
 and in the utmost freedom of outline. 
 
 As the travellers stood thus occupied at the point 
 of a bold cliff, they suddenly perceived a shadow 
 thrown from their precipitous station, intercepting 
 the blood red beams of the now setting sun, and 
 turning quickly round, they observed a man so close 
 to them, that by a single effort he might have hurled 
 the incautious wanderers down the abyss they had, a 
 moment before, shuddered to contemplate. He had 
 a bold, strongly defined, but light and flexible figure, 
 not much set off by a ragged frieze jacket : his neck 
 was scarcely covered by a loosely tied red handker- 
 chief. In his countenance there was a look of min- 
 gled carelessness and intrepidity, of gaiety and acute- 
 ness, which is so often discernible in the Irish physiog- 
 nomy. His hat worn gallantly on one side, his light 
 arch blue eye and curly hair, gave to his whole ap- 
 pearance something of rustic foppery, mingled \rifh 
 an hardy daringness, that was peculiarly chara$Pms-

 tic. This unexpected apparition in a scene so lonely, 
 amazed without alarming the travellers. When the 
 man asked, with a sort of triumphant laugh, “ Doesn’t 
 your honors know me, then? Shure, a’nt I your 
 driver, sirs, that drove you from Cashel in the Kil- 
 coleman chay, below, in the hollow there.” 
 
 This information rather increased than lessened the 
 surprise his appearance excited. “ Only,” he conti- 
 nued, “ that I threw off my cotamore* in regard of 
 the heat and wishing to climb the mountain after 
 you, I changed my old wig and caubeen for this bit of 
 a straw hat, sir, that I keeps under the chay sate for 
 warm weather, why.” 
 
 “ But with such a profusion of hair, why do you 
 wear a wig ?” asked the Commodore. 
 
 “ Och ! becaise, your honor, it was my ould father’s 
 before me, sir,f — God rest him” — and he crossed him- 
 self devoutly. 
 
 This mode of accounting for a disguise, more of 
 air and manner, even than of dress, amused, but by 
 no means satisfied the travellers ; and secretly con- 
 vinced that he had some motive for concealing his 
 person in Cashel, they accompanied him in silence 
 back to the spot where he had left the chaise and 
 horses. As they descended the declivities, De Yere 
 observed, “ This is what Shakespeare calls 1 a fine, 
 gay, bold-faced villain:’ I should like to know his 
 object in bewildering us in these mountains.”

 <l If he has any,” replied the Commodore, careless- 
 ly, “ it must soon discover itself.” 
 
 On reaching the hollow, they were surprised and 
 mortified to find that the daylight, which still linger- 
 ed in tints of purple and gold on the summits of the 
 mountains, had faded away from their valleys. 
 
 “ Yez may step in now, gentlemen,” said the driver : 
 “ we have a smooth piece afore us for half a mile, and 
 then we turn into Cloghnaigh-Cluain, and will he on 
 the top of Doneraile in no time.” 
 
 “We are quite aware that is utterly impossible,” 
 said the Commodore, decisively, as he got into the 
 chaise ; “ but go on as rapidly as possible ; we should 
 not like to be benighted in these mountains ; indeed, 
 we are resolved not to be so.” 
 
 “ Och ! sorrow fear, your honor, anyhow, of that 
 shure : isn’t there an illegant fine moon ? and if the 
 worst goes to the worst, is not there the mountain- 
 house Lis-na-sleugh , at the foot of the Galtees, and 
 the best of entertainment there for man and baste.” 
 
 “ No,” replied the Commodore in the same tone of 
 cool decision, “we must reach Doneraile or Butte- 
 vant to-night, except we ourselves change our minds, 
 as we proceed.” 
 
 “ Which we shall not do,” whispered his compa- 
 nion, “ and yet, perhaps, shall be necessitated to take 
 up our night’s abode in this mountain-house he 
 talks of.” 
 
 They had in the course of an hour reached the long 
 promised turn to Cloghnaigh-Cluain : but the road, 
 though it was a rapid descent, far from improving, 
 became every moment more impracticable, as the 
 twilight grew more obscure. The driver, at last,

 after a violent jolt, which threatened dislocation to 
 the joints of the crazy vehicle, suddenly stopped his- 
 horses, and coming up to the chaise window, asked, 
 
 “ Yez would not have such a thing as a crooked nail 
 about ye, plaze your honors ?” 
 
 The Commodore replied in the negative, half 
 laughingly, though with feelings of annoyance, arising 
 partly from suspicion of the man’s intentions, and > 
 partly from impatience of delay in such a place, and 
 at such a time. 
 
 u Why then, murther alive, -what’s this for ?” ex- 
 claimed the driver, scratching his head ; “ the fore 
 wheel oft^ and not a bit of a nail for a lineh pin ; and 
 the spring broke, too, and not a taste of rope to tie it 
 up with.” 
 
 “ This is a pleasant adventure,” said the younger 
 traveller, throwing himself back in the chaise ; while 
 the elder jumping out, examined into the accident : — 
 the spring was broken, the wheel was off. 
 
 “ This is no accident,” he'said, turning abruptly to- 
 the driver : “ the Finch pin of this wheel has been 
 drawn out purposely.” 
 
 “ It has, sir?” he reiterated with simplicity. “ See 
 that, now ! why then, I wonder who would be after 
 doing that same ; if it wouldn’t be your honors, out 
 of sport, sir. But sorrow much matter, anyhow ; I'd 
 as soon drive your honors with three wheels as four, 
 and did from Cork to Kil worth : that’s Father Mur- 
 phy, sir; and the wheel will just slip in the front of 
 the chay, fair and aisy, I’ll be bound. 
 
 “ But that’s not the worst of it,” he continued coolly, 
 endeavoring to force the wheel into the chaise on one 
 side, while Mr, Be Vere jumped out at the other;

 I « we've taken the wrong turn, it seems, entirely ; for 
 that Cloghnaigh bates the world, in respect of con- 
 trariness ; and when I thought we were in on it, isnit 
 it here the ‘ wolf’s track’ we’ve slipped into ? Dioul !” 
 “ You are to remember,” said the Commodore, 
 ^vhile his companion was enjoying a rapid combina- 
 tim of every real, fancied, or possible danger, “ you 
 I aid us you were well acquainted with the road ?” 
 And if I wasn’t, your honor, how would I know 
 that this is the wolfs track ? Och, musha ! the likes 
 of this never happened to me before. Ochone ! 
 here’s your purse, sir, dear, dropped in the hay and 
 he carelessly threw the purse, weighty from contain- 
 ing some golden Spanish coin, into the traveller’s 
 hand; he then continued his lamentation over his mis- 
 take, at the same Lime endeavoring to thrust the fore 
 wheel of the chaise through one of its doors. From 
 his tone of voice, peculiarity of manner, and the care- 
 lessness with which he restored a purse, that in all 
 probability would not have been missed, every suspi- 
 | cion of sinister intention was hushed in the mind of 
 i the Commodore. The younger traveller, however, 
 saw only in the latter circumstance some ruse, beyond 
 the ordinary stratagem of a common robber; and 
 whether he was to be enrolled among a band of Shan- 
 1 avests, or stripped and plundered for the benefit of 
 the Caravats, were circumstances debated in his mind, 
 under the influence of many romantic associations ap- 
 propriate to the scene and hour. Meantime, as the 
 driver assured them, that though they had not taken 
 the best or the shortest road, they were still making 
 their way out of the mountains, they continued to 
 walk in advance of the chaise, without further re-

 proach ; while the driver, leading his horses, reconi- f 
 menced his song, which he only interrupted to point 
 "cmt a stone cross under the cliff, that he called the 
 “ Hag’s Bed;” and to notice some other features in 
 the scene, characteristic of its wildness; thus evincing 9 
 that his boasted acquaintance with the mountains f 
 was not an unfounded vaunt. 
 
 With that sudden change of temperature incident® 
 to mountain regions, the air had become intensely 
 cold ; and through the increasing darkness of the evtki- 
 ing, they hailed with pleasure a long level ray iof 
 light, which assured them of their approximation to 
 some human abode; perhaps a forge, where they 
 might have their chaise wheel reinstated ; and they 
 suggested this possibility to the driver. “ A forge,” 
 he replied, “ then that’s the great luck, for if there’s a 
 forge, ye can put the night over at Lis-na-sleugh : 
 there’s not a forge in the Galtees round, barring the 
 forge of Lis-na-sleugh, where there’s the best of fine 
 entertainment, as I hear tell, that’s if the chay can’t 
 be mended, and yez don't care to get on by moonlight 
 to Buttevant, which yez may after all, plaze God.” 
 
 As they proceeded, the light had frequently ap- 
 peared and disappeared ; but as their descent became 
 less rapid, and they advanced more deeply into the 
 valley, it assumed a more steady beam ; and the out- 
 line of a small building became visible, amidst a mass 
 of darkly defined objects. On approaching they per- 
 ceived it was a little sash window, which emitted the 
 red light of a blazing turf fire ; and a volume pf white 
 curling smoke, issuing from an aperture in the roof, 
 stained the deep dark blue of the atmosphere with 
 fleecy forms. The moon just showed her edge above

 the horizon, and more strongly defined the position 
 of the building, which occupied part of a little plain, 
 f forming a point of termination to four cross-roads, 
 ^ branching off round the base of the mountains. Those 
 they had crossed appeared to rise almost to the clouds 
 f behind them; and of the many waterfalls which 
 dashed from the neighboring rocks, one fell close to 
 ^he rear of the cottage, dwindling into a rill, and 
 forming a little horse-pool in its front. A light under 
 a shed at a short distance showed some horses feed- 
 ing. A bunch of mountain heather suspended over 
 the door, but, above all, a post-chaise drawn up be- 
 fore it (which seemed, by its position, to have re- 
 cently arrived by one of the low roads), designated 
 this wild and remote edifice as an inn. This idea was 
 confirmed by a smar^ crack of the whip, with which 
 the driver brought up his weary horses, and by his 
 taking off his hat to the gentlemen, and exclaiming, 
 with a courteous bow : 
 
 “ Why, then, long life to yez ! yez are welcome to 
 Lis-na-sleugh !” 
 
 “ So,” said De Yere, “I thought so. This, how- 
 ever, is wizard scenery, and one may compound for 
 a little inconvenience or even danger to enjoy it.” 
 
 The approach of the carriage had brought out from 
 the ahed, which served as a stable, a lame beggar, 
 who officiated as hostler, and a ragged boy, who ap- 
 peared as the substitute for a waiter. 
 
 “ Here, baccah mavourneen,”* said the driver, who 
 was now once more muffled in his cotamore, his wig, 
 and old caubeen. “Take off them cattle for me, 
 
 * Baccah, a cripple. All lame and deformed beggars are 
 called baccahs in Ireland.

 while I show the gentleman into the place. Comey 
 my gasso.on, lend me the rush,” and he snatched the 
 light out of the boy’s hand. “ This way, your ho- 
 nors ; take care of the sow, sir ; there’s a bit of a 
 strame, sir. Widow Gaffney, Ma’am, where are you 
 agrah ? Oh ! here’s the mistress herself. I’ll trouble. 
 Ma’am, to look after the gentlemen, while I give a 
 squint at th’ other bastes.” 
 
 The hostess took the light from him, and he joined 
 the driver of the newly-arrived chaise, who was ad- 
 journing from the house to the stable. The Widow ♦ 
 Gaffney, with many smiles and courtesies, led the 
 guests from the dark little stone passage, which sepa- 
 rated the kitchen clouded with smoke from another 
 small room distinguished by its plank flooring, ex- 
 claiming, as she moved before them, “ Och ! but your 
 honors is welcome, sirs. It’s a sharp night to cross 
 the mountains, and will have a sod kindled in the 
 chimbley, sirs, if yez are going to stay past the cattle’s 
 taking their lock of hay, gintlemin.” 
 
 * As she spoke she lighted, or endeavored to light, a 
 miserable candle, which stood in a dirty brass candle- 
 stick on a shelf over the chimney. While thus en- 
 gaged, the yellow flickering light fell full on her face, 
 and drew her sharp, but handsome features, her deep 
 sallow complexion, and black bright eyes, into strong 
 relief. A red kerchief was tied round her head in the 
 Munster fashion ; and the rest of her tall, slight, bony 
 form was hidden in shade.* 
 
 The strangers withdrew their eyes from the figure 
 of the landlady to the apartment into which she had

 the female peasantry of Munster.

 ushered them. Its whitewashed walls were partially 
 covered with those pious prints which are hawked 
 about for sale in the remotest parts of Ireland. The 
 history of many a saint, the sufferings of many a 
 martyr, were here detailed in bright vermilion and 
 yellow ochre ; and angels and devils, hymns and 
 homilies, were mingled promiscuously with the ama- 
 tory history of “ Cool endas ,’ “ Croothenamcc the 
 “ Connaught daisy,” bloody and barbarous murders, 
 and a favorite song, called “ JMa chere amie ,” as sung 
 by Mrs. Billington. 
 
 A deal table in the centre of the room was still 
 covered with some little pewter vessels, and two 
 glasses with wooden bottoms. The hearth was stuff- 
 ed with withered heath ; and the atmosphere of the 
 room, from which all ventilation was excluded, was 
 impregnated with the fumes of whiskey. The 
 younger traveller, holding his perfumed handkerchief 
 to his nose, asked if there was no other apartment 
 they could occupy, while their horses were feeding, 
 and their chaise mending* 
 
 “Och! blessed Virgin,” said the hostess, wiping 
 down the tabic with her apron, “ this is the con- 
 trariest day ever rose on me ! Weeks we’d be, God 
 help us, and not a chay, or sign of quality come the 
 road ; and now, becaise it's the fair of Kiltish, and the 
 world’s in on upon us, here’s two po-chaises, and not 
 a sowl to help me, only the baccah, and my own little 
 garlagh of a boy.” 
 
 “ We should be glad to go anywhere, where there’s 
 a fire,” said the Commodore, “the kitchen for in- 
 stance.” 
 
 “Qch! your honor, that would be a poor place for

 the likes of you ; but if you would demean yourself 
 to step into it, while I kindle a sod here, and ready the 
 place, and takes down these brusheens .” 
 
 As she now began to raise a very unpleasant dust 
 by removing the bushes from the hearth, the gentle- 
 men walked at once to the kitchen. 
 
 The little inn of Lis-na-sleugh, or the house of the 
 mountain, was the genuine type of all such inns in the 
 remote cross-roads, or mountain ways in Ireland ; and 
 the kitchen, as is usual in such places, was equally the 
 receptacle of the guest and the beggar ; of those who 
 could, and those who could not, pay for a temporary 
 shelter. The earthen floor of this hospitable apart- 
 ment was undulating and broken : a low mud wall, 
 with an aperture in it to see through, screened the fire- 
 place from the door ; and the capacious hearth, lined 
 with a stone bench, afforded a comfortable retreat to 
 the chilled or wearied traveller. It was now occupied 
 by a haggard, worn-out looking person, who repeat- 
 edly drank from a noggin of water beside him. Above 
 the bright clear fire of mountain turf, built upon the 
 floor, hung suspended an immense iron caldron filled 
 with potatoes, not boiling, but boiled, and drying (5). 
 In an angle of the kitchen, over a three-legged table 
 and a little pewter vessel filled with whiskey, sat two 
 travellers; one of them, by the pack which lay at his 
 feet, a peddler ; the other, ill-looking and poorly clad : 
 both were earnestly conversing in Irish. Beside the 
 fire, on an old settle, were seated two females: one 
 with her long Irish frieze cloak, and the hood drawn 
 over her face, exhibited her warmly mittened hands 
 to the fire, towards which she was turned. The other, 
 stately and erect, her round figure covered in an old-

 fashioned travelling cloak, and her head enveloped in 
 that curious coeffure , made and called after the head of 
 a French carriage, and not many years back worn in 
 Ireland under the name of a calesh. From the super- 
 iority of their appearance, they were assigned by the 
 strangers to the chaise, which stood at the door on 
 their arrival, and seemed just to have preceded them. 
 
 As the gentlemen stood before the fire conversing 
 in Spanish on the incidents of their journey, calculat- 
 ing upon the probabilities of the future, and making 
 observations on all that surrounded them, the widow 
 having lighted a fire in the best room, returned to 
 await the dispersion of the smoke it occasioned. She 
 leaned indolently over a table, with her hands wrapped 
 in her apron, or, as she called it, her praskeen ; and she 
 cast a glance of curiosity, directed alternately at her 
 guests, in anxious hope that they would call for some 
 refreshment. None, however, was demanded, until the 
 entrance of Owney, the driver, broke the spell; for 
 he addressed her with— 
 
 “You wouldn’t have such a thing as a cuppan * of 
 parliament in the house, Mrs. Gaffney ?'’ 
 
 “ Och ! then, if I w^ould not have that, what would 
 I have, sir ? when I souled the bed from under me to 
 pay the license ; and would be sorry to see the barony 
 fined, after the murther we had in the mountains about 
 old Sullivan’s still, last week, and the waylaying of the 
 exciseman, and two men and one soger kilt in the 
 action. Since the attempt at a rescue made for the 
 Rabragh, never was known the likes in the province 
 of Ulster, many a day.” 
 
 Mrs. Gaffney was helping the driver to a little ves- 
 
 * Cuppan, a little cup.— Parliament, that is, licensed whiskey.

 gel of licensed whiskey, which he had termed a dtp* 
 pan of parliament, when the ill-looking man, who sat 
 tlte-'14Me with the peddler, asked : 
 
 “ What’s gone of the Rabragh, I wonder.?” ■ 
 
 “ Och ! sir, he’s about the world agaki, I hear tell,” 
 replied the landlady, “ though never saw him, ’bove 
 all the boys of the county. They say the Ban-Tierna* 
 had him released from prison last assizes twelve- 
 month, and went herself to the judges at Tipperary, 
 in regard of her being his foster-sister.” 
 
 “ Long may she reign,” exclaimed the ill-looking 
 man : “ for she’s a fine woman, and the poor man’s 
 friend. Here’s may she live a thousand years,” and 
 he tossed off a glass of spirits. 
 
 “ Amen,” said the driver, moving his hat reveren- 
 tially as he pledged the to&st, in a voice tremulous 
 with emotion. 
 
 “I drink to her in water, wishing it was wine,” 
 said the poor man in the chimney corner : “ for I 
 come from the land where her forefathers reigned. 
 “ Here’s to the Countess of Clancare.” 
 
 “ Why, then, if this were the last drop I had in 
 the world,” said the driver, drawing his hat over his 
 face, as he advanced in the light, “ you shall go my 
 halves in it and he presented what remained in his 
 cuppan to the water-drinker, who, swallowing it 
 eagerly, observed : 
 
 “ That’s the first bit or sup passed my lips the day, 
 barring a dry potato and a draught of water; and 
 came all the ways from the barony of Dunkerron, 
 
 * Ban-Tierna, the female chief ; literally, the woman of the 
 chief, or noblewoman. This epithet is occasionally applied to 
 the female representative of a noble house.

 district of Clancare in Kerry, over bog and moun- 
 tain, to sell my little bit of an hobby* at the fair of 
 Kiltishy to pay the rent of the shed I break my heart 
 under.” 
 
 “ Why, then, is that hobby with the saddle yours, 
 sir ?” asked the driver. 
 
 “ She is,” said the poor man, sighing, “ to my sor- 
 row : and a finer bit of a baste for bog or mountain 
 journey doesn’t breathe, for all I m carrying her 
 back with me this night ; and offered her for a thirty 
 shilling Cork note and a pair of brogues to a hawker 
 this morning.” 
 
 “ Why, then, sir, see here,” said the driver, in a 
 voice full of compassion — u If I had the money my- 
 self, I’d take her off your hands the night, if it was 
 only to hire her out by the job to travellers, and to 
 sarve you into the bargain, God help you.” 
 
 “ Then purchase her for me,” said the Commodore, 
 who, with his companion, had stood listening to this 
 local and desultory conversation, uttered in an accent 
 so strange to their ears as not always to be compre- 
 hended. p The bargain was soon struck, and the owner 
 of the hobby, with eyes streaming with joy, and a 
 tongue profuse in gratitude, received a small sum 
 over the price he had demanded. 
 
 “ I believe,” said the elder stranger, addressing him 
 as he counted out his money, “ at least I have read or 
 heard, that your barony of Dunkerron was famous 
 for this small breed of horses ?” B 
 
 * The little hobbies of this country are the most proper to 
 travel through it ; and a man must abandon himself entirely to 
 their guidance, which will answer much better than if one should 
 strive to manage and direct their steps.

 u And is so, yonr honor, to this day ; and that’s all 
 it is famous for now, barring St. Crohan’s Cell, the 
 patron saint of the barony, hewn out of the solid rock 
 with his own hands.” 
 
 The Commodore leant his head eagerly forward, 
 and in a peculiar tone of voice, said, “ And under the 
 hill of Kilcrohan there stands — there did stand, a 
 small, ancient building, commanding the bay of Ken- * 
 mare, once a friary.” 
 
 “I know it well, your honor; the chapelry of 
 Glinsky, the school-house of Terence Oge O’Leary, 
 and is there to this hour, troth.” 
 
 “ To this hour ?” repeated the Commodore in emo- 
 tion. 
 
 “ That’s the ruins of it, your honor. After Measter 
 O’Leary quit the place, nobody cared to take up in 
 it ; and somehow, the times doesn’t favor laming now 
 in Kerry as formerly ; and besides, there was an odd 
 story went about the school-house. I disremember 
 me what now ; and was a slip of a boy then, and 
 went higher up into Clancare — that’s twenty years 
 ago, ay, faith, twenty-two years, since Terence Oge 
 quit the place.” 
 
 “ And more,” said the lame beggar, who was filling 
 a sieve with some oats out of a sort of chest near the 
 hearth. “ I've good right to remember it well, for I 
 was the very man that brought the young lord, that 
 would have been, from Court Fitzadelm to Terence 
 Oge O’Leary’s house, who was his foster-father, and 
 gave him all the learning he got, young gentleman.” 
 
 “ Did you ?” said the Commodore, raising his up- 
 raised arm; then suddenly letting it drop, he asked m

 an altered tone, “ Did you send for a smith to look 
 to our chaise ?” 
 
 “ I did, your honor, and is at it this moment ; and 
 troth I didn’t see that same chaise drive up the night 
 with a dry eye ; for,” he added, turning to the Kerry- 
 man, u it was in that very chaise w T hich my lord 
 brought his elegant bride in, that I afterwards car- 
 ried her son after her death down to Dunkerron to 
 Measter O Leary’s, from whence he never returned, 
 dead or alive.” 
 
 “ That’s the young lord was drowned off the bay 
 of Kenmare, in his own bit of a corragh , and they say 
 haunts the chapelry of Glensky to this hour?” de- 
 manded the Kerryman. 
 
 “ Och ! to my heavy sorrow,” said the mendicant, 
 dropping the vessel he was measuring the corn with, 
 and leaning over the chest, “ that was a sore day for 
 me, sir, for if he was in it this hour it isn’t in this 
 condition I’d be, ould and lame, poor and desolate, 
 and so I tould Measter O Leary last week, who dropt 
 salt tears when he saw me.” 
 
 “ Last week !” reiterated the stranger ; then, with 
 a change of voice, he added, “ Were you in Kerry 
 last week, in Dunkerron ? I am travelling that way, 
 and should like to know the state of the roads.” 
 
 “ I was not, sir, in Kerry, and never put my foot in 
 it since I left the young gentleman there, that's the 
 honorable De Montenay Fitzadelm.” 
 
 “ You said you saw O’Leary there, I thought ?” 
 
 “ It was down in the Peninsula I saw Mr. Terence 
 Oge O’Leary, your honor, and am but just come from 
 it this day.”

 “ The Peninsula !” repeated the Commodore 
 “ where is that ?” 
 
 “ The Peninsula of Dunore, sir, on the other side 
 of the Boggra Mountains, where the Marquis’s Castle 
 is, on the seaside, at the bottom of the country, a 
 lovely fine place.” 
 
 “ I suppose the castle is in ruins ?” observed Mr. 
 De Yere, carelessly — “I mean Dunore Castle.” 
 
 “ Not at all, your honor, but as good as the day it 
 w T as built, every stone of it ; ay, faith, and better ; for 
 sure it was getting ready two years back for the 
 young mad Marquis; but the workmen have been 
 stopped, since he went beside himself: and it would 
 have been his cousin’s that was drowned only for the 
 villainy of the world that banished the cratur to the 
 wilds of Kerry, as Mr. O’Leary says; and no luck 
 could follow them after that, great as they are now.” 
 
 “ I remember that O’Leary when he w T as out of his 
 mind himself,” said the landlady, “ and I a bit of a 
 slip of a girl : he used to be wandering in the moun- 
 ’•%. tains here, and bothering the world with the Macar- 
 thies and the Fitzadelms, and looking for their ould 
 castles in ould places.” 
 
 “ Och, then, he’s brave and hearty now, Mrs. Gaff- 
 ney,” returned the lame hostler, “ and has a fine 
 school in the preceptory of Monaster-ni-oriel. Many 
 thanks to friar Denis O’Sullivan, the superior; for it 
 was he who took him upland preached the devil out 
 of him (for they say he was possessed), and set him 
 down there, snug and aisy, in the friary ; and allows 
 him to let his own apartment to bathers that come 
 to the salt wather when himself s not in it; and, 
 troth, you wouldn’t think, the day, he had put more

 than fifty years over his head, that's Mr. O’Leary, 
 though he’s sixty right out ; for it’s thirty-four years 
 since his wife got the nursing at Count Fitzadelm, 
 and Terence was twenty-six good then, and a brave 
 lump of a poor scholar, when he missed his vocation,* 
 and married Soosheen O’Callaghan.” 
 
 “They say it was laming cracked his brain,” ob- 
 served the landlady. 
 
 “No, troth! but grief for the loss of his foster- 
 child ; and to this day, when he isn’t going on with 
 his skancios of the Macarthies More, it’s of him he 
 bees talking, in spite of the Crawleys.” The mendi- 
 cant hostler now raised the sieve of oats on his head 
 and hobbled back to the stables. 
 
 “ Och ! but it’s a pity of him, the cratur,” said Mrs. 
 Gaffney, whose evident love of gossipping was much 
 gratified by the conversation which had accidentally 
 arisen — ■“ poor and lame as he is now, a baccah, beg- 
 ging his bit through the country, and betimes doing 
 a turn here for us, — why, then, he has seen great days 
 formerly, and was whipper-in to Lord Fitzadelm, 
 that’s the Black Baron, and often called in to sing 
 ‘ the Hunt of Kilruddery’ for my lord and the qual- 
 ity, in the great parlor after dinner ; and at last lent 
 him even his trifle of wages, and sold his bit of a place 
 to raise money for him, and got his lameness by being 
 thrown off in his service ; and there you are now, 
 Fineen McCrehan, without a rag to kiver you, or a 
 shed to lay your head under, or a bit of a bed to die 
 on, or as much as would buy a pipe to wake you 
 with this night. Ah ! then, nothing ever thriv with

 means to fall in love.

 them Fitzadelms ; they had the black drop in them, 
 for all they were the portliest men in the country 
 (though I never see them, barring in pictures), and to 
 this day it’s a saying in the country, 1 comely and 
 wicked like a Fitzadelm.,’ Well, there’s the last stick 
 and stone of the court to be sold next week. We 
 had orders to stick up the bill, sirs, here, from Mr. 
 Crawley’s land baily of Dunore, who passed through 
 the mountains yesterday.” 
 
 “ Then the devil set his foot after him wherever he 
 goes, and that he may never come back, I pray 
 Christ,” said the driver, as he drew his cotamore 
 round him, and went forth to look after the equipage. 
 
 To this pious adjuration a very general “ amen’ 
 was returned ; while both the travellers, as if moved 
 by the same impulse of curiosity, advanced to read 
 the advertisement hung over the chimney, by the 
 rushlight which was fastened in a cleft stick near it. 
 This paper indicated that the old castle and mansion 
 of Court Fitzadelm, beautifully situate in a valley, 
 watered by the Avon Fienne, and sheltered by the 
 Galtees and Ballyhowry mountains, were to be put 
 up for sale on a certain day, or might be purchased 
 by private contract. The materials were strongly re- 
 commended to any gentleman who was building ; and 
 a few acres of meadow land, with the liberties of a. 
 certain portion of the salmon fishery on the Avon 
 Fienne, were to be sold or leased. References were 
 to be made to Darby Crawley, Esq., Newtown, Mount 
 Crawley, Dunore, or at his house, Merrion Square, 
 Dublin. 
 
 “ I should like to see this Court Fitzadelm,” said 
 the Commodore, addressing Mr. Do Vere in Spanish.

 “ Perhaps I may be induced to purchase it, The 
 fishery of a fine river is a strong inducement, and my 
 future destiny is, I hope, to reside in this country.” 
 
 “ I should like to see it also, and will accompany 
 you. By its vicinity to the Ballyhowry mountains, 
 it can’t be far from Buttevant,” replied De Yere. 
 
 On inquiries made from the landlady, and partly 
 answered by the ill-looking man at the three-legged 
 table, they found that Court Fitzadelm lay due south 
 of the Ballyhowry mountains. “Then,” said the 
 Commodore, “ I can take it en chemin faisant to the 
 peninsula of Dunore.” 
 
 “ Dunore !” repeated the younger traveller ; “ I 
 thought you were proceeding to Kerry ?” 
 
 “Not immediately,” was the careless reply; and 
 the next moment the Commodore, observing that he 
 would endeavor to expedite their journey, left the 
 house. De Yere meantime took out his Spenser, and 
 threw himself upon the settle, in the place of the fe- 
 male in the frieze cloak, to whom the landlady was 
 serving out some milk in another part of the kitchen ; 
 when his neighbor in the calesh, jerking the skirt of 
 her riding cloak forward, which he had incautiously 
 sat upon, observed — “I’d trouble you to move off: 
 you were not so ready to put your comether * on me 
 when you refused me making a third in the chay, 
 why ! from Dublin to Cashel.” 
 
 Startled at this half-remembered accent, De Yere 
 raised his eyes fearfully, and under the yawning 
 cavity of the calesh, beheld the red nose and green 
 spectacles of Mrs. Magillicuddy. He sprung from 
 his seat and left the house. “ For heaven’s sake,” he 
 * “ Comether ” — officious intrusiveness.

 exclaimed, as with rapid strides he advanced to his 
 fellow-traveller, who stood talking near the door to 
 the baccah and the Kerry horsedealer, “ for heaven’s 
 sake let us be off directly, with or without a wheel. 
 Who do you think one of the two females at the fire 
 may be ?” 
 
 “ Not your nightmare, I hope,” said the Commo- 
 dore, smiling — “ not Mrs. Magillicuddy.” 
 
 “ My nightmare, indeed !” he reiterated, shrug- 
 ging his shoulders : “ this is being fairly hag-ridden.” 
 
 “ Magillicuddy !” repeated the driver of the first- 
 arrived chaise, who was putting to his horses. ■“ Is 
 that the ould lady’s name, your honor ? Why, then, 
 troth, she’s a gentlewoman every taste of her, and 
 pays finely ; and for that same, I bate your chay fair- 
 ly, and got in half an hour before yez.” 
 
 “ Where did you start from !” asked Ow r ny, com- ; 
 ing forward. 
 
 “ From Cashel ; and came the low road ; and 
 wonder yez would take to the mountains ; only it’s 
 what I believe you lost your way, sir,” he replied. 
 
 “ And where are you going to now V asked De 
 Vere, evidently interested in the question. 
 
 “ We are going on to one side of Doneraile, sir: 
 and if we can’t make that before ten o’clock, we are 
 to stop at the New Inn; for th’ ould lady doesn't 
 care to be on the road after the moon goes dowm, ; 
 though from this to Doneraile is as beautiful as a 
 bowling-green.” 
 
 “ I think,” said Mr. De Vere, “I should be well 
 contented to remain here to-night, if there was a 
 chance of clean beds, or even of fresh hether: we 
 could then proceed to Court Fitzadeim early to-mor-

 row, instead of having to tread back onr steps by 
 going to Buttevant first” This was addressed to tho 
 Commodore. 
 
 “ Och, then, not better beds you’ll get in the barony 
 than at the little back-room at Lis-na-sleugh,” ob- 
 served Owny, who" appeared to listen with attention ; 
 and I carried two gentlemen here who slept in them 
 last week, and one of them a priest, that’s Friar 
 ^O’Sullivan, on his way to Cork.” 
 
 “ Then we will endeavor to make our arrangements 
 accordingly,” said De Vere, turning sharp round, and 
 coming in contact with the whalebone of Mrs. Magil- 
 licuddy’s calesh ; for she had stood for the last few 
 minutes behind them. 
 
 “ Why, then, man,” she exclaimed to her driver, 
 u will you lave off your gossip, and not keep us here 
 till midnight, why !” 
 
 To this remonstrance, made in a most stentorian 
 ! voice, the man replied by opening the chaise door, 
 letting down the steps, and letting in the infirm Mrs. 
 
 ! Magillicuddy and her more youthful attendant, who 
 sprung lightly into the chaise after her: they im- 
 mediately drove away. 
 
 “ I told you,” said the younger traveller, “ we 
 were fated to remain at this miserable little mountain 
 inn.” 
 
 “ The fatality lies in your prepossessions,” replied 
 the Commodore, “ or, if you will, in the superhuman 
 influence of Mrs. Magillicuddy; and yet, she is a 
 woman.” 
 
 “ A woman ! Sex hath but one age : that passed, 
 
 | there is neither man nor woman. Who would assign 
 | to such a thing as that a gender, with her lungs and

 her bulk, her natural defects and artificial disgusts, 
 her Bardolph’s nose, and tower of horse hair. A 
 woman ! gracious heaven ! ’Tis altogether another 
 species, made of other elements, and composed of 
 other organs !” 
 
 As he thus stood “ chewing the cud of sweet and 
 bitter fancies,” in apostrophizing all that was lovely, 
 and all that had ceased to be so, in the sex, his more 
 active, more vigilant fellow-traveller, was occupied in 
 providing for their night’s accommodation. He had 
 also inquired for the driver, to inform him of their 
 new arrangements, and learned from the lame hostler 
 that he was gone behind the other chaise, as far as 
 the smith’s forge, for an iron pin, which was wanting 
 to the complete reinstatement of the broken machine- 
 ry of their own cra^y carriage. 
 
 The circumstance of two such guests . remaining 
 for the night at Lis-na-sleugh produced a business 
 and bustle most unusual beneath its humble roof. 
 Skaneen * the boy, was employed in catching, killing, 
 and plucking a fowl, which had (reckless of the fate 
 that awaited it) taken up its roost on the rafter of the 
 kitchen. The baccali was occupied in preparing such 
 a table equipage for supper as the house afforded ; 
 and the hostess herself gave her attention to the little 
 bedroom. 
 
 This apartment, which communicated by a few steps 
 with the parlor, contained two small, old-fashioned 
 bedsteads, with patchwork quilts (the accumulated 
 fragments of half a century), and check curtains of 
 transparent texture. Though poor and mean, it was 
 cleanly and cheerful; and was just such a sleeping

 apartment as is to be found in every inn in Ireland, 
 that lies in a road but little frequented. 
 
 When the strangers returned to the house, from a 
 short refreshing walk among the moonlight glens, the 
 house was cleared of its guests, silent and tranquil. A 
 clean cloth was spread upon the parlor table, the turf 
 fire blazed brightly ; and though there was no wine to 
 be had, and they had not yet made up their palates to 
 what Peter the Great called “Irish wine,” yet the 
 clear spring that gushed from the neighboring rock 
 was pure falernian to thirsty and temperate travellers. 
 The supper prepared, by their cordial hostess, though 
 homely, was all fri ndise to appetites sharpened by 
 the mountain air, and placed beyond the delicacy of 
 fastidiousness by long fast. 
 
 Owny, who had returned from the forge, inquired 
 carelessly “ if they had now the place to themselves, 
 barring the gentlemen,” and being answered in the 
 affirmative (for the three guests in the kitchen, the 
 horsedealer, the peddler, and his companion, had all 
 departed under favor of the moonlight), he immedi- 
 ately threw off his cotamore, caubeen, and wig. Light, 
 alert, and diligent, he now officiated as valet to the 
 gentlemen, and as coadjutor to Mrs. Gaffney’s estab- 
 lishment ; and his services added considerably to the 
 little sum of comfort and accommodation which the 
 travellers could naturally expect, in this improved 
 imitation of a Spanish Posada. 
 
 Meantime the Irish cead mille faltha* shone in every 
 eye, and beamed its welcome on the strangers. The 
 obvious good will of all compensated for the defi- 
 
 Hundred thousand welcomes.

 cieney of ability but too obvious; and even the 
 younger, and less easily satisfied guest, was led to ob- 
 serve of the little shebeen of Lis-na-sleugh, as the 
 French philosopher did of the world, “ Si tout n-y est

 There is scarcely any cabaret in the remote parts of 
 Ireland, over whose door is exhibited the usual adver- 
 tisement of “ Good entertainment for man and beast,” 
 where a tolerable breakfast may not be procured; 
 the abundance and freshness of the milk, butter, and 
 eggs, usually compensating for the indifferent quality 
 of that far-fetched and vivifying herb, which the 
 Widow Gaffney assured her guests as they seated 
 themselves at her breakfast table, after the refreshing 
 repose of the night, was “ illigant tay from Cork.” 
 Luckily, they were just then in a temper of mind to 
 take much upon faith, and to be pleased on very scanty 
 premises. There was a novelty, a romantic singu- 
 larity in their actual position, which lent it a peculiar 
 charm (at least to the younger traveller, to whom it 
 was evident that whatever was new was good) : 
 while it was obvious to both, that even the wildest

 parts of Ireland afforded that security to the 
 stranger’s wandering, which is refused only to the 
 local, official oppressor. 
 
 The travellers left the inn of Lis-na-sleugh, followed 
 by the blessings of its inhabitants, excited by their 
 liberality. Had the younger of them been capable of 
 observing anything, in which he was not himself per- 
 sonally concerned, he might have noticed that, pre- 
 vious to their departure, his mysterious companion 
 had been engaged in a conference with the lame 
 hostler, which lasted a considerable time : for while 
 Owny was putting to the horses, and arranging the 
 portmanteaux, the Commodore, with arms folded, 
 brows compressed, and eyes full of eager listening 
 curiosity, remained silently attentive to some narra- 
 tion, which seemed circumstantially detailed by the 
 baccah. As they both stood under the shadow of an 
 impending cliff (the bold figure of the Commodore in 
 deep shade, and darkly defined, — the bending form 
 of the cripple supported by his crutch, and tinged by 
 the light of a straggling sunbeam), they seemed ap- 
 propriate figures for the wild scenery that surrounded 
 them. In this point of view only they were con- 
 sidered by the tasteful observer, who stood looking 
 at them through his half-closed eyes, and who simply 
 noted the effect of their picturesque grouping, with- 
 out one surmise as to its cause. 
 
 The mountains the travellers had crossed, and the 
 glen in which they had passed the night, soon re- 
 ceded from their view : their journey lay along a 
 comparatively good road, among a long chain of hills, 
 which fenced within their undulating boundaries 
 many a lovely glen and romantic valley, brightening

 in the morning sunshine. Acclivity rose above 
 acclivity, lifting their bleak bare heads to the clouds 
 in wild and savage magnificence : those to the west, 
 forming the boundaries of the county of Kerry ; 
 those to the north and east, the Ballyhowry and 
 Nagle mountains, enclosing the classical scenery of 
 Spenser ; his own “ Mole” rising conspicuously above 
 all. 
 
 In the bosom of this wild and fantastic region, 
 after a journey of twelve miles, the valley of Glen- 
 fionne, or the Fair Valley, was announced by the 
 driver; and the old woods and towers of Court Fitz- 
 adelxn were discovered in the distance, crowning a 
 rocky summit, which seemed to hang perpendicularly 
 over the winding waters of the Avon Fienne. The 
 demesne of this fine old seat was accessible by many 
 mountain ravines from the south ; but the design of 
 its late lord, who had cut a road across a branch of 
 the Galtees, to shorten the way from Dublin, though 
 inadequately executed, was judiciously conceived. 
 On that side, its situation had been inaccessible, re- 
 mote, and romantic. The extensive stone wall, 
 which ran round the north of the demesne, was in 
 many places dismantled and broken down; and 
 through its frequent breaches, it exhibited the result 
 of that pernicious and exhausting system of farming 
 resorted to in such places. The ci-devant agent, now 
 the actual but absent master, had let out the beauti- 
 ful demesne in what is called jobbing farms, whose 
 tillage rarely extends beyond the growing of pota- 
 toes ; for which purpose the ground is uncalculatingly 
 burned, to produce one good crop to its temporary 
 possessor. Here and there, vestiges of wretched

 crops of grass and oats showed the land to he utterly 
 exhausted ; and, ^n many places it was abandoned to 
 the wild growth of weeds and briers. Almost every- 
 where the old meadow and pasture grounds were 
 covered with furze, broom and rushes, which, though 
 now yellow and rich to the eye, were still but “ un- 
 profit ably gay.” 
 
 The subdivisions of petty property were marked 
 by rude meerings ; and each temporary tenant had 
 secured his own rood of ground with unplanted 
 mounds, w T hose occasional gaps were stopped with 
 brambles and heath bushes. This coarse and rude 
 system of farming added much to the desolate and 
 neglected aspect of a naturally lovely scene, which, 
 in its present state, formed an apt epitome of the 
 abandoned dwellings of the Irish absentees. 
 
 The scanty and miserable population which ap- 
 peared in the neighborhood of the once princely 
 Court Fitzadelm, was appropriately wretched and 
 neglected. From a few mud-built huts, raised against 
 the park wall, occasionally issued a child, or a pig ; 
 while the head of its squalid mistress appeared for a 
 moment through the cloud of smoke streaming 
 through the door, and then suddenly retreated. 
 
 The long and broken road, winding round the 
 wall, seemed to lengthen as the travellers proceeded • 
 and they stopped to inquire the way to the nearest 
 approach of a poor man who was driving a lamb 
 with a straw rope round its leg. The man pointed 
 to a winding in the road, and directed them to the- 
 ruined gates of the principal entrance ; he then took 
 up the wearied lamb on his shoulders, an<J proceeded 
 sullenly on„

 52 The cratur !” said the driver, who was now walk- 
 ing by the side of his horses, as were also the gentle- 
 men ; “ God help him ! he is now going all the way 
 to Ballinispig fair with that bit of a lamb; eight good 
 long miles, and maybe it won’t bring him over three 
 tinpinnies.” 
 
 They had now reached the entrance of what had 
 been considered one of the most magnificent de- 
 mesnes in Ireland, once forming part of the princi- 
 pality of the Macarthies, and successively passing by 
 grants and forfeitures from them to the powerful 
 Desmonds, and again to the favored Fitzadelms. It 
 was now the ill-managed possession of an attorney, 
 who had held it partly on mortgage and partly by 
 lease from the elder Baron Fitzadelm, designated in 
 the country by the sobriquet of the “ Black Baron.” 
 The eyes of the strangers seemed equally anxious 
 in their gaze, which was, in both, more expressive 
 of obscure and faded recognition than of mere idle 
 curiosity. A long range of iron gate presented itself 
 to their view, much broken, many of the bars drawn 
 out, and the tracery covered with rust. The massive 
 stone pillars, on either side, overgrown with lichens, 
 still exhibited some vestiges of handsome sculpture ; 
 the capital of one was surmounted by a headless 
 eagle, the other showed the claw and part of the 
 body of a goshawk — both natives of the surrounding 
 i mountains, and well imitated in black marble, drawn 
 from their once worked quarries. Two lodges 
 i mouldered on either side into absolute ruin, and 
 the intended improvement of a Grecian portico to 
 I one, never finished, was still obvious in the scattered 
 fragments of friezes and entablatures, which lay

 choaked amidst heaps of nettles, furze-bushes aiid 
 long rye-grass. The broad approach, though now 
 moss-grown and green, was still to be traced wind- 
 ing through beautifully undulating but neglected 
 grounds; and there was a kind of mimic forest 
 richly clothing the sides of the elevated heights, 
 which rose, like little mountains, from the southern 
 shore of the river, deceiving the eye, and appearing 
 the same luxuriant wood which had once bloomed 
 there. It was now but the sprouting stumps suc- 
 ceeding to the lofty majesty of the full-grown oak? 
 pine and mountain ash, for which this country was 
 once so celebrated. 
 
 While the travellers stood looking upon this fine, 
 but melancholy scene, the driver thrust his head 
 through the broken bars of the gate, and, directing 
 his voice towards one of the ruined lodges, whence 
 issued a feeble smoke, cried out, “ Alleen machree ! 
 Atteen deelish /” 
 
 “Who do you call to?” asked the Commodore, 
 impatiently endeavoring to open the gate. 
 
 “ To little Ellen, plaze your honor, the daughter 
 of the poor baccah at Lis-na-sleugh, who lives here 
 with her ould granny, that kept the gates in both th’ 
 ould lords’ time, and is bed-ridden now; that’s as 
 the baccah tould me last night, when I was axing 
 him about the way. Alleen mavourneen .” 
 
 “ Che shin”K answered a shrill voice from within ; 
 and the next minute a figure, small, wild and fright- 
 ful, bounded over the plank laid before the lodge 
 door, and stood at the gate. To a few words ad- 
 dressed to her in Irish she lent a timid but fixed at-

 tention; then flew back to the lodge, and instantly 
 returned with a large massive key which she applied 
 with extraordinary strength to the rusty lock, and 
 the heavy gates opened slowly to admit the unusual 
 visitors. 
 
 “ That’s my caen-buy-deelish said Owny, kindly 
 patting a head, to whose thick and matted locks ad- 
 hered some bearded thistles. The little portress 
 laughed with all the wildness of fatuity; but shrunk, 
 scared and intimidated, as she snatched the offered 
 remuneration from the Commodore’s hand. Her 
 countenance, however, exhibited rather the stupor of 
 unawakened intellect, than a natural deficiency of in- 
 telligence, 
 
 “ That’s a poor 1 innocent,’ your honor : the likes 
 of them be always found in lonely places, like the 
 ould court here : and brings luck with them they say. 
 But for all that she’s a natural, her father tells me 
 she’s the finest cat-hunter and bird-catcher in the 
 barony round ; and is quite cute at gathering brush- 
 neens for the bit of fire, and catering among the 
 neighbors with her cruiskeenf and wallet, for her 
 ould bed-ridden granny.” 
 
 To this account the Commodore made no reply, 
 but shrugged his shoulders ; and both gentlemen pro- 
 ceeded in silence through the demesne, while Owny 
 entered the lodge to make some inquiries from the 
 bed-ridden lodge-keeper relative to the house; whether 
 it was to be seen, and who occupied it. The grounds 
 were divided into little plots and job-farms, up to the 
 door of the mansion, which stood on a rocky height

 over the river. On the opposite shores ascended m 
 range of well- wooded acclivities, whose summits min- 
 gled with the line of the horizon. Of the original 
 building nothing now remained, but a square ivy- 
 clad tower, called Desmond’s Castle, flanking a less 
 imposing edifice, built by the Fitzadelms In the reign 
 of James the First. This wing was In good preserva- 
 tion : but the modern fagade, raised forty years back 
 by Baron Fitzadelm, the Tierna-Dliu, was ruinous and 
 mouldering. It had been built by contract, was ra- 
 pidly got up for a particular purpose, and had been 
 constructed with bad materials, most of which were 
 not even yet paid for. The precipitous declivities 
 which swept down from the rocky foundation of the 
 house to the river had been cut into terrace gardens, 
 a fashion still observable at the seats of the ancient 
 nobility of Munster : and it was melancholy to ob- 
 serve the stunted rose-tree, and other once-cultivated 
 but now degenerate shrubs and flowers, raising their 
 heads amongst nettles and briers, and long grass, and 
 withered potato-stalks. Many fantastic little build- 
 ings were also seen mouldering on romantic sites 
 along the river’s undulating banks * some of shells, 
 some of rock-work : all alike monuments of the bad 
 taste of the day in which they were raised, and of 
 the wanton caprice of the persons who projected 
 them. 
 
 “ It was doubtless from a scene like this,” observed 
 Mr. De Vere, plucking an half-perished rose, to which 
 adhered the foliage of the deadly nightshade, “ that 
 Spenser drew his poetical metaphor of the seeds of 
 vice springing up amidst the scions of virtue

 ie And with their boughs the gentle plants did bear ; 
 
 But ever more some of the virtuous race 
 Bose up inspired with heroic heat, 
 
 That cropt the branches of their scient base, 
 
 And with strong hand their fruitful rankness did deface.” 
 
 “ It is thus, perhaps,” returned the Commodore, 
 “ that the rightful heir of Court Fitzadelm would act, 
 did he behold this place as we now see it.” 
 
 “ No,” replied De Yere, flinging away together the 
 rose and the nightshade. “ It is probable that the 
 representative of the Fitzadelm family (for the unfor- 
 tunate and insane Marquis of Dunore cannot be 
 deemed such) would look upon this ancient seat of 
 his ancestors, as I now view it, with a new feeling of 
 contempt for the species to which he belongs ; and 
 with as little interest for the posterity that is to fob 
 low, as for the ancestry that preceded him, he would 
 put it up to the hammer, and fly to enjoy its price in 
 happier regions and more genial climes.” 
 
 “ He would, on the contrary, perhaps,” said the 
 Commodore, with a vehemence tinctured with irre- 
 pressible indignation, “ endeavor to redeem the folly 
 and negligence of his ancestors, wrest his paternal 
 demesne from the grasp of fraud, or repurchase it 
 from the gripe of sordidness ; he would then raise its 
 fallen towers, reclaim its neglected soil, cherish the 
 miserable population, and expiate the violence and 
 rapacity by which his distant forefathers obtained 
 this still beautiful territory, by a constant and bene- 
 ficial residence in the land whence he draws his sup- 
 port and existence.” 
 
 “ You know but little of Calista,” replied De Yere, 
 smiling significantly— “ you know but little of Lord 
 Adelm Fitzadelm.” *

 “ Who is he ?” asked the Commodore, quickly, 
 
 “ Why, the only brother of the present Marquis of 
 Dunore, heir-presumptive of his title and possessions : 
 not to know him would argue yourself unknown.” 
 
 “ Oh true,” said the Commodore, with the tone of 
 sudden recollection, “ I have heard of such a person.” 
 “ I suppose so,” was the dry reply. 
 
 Owny now joined them with the information that 
 the house was to be seen, and that it was inhabited 
 by an old housekeeper, a follower of the Crawley 
 family, nick-named Protestant Moll, the “ divil’s own 
 saint,” one he had often heard of, but never seen, and 
 so called in regard of her having once been a great 
 papist and a voteen * and having afterwards become 
 a hedger (that’s a turncoat), and was made a kiln- 
 dried Protestant, by Miss Crawley, a great preacher, 
 and sister to the portreeve of Dunore, Torney Craw- 
 ley, Esq., a raal slave driver, that had many a poor 
 man’s sowl to answer for. While he spoke he was 
 vainly applying a stone to the folding doors of the 
 great entrance (for the knocker was off), and at last 
 went round to the rear of the building, in search of a 
 more easy ingress. In a few minutes his head ap- 
 peared through one of the front windows; and 
 assuring the gentlemen he would be down in a crack, 
 and open the hall door for them, he indulged himself 
 in a momentary view of the surrounding scene. 
 
 He soon, however, descended, and was heard un- 
 barring the long-closed portals, which slowly opened 
 to admit the strangers. A most capacious hall of 
 black marble discovered on either side several doors, 
 half-panelled; a superb but dismantled staircase, in

 the centre, branched off into a corridor, which sur- 
 rounded the hail, and appeared to lead to different 
 apartments. The rafters had in many places fallen 
 in ; and the plaster of the still crumbling ceiling lay 
 in heaps upon the floor, f 
 
 This ruinous and melancholy appearance gave 
 peculiar force to a motto in gold letters over the 
 folding doors of a private theatre, which opened into 
 the left side of the hall. The motto was, “Laugh 
 while we can.” 
 
 “ Laugh while we can !” repeated the Commodore, 
 with a shrug, that was almost a shudder. 
 
 “Oh, it’s delicious,” observed De Vere, ironically, 
 “ a thing to moralize a song withal.” 
 
 “ Why, then, it’s little of it them gets now that put 
 it up there, why ! that’s now, God help them, in a 
 place where there’s no laughing, but weeping, and 
 wailing, and gnashing of teeth.” 
 
 The strangers turned round at this unexpected ad- 
 dress, but not unknown accent, and beheld Mrs. 
 Magillicuddy close behind them. 
 
 “This is the housekeeper, who will show your 
 honors the place,” said Owny, and then retired to 
 look after his horses. De Vere drew back many 
 paces from the frightful phantom of his imagination. 
 * The Commodore stood surprised, and something 
 amused at the effect which this sudden apparition 
 produced on his companion, Mrs. Magillicuddy, 
 whose face was partly wrapped up in a worsted stock- 
 ing, and who was endeavoring to keep a brown paper 
 steeped in whiskey on her nose, looked at them for a 
 moment through her large green spectacles, and ad-

 dressed them both in a tone of great familiarity, ot> 
 serving : 
 
 “Well, who knows but we may meet in heaven 
 yet ; little chance as there seems for some of us now, 
 why ! for we’ve met often enough in this world any- 
 how, and may again when least expected. And it’s 
 little yez thought when ye refused me a third in your 
 chay to Tipperary, that I’d be showing you Court 
 Fitzadelm ; and is as much mistress here as the lady, 
 if she was in it, and will be till it fall into better 
 hands, plaze God. Why, then, yez had great luck ? 
 gentlemen, not to go in the chay from Dublin ; for 
 it’s in it, shure, I got one of my rheumatrix fits, all 
 down the face and head of me. And it was the 
 Lord’s will I should be overturned last night, coming 
 here, and broke my nose, why ! W ell, what matter, 
 Shure 111 be worse afore I’m better ; for whom the 
 Lord loveth, He chasteneth. Is my strength the 
 strength of stone, or is my flesh of brass ? No, troth ! 
 And so this young man here tells me yez want to see 
 the consarn. Why, then, it’s a sad place now; a 
 watch-tower in the wilderness. And little ever I 
 thought to see the likes of yez in it again, though 
 many of your sort frequented it formerly.” 
 
 “ Of our sort ? Why what do you take us for ?” 
 asked the Commodore in some surprise, tinctured with 
 seeming uneasiness. 
 
 “ For two rakes of quality, dear, going about the in- 
 nocent country, seeking whom yez may devour, like 
 the old one, why !” 
 
 The gentlemen both smiled; and even De Yere 
 seemed not displeased at the definition given of his

 appearance by the formidable Mrs. Magillicuddy, alias 
 “ Protestant Moll.” Still, however, he hung back, and 
 looked upon her with disgust and apprehension. 
 
 “ I understand,” said the Commodore, “ that this 
 old mansion, with a few acres of the ancient demesne, 
 is to be sold; and I wish to examine the premises, 
 before I apply for the terms to Mr. Crawley, to whose 
 seat I am now proceeding.” 
 
 “ As to the house,” said Mrs. Magillicuddy, “ it is 
 an house of clay now,” (and she waddled before them 
 towards the theatre, the door of which she threw 
 open) ; “ an house of clay, whose foundation is in the 
 dust, and which is crushed before the moth. There ! 
 — there’s the devil’s tabernacle.” 
 
 Curiosity now got the better of prejudice ; and Mr. 
 De Vere approached to examine this monument of 
 former dissipation and refinement, in scenes so inap- 
 propriate to its site. Most of the decorations, and 
 nearly all the seats and scenery, had been removed. 
 But fragments of scarlet cloth remained upon a bench 
 which had not been taken away. A cut wood scene 
 still occupied the stage ; and some ornamental paint- 
 ing and gilding were visible on the ceiling and 
 cornice. 
 
 “This was a box fitted up for the lord lieutenant,” 
 said Mrs. Magillicuddy, seating herself on the soli- 
 tary bench, “ and when the bishop’s lady came here to 
 see me, after my wonderful conversion (and it was 
 Miss Crawley that delivered me from the workings of 
 iniquity), and found the Rev. Mr. Scare’um sitting 
 with me in this very place (for he came to visit this 
 benighted district, and to take under his protection 
 the perishing sinners of the hill country), says the

 bishop’s lady to me (for my conversion made a great 
 noise, far and near), — no, says Mr. Scare’um to Miss 
 Crawley, it is curious to see, says he, by what great 
 strides Molly Magillicuddy has made her way out of 
 Babylon. Uponwdiich the bishop’s lady remarked — ” 
 
 “ I cannot stand this,” cried De Yere to the Com- 
 modore in Spanish. “ I will walk down to the river, 
 while you examine the house, if you really think there 
 is anything worth seeing.” 
 
 Mrs. Magillicuddy now rose with surprising alert- 
 ness, and observed : “ Maybe yez w mild like to see 
 the ould family pictures which will go with the house, 
 being worth nothing now, barring the frames, the best 
 being gone.” 
 
 The family pictures counteracted the effect of even 
 Mrs. Magillicuddy’s egotistical jargon, who seemed 
 to trade upon the history of her conversion, and to sup- 
 pose, with pious vanity, that it interested her audit- 
 ors as much as herself. The gentlemen followed her 
 up the hall, while she continued her recital with — “ So, 
 as I was saying, the bishop’s lady, thinking me a mira- 
 cle of grace (though, Lord help me, I was then but a 
 babe in knowledge, never having mansod hardly to 
 Mr. Scare’um, nor lived with the teisdoo), she says to 
 me, ‘ Molly,’ says she ” 
 
 “ This is a curious apartment,” interrupted the Com- 
 modore, as he threw open the door of the room, 
 which Mrs. Magillicuddy announced as the presence 
 chamber. 
 
 “ Ay, curious enough !” said she. “ Here it was 
 that the royal idolater, James the Second, held a court, 
 in his way through Munster, and was attended by all 
 the papist lords, the ‘ recusants,’ as Miss Crawley tells

 me. Oh ! she’s a great scholar and was here in her 
 way to Dublin, just afore I went to England for that 
 legacy left me by the pious Mr. Scare’um two months 
 ago — for the Fitzadelms,” she continued in her digres- 
 sive way, “ was then Romans themselves ; until, by 
 abandoning the scarlet lady of Babylon, they secured 
 their lands and rights ; and the king, when he looked 
 out at this window (called the king’s casement ever 
 since), started back, wondering much at the great 
 height of the house above the river.” 
 
 She threw open the window as she spoke ; and the 
 precipitous declivity beneath seemed to justify the 
 royal astonishment.* But the strangers were little 
 attracted by the bold and beautiful views without, nor 
 by the fine friezesTwithin, which were painted by the 
 Franchinis, two Italian artists, who visited Ireland a 
 century back, and were employed in ornamenting its 
 noble mansions. The few pictures, which mouldered 
 in their tarnished frames upon the oaken wainscot, 
 seemed to fix their most earnest attention; for the 
 greater number were portraits of the most eminent 
 characters of Charles the Second’s court. 
 
 The beauties, the wits, and the warriors of that day, 
 were in a large proportion Irish ; and while the pic- 
 tures of the Hamiltons, the Butlers, the Yillierses, the 
 Fitzgeralds, the Talbots, the Muskerries the Taafes, 
 and the Burkes, are sketched for immortality in the 
 delightful Memoirs of Grammont, their less durable 
 portraits by Lilly and Kneller have been copied ad in-

 for its romantic beauty, as the inhabitants of its immediate neigh- 
 borhood are for their courtesy, elegance, and hospitality.

 “ And are these pictures to go with the rest of the

 “It’s little matter where they go,” returned Mrs. 
 Magillicuddy, indignantly, “ or if they went with them

 Crawley tells me; they are paying for their scarlet and

 “Fleshly ease, indeed!” repeated De Vere, gazing 
 earnestly upon the picture of the beautiful Duchess 
 of Cleveland.* “ There is something in the swimming 
 eyes and thick lips of the beauties of those times, a 
 charming unidea’ d sameness of physiognomy, that is 
 now lost in the female face.” 
 
 “ Mental cultivation most diversifies the counten- 
 ance,” replied the Commodore. “ In barbarous nations 
 there is but one physiognomy for a tribe : where there 
 is little intellect, there can be but little variety of ex- 
 pression.” 
 
 “ I hate intellect in women,” said De Vere ; “ and 
 what is most delicious in the harem of that happy 
 satrap, Charles, is, that they all look such pretty 
 idiots, so fond and foolish, as if they were of that sect 
 which once flourished in Spain, the Embevecidos , 
 whose life and faith were made up of love.” 
 
 “ Love, indeed ! love ! when hearts were purchased 
 with French ribbons; and perfumed gloves went on 
 successful embassies to ladies’ affections. Oh ! trust 
 me, your royal satraps have more of laziness than of 
 love in their engagements; and nothing is further 
 from passion than their idle saunterings ‘ in ladies’ 
 chambers.’ ”

 Commodore, indignantly. “ I didn’t think so once,

 water, now the seat of Tier descendant Villiers Stewart, Esquire. 
 Part of the summer of 1817 was delightfully spent by the author 
 amidst these delicious scenes.

 God help me ! For I walked in utter darkness till I 
 was thirty ; and did not wrestle with the ould one till 
 I was forty good. My conversion made a great noise 
 far and near. The bishop’s lady came to me, and 
 said — - — ■” 
 
 Mr. De Vere was again retreating, when the old 
 woman hobbled to a door at the further end of the 
 apartment, and throwing it open, said, “ There, that’s 
 the drawing-room;” then flinging herself upon a broken 
 chair, the only article of furniture in the room, except 
 an antique japanned chest, she continued, pointing to 
 two pictures — “ There, gentlemen, there are the pic- 
 tures of the two brothers ; that is half brothers by 
 blood, but whole brothers in iniquity. I always took 
 the dark one in robes to be the Prince of Orange, 
 and the red-headed one to be the Pretender, till Miss 
 Crawley, when she came here for the Indy cabinet, 
 informed me that they were the two last Lord Fitza- 
 delms, the Dhu and the Ruadg, the black and the red. 
 Well, that’s all that remains of them now; the ould 
 one had a fine lob of them both. He that would have 
 wrestled for their salvation was not walking this 
 benighted country when they were in it, and so they 
 were left to go to the devil their own way, why !” 
 
 During this charitable speech the eyes of the tra- 
 vellers were fixed upon the pictures, pointed out by 
 their pious Cicerone. The elder brother stood in his 
 parliamentary robes, by a table, on which his coronet 
 was placed : his countenance expressed haughtiness, 
 something mingled with indecision; and traces of 
 wild ill-regulated passions, contrasted with a look of 
 feebleness and dependence, gave indication of a mind 
 endowed with some natural character, but which had

 been spoiled by circumstances and education ; as if 
 the natural force, which might have gone to the 
 strengthening of his intellect, served but to irritate 
 his passions and temper. He was of a dark and satur- 
 nine complexion ; but intemperance had so bloated his 
 features, and impurpled his naturally sallow hue, that 
 even the painter’s art could scarcely recall the beauty 
 for which he had once been celebrated. This picture, 
 by the date, was done above thirty years back ; the 
 name of the artist was so obscure, and the execution 
 so inferior, that it was probably the effort of some 
 itinerant painter, who worked by the square foot. 
 
 The younger brother was a true Geraldine in color- 
 ing and feature; the light, curled, and golden hair, 
 the full blue eye, and fair complexion were there, 
 which distinguished almost every branch of that illus- 
 trious family, particularly the southern Geraldines: 
 but there was an expression of licentiousness and cun- 
 ning mingled in the countenance of Gerald Fitzadelm, 
 which belonged not to the physiognomy of his family. 
 He had a foreign air, was habited in a Venetian 
 domino, and held a black mask so near his face, that 
 he seemed but in the very act of removing it. The 
 picture was dated V enice ; the name of the artist was 
 Italian ; and a label hanging from it, with orders how 
 it was to be laid in the case, which was placed near 
 it, indicated that it was about to be removed. On the 
 case, in large letters, was painted, “For the most 
 noble the Marchioness Dowager of Dunore, Dunore 
 Castle. ’ 
 
 “ Ay,” said Mrs. Magillicuddy, reading this address, 
 “ay, to the Marchioness Dowager: well, careful as 
 she is of the picture, it’s little she valued the reality,

 why ! It's from her, they say, the madness got into 
 the Fitzadelm family. For till the Baron Gerald mar- 
 ried that hoity-toity Englishwoman (though, as I’m 
 tould, they were foolish enough, and wicked enough 
 before), none of them was ever lunatic, until the 
 two young lords, her sons, went mad lately.” 
 
 “ What, both mad ?” asked the Commodore, while 
 his companion turned round, and fixed his eyes with 
 a very singular expression on the narrator. 
 
 a Ay, sir, both as mad as March hares: the eldest 
 being mad by nature, and t’other chap from pride, 
 why ! But shure the sins of the fathers must be 
 visited on the childer, as Miss Crawley says : afflic- 
 tion cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trou- 
 ble come out of the ground, why ! There is the 
 young Marquis in a madhouse, and there is Lord 
 Adelm Fitzadelm, his. brother, wandering the world 
 wide, they say, looking for something, he doesn’t 
 know what, like a prince in the story-book ; while his 
 mother, the ould policizing Marchioness, is setting 
 him up for the borough of Glannacrime here. But, 
 mark my words, she needn't trouble herself ; it isn’t 
 himself will git it, with the Fitzadelm name, and the 
 Dunore interest to boot.” 
 
 “No?” said the younger traveller, for the first 
 time addressing this formidable person. 
 
 “ No, sir, its meat for his betters, why.” 
 
 “Indeed!” returned De Yere, with an ironical 
 laugh ; “ and who may they be, pray ?” 
 
 “ Councillor Con is, dear,” said Mrs. Magillicuddy, 
 coming up close to him with an air of confidential 
 familiarity, while he retreated before her advances ; 
 “ that’s Councillor Conway Townshend Crawley, ne-

 phew to Miss Crawley, and son to Portreeve of 
 Dunore. Qch ! that’s the young man will prosper, 
 why ! Mark my words, and you’ll see them come to 
 pass yet,” 
 
 While this short dialogue was carrying on, the 
 eyes of the Commodore were glancing rapidly from 
 the features of the late baron to the face and figure 
 of his young companion; but when De Vere turned 
 round to him, he abruptly averted them, and took up 
 a parchment label which hung from one of the mas- 
 sive brass handles of the antiquated japan chest : the 
 inscription on it was curious, and ran as follows : 
 •“This travelling chest was presented by his most 
 sacred Majesty Charles the Second to Barbara, 
 Duchess of Cleveland, who bequeathed it at her death 
 in 1691 to her kinswoman, the Lady Geraldine Fitz- 
 adelm; she married in 1701 Thomas, Marquis of 
 Dunore, her uterine cousin, and died, leaving issue an 
 only daughter, 1730.” 
 
 “ I wonder this most valuable relic is suffered to 
 remain here,” observed the Commodore. 
 
 “ Och !” said Mrs. Magillicuddy, who seemed all 
 care and eye to everything that was said and looked, 
 “och, when everything went to sixes and sevens, 
 why ! and all was ruination, the Black Baron dying 
 in a garret in Dublin, and his brother that came to 
 the title abroad, it was little regard was paid to the 
 likes of that. But it is now to go by favor of Mr. 
 Crawley, who owns all, to Dunore as a present to the 
 Marchioness, whenever she comes over : there’s the 
 matting to pack it. They say it was in it was found 
 the family tree, which proved the ruined Fitzadelms 
 to be the heirs in the female line, in default of male

 issue, to the title and estate of Dunore ; and to this 
 day there is some curious papers in it. Perhaps, gen- 
 tlemen, yez would like to see them ?” 
 
 “ Oh very much 1” was the instantaneous reply of 
 both. Mrs. Magillicuddy now foraged to the very | 
 bottom of her capacious pockets for the keys, crying : * 
 
 “ Weary on them for keys, they are always missing 
 when wanting;” then suddenly recollecting she had ; 
 hung them in a closet, she scudded off to fetch them. 
 
 The strangers again turned their observation to the 
 portraits of the Lords Fitzadelms : but Mrs. Magilli- 
 cuddy had been scarcely more than two or three mi- 
 nutes gone, when a female voice, with all the flute- j 
 like sweetness of the tones of youth, breathed a few 
 clear melodious notes on their ear, as if some skilful 
 musician was running a preclusive division with equal 
 taste and judgment : but the sounds, prolonged for a I 
 minute or two, were as abruptly dropped as begun, j 
 and all was silence. The rude war-cry of the Fitz- 
 adelms, or the howl of the long-extirpated Irish wolf, 
 would have excited less amazement in the minds of 
 the auditors than these sweet and most musical 
 strains. By their expressive looks they seemed al- 
 most to doubt their own senses; and they remained j 
 for a considerable time silent, and in the attitude of 
 eager and expecting attention. Nearly a quarter of 
 an hour thus elapsed, yet all remained silent. 
 
 “ Did ever mortal mixture of earth’s mould breathe 
 forth such sweet enchanting harmony ?” asked De 
 Vere, entranced. 
 
 “ It seemed to come in a direct line from behind 
 that fragment of tapestry,” observed the Commodore; 
 and he immediately raised the remains of what once

 had been a handsome specimen of the Gobelin manu- 
 facture. It had concealed a small iron door, above 
 which was written “ Evidence Chamber.” The 
 strangers both looked alternately, and for a consider- 
 able time through the spacious keyhole, and dis- 
 covered a small rude chamber, dimly lighted by a 
 loophole, and perfectly empty. After some time 
 they looked out of the window, which Mrs. Magilli- 
 cuddy had called King James’s, and found that this 
 Evidence Chamber formed part of the original build- 
 ing called Desmond’s Tower. Their joint thought 
 . was to leap out of the window, and to examine this 
 tower, which appeared to lie open, and to be partly 
 in ruins. But the steepness of the rocks rendered 
 such an attempt impossible. 
 
 The shortest and surest way to discover the mys- 
 tery (for a mystery of the most romantic nature it 
 was asserted to be by De Vere) was to make inqui- 
 ries of the old housekeeper relative to the songstress 
 of these ruined towers. But Mrs. Magillicuddy, 
 though twenty minutes had elapsed, had not returned ; 
 and when they went to seek her, to their amazement 
 and consternation they found the door locked or 
 bolted, and beyond their power to open or force. 
 De Vere threw himself on the broken chair lately oc- 
 cupied by the housekeeper in an ecstacy of emotion ; 
 his companion, on the contrary, displeased, annoyed, 
 and irritated as much as astonished, sought round the 
 room for some mode of egress in impatience and per- 
 turbation. A door on one side opened into a dark 
 closet ; two windows opposite to the king’s casement 
 he tried with considerable strength, but they were 
 nailed down. A third, more manageable, was opened

 with difficulty, for the pullies were broken. It was, 
 however, at length opened, and supported by a 
 broken picture-frame. It communicated with one of 
 the ruined terraces hanging over the river, and cut 
 out of the rock. The height, which was considerable, 
 was easily cleared ; but the way to the front of the 
 house was intricate, and not easily found. The nar- 
 row irregular path was choked with briers, with the 
 stumps of old trees recently cut down, and lying at 
 full length, and with fragments of the original ruined 
 building, which had fallen in abundance. 
 
 As they proceeded through the entangled screen 
 of underwood and briers, they caught a view of a 
 man seated in a cot (6), on the river near a salmon 
 weir, whose curious construction, with the picturesque 
 appearance of the patient fisherman himself, would at 
 any other time have attracted their attention. It 
 was now, however, chiefly given to their obstructed 
 and difficult pathway, by which they at last reached 
 the front of this irregular and stupendous mansion. 
 
 To their increased amazement, they found the hall- 
 door again barred up. Every mode of ingress 
 seemed closed, as when they had first approached it. 
 Their chaise and its driver had alike disappeared; 
 and the little Kerry horse, with the Commodore’s 
 valise strapped on his back, was fastened to a tree, 
 and stood peaceably grazing within the length of his 
 bridle ; while the portmanteau of De Yere was placed 
 near it, on a clump of rock. 
 
 The travellers remained for a moment looking at 
 each other in silence, till De Vere burst into a fit of 
 laughter, anything rather than the ebullition of gaiety. 
 It was almost hysterical, and the pure effect of over-

 127 
 
 excitement ; when it had in some degree subsided, 
 he said — 
 
 “ So, this is indeed the delightful 1 land of faery, 
 which Spenser has described, in which he wrote, in 
 which he was inspired. Here his Gloriana seems still 
 to fling about her spells ; and new adventures appear 
 in ready preparation for other Sir Calidores and Sir 
 Tristrams, than those of his creation.” 
 
 “ Had we not better,” said the Commodore, who 
 for the moment was stunned by the event, which, 
 though not of superhuman agency, appeared in his 
 mind scarcely less comprehensible ; “ had we not 
 better go to the porter’s lodge, and make some inqui- 
 ries there ?” 
 
 “ Oh ! certainly. But you must not be surprised if 
 the lodge, the portress, and the idiot, are all vanished, 
 together with Mrs. Magillicuddy, Mr. Owny, and the 
 chaise and horses.” 
 
 The lodge, the portress, and the idiot, remained, 
 however, as they left them. The old woman was 
 seated upright in her wretched bed, with a red petti- 
 coat over her shoulders, and employed in knitting. 
 To the repeated questions of the travellers, she re- 
 plied, “ Nil gaelig a” I have no English* Nor could 
 either of them obtain the least information from her. 
 The idiot, when they approached her, laughed and 
 fled.. 
 
 Hopeless of information, they walked back to the 
 spot where the horse and their light luggage had been 
 left. There was something peculiarly singular, and 
 almost laughably pantomimic, in this adventure, 
 which amused, though it almost provoked the Com-

 modore ; while it defied conjecture to detect the 
 cause of its occurrence. He had reason to believe 
 that his name person, and very existence, were un- 
 known in Ireland ; yet the league of the old woman 
 and driver could not be without object, nor the whole 
 event without motive : it was evidently unconnected 
 with any sordid or dishonest view. The housekeeper 
 had not been remunerated for her trouble, nor the 
 driver for his horses or attendance. Rapid in his 
 silent cogitations, and quick in his decisions, he at 
 once determined that the object of this farcial im- 
 broglio was the fanciful and accomplished idealist, 
 with whom he was accidentally connected ; and giving 
 further conjecture to the winds, after a few minutes’ 
 reverie, he proposed that they should hail the fisher- 
 man at the weir, engage him to convey the younger 
 traveller down the river, as near as he could to Done- 
 raile or Buttevant : for himself as the day advanced, 
 and time pressed, he determined to mount his Kerry 
 steed, and proceed by the mountain route he had ob- 
 tained from Owny to Dunore. 
 
 To all these arrangements De Yere passively as- 
 sented ; and while the Commodore, with the activity 
 of boyhood, bounded down the precipitous rocks to 
 beckon the fisherman towards the shore, his compa- 
 nion, with folded arms, and eyes fixed upon vacuity, 
 stood the image of one, whom 
 
 “ Function is smothered in surprise, 
 
 And nothing is hut what is not.” 
 
 The events of his journey had combined them- 
 selves in his mind under the influence of the most 
 morbid imagination, and the most inordinate self-love. 
 His vanity and his fancy had worked out a series of 
 


## p. 129 (#135) ############################################

 129 
 
 associations and conjectures most favorable to the 
 character of both. Every event, every object, how- 
 ever unimportant in itself, was by him wrought into 
 a miracle, or meditated into a mystery, through the 
 medium of his singularly organized mind. From 
 trifles “ light as air,” he had the unhappy power of 
 constructing fabrications of ideal pain and pleasure, 
 of flattering or mortifying importance, which render- 
 ed him the victim of delusion, and covered the pros- 
 perous realities of his life with shadows, alike illusory 
 and unsubstantial. The perverseness of his journey 
 from Dublin, the counteraction of his intentions with 
 respect to his route, the impish laugh in the ruins of 
 Holycross, his unintentional visit to Court Fitzadelm, 
 the invisible musician of the Evidence Chamber, his 
 reiterated contact with the formidable Mrs. Magilli- 
 cuddy, the youthful figure of the female associated 
 with her at Lis-na-sleugh, the masquerading mystery 
 of the driver, and above all, the league evidently sub- 
 I sisting between the old woman and Owny, and their 
 
 I sudden disappearance from Court Fitzadelm, unre- 
 munerated for their respective services ; all these in- 
 cidents so strange, so unexpected, combined them- 
 selves in his meditations, till he believed himself 
 caught in a thraldom, like that “ Dove in clolce pri- 
 gione , Rinaldo stassi ,” the object of some deep-laid 
 project, of some romantic design, in which there 
 'would be little to mortify his vanity, or to disappoint 
 his feelings. 
 
 He had resolved, in his own mind, to take up his 
 residence in the neighborhood of the Court, and there 
 await the issue of an adventure of which he alone 
 could be the object. Notwithstanding his very

 ardent admiration for his companion, and the personal 
 distinction, and almost heroical cast of character and 
 physiognomy of the extraordinary stranger, it never 
 once suggested itself that he also might have had 
 some share in this extraordinary event. He himself 
 was alone the hero of his own thoughts ; and, with 
 the hypochondriacal egotism of Rousseau, he believed 
 himself an object of occupation, of amity or enmity to 
 the whole world. 
 
 This train of thought was, however, soon broken,, 
 by the return of the Commodore, followed by the 
 fisherman,, who took charge of his valise, and stowed 
 it in his little boat. He had engaged to row the 
 younger traveller down the river, to its confluence 
 wdth the Avonheg, which ran by Doneraile, and 
 which was the oft-celebrated Mulla of Spenser, where 
 “ On each willow hung a muse’s lyre.” 
 
 But the the curiosity and interest excited by Kiieole- 
 man, the Mole, and the Mulla, were now absorbed in 
 feelings of a profounder emotion ; and his approxima- 
 tion to the shrine of his pilgrimage no longer awakened 
 transports in the mind of the fanciful pilgrim. 
 
 As the travellers walked together to the river’s 
 side, the elder observed, “T have been making in- 
 quiries from the fisherman; and it appears that an 
 old woman, who had the epithet of Protestant Moll,* 
 and kept the mansion, where there is nothing to 
 tempt to depredation, has been dead for some weeks. 
 The house is unoccupied, and the approach by which 
 we entered is the least frequented, there being sev- 
 eral others, all open. Mrs. Magillicuddy is, therefore,, 
 some Ariel 1 correspondent command,’ of a concealed 
 Prospero*”

 “ Ariel!” reiterated De Vere; “ the foul witch Sy- 
 corax, rather.” 
 
 “Now, plaze your honor,” said the boatman, as he 
 drew up his boat close to a ruin, which he called the 
 battery. With some difficulty, De Vere was placed 
 in the cot, which was one of the smallest construction 
 known by that name. The boatman, with his spoon- 
 shaped paddle fixed against a jutting rock, for a point 
 d'appui , was pushing offi from the muddy shore, the 
 figure of the Commodore was thrown into muscular 
 exertion in endeavoring to assist, and the cot was 
 just afloat, as he seized the extended hand of his un- 
 known fellow-traveller. 
 
 “We part,” said De Vere, in a tone of emotion, 
 “ almost as we met.” 
 
 “ Almost,” replied the Commodore, returning the 
 strong pressure of his hand, with a grasp still stronger, 
 but in a tone not firmer. 
 
 “Farewell, farewell!” repeated De Vere, as the 
 boat cleared the banks ; and he moved his hat, with 
 an air of almost affectionate respect, half repressed by 
 habitual apathy. 
 
 “ Farewell !” r earned the Commodore, with a 
 mingled expression of courteousness and cordiality, 
 returning the salute. 
 
 The little bark glided into the centre of the sunny 
 stream. He whom it left behind in scenes so dreary 
 ascended the point of a rock, which commanded the 
 winding of the river : his eye pursued the cot, as its 
 paddles threw up the sparkling waters, and as it ap- 
 peared and disappeared amongst the projecting cliffs, 
 or glided under the shady alders, fringing the lovely 
 shores of the Avon-Fienne. It soon became a black

 speck in the water, and finally disappeared in a bend 
 of the river. 
 
 The Commodore, with a short involuntary sigh, 
 turned away his dazzled gaze. The gloomy, desolate 
 demesne of Court Fitzadelm spread around him — he 
 the sole occupant. “ Alone !” he exclaimed aloud — - 
 “ once more alone, and where ?” He glanced eagerly, 
 anxiously, almost wildly round him. His respiration 
 was short : emotions, long repressed, seemed to find 
 vent : he threw up his eyes to heaven, and clasped 
 his hands, almost convulsively : years and scenes of 
 distance and remoteness passed, in thick coming 
 visions before his coming; then by a sudden effort of 
 volition, as one 
 
 “ Not framed upon the torture of the mind 
 To lie in restless ecstacy,” 
 
 he changed at once his mode of thought, and elevated 
 position; and descending rapidly from the rock, 
 sprung upon his horse, galloped towards the dis- 
 mantled park wall, cleared it at a leap, and proceeded 
 on his way to the Peninsula of Dunore. 
 
 Whatever was the mission of this mysterious visit- 
 ant, to a country for which he evinced so deep an in- 
 terest, he seemed to forbid time’s anticipation of his 
 views ; and in all things, and upon all occasions, ap- 
 peared habitually to act as one who thought 
 “ The flighty purpose never is o’ertook, 
 
 Unless the deed go with it,”

 But I have cause to pry into this pendant. 
 
 Taming of the Shrew. 
 
 The Commodore pursued his solitary way to the 
 Peninsula of Dunore with as much rapidity as the 
 nature of this mountainous road would admit. He 
 had inquired the route both from the baccah and the 
 driver ; and to their various, and not always accord- 
 ant instructions, clearly arranged in his memory, he 
 added his own judgment, and such information as he 
 could occasionally glean from the passengers he acci- 
 dentally met. These, however, were few ; for as he 
 proceeded among the mountains, by roads only pas- 
 sable during the autumn, the population was so scanty, 
 that in the course of many miles, ambled over by his 
 admirable little steed, he met only with three indivi- 
 duals ; a boy carrying a couple of chickens for sale to 
 a distant market, a woman with a few hanks of yarn, 
 proceeding to the same rustic emporium, and a priest, 
 bearing the viaticum to a dying penitent, whose 
 temptations to err, amid scenes of such privation, 
 could not have been very numerous. 
 
 The priest courteously joined, and accompanied the 
 lonely traveller on his route ; and might have been 
 deemed an acceptable cicerone in a region which,

 however rude and savage, was not wholly destitute 
 of something like classic interest. In the dialect and 
 accent of the province, intermingled with a few 
 French and a few Latin words, he pointed out, here 
 a Cromlech, and there a cairne, a Danish fort, or a 
 monastic ruin ; and added such scraps of antiquarian 
 tradition as are to be found, even in the remotest 
 places in Ireland. The legend of St. Gian’s cap was 
 repeated, as a distant view was caught of St. Gian’s 
 Abbey. Its miraculous efficacy, still acknowledged 
 by the peasantry, and the belief of its having returned 
 of itself to the spot whence (though composed of an 
 immense hollow stone) it had been removed, were 
 circumstantially recorded. One of the defile castles 
 of the great Maearthies, The Fairie’s Rock, or Carig- 
 na-Souky, was pointed out, in the distance, on the 
 summit of a cliff, which hung above the ravine it 
 guarded. The ruins of St. Gobnate’s Church, rather 
 guessed at than clearly distinguished, introduced the 
 legend of that fair saint, with the episode of the his- 
 tory of the stone cross, still extant among its ruins y 
 where a far-famed rood of the Virgin was once kept, 
 and where still a stone, fixed near it in the earth, 
 exhibits the impression of many a penitent pilgrim’s 
 bended knee. 
 
 For the rest, the communicative and courteous 
 priest gave the Commodore some excellent instruc- 
 tions as to his future route, and lamented that he had 
 not taken a road, which, though more circuitous by 
 nearly a day’s journey, was far less intricate than the 
 one he had chosen. This he asserted to be a bird’s 
 flight route from the north to the south of the coun- 
 try, a bridle- way or car-track, cut, time immemorial,

 by the mountaineers, for the purposes of rural econo- 
 my, and communicating among the neighboring dis- 
 tricts. 
 
 At the conjunction of four of these mountain defiles, 
 marked by a large stone cross, placed over a holy 
 well hung with ragged offerings, the priest departed, 
 with a cordial benedicite , and a bow learned in his 
 French college, some thirty years before, but not yet 
 forgotten in the wild scenes, where his laborious and 
 ill-requited calling placed him. 
 
 The traveller, again left alone, proceeded by the 
 direction of the priest to a little mountainous village, 
 called the Town of the Beloved, in Irish, Bally-na- 
 vourna. It was silent and solitary, and seemed to 
 sleep in the noontide sunshine, as if placed there only 
 to form a pretty feature in the romantic scenery. Its 
 inhabitants were all abroad in a neighboring valley, 
 getting in their scanty harvest. When the Commo- 
 dore, after resting and bating his horse at a little 
 public house, lost sight of its moss-covered roofs and 
 curling smoke, no further vestige of human habita- 
 tion cheered his sight for many hours. Meantime his 
 road became every moment more rugged, wild and 
 difficult. The extraordinary instinct of the little ani- 
 mal upon which he was mounted (and which seemed 
 as peculiarly organized for the region it occupied as 
 is the camel for the desert, or the reindeer for the 
 snows of Lapland), excited an admiration not unmixed 
 with gratitude and respect. The traveller, rather 
 abandoning himself to its guidance, than attempting 
 to direct its steps, fearlessly permitted it to climb 
 among the rugged rocks, to skim over trembling bogs 
 and sloughy morasses : it still preserved its pleasant

 ambling pace, where other horses would have sunk 
 knee-deep, and was able to proceed where they would 
 have perished. 
 
 The sun was now hastening to its goal ; the few 
 birds of prey which inhabit these elevated regions 
 were returning to their eyries among the rocks. The 
 traveller had still to seek the landmarks, which the 
 priest had described as designating his descent to the 
 Peninsula of Dunore. He indeed caught glimpses 
 of the Atlantic ocean, through the interstices of the 
 mountains ; but the evening shadows were gathering 
 in vapors beneath his feet, as he descended, and yet 
 he approached not the mountain’s base. That he had 
 missed his way, and might be benighted in a region 
 so desolate, had suggested itself as a possibility ; and 
 he alighted for the purpose of ascending a high cliff, 
 which seemed to command a vast extent Of prospect, 
 to ascertain his exact position. 
 
 As he was in the act of fastening his' horse’s bridle 
 to th£ stump of a furze bush, sounds, measured and 
 mechanical, met his ear, and spoke of human prox- 
 imity ; they came from a little glen, near whose en- 
 trance he stood. A narrow bridle-way, leading 
 through a deep ravine, presented itself : on the sum- 
 mit of a stupendous rock, some fragments of a ruin 
 were visible; and beneath, seated in a sort of dry 
 dyke, appeared a man occupied in scraping away with 
 a sharp flint the lichens and mosses which incrusted 
 a large angular stone, in order to decipher an inscrip- 
 tion which he was endeavoring to copy. The char- 
 acters were Irish, and beneath appeared a translation, 
 in not very pure Latin, intimating that “ near to this

 PLACE, AT THE CASTLE OE MACARTHY, THE STRANGER WILL 
 RECEIVE AN HUNDRED THOUSAND WELCOMES.”* 
 
 The person who was engaged in this antiquarian 
 occupation was so intent upon his task, that the ap- 
 proach of a stranger was unobserved : the Commo- 
 dore stood gazing upon him with a look of singular 
 and marked expression, as if he too was penetrating 
 through the veil of time, and gradually recalling 
 traces and deciphering lineaments, which its moulder- 
 ing finger had touched with decay, but not wholly 
 defaced. There was an emotion of tenderness soften- 
 ing his countenance, as he gazed, foreign to its 
 habitual expression ; and when, leaning forward, 
 he read aloud the Latin, and added the comment of — 
 “ I believe there is a false concord in that sentence,” 
 his full deep voice wanted its usual tone of firmness 
 and decision. 
 
 As he spoke, the flint dropped from the hand of the 
 solitary sage, and he remained for a moment in the 
 motionless position of surprise, tinctured with appre- 
 hension, as if some “ airy voice, that syllables men’s 
 names,” had suddenly addressed his unexpecting ear. 
 
 The traveller saw the effect he had produced, and 
 endeavored to counteract its consequences by as- 
 suming a careless and familiar tone. 
 
 * “ I beg your pardon,” he said, “ for this intrusion 
 
 on your learned researches : I am a stranger in this 
 country, and I fear have lost my way ; I wish to reach 
 the town of Dunore before nightfall, and you will ren- 
 der me a service by pointing out to me the nearest 
 road.” 
 
 * A similar inscription was found in a ditch near the ruined 
 castle of the Macswines in Munster,

 This speech, evidently, recalled courage and confi- 
 dence iii him to whom it was addressed; and he 
 slowly arose, putting the flint into his pocket, a cork 
 into the ink-horn pendant from his button-hole, and 
 fastening a roll of paper and a pen into the cord of 
 his hat^ while he repeated : 
 
 “ A false concord, sure enough;— a stranger in the 
 country !” 
 
 He was now on his feet: the Commodore stood 
 opposite to him, with his back to the setting sun, his 
 figure cutting darkly against its brightness ; his face 
 and features in deep shadow. The yellow light of the 
 illuminated horizon bronzed the grotesque figure of 
 him on whom he gazed. This person was of a low 
 and clumsy stature ; but, though evidently passed the 
 middle age of life, was still strong and hale ; the deep 
 crimson of health burned on his slightly furrowed 
 cheek ; and his countenance gave indications of mingled 
 simplicity and acuteness. There was also a certain in- 
 describable, quaint, solemn, dogmatizing importance in 
 his look, and a wandering wildness in his eye, which 
 were curiously and strongly contrasted; while his 
 costume added to the characteristic peculiarity of his 
 person. A very small wig of goat’s hair surmounted 
 a few thick, bushy gray locks, which curled round his 
 short neck, for his shirt collar was thrown open, and 
 three coats of frieze, of various colors, excluded, like 
 the cloak of the fabulist, both wind and sun. As he 
 now stood, affecting to button up these coats, one 
 after the other, he was, in fact, earnestly engaged in 
 endeavoring to make out the traveller’s features, on 
 which his eyes were intently fixed.

 “ It’s long,” lie at last observed, “ since your honor 
 was in these parts.” 
 
 u I never have been in this district before,” was the 
 reply. 
 
 “ Haven’t you, sir ? then I renag e* my remark, and 
 requist your honor’s pardon. I’ll show you the way 
 to Dunore, sir. I’m going it every rood myself, and 
 lives a donny taste beyont it.” 
 
 As he spoke, he shifted his position, with the inten- 
 tion of obtaining a better view of the stranger’s face ; 
 but apparently, in order to draw forth a ragged colt 
 from a rocky shed : the Commodore at the same mo- 
 ment shifted his, and led forward his Kerry steed. 
 
 “ That’s a reyal Asturiones ,” observed his new com- 
 panion, “ and comes of a breed of jennets, brought 
 over by us from Spain, on our way from Phoenicia : 
 they are named Hobillers by Paulus J ovius, and Auto- 
 mates by Toumefort: they are of pace aisy, and in 
 ambling wondrous swift. It’s little the English Ed- 
 ward would have done at the seige of Calais but for 
 them same Irish Hoblers. Not that we were be* 
 holden to the likes of them, having our war steeds 
 and our chariots, 
 
 • Infroenant alii currus aut corpora saltu 
 Subjiciunt in equos.’ ” 
 
 He was now mounted on the back of his own 
 steed ; and his eyes were turned with a fixed look on 
 the Commodore’s marked profile, who rode with his 
 head somewhat averted beside him; the view he thus 
 obtained was dim and uncertain ; but still it seemed 
 to fix his attention. There was, as he gazed, an un- 
 certainty in his look ; a something of slow, doubtful, 
 
 * Renage, revoke, recall.

 vague recognition, as if the faint and indistinct re- 
 semblance of some features, once known, were cross- 
 ing his apprehension, — now lost, now caught, — deter- 
 mined by a light, a shadow, or a motion ; and flitting 
 as soon as seized. As they descended into the deep- 
 ening twilight of the glen, the obscurity of half-for- 
 gotten traits thickened into darkness ; the clue of as- 
 sociation was lost, and the hitherto silent spectator 
 withdrew his eyes, with the simple observation : 
 
 “ I could swear upon my soul’s savetie, that I had 
 seen your honor afore, sir : I disremembers me where; 
 but that cometh of my memory, which faileth me for 
 present things, — forgetting by times that my own 
 name is Terence Oge O’Leary, which is remarkable.” 
 
 “ O’Leary !” re-echoed the Commodore, in a voice 
 of almost boyish softness and extreme emotion. 
 
 “ Who calls ?” exclaimed O’Leary, wildly, and sud- 
 denly checking his horse : “ Who calls ?” he repeated, 
 turning full round, and throwing his strained and 
 wandering eye in every direction. 
 
 “•It was I who repeated the name you announced 
 to me, Mr. O’Leary,” said the Commodore, in an al- 
 tered and careless tone. 
 
 “Was it, your honor?” resumed O’Leary, after a 
 pause, and a deep inspiration. “ I thought it sound- 
 ed like a voice I sometimes hear close in my ear, sir, 
 when I am alone in the mountains. They tell me ’tis 
 my fetch ;* but I have heard it these twenty years, 
 and am to the fore still — it’s no fetch,” he added with 
 a deep sigh : “ it’s only an ould remembrance.” 
 
 * It is a common superstition in Ireland to believe that a 
 mysterious voice heard in lonely places gives notice of approach- 
 ’ ing death — it is called a fetch.

 His head sunk upon his breast, and they proceeded 
 in silence to the edge of the glen, which terminated 
 abruptly in a sloping surface of rich and mossy turf : 
 beyond, the sea-bathed track of land, called the 
 Peninsula of Dunore, spread at the mountain’s foot, 
 extending to the ocean, undulating with green slopes 
 intermingled with rocky elevations, and combining 
 many views of maritime and inland scenery, eminent- 
 ly beautiful and romantic. The descent, however, 
 was so ste^p, and so difficult from its smoothness, 
 that the travellers alighted and led their horses. 
 
 “ There, forenent you, lieth Dunore, as it is called 
 now,” said O'Leary, with emphasis ; “ one of the 
 tongues of land on the coast of Munster, so named 
 by one Mr. Camden, a Saxon churl. But its true and 
 ancient name is Danganny-Carthy, the fastness of the 
 Macarthies, the kings of the country round, of the 
 Coriandri and the Desmondii, and blood relations to 
 the Tyrian Hercules, every mother’s son of them.” 
 
 “ Indeed ! that is an illustrious descent.” 
 
 “ Troth, and deed ; for was not Malech-Cartha the 
 King of Tyre, says ould Bochart ; which manes 
 Malacchi Macarthy ; that’s plain, I believe, anyhow : 
 and defies Geraldus Cambrensis, Dr. Ledwich, and 
 Sir Richard Musgrave, with ould Saxo Grammaticus 
 to boot, to deny that : and would have been kings of 
 Desmond to this very hour, if right was afore might ; 
 and only for the enticing bates of the English to en- 
 trap them in their politics, their plots, and their com- 
 plots — their playing fast and loose, their English 
 earldoms and English patents, their grantees, and 
 protectees, and governorships, until the Macarthies 
 degenerated with the rest, from their ancestors, and

 never rose to great power from that day forth — that’s

 Englishman’s hate,* elected to the style and authority 
 of Macarthy More, 1599, even after he descended to 
 be made Earl Clancare, anno 1565, Elizab. Reginse 
 sex.” 
 
 “ Florence ?” said the Commodore, dwelling with 
 a peculiar expression on the name. “ Florence then 
 is a name given both to the males and females of this 
 illlustrious family ?” 
 
 “ It is, plaze your honor, and comes from the Span- 
 ish name Florianus, which the Macarthies brought 
 with them on their way from Scythia, as also the 
 O’Sullivan Bears.” 
 
 V 
 
 “ It is an Italian name also ; and one Florianus del 
 Campo has, I believe, written on this country,” said 
 the Commodore. 
 
 “He has, sir, — belied the land, like the rest of them,” 
 replied O’Leary. 
 
 “ The Macarthies followed the fortunes of the 
 House of Stuart, I believe, Mr. O’Leary ; at least I 
 have somewhere read so.” 
 
 “ They did, sir, to their great moan. Of all the re- 
 giments after the surrender of Conde, Maearthy’s 
 alone refused entering the Spanish service, till their 
 colonel got his dismissal in France, from the ra’al 
 King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.” 
 
 “ They have, however, since distinguished them- 
 selves in the service of Spain ; and even in the popu- 
 lar cause of South America.” 
 
 “ They have, sir, and everywhere but at home, God 
 help ’em, for a raison they have.”

 “Do any of the family now remain in this country ?” 
 
 “None at all,” said O’Leary; and then, after a 
 pause, added “ barring the Bhan-Tierna , who isn't in 
 it at this present.” 
 
 “ Ha ! I have heard that epithet, accompanied by 
 blessings in the mountains of the Galtees : to whom 
 does it belong?” 
 
 “ To whom does it belong, is it ? — why, to whom 
 should it, but to the great, ould, ancient Countess of 
 Clancare, anno 1565, Elizabeth® 6. But sure what 
 signifies talking about them now. You may see it all 
 in my Geneaological History of the Macarthy More, 
 written in the Phoenician tongue, vulgo vocato Irish, 
 it being more precise and copious than the English, 
 and other barbarous dialects ; also sharp and senten- 
 tious, offering great occasion to quick apothegm, and 
 proper allusion ; the only pure dialect remaining of 
 the seventy-two languages of Babel, introduced into 
 Ireland by Finiusa Tarsa, the son of Magog, King of 
 Scythia, from his own seminary of Magh-Seanair, near 
 Athens ; and is to this day the ould language spoken 
 by Hannibal, Hamilcar, Asdrubal, and the Macarthies 
 More of county Cork and Kerry, anciently Desmond 
 — and taught in my seminary in the ould preceptory 
 of Monaster-ny-Oriel, according to the Bethluisnion-* 
 na-Ogma, with Latin and Greek, and other modern 
 dialects.” 
 
 “And yet,” said the Commodore, with an half-re- 
 pressed smile, “ there are some skeptics of opinion 
 that there has always existed a certain identity be- 
 tween the Irish and the Anglo-Saxon ; that in fact the 
 Irish received their ancient alphabet from the Britons; 
 and that their pretensions to an Eastern origin is a

 groundless notion, generated in ignorance, and idly 
 cherished by a mistaken patriotism, which might bo 
 better directed.” 
 
 “ Oh murther !” exclaimed O’Leary, clasping his 
 hands : “ the thieves of the world !” 
 
 0 tribus Anticyris caput insanabile !” 
 
 Then suddenly mounting his horse, with a look of 
 mingled indignation and pity, directed at his unknown 
 companion, he added, pointing to a road which wound 
 down a woody hill, “ there’s your vray, sir, to Dunore 
 town. If you crass the river at Bally dab bridge, you 
 can’t miss it.” 
 
 He was trotting off, muttering to himself some 
 broken exclamations in Irish, when the Commodore, 
 who also had resumed his horse, followed him, and 
 said . 
 
 “ In detailing the opinions of others, I do not give 
 them to you, Mr. O’Leary, as my own : you are to ob- 
 serve, I speak not to dictate, but to learn.” 
 
 “ Why, then, sir,” said O’Leary, soothed by this 
 conciliatory observation, “I’d be loath to see the likes 
 of you, or any gentleman, enticed by them traitors of 
 the world, who come as espials on the land, and go 
 forth to defame it; for sorrow one of them English 
 but hate Ireland in their hearts ; and there’s an ould 
 saying in Irish, which manes, ‘ keep clear of an Eng- 
 lishman, for he is on the watch to deceive you.’ I 
 wouldn’t give a testoon* for the whole boiling of

 they might as well take St. Patrick from us, and deny 
 that the potato is the plant of the soil .' 5 
 
 “ I am afraid, Mr. O Leary, they would go near to 
 do both.” 
 
 “ Oh ! very well, sir : I see you are one of them 
 that would go ould Strabo on us, and Saxo Gramma- 
 ticus, and Dr. Ledwich.” 
 
 “ Nay, I speak as one ignorant of the subject, and 
 desirous to obtain information. If there were now, 
 as formerly, such seminaries to study in as the school 
 of Ross Alethri,* or such sages to study under as 
 those sought for by the learned Monk Ealfrith, who 
 came from Britain for that purpose, I should like to 
 become his disciple.” 
 
 “ To say nothing,” said O’Leary, “ of Agelbert, 
 bishop of the west Saxons, Alfred, king of Northum- 
 berland, and the blessed father Egbert, and the saintly 
 brother Wiglert, who, for the love of the celestial 
 isle, quit their kin and country, and retired to Ireland 
 to study.” • 
 
 “But what cell,” asked the Commodore with 
 emphasis, “ what preceptory, what academy is there 
 now open to the lover of Irish antiquities, where 
 learning and retirement could for an adequate com- 
 pensation be obtained together by a stranger, who 
 thirsts for both ?” 
 
 “ There is,” said O’Leary, after a short pause, and 
 in a voice full of importance, as he drew up close to 
 his companion, “ there is, plaze your honor, a place 
 called the Monaster-ny-Oriel — an old ruin, but a larned 
 retreat. And if there was a gentleman who, for the 
 love of Ireland, would put up with homely fare, and

 be satisfied to be housel’d with an old Senachy, or 
 genealogist, why, then— — ” 
 
 “ O’Leary,” said the Commodore, laying his hand 
 familiarly on his shoulder, and eagerly interrupting 
 him, “ should you receive me as your guest and dis- 
 ciple, you wnll find me not difticult to accommodate. 
 My ostensible business in this barony is with a certain 
 Mr. Crawley, but— — ” 
 
 “ With who ?” asked O’Leary, recoiling in horror : 
 “ with one Crawley, did you say ?” 
 
 “ With Mr. Crawley, of Mount Crawley.” 
 
 “ With him, the land pirate ! Then, sir, you cannot 
 housel with me, and so I wish you luck !” 
 
 With these w~ords, O’Leary, spurring on his little 
 nag, trotted abruptly down a craggy glen, and disap- 
 peared. The Commodore stood looking after him 
 till he was out of sight, and marked the path he had 
 taken; then, with a deep-drawn inspiration (as one 
 who, after some enforced restraint, breathes freely), 
 and with a smile almost characterized by sadness, he 
 bent his course towards the town of Dunore. 
 
 As the descent of the mountain softened into an 
 undulating valley, th£ approach to this town became 
 extremely picturesque. The conjunction of many 
 mountain streams formed a considerable river, which 
 flowed under the single arch of an antique bridge, 
 covered with ivy, and standing at the entrance of the 
 poor but pretty village, announced by a turf-carrier 
 (in answer to the Commodore’s question) to be Bally- 
 dab. A rude bleak mountain, which overshadowed 
 this village, and projected into the sea, formed a bold 
 headland. 
 
 At the distance of two Irish miles, the road joined

 the high road from Cork and Dublin, and wound to 
 the left of a group of new, unfinished houses, the em- 
 bryo of some rising town, haply intended to eclipse 
 the fading glory of the decaying and ancient village 
 of Ballydab. Within a mile of Dunore, the road pro- 
 ceeded by the edge of the bay, at the head of which 
 the town stood, and then appeared to wind along the 
 coast. The town itself (once of note, and of histori- 
 cal interest) was approached by a stately avenue of 
 trees. Its ancient but well-preserved castle termi- 
 nated its narrow street, and presented a striking fea- 
 ture in a scene then tinted by the silvery rays of a 
 cloudless moon. The castle casements were lighted 
 with a fairy illumination by its beams; and the rip- 
 pling tide, tinged with the same coloring, gave a gen- 
 tle motion to a few fishing vessels, which alone occu- 
 pied a port once of considerable trade with the oppo- 
 site shores of Spain, Portugal and Italy. 
 
 As the Commodore rode up the street, it was 
 already still and noiseless, save the barking of a dog, 
 which the echo of the horse's feet had roused. Two 
 lanterns in the front of two opposite houses marked 
 the site of the rival inns. That to the right had a 
 new and gaudy sign flaunting in the breeze; and 
 under a profusion of gilding, yellow ochre and white- 
 lead, was written “ The New Dunore Arms.” 
 
 The faded sign of its inferior competitor exhibited 
 a dancing bear, scarcely distinguishable, under which 
 was written in large, fresh black letters, “ This is the 
 real ould Marquis of Dunore.” The Commodore 
 chose the real old Marquis; and a tolerable supper, 
 and a clean bed, left him nothing to repent of his 
 election.

 The next morning, fatigued by his mountain ride, 
 he rose late, and was surprised to find upon his 
 breakfast-table a note, directed “ To his honor, the 
 gentleman at the ould Bear, who arrived last night, 
 these.” He opened and read as follows : 
 
 Right Honorable, 
 
 According to the advisement of my better judg- 
 ment, I herein complie with your requist this tyme, 
 in regard of the lodgement in the Friar’s room ; vi- 
 delicet Fra Denis O'Sullivan, Superior of the Order, 
 now in Portugal, via Cork, where he bides at this 
 present writing, pending the visitation; he being 
 likely to put the autumn over in foreign parts. The 
 place thereby being vaquent, the fioor clean sanded, 
 and the stone belted window giving on the sea-coast, 
 ill-befitting your honor, howsomever, or your likes, 
 being righte worthie of Dunore Castle, which is no- 
 thing to nobody, sithe your honor think it fit. 
 Touchinge the pintion thereof, should your honor 
 consent to housel with me, it shall be left to your 
 honor’s liberalities ; the lucre of gain, but little 
 weighing ; and if there be juste cause of complaynte 
 touchinge ye unruiiness of my scholars, or any rab- 
 blement on the part of them young but larned runa- 
 gates, they shall, on your honor’s so deposing before 
 me, their plagosus Orbilius, undergoe chastisement 
 in due austeritie : so praying an answer forthwith 
 I remaine, 
 
 With humble commendations, 
 
 Your honor’s dutiful servant,

 Whatever might have caused this sudden revolu- 
 tion in the sentiments of Mr. O'Leary, it evidently 
 excited much pleasure in the person in whose favor 
 it had occurred ; and, on learning that one of O'Lea- 
 ry’s academicians, or “ larned runagates,'’ awaited 
 an answer, he sent hack a verbal one, intimating his 
 intention of riding over immediately to the Precep- 
 tory of Monaster-ny-Oriel after he had taken his 
 breakfast. 
 
 On passing through the town, on his way to 
 O'Leary’s, the Commodore was struck not only with 
 the antiquity, but with the Spanish character of its 
 architecture. 
 
 The castle, raised on a rocky elevation, and look- 
 ing down upon the town, had, in the course of cen- 
 turies, lost nothing of its feudal character. Massive 
 and heavy, this ancient edifice formed a perfect pa- 
 rallelogram, with five flankers ; its battlements, belt- 
 ings and coigmes, were of hewn stone; and its 
 strength and magnitude were, as far back as Eliza- 
 beth, so formidable, that the queen was induced to 
 think it too considerable a hold to belong to any 
 Irish subject. 
 
 The castle, town and manor of Dunore, were given 
 to Hildebrand, first Viscount of Dunore, (a connexion 
 of the great Lord Boyle’s,) by grant of James the 
 First. The English lord completed the ramparts, 
 which, under his jurisdiction, were no longer causes 
 of jealousy. He also planned the ancient bawn,* 
 made a stately avenue of trees from the town to its 
 
 * The bawn was an inclosed piece of ground, reserved for the 
 purposes of recreation and exercise. Swift’s Hamilton’s bawn 
 was one of these Irish vergers .

 portals, and placed above the arch of its entrance, in 
 letters cut in stone, and still perfectly legible — 
 
 “ God s providence 
 Is my inheritance . 77 
 
 He had also expelled the friars of Monaster-ny- 
 Oriel, one of the communities which, like many 
 others still subsisting in Ireland, had never been sup- 
 pressed; and he devoted its revenue for the pin- 
 money of his daughter-in-law ;* but still from time 
 to time some of the Order were found congregating 
 among the ruins of the building, in obedience to the 
 rules of the Order, forbidding the entire dispersion 
 of its members. 
 
 One of his descendants, William, second Earl of 
 Dunore, had visited the castle, on a tour to the south, 
 which he made during his viceregency of Ireland. 
 The present marquis, the eldest of two twin brothers, 
 had early in life suffered his susceptible imagination to 
 dwell on some affecting and curious relations of the 
 ancient and actual state of Ireland. Impressions thus 
 received wrought on his mind with an influence pro- 
 portioned to the unhappy malady, which now first 
 betrayed itself in many symptoms : of these his sym- 
 pathy for Ireland, and his determination to reside 
 in what he perpetually called “his beautiful castle,” 
 were deemed by his mother and friends among the 
 strongest. 
 
 With the uncalculating impetuosity of his disease, 
 he had ordered immense sums of money to be ex- 
 pended in repairing and ft tting what had become al- 
 most a ruin. Furniture, the most sumptuous and ap-

 propriate, had been sent from England ; and even 
 wine and plate had arrived, and been stowed in the 
 long-unused cellars and buttery of the castle. Its 
 lord and suite had been daily expected, when his dis- 
 ease declared itself so unequivocally that the promis- 
 ing but unfortunate young nobleman w^as placed in 
 close confinement. Two years had elapsed since that 
 event; and his mother, the Marchioness Dowager of 
 Dunore, his sole guardian, and in whom centred the 
 wdiole interest and influence of the Dunore property, 
 had recently proposed visiting the castle, in order to 
 set up her second son, Lord Adelm, to represent the 
 neighboring borough of Glannacrime : but on some 
 
 I representations from her agent, Mr. Crawley, and 
 from his son, Councillor Conway Townsend Crawley, 
 she had suddenly given up the intention. 
 
 The castle, therefore, remained in statu quo , antique, 
 superb, and desolate, such as may be found in- every 
 province in Ireland — the ancient residence of Irish 
 chiefs, the quondam possession of English lords of the 
 
 I 1 - pale, the property of more recent patentees, or the in- 
 heritance of English-Irish absentees, known only by 
 name to the tenants they have never visited. 
 
 The traveller paused a few moments before its 
 I walls, threw his eyes rapidly over the stately edifice, 
 and then proceeded under its once fortified terrace, 
 s along the strand, to the monastic retreat of the learned 
 I O’Leary. 
 
 Monaster-ny-Oriel was one of those ecclesiastical 
 ruins in which the South of Ireland abounds ; it was 
 once of great extent, and was (in the terms of its 
 charter) given to God and to St. John the Evangelist 
 by one of the chiefs of the Macarthy family. The

 windows and arches, still in preservation, were of 
 beautiful Gothic architecture : the walls of the choir 
 remained, but it was roofless: and in the newly- 
 thatched chauntry of the Blessed Virgin, G Leary 
 held his academy, literally imaging Shakspeare’s de- 
 scription of a pedant keeping a school in a church. 
 A tower on the verge of the ruins (once a small house 
 for novices) hanging over the coast, was now called 
 the Friary of St. John, where the Order of the Do- 
 minicans was still kept up ;* it was also the tenement 
 now at O’Leary’s disposal, through the kindness of 
 its absent proprietor. 
 
 Everywhere among the ruins, the tombs of rival 
 chiefs were visible, through the wild shrubs and furze 
 that half concealed them. Here, a “ Gloria in Excel- 
 sis Deo” was raised for an English Boyle or Petty ; 
 there, a “ Giste ici — Dieu de son ame ait merci,’ for 
 some Norman de Barri or de Grosse ; and above all 
 rose the high gray stone, that in the ancient Irish 
 character pointed to the resting-place of Conal Ma- 
 carthy More, “ the swift-footed,” reposing in the 
 midst of those who had opposed, or those who had 
 betrayed him. 
 
 This scene, so solemn even when tinged with the 
 cheery lustre of the morning light, was most incon- 
 gruously disturbed by the hum of confused and nasal 
 murmurings, resembling the discord of an ill-tuned 
 bagpipe. The ear of the traveller seemed to recog- 
 nize this sound, once perhaps well known to him ; and 
 directing his steps towards the chauntry of the

 Blessed Virgin, be perceived several students stretched 
 upon the rank grass before its high-arched Saxon 
 doorway : thus reviving the picture of an Irish school, 
 given by Campion, in Queen Elizabeth’s day. The 
 ardent but barefooted disciples of the muses now (as 
 then) “ grovelling on the earth, their books at their 
 noses, themselves lying prostrate, and so chaunting 
 out their lessons piecemeal. - ’ 
 
 The breaking up of the academy took place as the 
 Commodore approached it ; a bevy of rough-headed 
 students, with books as ragged as their habiliments, 
 rushed forth at the sound of the horse’s feet, and 
 with hands shading their uncovered faces from the 
 sun, stood gazing in earnest surprise at the unexpected 
 visitant ; last of this singular group followed O'Leary 
 himself, in learned dishabille (his customary suit), an 
 old great-coat fastened with a wooden skewer at his 
 breast, the sleeves hanging unoccupied, “Spanish- 
 wise,” as he termed it ; his wig laid aside, the shaven 
 crown of his head resembling the clerical tonsure ; a 
 tattered Homer in one hand, and a slip of sallow in 
 the other, with which he had been lately distributing 
 some well-earned pandies to his pupils : thus exhibit- 
 ing, in appearance, and in the important expression 
 of his countenance, an epitome of that order of per- 
 sons once so numerous, and still far from extinct in 
 Ireland, the hedge schoolmaster. 
 
 O’Leary was learned in the antiquities and genealo- 
 gies of the great Irish families as an ancient Senachy* 
 
 * This Seanachaiahe* were antiquaries, genealogists, and his- 
 torians ; they recorded remarkable events and preserved the 
 genealogies of their patron in a kind of poetical stanza. Each 
 province prince, or chief, had a senacha : and we will venture to

 (an order of which he believed himself to be the sole 
 representative) ; credulous of her fables, and jealous 
 of her ancient glory ; ardent in his feelings, fixed in 
 his prejudices; hating the Bodei Sassoni , of English 
 churls, in proportion as he distrusted them. Living 
 only in the past, contemptuous of the present, and 
 hopeless of the future, all his national learning and 
 national vanity were employed on his history of the 
 Maoarthies More, to whom he deemed himself here- 
 ditary senachy. All his early associations and affec- 
 tions were not the less occupied with the Fitzadelm 
 family; to an heir of which he had not only been 
 foster-father, but, by a singular chain of occurrences, 
 tutor and host. Thus there existed an incongruity 
 between his prejudices and affections, that added con- 
 siderably to the natural incoherence of his wild, un- 
 regulated, ideal character. He had as much Greek 
 and Latin as generally falls to the lot of the inferior 
 Irish priesthood, an order to which he had been ori- 
 ginally destined. He spoke Irish, as his native tongue, 
 with great fluency; and English, with but little vaiia- 
 tion, as it might have been spoken in the days of 
 James or Elizabeth ; for English was with him acquired 
 by study, at no early period of life, and principally 
 
 conjecture, that in each province there was a repository, for the 
 collections of the different Seanachaiahe belonging to it, with, 
 the care of which an Ollamh-le-Seanacha was charged ; the an- 
 cient college of arms of Ulster is still maintained. — JFalker's His-

 obtained from such books as came within the black 
 letter plan of his antiquarian pursuits. 
 
 O’Leary now advanced to meet his visitant with a 
 countenance radiant with an expression of compla- 
 cency and satisfaction, not unmingled with pride and 
 importance, as he threw his eyes round on his numer- 
 ous disciples. To one of these the Commodore gave 
 his horse; and drawing his hat over his eyes, as if to 
 shade them from the sun, he placed himself under the 
 shadow of the Saxon arch, observing : 
 
 “You see, Mr. O’Leary, I very eagerly avail my- 
 self of your invitation ; but I fear I have interrupted 
 your learned avocation.” 
 
 “Not a taste, your honor, and am going to give my 
 classes a holiday, in respect of the turf, sir.* What 
 do’s yez all crowd round the gentleman for ? Did 
 never yez see a raal gentleman afore ? I’d trouble 
 yez to consider yourselves as temporary. There’s 
 great scholars among them ragged runagates, your 
 honor, poor as they look ; for though in these degen- 
 dered times you v/on’t get the childre, as formerly, to 
 talk the dead languages afore they can spake, when, 
 says Campion, they had Latin like a vulgar tongue, 
 conning in their schools of leechcraft the aphorisms 
 of Hippocrates, and the civil institutes of the facul- 
 ties, yet there are as fine scholars and good philoso- 
 phers still, sir, to be found in my seminary, as in 
 Trinity College, Dublin. Now, step forward here, 
 you Homers. ‘ Keklute meu Troes, kai Dardanoi, 
 ed’ epikouroi.’ ”

 naked feet, hustled forward.

 down the front lock of their hair to designate the 
 bow they would have made, if they had possessed 
 hats to move, now scampered off, leaping over tomb-

 stones and clearing racks; while O’Leary observed, 
 shaking his head, and looking after them, “Not one 
 of them but is sharp-witted, and has a ganius for 
 poethry, if there was any encouragement for laming 
 in these degendered times.” 
 
 Having gratified his pedagogue pride, and excused 
 the “ looped and windowed raggedness” of his pupils, 
 by extolling that which passeth show, he now turned 
 his whole attentfon on his guest, who stood shadowed 
 by the deep-arched doorcase, waiting till the last of 
 the boys had disappeared. O’Leary led the way be- 
 fore him into the interior of the chauntry, which was 
 divided into the schoolroom and his own abode; 
 then laying down his Homer and ferule, and shutting 
 the door almost to the exclusion of the light, and 
 wiping down a seat with his wig, which lay on the 
 desk, and which he afterwards placed on his head, he 
 respectfully motioned his visitor to be seated. A si- 
 lence for a moment ensued ; when O’Leary, fixing his 
 eyes into a look of expressive significance, observed, 
 in a low cautious tone : 
 
 “ I ax your lordship’s pardon for the great liberty 
 I took in calling you, sir, my lord ; thinking it due 
 discretion so to do before my scholars ; in respect of 
 your intention of biding here in casu incognito .” 
 
 “ Indeed !” said the Commodore, starting on his 
 feet ; “ for whom, then, do you take- me ?” 
 
 “For who you are — noble by blood, by birth, and 
 by descent; and, though no Irishman, but of Norman 
 breed, a true Geraldine. And though the Fitzadelms 
 are nothing to me, now, for I have shook the dust of 
 my feet at their threshold, and threw my ©uld couran *

 over the head of the last of the race that shall ever 
 give my heart a beat, or my eye a tear, yet I’d be 
 sorry that it was to say that a branch of the ould 
 tree wanted a sheltering place when I, Terence Oge 
 O'Leary, the last Irish fosterer of the family, had a 
 shed to ho ns el him under.” 
 
 “ For whom, then,” repeated the Commodore, in a 
 calmer tone than he had before asked the question, 
 “ for whom do you take me ?” 
 
 “ For Lord Adelm Fitzadelm,” replied O’Leary, 
 with a respectful bow, “ the cadet of the twin sons of 
 Gerald Baron Fitzadelm, commonly called the Red 
 Baron; himself the cadet of the father of the son, 
 
 and heir that would have been if 
 
 O’Leary paused : his voice faltered ; and after a mo- 
 ment’s silence, the Commodore observed : 
 
 “Tt is strange that you should take me for the Lord 
 Fitzadelm. For what purpose should he come incog- 
 nito into this neighborhood ?” 
 
 “ For every purpose in life, your honor, and the best 
 of purposes, to circumvent them land pirates, them 
 plot-hunters, them trianglers! them — them Crawley 
 thieves, Bachal Essu ! only let me live to see that day, 
 and then doesn’t care how soon I'm carried feet fore- 
 most to the berring ground of the pobble O’Leary,, 
 near St. Crohan’s, county Kerry : for it’s little else is 
 left for me now to live for, but to die,” 
 
 “ And for this strange tissue of improbability, what 
 grounds have you, O’Leary ? Why should Lord 
 Fitzadelm come over in disguise to circumvent, as 
 you call it, his mother’s agent ?” 
 
 “ If you don’t believe me, your honor,” interrupted 
 O’Leary, losing the supposed identity of the person he

 was addressing, in the incoherency of his always con- 
 fused ideas, “ will you believe your own eyes, sir ; 
 that’s my lord, I mane ?” 
 
 He drew forth a letter from his pocket as he spoke, 
 and the Commodore took it to the little casement, 
 and read as follows : 
 
 “ A distinguished looking stranger will shortly pre- 
 sent himself to the learned and sagacious Terence 
 Oge O’Leary : should he propose himself as a tenant 
 for the Reverend Mr. O Sullivan’s vacant apartments, 
 he will do well to accept him. Terence Oge O’Leary 
 may have heard that Lord Adelm Fitzadelm will 
 shortly be in the Peninsula of Dunore, to circumvent 
 the machinations of the Crawley fiction, and will 
 there be incognito. None but the well-wishers of the 
 Crawleys would refuse to assist Lord Adelm in a tem- 
 porary concealment, necessary for the effecting of his 
 laudable purposes.” 
 
 After a frequent and amazed perusal of this billet, 
 the Commodore demanded how this strange letter 
 reached O'Leary. 
 
 “I found it,” he replied, “ after the dawn of day.” 
 
 “ Found it ?” 
 
 “ Aye, did I, troth, and marvelled much to see it 
 fixed in the latch of the outside door of the chauntry ; 
 and was mighty loth to break the sale,* and didn’t, 
 only just skimmed round it. 
 
 The Commodore, on examining the seal, found it 
 bore the figure of a child, plucking the thorns from a 
 rose, with the motto : 
 
 Sou utile ainda que Bricando,*}’ 
 
 * Seal. 
 
 t I am useful in sportiveness.

 “And have you no idea from whom this letter 
 comes ?” asked the Commodore, after another pause, 
 and some evident perplexity of idea. 
 
 “ I have, plaze your honor, that’s your lordship, I 
 mane; every iday in life — it comes from the good 
 people — ’Often they do the likes of that kind turn by 
 their pets — ‘that’s the fairies, my lord.” 
 
 “ In this instance, however,” returned the Commo- 
 dore, smiling, “ they have done you an ill turn ; for if 
 they mean to impress you with an idea that I am 
 Lord Adelxn Fitzadelm, they most certainly deceive 
 you.” 
 
 “ Oh ! very well, sir,” returned O’Leary, with a most 
 obstinate look of incredulity, “ as your lordship will- 
 eth, that’s your honor, I mane, now, sir, if it’s sir you 
 plaze to be.” 
 
 “ Supposing,” said the Commodore, “ that even if it 
 were Lord Adehn who sought concealment under your 
 roof, surely you would not defeat his intentions by 
 persisting in giving him a title which would at once 
 reveal his rank, or at least awaken suspicion ?” 
 
 “ Is it me ! och ! I’d be very sorry ! and will be 
 bound I’ll never call your lordship my lord, if you 
 was in it till the day of judgment, only when w^e are 
 alone, sir, and nobody by, barring our two selves, and 
 can pass you as a tinnant come to bathe in the salt 
 w r ater, sir, and need never name your honor at all, sir, 
 only pass you for my lodger.” 
 
 “ You will then pass me for what I am anxious to 
 become, O’Leary ; I w T ill therefore look at the apart- 
 ment you mean me to occupy. You shall name your 
 own terms ; and I dare say you have some old dame,

 who is wont to boil a chicken, and make coffee for 
 Friar O’Sullivan, who would undertake^- — ” 
 
 “ Aye,' 7 interrupted O’Leary, eagerly, “ and who can 
 toss up an omelette, and fry a bit of fish on maigre 
 days, your honor, and was taught by Fra Denis him- 
 self, who has a mighty pretty taste that way. Och ! 
 I’ll engage we’ll table your honor well. Here, Mo* 
 riagh machree, throw me the keys of the friary.” 
 
 As he spoke, O’Leary rapped at a little blind win- 
 dow in the wall, which was instantly opened, and dis* 
 covered at once the interior of his kitchen, and an old 
 woman employed in carding* “ That’s my Giiieen,” 
 said O’Leary, taking a bunch of keys from her, and 
 opening a door opposite to that which led from the 
 road to the chauntry. The host and his new lodger 
 proceeded across a sort of grass-grown court, sur- 
 rounded by a range of cloister, still in high preserva- 
 tion, and bent their steps towards the friary. An old, 
 and apparently very feeble eagle, with a leather collar 
 round his leg, and fastened by a chain to a fragment 
 of the ruin, attracted the stranger’s attention. O’Leary 
 paused also, clasped his hands, and sighed, exclaiming : 
 “You are not long for this world, my Cumhal 
 ) honey, and leaves your bit of food for the sparrows, 
 my poor bird, that daren’t come near you oncet, my 
 king of the mountains.” 
 
 “ He looks very sick, and I think dying.” 
 
 “ Oh ! musha, the pity of him ! He’s ould and de- 
 solate like myself. It’s twenty years and more since 
 he came home to me in Dunkerron ; and when he

 brought me the eagle, sir, he that had the eye of an 
 eagle, and the spirit of an eagle,— Terence, my old 
 lad, I have brought you another pet, says he. Do 
 you mind, your honor, marking the word 1 another,’ 
 and maneing himself to be one, the sowl ! Have you, j 
 my lord, says I, for though he was then left to perish * 
 by his own kin, and was sharing my bit and sup, in ] 
 the wilds of Kerry, I always called him my lord, as 
 he was, or would have been ; and did so that day j 
 ’bove all others, for he had scarcely a skreed of his 
 ould red jacket left on him; and called him my lord, 
 in regard of the jacket. Have you, my lord, says I ; 
 and Terence, says he, you’ll be kind to this eaglet 
 (and it was fluttering on his left arm, with its blue 
 bill and golden eye), you will be kind to it for my 
 sake, and I’ll tell you why, Terence, says he, leaning 
 his right arm on mine and looking with his smile, his 
 mother s smile, in my face. The poor bird has been 
 driven from its parent’s nest, says he : I found it flut- 
 tering on a bare rock exposed and perishing. For it 
 is the nature of the eagle to chase away its young, ’ 
 when unable to supply its own wants. Want, j 
 Terence, says he, may overcome even a parent’s love. 
 The tears stood in his eyes as he spoke, for it was his 
 own story, plaze your honor, and it wasn’t with a dry : 
 cheek I heard him. And yet, says he, cheering up 
 and placing the fine young eaglet on the ground, the 
 eagle is a noble bird, Terence, and even this poor fel- 1 
 low may yet soar high; though it isn’t under a 
 parent s wing, he’ll imp his flight. Them were his 
 words, if I was dying, and that was great speaking 
 for a boy of twelve years old. But he ‘had Homer 
 and Ossian at his finger’s ends, to say nothing of Don

 While O’Leary was giving this history, the Com- 
 modore seemed shaken by some deep feeling, which, 
 however, was unobserved by O’Leary, whose atten- 
 tion was wholly occupied in striving to make the 
 bird feed, while he described its first appearance 
 under his roof. The Commdore asked, “ Of whom 
 do you speak, O’Leary ?” 
 
 “Of whom do I speak, your honor?” said O’Leary, 
 raising his head loftily; “it’s of the Honorable de 
 Montenay Fitzadelm I speak, that would have been 
 Marquis of Dunore, if he were in it the day, the only 
 son and heir of Walter Baron Fitzadelm ; it’s of your 
 father’s nephew I speak, my lord,” said O’Leary, with 
 inveteracy, and raising his voice, “his only nephew, 
 sir ; and such a nephew ! and nothing to be got by it 
 but a poor bit of a title in distant reversion ! not a 
 I scrubai in money at the time, not a cantred of land 
 then ; it was for a sound, a breath, he sowld his sowl. 
 But the curses that fell that day — ” abided he, closing 
 his hands, and grinding his teeth, while he still seemed 
 to struggle with feelings which were giving the ve- 
 hemence of insanity to his voice, nnd its wildness to 
 his look ; when the Commodore, taking off his hat, as 
 if to give coolness to his fervid brow, fixed his eye on 
 
 I him. O’Leary tottered back a few steps : his color 
 faded, his countenance lost its expression of fierce- 
 ness ; he several times drew his hand across his eyes, 
 as if to clear their vision ; then stood gazing in si-

 lence for many minutes on the face of the stranger, 
 which he now first beheld fairly revealed. 
 
 “You do not wish that the crimes of the father 
 should bring curses on his children, O'Leary,” said 
 the Commodore, in a tranquil voice, “ if indeed the 
 late Baron Fitzadelm has been guilty of crimes which 
 merit execration ?” 
 
 O’Leary remained silent : his mind seemed in abey- 
 ance : every other sense was condensed in one : his 
 lips moved, but he uttered no sound : he stood mo- 
 tionless, till his eyes, dazzled by the intensity of their 
 gaze, obliged him to press his lingers on their aching 
 lids. 
 
 “ But,” continued the Commodore, putting on his 
 hat, and losing much of the character of his face by 
 concealing its finest features, “ but, O’Leary, if you 
 persist in believing me to be Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, 
 say, is the son a well-chosen confidant of his father’s 
 misdeeds ? or if you cannot keep the secret of your 
 own indignant feelings, how may I expect you will 
 keep my secret ? that is, supposing I were the Lord 
 Adelm, or any other person, O Learv, whose interest 
 it is to keep his real name unknown, till certain pur- 
 poses be effected. The absence of discretion, O’Leary, 
 may render even the zeal of affection abortive. But 
 come, time wears, and time is precious : I will leave 
 the arrangement of the friary to your care : I must 
 now away to Mr. Crawley's. My host of Dunore 
 tells me that it will be difficult to obtain an interview 
 with your powerful portreeve after twelve ; you shall 
 show me the way to Mount Crawley, and we will 
 talk of the great Macarthies More as we walk along,

 the descendants of the Tyrian Hercules, the powerful 
 chiefs of Desmond.’ 5 
 
 The spirits of O’Leary rallied at this watchword of 
 the imagination : he looked round as one suddenly 
 awakened from some strange vision of the night, and 
 mechanically followed the stranger across the chauntry 
 into the cemetry of St. John’s, where the boy, to 
 whose care he had delivered his horse, was still lead- 
 ing it about. “ Bring your master his hat,” said the 
 Commodore, taking the reins of his horse. “You 
 shall walk a mile of the way with me, O’Leary, and 
 then return to your business, to which I must and am 
 resolved not to be an hindrance.” 
 
 The boy returned with the hat, which O’Leary suf- 
 fered him to put over his little wig, now all awry. 
 Plunged once more in deep cogitation, he walked si- 
 lently beside his new tenant, snatching at intervals an 
 eager glance at his person, and then shaking his head, 
 debating, as it were, some point within himself ; and 
 at last clasping his hands behind his back, and ex- 
 claiming aloud, as he paced on heavily — “ Sure kin 
 may liken* kin ; and no marvel in that, anyhow ; only 
 it alllies in the upper part of the face : and that was 
 his mother’s. The dark eyes, Milesian born. The 
 great O’Sullivan Bear’s daughter coming from the

 be dead, and taken from her : and a hard case it was, 
 as she said to my wife on her death-bed, God rest 
 her : for they’d ail desarted the court, barring the 
 bailiffs for the execution, laving her to die with only 
 the child’s nurse to wet her lips. 4 And a hard case it 
 is to lose one’s child, Susheen,’ said she, as she gave 
 the prayer-book that had the certificate of Mr. De 
 Montenay’s birth and marriage in it, that’s her own 
 marriage with my lord, thinking, God help her, that 
 it might be of use to the child one day (which it 
 never will), and sending it to the friar Denis O’Sulli- 
 van Finn, her own kinsman at Dunkerron, for my 
 lady was a Catholic by birth, and — — ” 
 
 “ O’Sullivan,” interrupted the Commodore, “ is still 
 in Cork, I suppose ; but the book of course lost, if 
 that were of any consequence now.” 
 
 u He is in Cork, sir, and will be till the visitation i8 
 over, and then will be in Portugal ; and the prayer- 
 book’s safe. I saw it with him the day he departed ; 
 but what matter is it ? Sure there is nothing to prove, 
 but that he was murthered fairly, that’s drowned by 
 force, vi et armis. I never will believe that he sunk 
 when his boat was overturned. Is it he that dived 
 and swam like a duck ? and often saw him, when no- 
 body would venture out, cut his way through the 
 wild waves that bate the great Skelegs, and his cot 
 overset, and a thousand ullalues raised from the shore, j 
 and rise like a barnacle from the waves, and gain the 
 land, and 1 scale the stone of pain,’ as it’s called, and 
 reach the spindle, the pilgrim’s last station (a bit of 
 rock projecting over the raging sea), the storm bating 
 wildly round him. Och ! that was a great sight. 
 Above the world he looked, and above his own lot,

 “ And he to be drowned on a fine, calm, moonlight 
 night, when he went out to chase the porpoises (for 
 that was great sport to him), and to fight the sae- 
 calves in the caves, under the headlands of Kerry.” 
 He paused and again looked earnestly in the Com- 
 i modore’s face ; who, musing, rather than listening to 
 this apostrophe of O’Leary, was walking on in a slack- 
 ened pace, with the reins of his horse rolled round 
 . his folded arms, when he suddenly asked : 
 
 “ And where does Mr. O’Sullivan live in Cork?” 
 
 “ At the Franciscan Friary,” said O’Leary : and then 
 continued, with a deep sigh, “It’s marvellous; and 
 doesn’t know where the likeness is with the hat on. 
 Only it’s the Fitzadelm mouth, anyhow — why wouldn’t, 
 it ? and minds me of the Maearthies More, and Ma- 
 carthies Reagh of Carberry, who were kin by blood 
 as by descent, marrying through other, evermore, 
 and preserving the family mouth always.” 
 
 “ Oh ! by-the-bye,” said the Commodore, abruptly, 
 and throwing off his air of abstraction, “ did not this 
 district, of Dunore belong anciently to the Macar- 
 thies ?” 
 
 “ Did it ? Is it Dunore ? — The Maearthies, kings of 
 the Coriandri, of the ancient Desmonds, the whole 
 province of Munster, late tyranni ! See there, plaze 
 your honor, behind you; that’s Dunore Castle, the 
 Dangan-ni-Carthie, the ancient fortress of the Macar- 
 thies ; now an English pale castle, as I may say ; and 
 look there to your left, near the sae, at the brow of 
 ould Clotnottyjoy ; do you see a fine ancient ould 
 castle ? Well, that’s Castle McCarthy, hanging over

 its depindency, the village of Ballydab, oncet a bishop- [ 
 ric and borough. The castle on a rock, an ellipti- 
 cal conoid, defended by a barbican to the right, and 
 the hall underneath, where Donagh Macarthy held 
 his last court-baron, and his tributaries resorted to 
 him for suit and service, the pobble O’Keefe and the 
 pobble O’Leary.” 
 
 “ I see nothing but a small square building on the 
 mountain’s brow,” replied his companion, in vain 
 straining his eyes to view the features of feudal 
 strength described by O'Leary, who saw only in the 
 mind’s eye, who now, with all the associations of mem- 
 ory and imagination awakened, and with his wonted 
 incoherence, launched into his favorite theme, for the 
 moment forgetful of every other. 
 
 “ There is the very gabbion which Florence Ma- 
 carthy stood on when he saw the cannon planted j 
 against his only son, then in the Lord President’s 
 power, sending the warder word that they kept him I 
 as a fair mark to bestow their shot upon. But the 
 constable returned answer, 1 the fear of the boy’s life j 
 should not make them abandon their country and its 
 cause.’ Then the Lord President of Munster and his 
 men intrenched themselves between the river here to 
 the left and the castle forenent you, and planted be- " 
 fore it two demi-cannons and one sacre. Then, sir,

 who were in the English army below, encouraging ’ 
 their men, that appeared on the ramparts above;

 Lambh-laidre-aboo,* shouts Macarthy More, from the 
 postern, like a flame of fire, bearing down all before 
 him;— the English retreat: the war-horn of the Ma- 
 carthies is heard through the mountains ; the Macar- 
 thies carry the day. Hurra ! Hurra ! Hurra !” 
 
 O’Leary was now waving his hat in the air triumph- 
 antly, and transported beyond the present moment, 
 when “ the vile squeaking of a wry-necked fife,” and 
 the roll of a drum, broke the thread of his ideas; and 
 to the fancied engagements of the Irish and English 
 cohorts of Queen Elizabeth’s day, the gallow-glasses 
 of the Macarthies, and the bowmen of St. Leger, suc- 
 ceeded the New-Town Mount Crawley supplement- 
 ary auxiliary yeomanry legion, a corps newly raised 
 by Mr. Crawley, which stepped along the pathway 
 of a very narrow road, it nearly occupied, to the 
 tune of “ The Protestant Boys,” which, on the ap- 
 pearance of O’Leary, was instantly changed to 
 “ Croppies Lie Down.” To judge by the appearance 
 of this evidently new-raised corps, their leader, like 
 Falstaff, had 
 
 “ Misused the king’s press most d nably 
 
 and whether it were, or were not, made up of “ re- 
 volted tapsters,” and “ hostlers trade-fallen,” its mem- 
 bers presented a most unsoldier-like appearance. 
 There gleamed, however, through their awkward 
 gait and clumsy carriage a consciousness of superior- 
 ity, perhaps, both religious and military, which gave 
 the last finish of ridicule to their exhibition: take 
 them altogether, 
 
 “ No eye had seen such scarecrows.”

 The manner in which they had hustled O’Leary off 
 the pathway, the well-known tune, and its well-known 
 meaning, operated like a spell upon his agitated 
 mind ; he stopped short till they had marched by ; 
 and then, wholly disenchanted from his splendid 
 dreams, the Irish Macarthies and the Norman Fitza- 
 delms vanished from his thoughts, and a third epoch 
 in the history of his country was recalled to his re- 
 collection ; this little image of local power and petty 
 ascendency changed the current of his ideas, and, 
 with a deep sigh, he added, “ And now ’tis the reign 
 of the Crawleys.” 
 
 “ Then let us hasten to their court baron,” returned 
 the Commodore, smiling, “ or we may be too late for 
 an audience, O’Leary.” 
 
 The idea that the stranger was the brother of the 
 Marquis of Dunore had taken possession of O’Leary’s 
 mind with all the pertinacity incidental to his former 
 malady ; and persuaded that the ruin of the Crawley 
 faction, as he termed it, was at hand, he neither spe- 
 culated nor reasoned upon the probable means by 
 which that event was to be consummated. His ha- 
 tred of that family had its source in the strongest 
 feelings and most fixed prejudices of his nature; and, 
 like the rest of his countrymen, of his own class, 
 his revenge was proportionate to his devotion and 
 fidelity. 
 
 A few words, dropped at intervals, made up the 
 conversation during the rest of their walk. He 
 spoke of the stranger looking older than be ought, 
 of his being “ mighty tanned by foreign parts;” he 
 asked if Mr. Crawley had seen him when in London, 
 which, being answered in the negative, he expressed

 his fear that a family likeness might be traced, and 
 his hope that Torney Crawley would be caught by 
 his lordship in all his glory : for this was one of his 
 great days, when people came to him from all parts 
 of the county for law, justice and money. 
 
 “ There is New-Town Mount Crawley, plaze your 
 honor,” said O’Leary, pointing to a few slightly-built 
 red brick houses : “ sorrow call there was, at all at all, 
 for them slips of card buildings, only to crush the 
 ancient city of Ballydab, handy by. And there’s the 
 new barracks, and the mail-coach road that is to be. 
 Och ! musha, English barracks and a mail-coach road 
 in Dangan-na-Carthy ! when, in Florence McCarthy’s 
 time, the sheriff daren’t set his foot in the place but 
 the country round rose to oppose him ; and all this 
 now in respect of the jobs, and the patronage, and 
 the protectees, taxing the country : and before that 
 road is finished, which it never will, many a false oath 
 will be sworn, and many a sowl lost, and many a poor 
 man’s cattle be driven ; and for all that, I remember 
 me the Protreeve's father, ould Paddy Crawley, herd 
 to M c Carthy, of Castle McCarthy, there beyont, that’s 
 the late ould titular Earl of Clancare. And now, 
 there’s Mount Crawley, plaze your lordship, on the 
 top of that green sod hill, once called the Thane’s 
 Heap,* in regard of a Macarthy was slain there, in an 
 engagement between them and the Fitzadelms, about 
 taking a prey of cattle, — that’s when the Macarthies’ 
 greatness overshadowed all the southern chiefs ; and 
 they made that day an elegant retrait through the 
 pass of Mashanaglass, there below, to their own castle, 
 as will be seen in my genealogical history. Sorrow

 much the retrait of Xenophon was in comparaisment 
 to that Mashanaglass ; but now, Dioul ! its the reign 
 of the Crawleys.” 
 
 At the gates of the .principal entrance to Mount 
 Crawley O'Leary took his leave, observing that he 
 had made a vow in the year of the rebellion never to 
 cross the threshold of a Crawley, “ till they had no 
 longer a threshold to cross, plaze your lordship.” At 
 the word “ lordship,” the Commodore put his fore- 
 finger to his lips, and O'Leary, recovering himself, 
 added, “ your honor, I mane.” He then retreated, 
 leaving him, whom he persisted in believing Lord 
 Adelm, persuaded that, among his virtues, the “ ex- 
 cellent quality of discretion” could not be numbered; 
 and that this affectionate, but inconsiderate person, 
 was the last to be trusted with a secret, in which his 
 own strong and ungoverned feelings had an interest. 
 He had in the course of his desultory and incoherent 
 conversation betrayed circumstances detrimental to 
 the family honor of the Fitzadelms, and which had 
 long slept in oblivion,— that Baron Fitzadelm had 
 been reduced by his distress, and influenced by his 
 brother, to conceal the existence of his son, in order 
 to raise money on the little that was left of his estate, — 
 that he had afterwards yielded to the story suggested 
 by his brother, of this unfortunate boy not being 
 his son, but the substituted child of his first nurse, to 
 whom O’Leary’s wife had succeeded, — that the boy 
 had afterwards been sent to the wilds of Kerry, to 
 his foster-father, to be kept for some sinister purpose 
 out of the way, — that immediately after his father’s 
 death he was drowned by accident (though some told 
 a different tale) —that the herald’s office had, for some

 years after the death of the father and son, refused to 
 grant Gerald Fitzadelm the title of Baron Fitzadelm. 
 All these circumstances, once the common topic of 
 conversation in the province, had now died away, 
 with the greater part of the generation who had wit- 
 nessed them ; and the details were only known to the 
 few persons still surviving who were interested in 
 their occurrence : these were the superior of the friars 
 of St. John’s, the old baccah of Lis-na-sleugh, and, 
 above all, the fosterer of the deserted and persecuted 
 heir of Fitzadelm, Terence Oge O’Leary.

 The Commodore had insisted on O’Leary’s riding 
 back his horse, and had left the arrangement of his 
 future residence at the friary entirely to his direction. 
 He then ascended, alone, the steep hill, which, bleak, 
 bare, and fringed only by a few scanty and ill-thriven 
 plantations, led to the new-raised mansion of Mount 
 Crawley. The house was a large, square, lantern- 
 like building, all wyat windows and green verandas ; 
 it was unsheltered and unadorned, save by a cum- 
 brous Grecian portico, an evident afterthought of the 
 architect, who seemed to have consulted rather the 
 genius of the owner than of the place ; for all was ex- 
 pense without taste, and show without comfort. 
 
 It was a levee day with Mr. Crawley, who, from an 
 open window of his office, usually transacted, at the 
 same time, the opposite and multifarious business of 
 agent, magistrate, county treasurer, land jobber, road 
 maker, landlord, and attorney-at-law, captain of the 
 Dunore Volunteers, and commandant of the New- 
 Town Mount Crawley supplementary-auxiliary volun-

 teer legion, which he had just raised, and clothed at 
 the expense of the — county. 
 
 At this window, the object of many an anxious 
 eye, which had watched its opening from the day’s 
 earliest dawn, now stood Mr. Crawley, m robe de 
 chambre , et bonnet de nuit ; his shaving-box in one 
 hand, and his shaving-brush in the other, which was 
 applied to his already half-lathered face. A clerk was 
 seated writing at a table by his side, disputing and 
 wrangling with the crowd of suitors who occupied 
 the gravel- walk in front of the window, and who had 
 come from all parts to solicit law, redress, protection, 
 interference, work, alleviation, or a long day for the 
 rent they were wholly unable to pay. On the other 
 side, and close to the window, with hard features, 
 and looks full of petty importance, were to be seen 
 jobbers, drivers, land bailiffs, constables, and over- 
 seers, surrounded by petitioning, whining, w r retched 
 cotters, road makers, and laborers. In this group 
 also stood two resolute, determined-looking men, 
 manacled, and in custody. They had been taken up 
 on the preceding night as “Padreen Gar’s boys, ’ — a 
 real or supposed association, less formidable to go- 
 vernment than to Mr. Crawley's peace of mind, and 
 serving him as the groundwork of many well-got up 
 plots, as the preamble of many proposed bills, sug- 
 gested by him to the Irish government, for multiply- 
 ing dependants, increasing influence, and depressing, 
 galling, harassing, and insulting, the beggared and 
 Catholic peasantry. 
 
 These men were now waiting to go through the 
 form of an examination, previous to their committal 
 to the county jail ; where, guilty or innocent, they

 were destined to wear out their lives, in all likelihood, 
 in incarceration, vice, and misery, under a form of 
 law, known only in Ireland, called a Rule of Bail. 
 Under the portico, with a table and some refresh- 
 ments before them, sat a few of the more substantial 
 tenants of the Dunore estate, who had just paid in 
 their rents. In the front of the house were drawn up 
 the Mount Crawley legion, regaling the ears of this 
 Catholic multitude with the (alternately performed) 
 tunes of “ The Protestant Boys,” and u Croppies Lie 
 Down.” A crowd of idle people stood a short dis- 
 tance outside a little gate, which opened on the lawn ; 
 and among these, the candidate tenant for Court 
 Fitzadelm had placed himself out of the view of the 
 “ great man” of this characteristic Irish scene. 
 
 Meantime Jemmy Bryan, ci-devant driver (8), but 
 now the right-hand man of Mr. Crawley, was endea- 
 voring to establish order among some persons, who, 
 from curiosity, were led to examine the new scarlet 
 jackets and worsted plumage of the legion, more 
 'closely than was deemed respectful to the sacredness 
 of their military calling. He was laying about his 
 staff of office pretty actively, with “ Quit, quit, I say ! 
 Will yez let his honor get a sight of his own legion, 
 and he going to man-yeuvre them ?” 
 
 Mr. Crawley now placed himself at his window, 
 brandishing not his sword, but his razor ; and hold- 
 ing his nose obliquely with his left hand, he exclaimed 
 authoritatively, “ Jemmy Bryan, make an era for the 
 legion to go through their involutions in*. Rare rank, 
 take close order : mighty well. Where are your re- 
 gimental gaiters, Corporal Costello ? Oh, now while

 Dublin for a pair; and that’s the way you sarve me 
 for encouraging the manufactory of the country, Mr. 
 Kelly.” 
 
 “ Plaze your honor, in regard of the Kew-Town 
 Mount Crawley legion,” said Sergeant Kelly (a tailor 
 by trade), stepping up with a military salute to the 
 window, and an apologetic look, indicating that his 
 new vocation had “ raised his soul above buttons.” 
 “Well, Mr. Sargeant Kelly, you must saiwe the 
 government first; but that’s no raison nor rhyme 
 either that I’m to want my small-clothes ; and now 
 fugle me those haroes through all them system of tic- 
 tacs I sent you down from Lord Rosbrin in a castle 
 frank last week, his own tictacs for the Kil-Rosbrin 
 corps, from the secretary’s office.” 
 
 “ I shaul, your honor ; that’s eyes right and eyes 
 left, sir ; and is eligant marchers at a quick step, plaze 
 your honor, captain.” 
 
 “ W ell then, Sargeant Kelly, march me them through 
 a little circuitous cut to Paddy Scanlan’s potato 
 ridge ; but have a care of my meadow : do you mind, 
 Sargeant Kelly ?” 
 
 “ I shaul, sir. Quick march,” cried the sergeant, 
 while “ The Protestant Boys” struck up, and the 
 legion went shambling off in a contrary direction to 
 that intended by Mr. Crawley, w T ho, with that half of 
 his face which was not covered with soap-suds, purple 
 with rage, called after them : 
 
 “ Come back here, you scampering sons of guns ! 
 Halt, I say ! don’t you see my invisible fence, there, 
 before your eyes, you buzzards, and goes headfore- 
 most rollicking over it ? Halt, I say.”

 Halt was now repeated by an hundred voices to the 
 inattentive ears of the Mount Crawley heroes, who, 
 stunned by the noise of the drum and fife, and de- 
 lighted with their exhibition before , their less conse- 
 quential countrymen, were deaf to the orders of their 
 captain-commandant, and went, as he termed it, “ rol- 
 licking on,” till overtaken by Jemmy Bryan, who 
 brought them back in confusion, while Mr. Crawley 
 vociferated : 
 
 “Is it to Jericho ye are marching, ye shambling 
 thieves, flopping over my hay ?” 
 
 “No, plaze yer honor,” replied Sergeant Kelly, 
 “ only to Ballydab, captain, to be ready against the 
 ruction at the fair, sir, to keep the King’s pace, ac- 
 cording to your honor’s orders, and the young 
 sheriff’s, sir.” 
 
 “ And did I bid you go without your new colors, 
 worked for you on elegant orange silk by Miss Craw- 
 ley, Sargeant Kelly ?” 
 
 “ You did not, plaze your honor.” 
 
 “ Then draw up in a square hollow, according to 
 Lord Rosbrin’s tictacs, under the virandow of her 
 room, and she’ll hand them out to yez. Order a tre- 
 vailly to be bate to give her notice.” 
 
 The sergeant drew up his men, the reveillee was beat, 
 the window opened, and Miss Crawley, the maiden 
 sister of the captain-commandant, appeared with a lit- 
 tle flag at the veranda, which she lowered to Sergeant 
 Kelly, observing, as she resigned it : 
 
 “ In presenting to brave men the standard that is 
 
 to lead them to victory or death ” 
 
 “ Och, murther !” interrupted Mr. Crawley, stretch-

 ing out of his own window, and looking up at his sis- 
 ter’s with a look of humorous surprise. 
 
 “In presenting to brave men,” continued Miss 
 Crawley, “ the standard which is to lead them to vic- 
 tory or to death, I feel myself placed in a situation 
 out of my sphere, and inimical to my feelings, which 
 are those of peace and good will to all men. But 
 Judith did not disdain an act of courage in her coun- 
 try’s cause ; nor should I have shrunk from a Judith’s 
 part, had that Holofernes visited this devoted land, 
 that great leviathan, who has threatened to swallow 
 us all up.” 
 
 The intimidated legion expressed by their looks 
 how little they would have relished being swallowed 
 up, while Mr. Crawley, between jest and earnest, and 
 much amused by the unexpected eloquence of his 
 sister, exclaimed : 
 
 “ There ! there’s a haro in petticoats for you !” 
 
 “ Go,” continued Miss Crawley, emphatically, “ and 
 may heaven crown your arms with meekly-borne 
 success !” 
 
 The “ go” of the redoubtable Miss Crawley, the 
 deputy lady of the manor, as her brother was the 
 deputy lord, was as commanding to the Mount 
 Crawley legion as the “ march” of their sergeant, 
 who now led them forth to Ballydab, full of their own 
 superior influence, and the ascendency appertaining 
 both to their political and military relations. Ani- 
 mated also by a little whiskey, ordered by Mr. Craw- 
 ley to steep their colors in, they proceeded to oppose 
 prejudice and ignorance armed with power, to 
 prejudice and ignorance in subjection; and, most 
 probably (as is the usual case upon such occasions in

 Ireland), to breed and foment the disturbance they 
 were sent to anticipate, or to quell, by tunes, colors, 
 and speeches, long devoted to popular execration. 
 
 Mr. Crawley dismissed himself and his legion to- 
 gether ; his clerk took his place at the window, and 
 he retired to finish the duties of the toilette, which 
 his military avocations had interrupted. Not so Miss 
 Crawley : she indeed had retired, but retired only to 
 return to her veranda with a green watering-pot, and 
 a sort of shepherdess’s hat added to the quaker-like 
 simplicity of her dress. Her quick eye had lighted 
 upon the Commodore, who stood mingled but not con- 
 founded with the plebeian crowd ; and she now re- 
 turned, under the plea of watering her geraniums, 
 to follow up her reconnoitre, with a tactical skill, 
 better understood and practiced than Lord Rosbrin’s 
 system by the New-Town Mount Crawley legion. 
 Meantime the Commodore, unconsciously “ biding the 
 keen encounter of the eye,” walked towards the por- 
 tico, and demanded of a servant, who stood lounging 
 at the door, if Mr. Crawley was at home. The ser- 
 vant said he would “try;” and, after the delay of a 
 few minutes, returned, not with a direct answer to 
 the inquiry, but with, “ If you please to step in for a 
 minute, I’ll try if my master’s at home, sir. What 
 name, sir, shall I say ?” 
 
 “ My name is of no consequence : merely say a 
 gentleman, a stranger, requests the pleasure of seeing 
 Mr. Crawley.” 
 
 “ I shall, sir. Walk this way, if you please, sir.” 
 
 The unknown visitor followed the liveried cicerone 
 through two spacious and splendidly furnished rooms, 
 where the windows, closely blinded, and the hearth,

 closely skreened, accounted for the chill and fusty 
 atmosphere which pervaded them. Two slovenly 
 housemaids were uncovering the furniture of the 
 drawing-room ; the butler was occupied in laying out 
 a gorgeous sideboard of plate in the dining parlor ; 
 and the arrangements everywhere spoke preparations 
 for a formal country dinner party, that epitome of 
 all competition, tedium and ennui. 
 
 In that official class of Irish life to which Mr. 
 Crawley belonged, the acquisition of fortune, not 
 purchased by honest, prosperous industry, but accu- 
 mulated by servile arts, political delinquency, and 
 fraudulent intrigue, is usually too rapid to admit of a 
 gradual acquaintance with every-day comforts, found 
 equally among the first and middling classes of soci- 
 ety. A place under government uniting wealth to 
 influence, when suddenly obtained, strikes the roots; 
 cf ostentation deep, before the w r ant of comfort and 
 accommodation is felt by those whose original posi- 
 tion was destitute of both. In such establishments, 
 penury combines with display, discomfort with ex- 
 pense ; and while a competition is excited with those 
 to whom splendor is an inheritance and a habit, the 
 less obvious and more enjoyable elegances of life are 
 wanting and neglected. Of this, the cold, fine, formal 
 apartments of Mount Crawdey (like the habits of life 
 of its occupants) w^ere striking illustrations. 
 
 The suite, intended to be imposing, terminated in 
 a little room, into which the footman ushered the 
 Commodore, and then went out by an opposite door. 
 Though close, unaired and slovenly, this apartment 
 had an air of pretension about it, marking it as the 
 retreat of some slip shod muse. Soiled muslin

 draperies, vases of dead flowers, an unfinished draw- 
 ing of New-Town Mount Crawley, with Dulce Do- 
 mum written under it, on an easel, together with 
 much literary lumber, and similar traces of vulgar 
 sentimentality in every direction, would have decided 
 at once the vocation of its proprietor, if pious books, 
 strewed upon the tables, and evangelical tracts cover- 
 ing the sofas, had not indicated another calling than 
 that of the muse. Piles of bibles, filling every corner, 
 suggested that this coquettish boudoir, and holy 
 oratory, belonged to one of those persons who give 
 books where they should give bread, and lavish dog- 
 mas and credenda to those who want the means of 
 ^existence,. 
 
 The Commodore, in the ennui and impatience of 
 idle waiting, took up one book after another ; but 
 though all were not sectarian and polemical, none 
 were to his taste. This Olio Podria of sacred and 
 profane literature consisted of namby-pamby verses 
 and religious calls ; sentimental letters and Methodist 
 tracts ; short cuts to learning of every description ; 
 summary views and meagre abridgments ; elegant ex- 
 tracts ; alphabetical citations ; and rhyming, biographi- 
 cal, geographical, scriptural, historical, and astrono- 
 mical dictionaries of every calibre. Here, “ Philoso- 
 phy, for the Use of Ladies,” lay with “ The True Reli- 
 gion of a Gentlewoman “ The Wanderings of a 
 Water Wagtail in the Sixteenth Century” with “Ser- 
 monettinos, or Religious Bagatelles “ Shreds of 
 Fancy, or Literary Patchwork,” with “An Alarm to 
 the Unconverted;’ “Delicate Crimes, or Sin, Sor- 
 row, and Sensibility,” a religious novel, with “ A Cal 
 the Unrepenting, or Milk for Babes, and Strong

 Meat for Men ;” a duodecimo “ Beauties of all the 
 Poets, or Pocket Inspiration,” with “ The History of 
 a Child who knew not the Lord before her fifth year, 
 and who died converted to the true faith at seven.” 
 Controversial tracts upon all the new lights were min- 
 gled with quarterly, monthly, and evangelical reviews; 
 “ Elegant Extracts for the Flageolet,” with u Hints 
 for the Tambourine and Triangle;” “A Method for 
 Tuning the Harp without an Ear ;” “ Mnemonic Sys- 
 tems for learning Languages without study, and with 
 a mode of playing three Piano-fortes at once with 
 two hands.” This catalogue raisonne, or rather ds- 
 raisonn * , might be taken as epitomizing the perver- 
 sion of human intellect, and as evincing a successful 
 circulation of the folly, hypocrisy, and imposition of 
 the day, no less than the shallowness, bad taste, and 
 pretension of the presiding mistress of such a sanctum 
 sanctorum. 
 
 The Commodore had just taken up, and was about 
 to throw down, in its turn, an historical work for 
 youth, in the title-page of which appeared “ Stories 
 from the History of England, by Conway Townsend 
 Crawley, Esq., Barrister- at-Law, dedicated to her who 
 4 taught his young idea how to shoot,’ to Anne Clot- 
 worthy Crawley, by her nephew :” but finding that 
 this History of England omitted the trifling events of 
 Magna Charta and the Revolution as Jacobinical, and 
 as tending to teach the young idea how to shoot in a 
 direction unfavorable to the orthodox dictation of the 
 day, the circumstance amused him, and he sat down 
 to glance his eye over its pages. They contained an 
 abridgment of doctrines which he was yet ignorant 
 had been broached in Great Britain, under the special

 protection of the constituted authorities ; (doctrines 
 which, if accredited, defeat the claims of the reigning 
 family to the throne, and place its august members 
 on a line with the mushroom kings of the by-gone 
 day.) 
 
 He was thus occupied when the door opened, and 
 entered, not, as he expected, Mr. Crawley, but Mr. 
 Crawley’s sister ; with her chapeau de bergere in one 
 hand, her watering-pot in the other, and exhibiting a 
 marked primitiveness in her dress, and a mincing, Ian- 
 guid, affected air in her whole gait and movement. 
 She commenced with a little start of surprise at find- 
 ing her boudoir so occupied, then approached full of 
 smiles, graces, and graciousness, or what she meant 
 to be such : she begged the gentleman to be seated, 
 let down the muslin blinds, to exclude, as she said, 
 the too propitious kindness of Sol, and then took her 
 seat near the sofa, which she pointed out to the 
 stranger. Whatever impression his manly and dis- 
 tinguished figure had made upon Miss Crawley, as he 
 was seen leaning over the paddock-gate, that impres- 
 sion was now improved into boundless and enthusi- 
 astic admiration by the singularity of his fine counte- 
 nance, the extreme ease of his address, by that disen- 
 gaged air which the world only gives, and, above all, 
 by a bow, whose foreign grace she placed at once to 
 the account of supreme English bon-ton. 
 
 It was Miss Crawley who had reoeived the Com- 
 modore’s message, who had told the footman that she 
 would receive him, until her brother was at leisure to 
 attend his summons ; and in so doing, she believed 
 that she was paying attention to some man of rank, 
 bearing letters' of introduction from the Marchioness

 of Dunore, or some other person of distinction, whom, 
 by her laborious exertion, she had placed on the list 
 of those she called “ her kind great friends. 5 ’ 
 
 Miss Crawley, after a few sidelong looks and ser- 
 pentine motions, now opened the conversation by 
 apologizing for her brother’s absence, enumerating the 
 variety of his official, political, and professional engage- 
 ments. She stated the coincidence of the assizes, and 
 the Glannacrime election, as an additional cause for 
 the hurry of business; and introduced episodical 
 sketches of the family importance in general, — of her 
 second brother being a sergeant-at-law ; her third, a 
 first commissioner ; her eldest nephew that year 
 sheriff of the county ; her next, a major in the army 
 (a peninsula hero, covered with orders); and the 
 amiable cadet, she added, “ the Magnus Apollo 5 ’ of 
 the age and country, a young barrister of great poet- 
 ical, political, and diplomatic promise — her eleve, and, 
 i as the poet said, “ darling without end.*’ Encouraged 
 by the silent attention and occasional inclination of 
 the Commodore’s head, Miss Crawley added to this 
 information some slight notices of herself ; and, in 
 apologizing for what she called “the literary litter” 
 of her boudoir, she referred to habits that had be- 
 come second nature, and that, to be broken, required 
 ’an almost regenerated spirit, a superhuman interven- 
 tion. She sighed, and then threw up her eyes, adding, 
 with an air half primitive, half dramatic — 
 
 “ It was my good fortune— or should I not rather 
 say my ill fortune ? — -early in life to be distinguished, 
 by the celebrated Lady Clotworthy, of Bath, whose 
 prize poems— — * 
 
 Here the Commodore involuntarily took up his hat;

 and Miss Crawley suspecting that she was bestowing 
 more of “ her tediousness” on him than might suit 
 with his previous arrangements, observed : 
 
 “ I have obtruded this family sketch upon you, in 
 the expectation of presenting to you the originals; 
 for we hold a family congress here to-day, and whe- 
 ther your visit to Dunore be a pilgrimage of taste, or 
 of mere amusement, my brother will be happy to do 
 the honors of these romantic scenes in the absence of 
 their lord, whom, he represents.” 
 
 “My visit, madam, has not been destitute of the 
 gratification of taste ; but it is not a pilgrimage made 
 merely in pursuit of amusement ; business of a more 
 serious nature.” 
 
 The word “ serious” fell like an electric spark upon 
 the imagination of Miss Crawley ; and the first self- 
 created vision she had conjured up, vanished before 
 another of equal interest and importance. She was 
 now led to believe that herself, and not her brother, 
 was the object of this visit; that what she had taken 
 for temporal distinction was “ the beauty of holiness ;” 
 and that she saw before her, not, as she had supposed, 
 a mere idle elegant English tourist of fashion, but one 
 of a higher calling, who might unite worldly elevation 
 to that w'hich is above the world’s giving or taking 
 away. 
 
 Miss Crawley was of that undefined age which is 
 occasionally found to vibrate between th folly and 
 sdsceptibility of youth, and the despondence and ex- 
 jDerience of disappointed senility ; that drowning age 
 in which female celibacy catches at every straw held 
 out by hope, or offered by vanity, and which, with the 
 illusive chemistry of self-love, converts every circuin-

 stance of the day’s ordinary routine into the chance 
 of that change so devoutly wished. She had long 
 sighed for a fellow-laborer in the cause : which, like 
 all other causes of heaven, is best carried on among 
 mortals, with the auxiliary of rank, fortune, or per- 
 sonal advantage.* The object might now stand be- 
 fore her, her hour might have arrived ; and the sud- 
 den hopes kindled by this visit, for a moment stunned 
 and deprived her of her wonted, elegant, graceful, 
 picturesque presence of mind. She repeated his 
 words in a certain soft solemnity of voice : 
 
 “ A more serious nature ! May I add my ardent 
 wishes to my sanguine hopes, that whatever may be 
 the purport of your visit here, success the most per- 
 fect may attend it ?” 
 
 The Commodore bowed low, and even in some lit- 
 tle confusion, but looked to the door for the momen- 
 tarily expected entrance of Mr. Crawley. 
 
 “ You may, perhaps, have known,” said Miss Craw- 
 ley, “ the late celebrated Zachariah Scare’um, of pious 
 memory.” 
 
 “ I have heard of him,” replied the Commodore, 
 with the conversion of the mysterious Mrs. Magilli- 
 cuddy full in his memory, and again taking his hat. 
 
 “ You have heard of him,” said Miss Crawley, “ of 
 course : disciples of every sect have heard of him, 
 though all do not agree with him. His gladiatorial 
 wrestle with many of the ramifying and heterodox 
 divergencies of the only true and infallible light has 
 gained him a worldly distinction he craves not ; his 
 sturdy and zealous opposition to the Sublapsarians, 
 the Baxterians, Necessarians, Antinomians, Sabala-

 rians, Swedenborgians, Independents, Universalists, 
 Destructionists, Hutchins onians, Millenarians, Shakers, 
 Jumpers, Hunkers, Fifth-Monarchy men, and Mug- 
 gletonians ” 
 
 Here Miss Crawley’s breath and the Commodore's 
 patience failed together. She paused for inspiration, 
 and he rose to interrupt her tirade of sectarian pe- 
 dantry, by demanding if he had any chance of seeing 
 Mr. Crawley that morning. With a look vibrating 
 between doubt and disappointment, Miss Crawley 
 rose and rang the bell ; but to her inquiries for her 
 brother, the answer, as she expected, was, that he had 
 driven out in his curricle to Glannaerime, and would 
 not return till dinner. 
 
 “ This is unfortunate,” said the Commodore, “ for 
 I am obliged to leave Dunore early to-morrow morn- 
 ing.” 
 
 Miss Crawley grew pale with disappointment. 
 Such guests were not always to be had in the coun- 
 try — such persons were rare everywhere ; and to 
 prevent the chance of the desirable acquisition escap- 
 ing from the list of her “ kind great friends,” she po- 
 litely and warmly pressed on him an invitation to 
 dinner for that day. Presiding in her brother’s 
 house, who was a widower, her privileges and immu- 
 nities were unlimited ; and she now pressed her invi- 
 tation with the air of one who had a right to give it, 
 and the ardor of one who had ah interest in its being 
 accepted. 
 
 This conviction struck the apprehension of her 
 quick-sighted guest ; and corresponding with the exi- 
 gencies of his own situation and business, it at once 
 decided him, and he yielded to solicitations, which,

 coming from a woman, even from such a woman, he 
 was not, perhaps, of a character to reject. With 
 that peculiar frankness which characterized his man- 
 ners, after the pause and hesitation of a moment, he 
 said : 
 
 “Well, madam, I shall avail myself of your polite 
 invitation. The few words I have to say to Mr. 
 Crawley can be dispatched over our coffee ; and time, 
 precious to both, may thus be spared.” 
 
 He now took his leave, and the bow with which he 
 departed finished the impression his first appearance 
 had made. 
 
 lie had been gone near twenty minutes, and Miss 
 Crawley still remained lounging on the sofa, in the 
 attitude of one absorbed in a pleasant .reverie, when 
 suddenly recollecting that she had neither asked the 
 name nor address of the person she had invited, and 
 that he had not himself volunteered it, she rose and 
 rung the bell to make some inquiries among the ser- 
 vants, when the arrival of two barouches and four 
 with out-riders, called off, for the present, her atten- 
 tion. 
 
 These handsome and showy equipages contained 
 nearly the whole of the family congress alluded to by 
 Miss Crawley. The one brought Sergeant and Mrs. 
 Crawley and their four daughters ; and the other, Mr. 
 and Mrs. Commissioner Crawley, with a pretty daugh- 
 ter of the latter by a former marriage. The first par- 
 ties were on their way to Killarney, and stopped by 
 special invitation for a few days at Mr. Crawley’s. 
 The latter had come to take possession of an estate 
 purchased for him by his eldest brother, the attorney,

 in the neighborhood of Dunore : they were to pro- 
 ceed on a visit to the bishop of the diocese. 
 
 If ever there was a period in the history of a coun- 
 try when it might be said that 
 
 “ Crime gave wealth, and wealth gave impudence,” 
 
 it was that period in the history of Ireland, when re- 
 bellion, excited for the purpose of effecting an un- 
 welcome union, called forth all the worst passions of 
 humanity, and armed petty power with the rod of 
 extermination. The wealth, influence and impor- 
 tance of the Crawley family took their date from 
 that memorable and frightful epoch in the tragedy 
 of Irish history, which produced both moral and 
 political ruin to a long-devoted country, under every 
 form of degradation of which civilized society is sus- 
 ceptible. Previous to that period the three brothers 
 had remained buried in the obscurity which belonged 
 to their social and intellectual mediocrity. The eld- 
 est, Darby Crawley, the country attorney, found his 
 highest dignity in being the factotum of the two 
 Barons Fitzadelm, the agent of their embarrassed 
 property, on which he lent them money saved by his 
 father in their service, until the little that remained 
 of the estate fell into his hands. Through the inter- 
 est of his employer he had been put into the commis- 
 sion of the peace; the year 1798 found him a magis- 
 trate, and fortune and his merits had done the rest. 
 
 The second brother, whose gravity was mistaken 
 for ability by his father, (the illiterate land-bailiff of 
 the Fitzadelms,) was made a gentleman by the pa- 
 tent of a college education, and the legal degree of 
 barrister-at-law. He had plied in the courts with an

 empty green bag, and more empty head, year after 
 year, with fruitless vigilance, till his energy, in the 
 melancholy prosecutions produced by the rebellion, 
 obtained him notice, patronage, place, and a silk 
 gown. , 
 
 The third brother, at once pompous and officious, 
 servile and oppressive, and formed alike to tyrannize 
 or cringe, had been placed as clerk in a government 
 office, where, by his pliancy and industry, he made 
 himself useful to a personage of shallow endowment 
 and official importance, whose political views ai*d 
 flimsy attainments rendered agents thus qualified ne- 
 cessary to his purposes. The dull but zealous com- 
 missioner, who could not be daunted because he 
 i could not feel, was deemed a proper person to re- 
 present a government borough in the Union Parlia- 
 ment; and, having effected “his most filthy bargain,” 
 was rewarded with the place of first commissioner of 
 a particular board, instituted and perpetuated for the 
 purpose of paying such debts to such creditors as the 
 members of the Crawley family. 
 
 Mr. Commissioner, like his elder brothers, charac- 
 teristically represented the Bureaucratic , or office 
 tyranny, by which Ireland has been for so long go- 
 verned; whose members, arrogating to themselves 
 exclusively the virtue of loyalty, and boldly assuming 
 its insignia and device, have become formidable and 
 oppressive to all who thwarted their career, or insi- 
 nuated that their loyalty lies more in their places 
 than their principles. The elder brother Darby was 
 1 inferior in acquirements, and destitute of that educa- 
 tion which his father’s increasing prosperity had en- 
 abled him to bestow upon his younger sons ; his sue-

 cess, however, was equal to theirs, and his places and 
 avocations were still more numerous. He had been 
 a crown solicitor, at a moment when that place was 
 the most inordinately lucrative ; he was treasurer of 
 a county, and he united to these trustworthy situa- 
 tions those three capacities, whose unity is named in 
 the country parts of Ireland “ the triple tyranny of 
 the land;” he was agent to an absentee nobleman, an 
 active magistrate, and captain of a yeomanry corps. 
 
 As agent he kept off the landlord by misrepresent- ; 
 ations of the political and local state of the country ; 
 and he worried the tenants by obliging them to labor 
 for his own personal benefit. 
 
 As a magistrate, and the representative of his em- 
 ployer, he packed juries, domineered at sessions, cor- 
 responded with the state secretaries, became an organ ; 
 of intelligence to the Irish government, and obtained 
 the name of the most loyal man in his country. 
 
 As captain of yeomanry, he clubbed his own tenants 
 and laborers of the dominant persuasion, made his 
 returns full to the government, distributed some of 
 the money at his own discretion, pocketed the sur- 
 plus, kept the neighborhood in terror, and apprehended 
 and committed to prison whom he pleased, and with ij 
 more regard to prejudice and private feeling than to 
 justice or the public peace ; for he was a man of con- j 
 stitutional timidity; and, believing himself an object 
 of popular execration, he acted as if he was its victim. 
 
 Though in his magnificent house in Dublin, and his 
 seat at Mount Crawley, he received and entertained 
 persons of the first distinction, the Society he fre- 1 
 quented, the circle in which he moved, had produced 
 no influence on his mind or manners. The stubborn,

 intractable, incorrigible vulgarity which distinguished 
 both, was accompanied by a sort of low native humor, 
 giving a peculiar expression to his shrewd, leering 
 eye, and screwed up puckered mouth. Though all re- 
 finement, all mental illumination were placed beyond 
 j the possibility of his acquirement, he had still that 
 ) species of natural sagacity, that subtilty of littleness, 
 
 • which, operating like instinct, in small circles, attains 
 to a precision proportionate to its circumscription, — 
 which has been so well styled by Bacon a “ left-handed 
 wisdom.” He possessed a faculty, too, a certain cheer- 
 fulness of temperament, a constitutional hilarity, which 
 hid out the darker qualities of his character and ren- 
 i dered even the contempt he inspired free from the as- 
 J perity of fixed aversion — in those, at least, who were 
 : not the perpetual victims of his cruel malversations. 
 
 ! The laughter he excited blinded many to the injuries 
 he had committed ; his blunders and humor kept his 
 designs out of sight; and his ridicules were so prom- 
 inent, and stood so broadly on the surface, that if they 
 I did not conceal his vices, they gave, even to his arts, 
 j the air of simplicity. 
 
 At the period when the genius and worth of Ire-

 quish nor refute. Low jest, coarseness that passed 
 the bounds of decency, blunders that bordered on 
 fatuity, (sometimes the genuine products of intellect- 
 ual confusion, more commonly the results of a long- 
 sighted affectation,) were then put in requisition, along 
 with many other debasing schemes, for vitiating public 
 taste, for corrupting principles, blunting feelings, and 
 subduing the spirit of a regenerating and awakening 
 people. 
 
 In this school, and at this period, Darby Crawley 
 had studied deeply. He estimated everything by its 
 success. Genius and patriotism (or, according to his 
 own accentuation, gianius and pathretism) with him 
 meant folly and disloyalty. But while his experience 
 taught him the danger of possessing the one, or of 
 cherishing the other, he had a high and reverential ap- 
 probation for purchased acquirements, for that edu- 
 cation which wealth can obtain. Education had made 
 gentlemen of his brothers ; education had made a fine 
 lady of his sister; education had made his sons 
 wiser than their father ; and want of education had 
 left himself upon the last degree of the family scale, 
 whom nature had allotted to the first. To .supply his 
 early deficiencies, he became therefore a close copyist 
 of the sentimental jargon and foreign slip-slop of his 
 sister ; and even attempted the fluent verbosity and 
 college pedantry of his youngest and most admired 
 son. But the double treachery of a bad memory and 
 a false ear plunged him into inaccuracies and mis- 
 takes, which the reprehension of those two leading 
 members of his family were in vain applied to correct. 
 
 It was, however, curious to observe his natural 
 sagacity, and the intuitive ability of his low, creeping,

 sordid self-interest, occasionally assuming their supe- 
 riority over the flimsy attainments of his brothers 
 and children ; whose accomplishment he was wont to 
 admire, and who, in return, while they reverenced his 
 success in life, and availed themselves of its advan- 
 tage, blushed, and looked down on the ignorance and 
 vulgarity by which it was accompanied, 
 
 A wet evening in the country, during the long vaca- 
 tion, would frequently afford him an opportunity of 
 displaying his intuitive views of advancement in life, 
 for the benefit of those who stood indebted to educa- 
 tion alone for their distinctions. Then, released from 
 the necessity of representation, and indulging to its 
 full extent his natural vulgarity, he might, as he sat 
 seated over what he called his “ sup of hot,” (a tum- 
 bler of punch,) be said to be truly in his element. 
 Then, surrounded by his family, his sister presiding 
 at the tea-table,— his three sons lounging in different 
 parts of the room, — his intellect quickened by his 
 potations, — his feelings softened into maudlin tender- 
 ness,— his eyes half closed, — his punch half drank, — 
 his hands half clasped, — and his thumbs in twirling 
 motion, he would begin his customary exhortations 
 to his sons. 
 
 These domestic lectures usually commenced with 
 drinking the health of his children, to call their atten- 
 tion ; then reproving, then advising, and at last be- 
 coming pathetic as he grew fuddled, he usually con- 
 cluded with his own death and the family ruin, which 
 must ensue if his advice was neglected and forgotten.

 tie the tay ever your mother drank at your age, though 
 she got to be the taydrinkingist sowl in the barony 
 before she died, poor woman. Why then, Tim dear, 
 have you nothing to do but to lie stretched on the 
 broad of your back along my new hair-bottoms, with 
 your arm dangling down, and surprising them inno- 
 cent animals of flies on the carpet, that's strewn with 
 their corpses? Upon my word, Tim, it would be 
 fitter for you to be raiding the 1 Hints for a Magis- 
 trate,’ or 1 MacNally’s Justice of Pace;’ you that will 
 be in the commission, and high sheriif of the county, 
 by promise since the Union. I wonder, Tim, but 
 you’d send them game to the bishop you brought 
 home last night, instead of giving them to your crony, 
 the surveyor; and the bishop, brother to a minister! 
 and he that likes a bit of grouse above the world. 
 There is nothing better bestowed than that which we 
 give to them that want nothing; mind my words, 
 Tim. Why then, captain, I wish you’d quit with 
 your rattan against my illigant Northumberland table, 
 and get off it mtirely. What use is the cheers but to 
 sit on ? and if you had gone, as I bid you, to make 
 your compliments to the Gineral of the district the 
 day, you wouldn’t be playing your devil’s tattoo, and 
 spoiling my Northumberland. I’ve often told you 
 the Gineral might make a man of you with the Duke 
 of York. Is it by whistling and rapping my stick 
 against the table for the length of a wet evening, that 
 I got on in the world ? No ; but night and day, wet 
 or dry, summer or winter, watching the main chance, 
 Thady ; and when I hadn't as much for myself as 
 ( cuddy would you taste,’ I had still always a bit of a 
 dewshure for the great, a Wicklow pebble, or a lump

 or a cask of Waterford sprats, or some sort of a pretty 
 bougie for my friends.” 
 
 “ Bijou” interrupted .Miss Crawley. 
 
 “ Well, bijou, then. But apropos de bot , Thady, in 
 regard of your flopping fat Miss O’Flaherty of Dunore 
 on your fine mare, and riding her round the country, 
 when you couldn’t plaze the Gineral’s lady more than 
 giving her that very mare, which only just lies here 
 doing nothing at all hut aiting my hay , and corn, 
 while you are with your regiment eleven months in 
 the year; for the great likes a present every man 
 Jack of them; and fat Miss O’Flahertv’s a papist, and 
 was a marked man in the rebellion, that’s her father ; 
 and her brother this day in America : and is it by 
 lending a mare to fat Miss O’Flaherty I got your 
 ensigncy from the secretary of war, and made a 
 captain of you, over the heads of them might be your 
 father ? No, faith, it was the Puldoodies that did it, 
 and being a good friend to government through thick 
 and thin. What is it you’re writing there in them 
 short lines, Conway Townshend? Is it rhymes? 
 Why, then, I wish you’d lave off with your poethry 
 and your gianius : mind my words, Con dear, your 
 gianius will play you a dirty trick yet ; for sorrow 
 good gianius ever did for man or beast. What was 
 it brought the country into jeopardy, and bull-veasied 
 the government in the year ’82 ? — Why, gianius. 
 What was it that set the world wild with the Irish 
 volunteers, the free trade, and the Catholic bill, and 
 Counsellor Curran, and ould Lord Charlemont, with 
 his statues, and his pictures, and his popularity ; and 
 Mr. Grattan, with his people, and his Irish eloquence ?

 Why, wasn’t it gianius ? Och ! sir, times is changed 
 since then, since a man should talk eloquence and 
 pathretism, and all that Gally-my-jaw, as the French 
 call it, to get on in the world.” 
 
 “ Galimathias ,” lisped Miss Crawley. 
 
 “ Well, Gally-msftchaw, then; and not all as one as 
 now, Con, when a man has only to follow his nose, 
 and walk into place or pension, just by sticking to 
 the main chance. Och, sir, the Irish bar is another 
 thing since them days. Tell me, Con dear, is it inde- 
 pendence will get you a silk gown ? Will gianius 
 make you first counsel to the Commissioners, with 
 your eight thousand a year for doing nothing at all 
 at all ? Will it make you a deputy remembrancer, 
 with your nate four thousand, which is the true re- 
 membrancer? Or would gianius, poethry, and pa- 
 thretism, with the aristocracy at their head (that is, 
 barring the Union Lords), get you at this moment to 
 be one of the thirty-one county session chairmen, all 
 made since the year eighty-nine, for the encourage- 
 ment of the rising young barristers ; or even a magis- 
 trate of police, or a seneschal of the Dublin liberties, 
 or a missionary to explore disturbed districts ? Troth 
 and faith, they wouldn’t ! And could do more this 
 day myself for you than the whole boiling of them, 
 in respect to pushing you up the stick, Con, at the 
 bar ; that’s if you’ll lave off bothering us with your 
 poethry. For see here, the thing’s as plain as pais 
 (peas). Sure, there’s spectacles for all ages, as well as 
 wigs and gowns. Thanks to him that served the 
 country well when he was in it, and does to this day, 
 for all he butters them up with the Catholic question, 
 and votes on it with his tongue in his cheek ; and its

 are the day. And there’s a little bone-bush in store 
 for you all round, if you will just be aisy and mind 
 your hits, and drive on the ball when it comes to you,

 hundred of yez, great and small, ould and young, 
 walking the hall, with your wigs and your bags, and 
 there is three hundred places to divide among yez — 
 make money of that, Con ; and not one of you but 
 may be a loyal man, and an enfant trouve of govern- 
 ment, as the French say, if he plazes.” 
 
 “ Enfant cherif interrupted Miss Crawley. 
 
 “Well, enfant cherry, if yez will just mind your 
 P’s and Q’s ; and so now you know the ways of the 
 place ; there’s neither twining nor turning, but 
 straight forward. So let’s have no more of your 
 rhymes and your gianius, and your satirical perigrams, 
 Counsellor Con.” 
 
 “ Epigrams, my dear Darby.” 
 
 “ W ell, epigrams, then ; but ” 
 
 “ Can’t you mind what I think, and not what I say ? 
 for you’re not beholden to them, Con, with your col- 
 lege education, and your speaking French like a Na-

 gianius ? or the Counsel to the Commissioners a 
 gianius ? or was it poethry made a sergeant of your 
 uncle? — No; but wigging* all the chancellors that 
 ever were created, and offering to kick a Catho- 
 lic barrister, which he didn’t after all, for a raison' he 
 had ; but the will, sir, was taken for the deed. So 
 come to your tay, Con, and be aisy with your 
 poethry.”

 “Well, boys, dear, 111 see the4lay yet, when Tm 
 dead and buried, God help mej and in my new 
 moleseum in Dunore Church, when my words will 
 come to pass, and you will be thinking of your ould 
 father, Darby Crawley, when some of ye z may have 
 titles, which, if ever there comes another rebellion, as 
 I expect there will, plaze God — but that’s neither 
 here nor there — only, just as I was saying, when I 
 am dead and buried, and Clotty there places an 
 epithet over me, from his affectionate sister, and the 
 pew hung with black, like the Dunore s, I’ll see my 
 words come to pass, and you’ll remember your poor 
 father that worked night and day to make gentlemen 
 and loyal men of you; foj; we must all die, boys, 
 honey, great as we are. Momenti mori , as the tomb- 
 stone says, and the yeomanry corps fire over us, the 
 Lord help us; for dirt we are, and to dirt we must 
 return; the Crawleys like the rest.” 
 
 As this compound idea of death and supremacy 
 rounded off the admonitory peroration of Mr. Craw- 
 ley, snuff and punch had usually wound up his whin- 
 ing sensibility to its utmost excitement ; and the tears 
 which he shed for his own death were commonly fol- 
 io w r ed by that profound sleep which images it. 
 
 On the three hopeful disciples of this worldly doc- 
 trine, though its letter made but little impression, its 
 spirit sunk deep ; and the characters of the three 
 younger Messrs. Crawley were but modifications, in 
 various degrees and proportions, of the moral quali- 
 ties of the three elders. Timothy Ilarcourt, the high 
 sheriff, the true representative of the class contempt- 
 uously designated by the peasantry as “the Squiranty,” 
 was dull, overbearing, vulgar, and profligate. At the

 bead of a party association in the country, gambling 
 deeply at the clubs in Dublin, he everywhere as- 
 sumed airs of importance on the strength of the fa- 
 mily relations with the government, and affected a 
 fashionable libertinism in his morals, with a violent 
 outcry in favor of church and state. Still, however, 
 he preferred a cock-fight at Dunore, or a carousal at 
 the Dunore Arms with his friends, the port surveyor 
 and the sub-sheriff, to the higher class of society, 
 which he occasionally commanded, but never enjoyed. 
 The lower classes, whom he oppressed, hated him to 
 abhorrence ; the middle classes in the country feared 
 and avoided him; and the higher circles won his 
 money, and admitted him to their drinking parties, 
 where his intemperance passed for joviality, and his 
 vulgarity for humor. 
 
 Major Thaddeus Windham Crawley (for it is the 
 fashion among the Crawley class in Ireland to tack 
 the names of viceroys and secretaries to their bap- 
 tismal appellations) called himself a dasher ; and was 
 a fair illustration of that term, as applied in Ireland. 
 He was handsome, good-humored, vulgar, and self- 
 sufficient. He had seen a little service in America, a 
 good deal in the Peninsula ; and though his residence 
 in other countries had cleared away many of his local 
 prejudices and littleness, it had not added to the 
 stock of his original ideas, and took nothing from the 
 purity of bis original brogue. His phrases were all 
 broadly idiomatical ; his conversation enriched with 
 regimental technicalities and Irish slang; and when 
 he talked of bivouacking and wigwams, of making the 
 ould one come down with the pipeclay, sung “ I am 
 the Man for the Leedies,” and described the Prince

 Regent’s levee (commencing every phrase with “ I’ll 
 give you my honor”), he had gone through the whole 
 menage of his intellectual capabilities. The rest of 
 his existence was made up with whistling, humming, 
 drawing up his cravat, to make a sensation on the ap- 
 pearance of a stranger, reading the army-list, and 
 beating his rattan against his father’s Northumber- 
 land table. 
 
 The character of the barrister, Conway Townsend 
 Crawley, the literary idol of his aunt, and usually 
 called Counsellor Con by his father, seemed to have 
 its foundation more particularly in temperament, and 
 to be of a more definite and distinct class than that 
 of his brothers. It was obvious that both its merits 
 and its defects originated in physical infirmity beyond 
 his control. Called by his father his posthumous son, 
 because his mother died in giving him life, his inaus- 
 picious birth seemed to have entailed on him a bilious, 
 saturnine constitution. Even his talent, if talent it 
 might be called, was but the result of disease. No 
 “ overflowing of the pancreatic juices” had influenced 
 the system of Conway Crawley, even in that age 
 when the blood is balm. The dark bile, which from 
 childhood sallowed his cheek, dimmed his eye, and 
 tinged the spirits of youth with the causticity of age, 
 continued, through adolescence and manhood, to 
 communicate its bitterness to all his views ; turning 
 his words to sarcasm, his ink to gall, and his pen to a 
 stiletto. Combining with an education whose object 
 was pretension, and whose principle was arrogance, 
 it made him at once a thing fearful and pitiable, at 
 war with its species and itself, ready to crush in man- 
 hood as to sting in the cradle, and leading his over-

 weening ambition to pursue its object by ways dark 
 and hidden, — safe from the penalty of crime, and ex- 
 posed only to the obloquy which he laughed to scorn : 
 opinion has no punishment for the base. 
 
 If there ever was a man formed alike by nature and 
 education to betray the land that gave him birth, and 
 to act openly as the pander of political corruption, or 
 secretly as the agent of defamation, who would stoop 
 to seek his fortune by effecting the fall of a frail wo- 
 man, or would strive to advance it by stabbing the 
 character of an honest one, who could crush aspiring 
 merit behind the ambuscade of anonymous security, 
 while he came forward openly in the defence of the 
 vileness which rank sanctified and influence protected, 
 that man was Conway Crawley. He was yet young ; 
 but belonging to the day and the country in which he 
 first raised his hiss and shed his venom, success already 
 beckoned him, through the distant vista, towards her, 
 with a smile of encouragement and a leer of contempt. 
 Prompt, pert, and shameless, he had already, both at 
 the bar and in society, evinced a well-managed talent 
 for display and for evasion, a fluency that bore down 
 where it could not convince, and an insolence which 
 humility could not soften, nor power browbeat. 
 Lampoons, which he solemnly denied, had been brought 
 home to him, and obtained a sort of local notoriety, 
 while they evinced talents which were to pave his way 
 to distinctions more solid, by means more ingeniously 
 despicable than he had as yet been called on to exer- 
 cise. In every pursuit, “ wisely shunning the broad- 
 way and the green,” his paths were paths of darkness ; 
 and had he been found guilty of one good, one gen- 
 erous action, he would “ have blushed to find it fame.”

 It was by another species of reputation that the gates 
 of promotion and wealth were to be opened to the 
 ambition of Conway Townsend Crawley. 
 
 He was now going the Munster circuit, and took 
 his father’s house in his way between two assize towns. 
 He did, however, but little in his profession, notwith- 
 standing that his father had procured him several 
 crown prosecutions, and had made him counsel to two 
 boards. His views were higher than thus to creep 
 through professional places, offices, and sinecures, such 
 as are now reserved for the Irish bar. He was deeply 
 interested in the Glannacrime election, and was law 
 agent for the absent candidate, Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, 
 whom he had never seen, but whose character he 
 particularly disliked. To his mother, the Dowager 
 Marchioness, he was personally known ; and to her, 
 while at the Temple, he had paid most obsequious at- 
 tention. His fluency, his light literature, poetical 
 scraps, and critical discussions, had passed upon this 
 capricious and powerful woman of fashion, of talent, 
 wit, and erudition; pretension, in this, as in every 
 other instance, succeeded, when it amalgamated with 
 her the well- whipped froth of courtly sense. 
 
 At the head of the females of the Crawley genus, with 
 all the characteristics of the family, stood Miss Anne 
 Clotworthy Crawley; Anne, after her humble mother, 
 Nancy Malone, a brogue-maker’s daughter of Done- 
 raile; and Clotworthy, from a certain Lady Clot- 
 worthy, who distributed poetical prizes at Bath, and 
 to whom Miss Crawley had rendered herself both 
 useful and agreeable, during a six months’ residence 
 in that city, where she had gone, at a late period in 
 life for such purposes, to finish her education.

 Her first simple name she had received at her chris- 
 tening in the steward's room at Court Fitzadelm, 
 forty-five years back ; the second she had adopted at 
 her confirmation at Bath twenty years after. This 
 mature re-naming she called her “ sentimental regene- 
 ration and she heard with horror a name so distin- 
 guished, so dear to the Muses, (at least to the Bath 
 muses,) as Clotworthy, curtailed by the fraternal 
 familiarity of her brother Darby into the endearing, 
 but ill-sounding, diminutive of Clotty . Against this 
 abbreviation Miss Crawley had vainly remonstrated : 
 it had seized both the imagination and the affections 
 of her brother ; and with this good-humored but cho- 
 leric relation, she dared only to go certain lengths. 
 
 Placed at the head of his sumptuous establishment, 
 her alternative was living in a boarding-house, on a 
 legacy left by Lady Clotworthy ; for as a resident in 
 the house of her brother, the sergeant, or in that of 
 the commissioner, her two sisters-in-law had shut the 
 door against her. To live with the great, to be 
 noticed by the great, to influence and render herself 
 necessary to the great, was the ambition and object 
 of Miss Crawley’s existence. For this purpose she 
 took the only paths open to her, pretension and flat- 
 tery ; pretension, arising out of a few flimsy, shallow, 
 commonplace acquirements, the produce of every 
 vulgar boarding-school, — and flattery, as consonant 
 to the grovelling, time-serving spirit of her family, 
 and to the smooth, silky, insinuating, serpentizing 
 temper of her own character. At once feeble and 
 vain, deficient and ambitious, her original endowments 
 were below mediocrity, and her stock of literary and 
 sentimental ideas, like the contents of her boudoir and

 library, was made up of scraps and fragments ; ber 
 sensibility was gleaned from sentimental novels, her 
 critical judgments were borrowed from reviews, jour- 
 nals, and the oft-copied opinions of orthodox autho- 
 rity ; and her musical talents consisted of a few got- 
 up songs, sung in such tune as it pleased heaven, in 
 two airs on the harp, one on the Spanish guitar, and 
 four waltzes on the piano-forte. 
 
 To these higher endowments she united other little 
 “ useful uselessnesses,” which enabled her to supply 
 the wants of her great friends, which she herself first 
 created. Cloth fruit and fillagree baskets, daubed 
 velvet and paper card-racks, French mottoes and 
 English devices, with all the industrious arts which 
 bad taste supplies to unoccupied mediocrity, were 
 devoted to the drawing-rooms and boudoirs of the 
 great and shallow persons who admitted her as their 
 inmate. With that cunning which invariably belongs 
 to intellectual inferiority, she rapidly obtained the 
 secret of a dominant weakness or a master-passion ; 
 and she administered to both with an address worthy 
 of higher views and better objects. She had little, 
 valueless, appropriate offerings for every one; and 
 from an evangelical tract, or a society Bible, down to 
 sugar sweetmeats or paper dolls, her adroitness ad- 
 ministered (and cheaply administered) to the passions, 
 prejudices and infirmities of all ages, characters and 
 classes. 
 
 There were instances, however., where even flattery 
 failed ; and, there, Miss Crawley sought the dernier 
 resort of bold, pushing, presumptuous intrusion, which 
 no delicacy checked, no pride restrained. Many a 
 coroneted dame has in public felt the pressure of Miss

 Crawley’s arm on hers with the half-stifled swell of 
 provoked indignation, mortified at her own good- 
 natured weakness, which could not resist the impu- 
 dent request of protection made in the whining tone 
 of humble supplication. 
 
 With all this, Miss Crawley got on; and though 
 admired but by few, laughed at by many, and pro- 
 gressively found out by all, she contrived to obtain a 
 place in society which modest genius could scarcely 
 hope for, and which proud independence would 
 scornfully reject. Her success, like that of her 
 nephews, belonged to the day, and the circle, and 
 the family in which she lived. 
 
 During the first thirty-five years of Miss Crawley’s 
 life, she had professed herself devoted to friendship 
 and the muse ; but she by no means suited the action 
 to the word. Other altars than those of Minerva 
 had received her adoration ; and she had long coquet- 
 ted (from the bench in her brother’s (the attorney’s) 
 office, to the bench of the Common Pleas and Ex- 
 chequer), until a platonic engagement and senti- 
 mental correspondence with a certain Counsellor 
 O’Rafferty induced her to render her legal flirtations 
 “ moins bannales .” 
 
 This correspondence, fed by the tenderest hopes, 
 did not prevent other views from being cultivated. 
 Rank was her object; but in failure of her vaulting 
 ambition, which might o’erleap itself, Counsellor 
 O’Rafferty, whom she called the “ soft green of her 
 soul,” was kept in quiet reserve, until Counsellor 
 O’Rafferty, unexpectedly elevated to the bench, pro- 
 nounced a verdict so little favorable to Miss Crawley’s

 pending cause, that she saw herself, at forty, the victim 
 of a too-confiding heart, and found 
 
 “ What dust we doat on when ’tis man we love.” 
 
 The delicate line which is said to divide coquetry 
 from devotion was now broken ; and an introduction 
 at this period to some serious ladies of rank, (who in 
 Dublin preside over faith and tent-stitch, and dictate 
 creeds while they cut out shirts, for the benefit of 
 poor sempstresses and expected converts,) together 
 with the influence of an itinerant evangelical preacher, 
 the celebrated Zachariah Seare’um, awakened her to 
 a vocation which induced her to give to heaven all 
 that had once been Counsellor O'Rafferty’s. Still, 
 however, she coquetted with religion as she had co- 
 quetted with the bar; and roused many a sturdy 
 polemic, as she had excited many a promising lawyer. 
 She had ran in rapid succession through all the shades 
 of the sectarian prism, successively reflecting old 
 lights, new lights, broadlights and twilights, until 
 finally deciding that she should never stand in her 
 own light, she brought her love of rank, power and 
 ascendency to quadrate with her religious system, and 
 settled down into a High Church Methodist. 
 
 The former fantastic frippery of her dress was then 
 changed into that coquettish simplicity, adopted by 
 ladies who advertise to the world their inward su- 
 periority by the outward and visible signs of the 
 toilette,— who pin up their faith with their top-knot, 
 indicate their piety by the cut of their bonnet, and 
 look upon the bright hues and rich tints of heaven 
 and nature as symptoms of sin and badges of iniquity ; 
 but who nevertheless bestow upon their ostentatious 
 reserve of costume, a care, a precision, a singularity,

 which attracts the eye to their studied appearance, 
 and might put the recherche- taste of a finished Paris- 
 ian milliner to the blush of inferiority. 
 
 At the head of these pious petites mattresses stood 
 Miss Crawley, eminently primitive in all the exterior 
 forms of her calling ; looking upon celestial rosy red 
 with eyes averse, doubting the faith which pranked 
 itself in azure, — heaven’s own proper dye,”— giving 
 yellow to the devil, and placing coquelicot beyond 
 the pale of salvation; while her own greys, fawns, 
 puces, and snuff colors, “ breathing a browner horror” 
 over her swarthy complexion, were chosen with all 
 the delicacy and selection belonging to the studied 
 faste of the sectarian wardrobe. 
 
 Mrs. Sergeant, and Mrs. Commissioner Crawley, 
 were less marked by peculiarity than their sister-in- 
 law, at whom they laughed, — not in contempt, but in 
 envy : for they gave her credit for all she assumed, 
 and hated her for her success, as much as if she had 
 merited it. Mrs. Sergeant Crawley, half Irish, half 
 East Indian, with the brogue of one country and the 
 hue of the other, prided herself upon the fortune she 
 brought her husband, on the size of her house, and 
 the accomplishments of her four exhibiting daughters. 
 To those grounds of self-satisfaction she added the 
 honor and eternal boast of her intimacy with Lady 
 Kilgobbin, an old lady of rank arid local consideration, 
 who had been left a solitary straggler on the Irish 
 red bench, after the dispersion of the nobility by the 
 Union. Pew-fellow, card-player, and newsmonger 
 in ordinary to Lady Kilgobbin ; Lady Kilgobbin was 
 with Mrs. Sergeant the beginning and the end of all 
 things.

 With Mrs. Commissioner Crawley, on the contrary, 
 the Lady Lieutenant was the alpha and omega of 
 special reference. Her life had, however, furnished 
 her with other sources of pride. She had once been 
 the yoimg widow of an old bishop ; and when, with 
 an unprovided daughter, and a portion of an hundred 
 a year, she accepted the hand of the court-favored 
 commissioner, she had endeavored to perpetuate the 
 recollection of her former rank and connexion by per- 
 petual references to the memory of her “ dear late 
 lord.’' Cold, arrogant, and supercilious, she mistook 
 a dogmatizing spirit for cleverness, affected to despise 
 accomplishments, because she was too indifferent and 
 too negligent of her daughter to give her any, and 
 fancied herself a woman of fashion, because people ofj 
 rank came to her expensive parties, though they 
 laughed at her for the pains she took to induce their 
 visits. 
 
 It was impossible for any daughter to be less like 
 her mother, or less like the daughter of a bishop, than 
 Miss Kate Lesley. Her education had been founded 
 by the maid, who had taught her to read ; and was 
 finished by the footman, with whom she giggled 
 at the carriage window, while her precise mother was 
 paying morning visits. Not yet “ come out,” she was 
 fat, fair, slovenly, and fifteen, with her sleeves hang- 
 ing off her shoulders, her comb out of her hair, and 
 her slipshod shoes off her feet, she was, in everything, 
 a striking contrast to the four wouskydooking, slight, 
 sallow, overdressed Miss Crawleys, who had been 
 presented at the Irish court, went to parties, and 
 played, sung, and waltzed, for any one who had the 
 kindness to listen, or the benevolence to look at them.

 In addition to the Crawley family, which a six o’clock 
 dinner-bell assembled at Mount Crawley, were a few 
 guests supplied by the situation of the country, and 
 the circumstances of the neighborhood. They con- 
 sisted of two barristers, friends and (in their respect- 
 ive ways) toadies of the young counsellor ; two pro- 
 tectees of Mr. Crawley, senior, bearing the official 
 dignities of sub-sheriff and port surveyor ; two coun- 
 try gentlemen, tenants of the Marquis of Dunore ; 
 and the brigade-major of the district, who, from his 
 strict adherence to the prudent rule of never dancing 
 with the daughter where he had not dined with the 
 father, had obtained from the wits of Dunore the so- 
 briquet of the “ cut-mutton-jig major.” 
 
 Of the two barristers, the elder was one of that 
 class termed in London, Old Bailey counsel. He 
 | piqued himself principally upon the vulgarity of his 
 humor, and the coarseness of his address ; he wore a 
 coat well powdered and ill brushed* and laughed at 
 l the legal coxcombs who sought to get rid of the 
 dust of the courts before they sat down to a circuit 
 dinner. He might, however, be said rather to enter-

 tain the bar than to practise at it ; and to pick up on 
 the circuit more jokes than briefs; He was now a 
 sort of hanger-on — a proneur titre f of Mr. Conway 
 Crawley ; and was always contented to swallow the 
 insolent superiority of the son, so long as he was per- 
 mitted to swallow with it the claret of the father. 
 The other barrister, more timid and more gentleman- 
 like, followed in the track of the young legal Bobadil 
 from genuine admiration, and with a firm resolve to 
 adopt his course, and to trace his steps to promotion, 
 whatever path he might take ; indolently reposed on 
 his higher genius for his own future fortunes, and 
 catered applause for talents he emulated, the jackal 
 of another’s vanity. 
 
 The two country gentlemen were simply country 
 gentlemen, such as they are found in Munster. Gay, 
 cordial, courteous, hospitable at home, and convivial 
 abroad ; but a little out of their natural element in 
 Mr. Crawley’s circle, where the business of signing 
 leases alone had detained them. The sub-sheriff and 
 surveyor owed everything to the Crawley interest ; 
 and full of gratitude for favors yet to come, they 
 looked up to Mr. Crawley, of Mount Crawley, with a 
 deference, evinced in proportion to their expectations. 
 The applause which this gentleman usually extorted 
 from both, by a significant wink of the eye, whenever 
 he chose to be witty, or was inclined to be humorous, 
 was generally paid by the sub-sheriff* in the formula 
 of “ That’s nate !” which the surveyor constantly con- 
 firmed by the echo of “ Mighty nate !” 
 
 Such were the party assembled in the best draw- 
 ing-room of Mount Crawley, when the commissioner, 
 observing that no verbal announcement of dinner fol-

 lowed the summons of the bell, turned to Mr. Craw- 
 ley impatiently, and asked : 
 
 “ Who do we wait for ? Do you expect any one 
 to dinner, Darby ?” 
 
 “Not a Christian, 55 returned Mr. Crawley. “Thady 
 dear, give the bell a touch, and bid them dish.” 
 
 “You forget, brother Crawley,” said his sister, 
 anxiously, “ that I told you, when you came home, if 
 you would have listened to me, or to any one but 
 Jemmy Bryan, that I had asked a gentleman to din- 
 ner, a very distinguished person, who called on you 
 this morning, after you were gone to Glannacrime.” 
 
 “ Oh, very well, he’ll be here while dinner’s dishing, 
 I’ll engage. Did he lave his name ?” 
 
 “ I cannot tell you his name,” said Miss Crawley, 
 with a smile, “because I really forgot to ask it. ‘ But 
 what’s in a name ?’ as Romeo says. This I however 
 can tell you : he is not only the most distinguished, 
 but the most poetical-looking person, as dear Lady 
 Clotworthy would have said.” 
 
 “You know, Anne Clotworthy, I am always rather 
 a stiptic to your descriptions,” said Mr. Crawley, 
 winking to the sub-sheriff, “ ever since you tould me 
 that that Methodist preacher, who came to us on a 
 visit of two days, and staid three months, was an 
 angel without wings. He was without wings sure 
 enough, but it was a scarecrow without wings he 
 was the very moral of.” 
 
 “ That’s nate !” said the sub-sheriff. 
 
 “ Mighty nate !” replied the surveyor. 
 
 “When I spoke of the angelic properties of the 
 Rev. Jeremiah Judd, I alluded to the inward man, 
 and I was induced to-day to believe for a moment

 that this gentleman had brought letters from him; 
 but though he avowed that his mission into this coun- 
 try was of a serious nature ” 
 
 “ Then I’ll tell you once for all, Miss Crawley,” in- 
 terrupted her brother in a passion, “ I will not have 
 my house made a Magdalen Asylum to a parcel of 
 canting Methodistical thieves, who are of no use but 
 to set aside the simple lethargy of the church service, 
 and to substitute the errors of the Presbyterians for 
 those of the established faith. With your missions 
 and missionaries, conversions and perversions, have 
 you left me a tinpenny in my pocket, to give to my 
 own poor in New-Town Mount Crawley? And 
 pray, what’s gone of my one pound note that w^as to 
 make Christians of the black negroes? Never saw a 
 single sowl of them set foot in a church yet, barring 
 Mrs. Casey’s little black boy, that carries her prayer- 
 book to early service. And I’d trouble you for my 
 eleven and fourpence halfpenny,* Miss Crawley, that 
 you made me give to get King Pomarre, of the Ota- 
 heitee Islands, to let himself be baptized; though faith 
 I believe it was king of the Mummers, that’s king of 
 the hummers he was. And ’bove all, where’s my six- 
 teen and threepence, carried off by your 1 angel with- 
 out wings,’ for ‘lighting up the dark villages and 
 my elegant surtout , that was stolen out of the hall in 
 Merrion square, by your converted Jew, that was 
 waiting for your 1 Guide to the Land of Promise ?’ I 
 wish you had given the devil his Jew (due), and left 
 me my great-coat ; that’s all, Miss Crawley.” 
 
 “ That’s nate !” cried the sub-sheriff, looking to the 
 surveyor.

 “ Mighty nate !” echoed the surveyor, nodding his 
 head ; while Mr. Crawley, having punned himself into 
 good humor, as the man in the Guardian punned him- 
 self out of a fever, and observing the rest of the party 
 much amused at this attack upon the evangelical and 
 dictatorial Miss Crawley, continued, in a milder tone : 
 
 “ Now, Clotty dear, I tould you before that I never 
 would let one of your angels without wings roost in 
 my house to the day of my death, since Mr. Judd’s 
 visitation, who did nothing but preach and ate from 
 morning to night, frightening the life out of me, and 
 abusing the cook. I’d rather see the devil come into 
 my house than a Methodist preacher, Lord forgive 
 me ! And thinks when there’s a religion by law 
 established, which qualifies a man for every place in 
 the state, it may serve our turn, as well as our betters. 
 If this gentleman then is one of the sarious, one of 
 your missionaries ” 
 
 “ Here he is, to speak for himself; here at least is 
 one of the Dunore hack chaises driving up the ap- 
 proach, so I’ll ring for dinner,” observed the commis- 
 sioner. 
 
 “ Oh ! a hack chaise,” said his wife superciliously, 
 and letting fall her spy-glass. 
 
 “Is it a hack chaise?” asked Miss Crawley in a 
 tone of mortification ; but before any other observa- 
 tion could be made, the door was opened, and the 
 stranger, unannounced, appeared. He was in full 
 dress; and the air. with which he entered the room, 
 and walked to the place occupied by Miss Crawley, 
 was marked by a certain disengaged freedom, be- 
 yond what is merely acquired in society — the ease 
 of conscious, careless superiority.

 While he stood paying his respects, and offering 
 apologies for his late arrival to Miss Crawley, every 
 countenance in the room had changed its expression. 
 Some who had risen even forgot to sit down; others 
 eyed him with curiosity; the four Miss Crawleys 
 paused for a moment in their flirtation with the 
 barristers and brigade-major; and Miss Kate Lesley 
 left her shoe in the middle of the room, where it 
 had been thrown by Major Crawley, whose manual 
 gallantries she had in vain resisted, with “ Quit now ! 
 behave, Thady Windham, or I will complain to your - 
 aunt — I will, upon my honor;” to which the major 
 only replied by twitching off her slipshod shoe, and 
 reiterating “ Ton your honor !” The two Mesdames 
 Crawley looked mortified at their demi-toilette, as- 
 sumed for a family dinner ; and Miss Crawley’s coun- 
 tenance was radiant with triumph, in spite of the Du- 
 nore hack chaise. 
 
 _ Mr. Crawley, who loved company when he was 
 prepared for it, who liked his plate to be seen when 
 he took the trouble of displaying it, whose^ favorite 
 aphorism on a company-day was, if there’s enough 
 for ten there’s enough for twelve, and who now felt 
 satisfied that his guest was not a Methodist, advanced 
 to receive him with his wonted overcharged civility ; j 
 but when that guest appeared, his head uncovered, 
 and his face turned full to the light, the host stag- 
 gered back a few steps, and stood' gazing on a form 
 and countenance that seemed to burst upon his view 
 like some half-forgotten image of an unpleasant 
 dream. After a minute’s silent pause, he took his 
 youngest son’s arm, who stood turning over the 
 leaves erf the Review, and, glancing a furtive look

 at the stranger, drew him into the open veranda, 
 with the manner of one “ perplexed in the extreme.” 
 
 “ Con dear,” said he, “ can you give a guess who 
 that chap is, or what he is, or what brings him here 
 at all?” 
 
 “ I am sure I have not the least idea, sir,” replied 
 his son. “ I don’t think his name was announced ; 
 but I suppose you will soon know his business. 
 He seems a confident, presuming-looking coxcomb 
 enough ; most likely a recruiting officer, or a maud- 
 lin traveller to the lakes, who will eat your dinners, 
 and put us all into his book, in return for your 
 hospitality.” 
 
 “ I don’t care where he puts us, if he’s only a gia- 
 nius,” said Mr. Crawley, evidently relieved by this 
 suggestion. “ If I was sure of that, Con, — ” he 
 paused, and then added, e< It struck me just at the 
 first glance that — but what does that prove ? Sure 
 they say that I am the very moral of Paddy Duige- 
 nan about the corner of the mouth and the eye, and 
 is no more to him, either in kith, kin, or relationship, 
 than the Lord Chancellor, only just playfellows, when 
 slips of boys together, and great cronies.” 
 
 “ Does this person resemble any one you know ?” 
 asked young Crawley.” 
 
 “Dinner is announced, sir,” said the surveyor; 
 “ and Mrs. Commissioner Crawley is waiting for you 
 to hand her down, sir.” 
 
 Ceremony, with all its laws of precedence, is the 
 cheval cle bataille of the demi-officials of Ireland. 
 Every guest in Mr. Crawley’s drawing-room knew 
 his place, while the Commodore, alone accustomed 
 
 to the manners of foreign countries, where the circle

 of private salons neutralizes all rank, offered his arm 
 to Miss Crawley, because he stood next her; but she 
 gently resisted the offer, and the procession began. 
 Mr. Crawley led out Mrs. Commissioner Crawley, 
 Mr. Commissioner led out Mrs. Sergeant, Mr. Ser- 
 geant escorted the elder Miss Crawley,. Miss Lesley, 
 as a bishop's daughter, claimed the pas of the four 
 Miss Crawleys, and was ushered by the high-sheriff ; 
 the four Miss Crawleys were divided amongst the 
 lawyers, the brigade-major, and their cousins ; Coun- 
 sellor Con followed alone, proudly pre-eminent, and 
 took his place at the foot of the table; the sub-sheriff 
 and surveyor bowed each other out with pompous 
 solemnity. The stranger and the two country gen- 
 tlemen having “ done the state no service,” and being 
 without any precise Hat in this official hierarchy, 
 were left to arrange their precedence as they might ; 
 and they followed last in the train which proceeded 
 to the dining-room. 
 
 The tables of these demi-officials are distinguished 
 by a sumptuousness, a luxury, an extravagance, almost 
 unknown, beyond the highest ranks in other countries. 
 
 The dinner-table of Mr. Darby Crawley, attorney- 
 at-law, differed in nothing from that of the Lord 
 Chancellor of Ireland, except in the polish of him that 
 presided. Services and reldbes succeeded each other 
 in due alternation. The soup, fish, and pates were 
 swallowed in solemn silence ; but when the first flush 
 of appetite subsided, champagne circled, burgundy 
 went round, old hock was recommended, and every 
 one talked across the table, round the table, and from 
 the top to the bottom of the table. 
 
 Mr. Crawley, who had raised his eye3 to the stran-

 jeer’s face between every spoonful of his soup, ques- 
 tioned him with great civility, but with great hesita- 
 tion, on his opinion of the country ; and by degrees 
 yielded up his uneasy, vague, and undefinable sensa- 
 tions of perplexity to the influence of the frank 
 replies of his nameless guest, and to the exhilaration 
 of his own sparkling champagne and burgundy. 
 Thus restored to his ease, convivial, talkative, and 
 ridiculous as usual, he mentally observed, as he helped 
 himself to mock-turtle, his favorite dish, “ I wonder 
 what the devil came over me, making a Judy Fitz- 
 simmons of myself about nothing at all — -and all for a 
 look, which is no proof — how could it ?” 
 
 Thus finally chasing the unpleasant impressions 
 (whatever they might be) from his mind, he gave up 
 his attention to a series of bad jokes and circuit anec- 
 dotes, told with a broad, vulgar, slang humor by 
 young Crawley’s elder friend, Counsellor Mulligan. 
 This facetious barrister having just finished a good 
 story, of which Judge Aubrey and Baron Boulter 
 (the judges then on circuit) were the heroes, he ob- 
 served, turning to Mr. Crawley : 
 
 “ By-the-bye, sir, Judge Aubrey has let out the Ra- 
 bragh, whom you put up last summer, and whom 
 Baron Boulter left in Tipperary jail under rule of 
 bail.” 
 
 “■So I hear,” said Mr. Crawley; “but bathershin (as 
 the Irish say), mind my words, Counsellor Mulligan, 
 I’ll have the Rabragh where he wont so easily get 
 lave of absence; that’s, with due deference for Judge 
 Aubrey : and has good reason to know (though 
 nothing has been brought against him yet) he’s at

 the bottom of everything in this country, Padreen 
 Gar's boys and all.” 
 
 “ Have you seen Conway’s ‘ Familiar Epistle to a 
 Jacobin Judge , 7 written on that occasion? By Jove, 
 ’tis the best hit that ever was made, and has set the 
 judge wild, they say.” 
 
 ‘No, I have not, Counsellor Mulligan, nor doesn’t 
 care if I never see a scrap of his poethry again, while 
 I live ; and wishes he would lave off with his hits.” 
 
 “ Me !” said Conway, tossing off a glass of liquor 
 (for the dessert was now on the table). “ Upon my 
 honor I didn t write the lampoon which was circu- 
 lated at Cork, if you mean that.” And he felt as he 
 spoke for the manuscript in his pocket. “I don’t 
 know how it is,” he added, conceitedly, “ but every 
 wicked thing is laid at my door.” 
 
 “ Every witty thing is,” said the timid young bar- 
 rister, with a smile. 
 
 “ Well ! that comes to the same thing. I had just 
 the same fatal pre-eminence when I was at the Tem- 
 ple. All the foundling genius of the inns of court 
 was placed to my account.” 
 
 “ I wish,” said Mr. Crawley, flinging an apple skin 
 violently from him, “ there never was a gianius in the 
 world. What use in them ? What good did ever 
 one of them do? No, but great harm; and when a 
 man is rared at college, and has read the classics and 
 the college course, what call has he to gianius after 
 that ?” 
 
 “ I doubt, however, my dear Darby,” said the ser- 
 geant, projecting an immense pair of bushy black 
 eyebrows, in which lay all his reputation, and over 
 which he exercised a singular power of contraction

 and expansion — “ I doubt that we should have had 
 the classics to read in college, if there had not been 
 authors, and what are called men of genius to write 
 them.” 
 
 “You are quite right, William,” said his brother, 
 the commissioner, speaking with the authority of one 
 who presided at “ a board “ for if we must have 
 books to read, there must be authors to write them, 
 that’s certain.” 
 
 “ C'est clciir /” said Conway Crawley, in a tone of 
 ridicule (frequently directed at his uncles), and with a 
 smile of intelligence at his aunt, who had hitherto 
 vainly endeavored to draw the Commodore into con- 
 versation across the table. 
 
 u C y est clair indeed !” repeated Miss Crawley, with 
 an affected laugh. 
 
 “See Clare,” reiterated Mr. Crawley, senior, angrily: 
 “ well, and see Clare, and see Lyttleton upon Coke, 
 and see all the great crown lawyers that ever wrote, 
 and see if ever one of them wrote a line of poethry. 
 Chancellor Clare hadn’t as much gianius for poethry 
 as my foot, and if he had, would have been ashamed 
 to own it.” 
 
 “ I am not now,” said Miss Crawley, delighted with 
 the turn conversation was taking, “ as once, an advo- 
 cate for the ‘idle visions of the brain.’ But still I 
 think no chancellor need have been ashamed of pro- 
 ducing such poetry as Watt’s Hymns, nor do I see 
 why Themis and Apollo should not have their liaisons” 
 
 “ I am afraid, aunt,” said Conway, “ that, as my fa- 
 ther supposes, they would be ‘ liaisons danger euses? 
 Blackstone, however, was a poet.” 
 
 “ Yes,” said Miss Crawley, “ and it was a private

 traditional ane.cdote of Shenstone in the Clotworthy 
 family (for Lady Clotworthy was his relation), that 
 the sweet bard of the Leasowes was intended for the 
 English bar ; and surely had he sat upon the wool- 
 sack, he would not have denied being the author of 
 that sweetly moral and simply pastoral eclogue — 
 
 £ I have found out a gift for my fair, 
 
 I have found where the wood-pigeon breeds.’ ” 
 
 “ Oh, dacency ! Miss Crawley,” interrupted her 
 brother Darby, winking at the sub-sheriff, while the 
 ladies smiled. Miss Crawley, placing the smile to the 
 right account, triumphantly went on — 
 
 “ But let me that plunder forbear, 
 
 She will say ’tis a barbarous deed.” 
 
 “ Sorrow harm I see in robbing a bird’s nest, sir,” 
 said the sub-sheriff, addressing his critique to Mr. 
 Crawley, in conformity to his patron’s very humorous 
 look at the moment — 
 
 “ For he ne’er can be true she’ll aver 
 Who could rob a poor bird of her young.” 
 
 “ Oh ! a most lame and impotent conclusion, my 
 good aunt. But for heaven’s sake give us no more 
 of that fadaisc ,” said Conway Crawley — “ that gone- 
 by trash, which is worthy of the Della Cruscan 
 school, only that it is still more insipid, and would 
 scarcely furnish my friend of the Baviad and Moeviad 
 a peg to hang a note on.” 
 
 “ But your friend of the Baviad, my dear Conway, 
 got out of all keeping when he called Anna Matilda 
 ‘ a wretched woman’ and other hard names; especially 
 as it was known in the literary circles of Bath and 
 Litchfield that Anna Matilda was dear Lady Clot- 
 worthy.”

 “ Lady Clotworthy ! not a bit,” reiterated Conway 
 Crawley. “ Anna Matilda w T as neither more nor less 
 than that enfant glte of a particular set, Mrs. Cowley, 
 the author of that tissue of all nonsense and absurd- 
 ity, the Belle’s Stratagem.” 
 
 • ' 1 The Belle’s Stratagem !” said Mrs. Commissioner. 
 “ Why the Lady Lieutenant bespoke it this winter. 
 It was played by command ; and I had seats in the 
 next box to her.” 
 
 “And I,” said Mrs. Sergeant, “ had a row in Lady 
 Kilgobbin’s box for the girls and myself, and we 
 thought it a charming comedy, so much fashionable 
 life in it. And Letitia Hardy so talented, as Lady 
 Kilgobbin said, and sung, and waltzed so delightfully.” 
 
 “ It certainly is a very amusing comedy,” said the 
 commissioner authoritatively. 
 
 “ Very amusing,” said the sergeant, with his eye- 
 brows. 
 
 “ The Belle’s Stratagem,” said young Crawley, with 
 cool insolence of look and tone, and folding his arms 
 upon the table, “ is, what I have asserted it to be, a 
 tissue of nonsense and absurdity. I repeat the words. 
 ’Tis more, ’tis a crying sin against good taste, good 
 sense, good manners, and good morals. Its very title 
 justifies every word of my assertion. The Belle’s 
 Stratagem ! observe — Belle, a foolish French term for 
 a young woman, according to Johnson, and . so used 
 by Pope, in his Rape of the Lock. Stratagem, too, a 
 term derived from the Greek, etymologically meaning 
 an artifice, or ru>:e de guerre , a device, trick, imposi- 
 tion. The trick of a young woman, to take in a 
 young man of fortune. A notable play for mothers 
 to take their daughters to, truly !”

 “ 1 wonder, my dear,” said the sergeant, with an 
 unusual projection of the eyebrows, “ you should take 
 the girls to such a thing.” 
 
 “Lady Kilgobbin — ” interrupted Mrs. Crawley; but 
 their nephew interrupting both, and bearing down all 
 before him, poured forth a torrent of hypercriticism, 
 imposing in proportion to its shallowness; refining 
 away the merits, exaggerating the faults, misquoting, 
 misrepresenting, and misjudging one of the most ele- 
 gant and popular comedies on the English stage, 
 until all those, who had given it their unequivocal ap- 
 probation a few minutes before, endeavored to ex- 
 piate their former hasty, but independent judgments, 
 by approving, seconding, and adopting that of this 
 formidable Zoilus of the Crawley family. 
 
 During this tedious, but fluent tirade of pedantic 
 critical jargon, Miss Crawley sat transported; and 
 only fearful that a conversation should cease, in which 
 she and her eleve were alone, of all the race of the 
 Crawleys, calculated to shine, she endeavored to keep 
 up the ball, while the nephew paused to take his 
 claret. 
 
 To force the stranger into the lists, she asked him 
 across the table : “ May I beg to know what is your 
 opinion of the English poets in general ?” 
 
 This sweeping question startled the Commodore 
 into a sudden and abrupt ejaculation of “ madam !” 
 Every one smiled : Mr. Crawley winked at the sur- 
 veyor; and Miss Crawley, with her former suspicions 
 of the stranger’s vocations, revived by his silence and 
 gravity, and by the little part he had taken in a con- 
 versation, hitherto unworthy of the “ elect of the 
 Lord,” added with a demure and primitive air, “ Your

 poetical studies are, perhaps, from necessi y, far from 
 general; but Milton’s divine poem of the Paradise 
 Lost may have come under your observation, and 
 stood the test of your critical acumen ; if ” 
 
 “ The term 1 divine,’ my dear aunt,” interrupted the 
 “ never-ending, still beginning” nephew, “ is rather 
 strong to be applied to an uninspired writer; and 
 most of all to such a poet, and such a poem as Milton, 
 and his Paradise Lost. I don’t, however, mean to say 
 — pray hear me out, madam — -that Milton was not a 
 poet, and a good poet; but I must add, that he was a 
 most profane writer, and a most sacrilegious paro- 
 dist, — nay, grant me your patience one moment.” 
 
 “ I only mean to say, in my own exculpation, Con- 
 way Townsend, that the term divine, as applied to 
 Milton, does not originate with me ; that others of 
 higher authority -” 
 
 “ Oh, yes, I know, ma’am, what you would say : and 
 it is very true, that within the last century Milton has 
 enjoyed a most preposterous fame, a most exagger- 
 ated, unmerited celebrity ; a fame wdiolly denied to 
 him by his cotemporaries, the best judges ; for, after 
 all the trash that is talked about posterity, the true 
 reputation is cotemporary reputation, tangible fame, 
 fame that one can lay one’s finger on, that one can 
 touch.” 
 
 “ Devil a bit, Counsellor Con, but I give you credit 
 for that,” said his father, cracking a nut between his 
 teeth ; “ touch and go, sir, that’s the ra’al fame, for 
 my money. Sub, hand up the port, and put the 
 church in the middle of the parish — ergo , the salt- 
 cellar — I always take my nuts turn grano sails, as the 
 French say.”

 “ But,” continued young Crawley, “ even tlie fame 
 which posterity, that is, which the last century have 
 bestowed on Milton, cannot be called legitimate fame. 
 It is his political principles, that harmonize with the 
 revolutionary systems of the last fifty years, which 
 have given to the sturdy jacobin the fame that is sup- 
 posed to be extorted by the poet, a poet, by-the-bye, 
 
 who has taken the devil for his hero 
 
 “ The Lord bless us !” said Mr. Crawley, throwing 
 down his nutshells in pious horror. 
 
 “ hell for his principal scene of action, and re- 
 
 bellion for his theme,” continued young Crawley. 
 
 “ Why then, who is he at all ?” asked his father 
 with vehemence. 4t Will nobody tell me ?” 
 
 “ And of this I am certain, that had he published 
 his Paradise Lost in the present day, there is not one 
 genuine English review that would not have de- 
 nounced him for an impious parodist, and condemned 
 him, out of his own words, as profane, jacobinical, 
 indecent, and immoral.” 
 
 Everybody shook their heads, though nobody 
 knew why ; while Mr. Crawley, stealing a timid, sus- 
 picious look at the stranger, and then turning to his 
 sister, observed : 
 
 “Til trouble you, Miss Crawley, not to mention 
 that man, whoever he is, any more at my table. 
 How do I know but every w r ord of the conversation 
 may be reported at the castle, and the secatary think 
 I’m hand and glove with him.” 
 
 “ It is curious,” continued Conway, not even hear- 
 ing his father, and borne away by the shallow rapid- 
 ity of his own exhaustless volubility, “ it is curious to 
 observe Milton’s hatred of kings breaking out in some

 of his most poetical effusions. Thus, in his famous 
 simile : 
 
 * As when the sun, new risen, 
 
 Looks through the horizontal misty air, 
 
 Shorn of its beams ; or from behind the moon 
 In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds 
 On half the nations, and with fear of change 
 Perplexes monarchs.’ ** 
 
 u Perplex a monarch !” exclaimed Mr. Crawley, 
 inarticulate from vehemence. “ Och ! the thief of the 
 world ! Why, then, Con, where was the Suspendeas 
 Corpus Act? Where was the law of libel ? What 
 was the attorney-general about ?” 
 
 “ The fact is,” said young Crawley, taking snuff, 
 and pushing on the box, “ that, notwithstanding the 
 legitimate prince was then but recently seated on 
 his throne, and the reins of government still hung 
 loose, this passage nearly caused the suppression of 
 the book by the royal licenser ; and Milton and his 
 Paradise Lost would then have been condemned to 
 eternal oblivion (we cannot say unjustly), and sacri- 
 ficed to the insulted majesty of the house of Stuart.” 
 “ Better,” exclaimed the Commodore, with a sud- 
 den explosion of fiery indignation that resembled the 
 brilliant bursting of a sky-rocket, “ better that the 
 whole line of Stuarts should be given to oblivion 
 than that one bright effusion of the genius of Milton 
 i should be lost to the great nation, whose intellectual 
 glory it has raised above that of all modern people. 
 Any land might have produced the Stuarts; and one' 
 ! land, blushing to own them for her sons, twice drove 
 1 them from her shores, a false and feeble race, whom 
 Milton would not flatter, and Sydney could not save.” 
 A dead silence followed this animated burst of un-

 controllable feeling. All were struck, as much by the 
 manner as by the matter of the unexpected apostro- 
 phe. But if all were startled, old Crawley was con- 
 founded. His son, darkling with ire and irritation, 
 sat for a moment silent as the rest : while his father, 
 whose native cowardice had taken the alarm, doubted 
 whether a French spy, a government informer, or an 
 Irish rebel, now sat at his table. He was even half 
 inclined to send out an ukase to Jemmy Bryan and 
 his myrmidons to hold themselves in readiness ; but 
 he first resolved, before he took any decided step, to 
 give a toast as a pierre de touche of the stranger’s poli- 
 tical creed, a toast which he considered as the watch- 
 word of his own dominant party. Passing, therefore, 
 his hand over his face, so as to give a significant wink 
 to his youngest son, unseen by the rest of the com- 
 pany, he exclaimed : 
 
 “ Come, Counsellor Con, fill the gentleman’s glass 
 next you : I don't mane to give you a hint, ladies, but 
 before you go, you must all join in a toast, which I 
 believe no one will refuse to drink in this house ; this 
 is, sir,” (nodding to the Commodore,) “ the glorious 
 and immortal— — -” 
 
 “ The glorious and immortal what, sir ?” asked his 
 guest, putting a little wine in his glass. 
 
 “ Why, the glorious and immortal memory ; every 
 loyal man knows that.” 
 
 “ I hope I shall not forfeit my claim to that desig- j 
 nation, by confessing I have yet to learn whose happy 
 memory has merited these distinguished epithets.” 
 
 Mr. Crawley pulled down his little “ Beresford 
 bob,” as he called his wig ; he was not prepared to 
 answer such an unexpected question: and his son,

 seeing his perplexity, promptly came to his relief, ob- 
 serving coldly and superciliously to the stranger, 
 “My father, sir, gives a toast, which in Ireland, at 
 least, requires no explanation ; he gives the glorious 
 and immortal memory of William the Third.” 
 
 “ I drink it with all my soul,” said the Commodore, 
 with animation, filling first his own glass to the brim, 
 and then that of the poor Catholic gentleman, who sat 
 next him, and to whom “ the glorious and immortal” 
 was the memory of the overthrow of his religion, the 
 ruin of the fortunes and the hopes of his family. “ The 
 memory of William of Nassau,” continued the stran- 
 ger, “ should find its monument in the breast of every 
 true lover of British freedom : it is the memory of a 
 great captain, chosen by a great nation to lead it forth 
 in the defence of its natural rights and dear-bought 
 constitution, and to drive from the violated sanctu- 
 ary of their laws that despotic bigot, whose feeble- 
 ness and corruption had forced a loyal people into the 
 hazardous experiment of revolution ! with such recol- 
 lections I drink,” and he arose as he spoke, “ to the 
 glorious memory of William the Third.” 
 
 This was so new an exposition of the revered text 
 of “ the glorious and immortal,” that Mr. Crawley 
 senior was not the only person present whom it puz- 
 zled. With this party of placemen, “ the glorious and 
 immortal” had but one signification ; it was the watch- 
 word of their own influence, the cry of their own 
 petty but powerful ascendency: and these genuine 
 Tories, these advocates of their own arbitrary power, 
 had been all their lives giving the Whiggish toast, 
 without an idea attached to it, save the subjection of 
 the Catholic population^ an unequal distribution of

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 rights, and the supremacy of a narrow, bigoted, and 
 impolitic intolerance. Miss Crawley, wholly thrown 
 out as to her former opinions of the stranger, came to 
 her nephew’s relief by observing, “ Well, before I go, 
 I must express my regret that a few literary remarks 
 thrown out at random should have led to anything 
 like political discussion ; and in my own defence must 
 say, that the eulogium I ventured to pass on Milton 
 was wholly confined to his poetry; for I believe, 
 whatever may have been his principles as a politician, 
 he is, undeniably, a good poet.” 
 
 “ He has written a good poem of the second order,” 
 said young Crawley, rallying, “ for, strictly speaking, 
 the Paradise Lost is not an epic ; and in a moral point 
 of view, there is not one maxim of prudence or con- 
 duct to be drawn from it. Besides, one-half of his 
 poetical beauties are downright plagiarisms from the 
 ancients, in whose snow I can track him at every 
 step. Thus : 
 
 ‘ As when heaven’s fire has scath’d the forest oak, &c.,’ 
 happens to be a cento made up from Homer and Yir- 
 gil ; and again, 
 
 ‘ Thrice he essay’d to speak, &c.,’ 
 
 is Ovid’s 1 Ter conata loqui , et ter vox faucibus hcesit? 
 This, sir, however,” and he turned to the stranger 
 with a triumphant sneer, “ may appear fiat heresy to 
 you, and a new reading of your favorite author.” 
 “New! not at all,” returned the Commodore, care- 
 lessly ; “ I have read every word of it long since, in 
 the dull forgeries of that convicted impostor, Lauder; 
 but since the ingenious detection of Douglas, I had 
 imagined that Milton’s plagiarisms had been at rest,

 or remembered only as warnings against literary ere- 
 dulity.” 
 
 “ Shall we go, Mrs. Crawley ?” asked Miss Craw- 
 ley, rising and coloring, while the complexion of her 
 nephew deepened in its sallow hue, and became dark 
 wfith ire and mortification. He was wholly unpre- 
 pared for the detection of his gotten-up criticisms, j 
 even before an audience so insignificant. This singu- 
 lar stranger, who sat a nameless guest at his father’s 
 table, with his bursts of light and involutions of dark- 
 ness, his habitual reserve and silence, and his occa- 
 sional involuntary explosions of mind, seemed to 
 hover like an incubus over the vision of his self-im- 
 portance. Always the centre of his own circle, he 
 was alike unused to opposition or superiority; and 
 from this moment the stranger became the object of 
 that strenuous, inveterate, and unappeasable enmity, 
 which springs from the wounded self-love of a vain 
 man. 
 
 The retreat of the ladies, the removal of the great 
 table, and the placing of a smaller one, the prepara- 
 tions for whiskey punch (asked for by the sub-sheriff 
 and surveyor, and eminently enjoyed by Mr. Craw- 
 ley, who confessed himself no accoucheur in wine), 
 with the change of seats incidental to the separation 
 of the sexes after dinner, occupied a considerable 
 time ; and the Commodore was on the point of tak- 
 ing advantage of his seat next Mr. Crawley, to men- 
 tion to him the business which had brought him to 
 Mount Crawley, when he was interrupted by the en- 
 trance of a servant, bearing a letter to the master of 
 the house. 
 
 “ A coronet sale” (seal), said Mr. Crawley, wiping

 liis spectacles : “the Dunore crest, the Marchioness’s 
 hand. James, come back here. Who brought this 
 letter ; it isn’t a post one, sure ?” 
 
 “ It is not, sir ; it came by express ; a castle ex- 
 press. The dragoon has just gone down to the horse 
 barrack.” 
 
 “ A castle express !” said Mr. Crawley, opening 
 the letter with trepidation, while his son Conway 
 took his seat at the back of his chair. I 
 
 “ Hem ! Emily Dunore — Dublin Castle, August 
 25,” read aloud Mr. Crawley, glancing his eye over 
 the page to the signature and address ; then rising, 
 he retired to a remote table with his son, in evident 
 perturbation. After the perusal of the letter, and a 
 few moments’ conference, the father and son rejoined 
 the party. 
 
 “ Here is good news,” said young Crawley, with 
 affected gaiety, while his father remained silent. 
 
 “ Lady Dunore is arrived in Dublin, and is coming 
 to Dunore Castle immediately. She is merely re- 
 cruiting from the fatigues of her voyage, with her 
 friends, the viceregals, and then sets off with a large 
 party.” 
 
 “ Come, sir,” addressing his dejected father, “ we’ll 
 drink to her ladyship’s speedy and safe arrival.” 
 
 The toast went round, and many comments were 
 made on the effects of this event. The Protestant 
 country gentlemen observed : 
 
 “ This will give a helping hand to the election. 
 The presence of Lady Dunore on the spot will be of 
 infinite service to her son’s cause at Glannacrime.” 
 
 “ It will be of service,” said young Crawley. 
 
 “ Why, I thought she had given up all thoughts of

 coming to Ireland,” said the commissioner: “I heard 
 Lord Rosbrin say so in Dublin.” 
 
 “ And so she had,” said old Crawley, with uncon- 
 trollable irritation, “ but you might as well fix tli’ 
 ould weathercock on the top of Dunore Court-house.” 
 “ The residence of the Dunore family, even for a 
 short time, will do great good,” said the Catholic 
 gentleman. 
 
 “ Great !” said young Crawley, filling his father’s 
 glass, and giving the health of the absent candidate, 
 Lord Adelm Fitzadelm. 
 
 “ I wonder,” said the Catholic gentleman, “ since 
 the Fitzadelms have come in for the Dunore property, 
 that they haven’t tried to repurchase the old house 
 and grounds of Court Fitzadelm.” 
 
 “ Apropos , Mr. Crawley,” said the stranger, in a 
 low tone of voice. “ It is time that I should apolo- 
 gize for my intrusion on your hospitality, by account- 
 ing for it. I am desirous to become a purchaser of 
 Court Fitzadelm ; for that purpose I came to Mount 
 Crawley, and being obliged to leave Dunore to-mor- 
 row morning on urgent business, I availed myself of 
 Miss Crawley’s polite invitation, in order to obtain 
 an audience from you. The time, I am aware, is an 
 awkward one for business : all that I can now expect 
 to learn is, what may be my chance, and on what 
 terms ?” 
 
 “ I believe, sir,” interrupted young Crawley, l< you 
 stand so engaged with Mr. Skerrett of Inchigeela, 
 that you cannot open any new engagement.” 
 
 “ Mr. Skerrett !” said the old man, rousing himself, 
 “ to be sure I can’t. And may I presume to ask, sir,

 is it to take back, that is, to purchase, I mane, Court 
 Fitzadelm, that brought you into this country ?” 
 
 “ Not exactly, sir. My wish of taking Court Fitz- 
 adelm is merely accidental. I saw it advertised, 
 liked the description, visited the grounds on my way 
 hither, and liked them still better. I resolved to 
 purchase if I could, and waited on you for that pur- 
 pose.” 
 
 Old Crawley passed his hand across his forehead, 
 first looked at his son and then at the stranger ; then 
 he added : 
 
 “ And you mane to return to this country, sir ?” 
 
 “ My hope of arranging matters with you will be a 
 strong inducement to my doing so.” 
 
 “ Then, sir,” said old Crawley, eagerly catching at 
 his word, “ you need not give yourself the trouble. 
 The place is all as one as sowld to Mr. Skerrett, an 
 ould acquaintance, and a residenter in the country ; 
 and of course I would give a neighbor the preference 
 over a stranger, an entire stranger.” 
 
 “ It is very natural, sir,” said the Commodore. “ Am 
 I to consider this answer as definitive ?” 
 
 “ Certainly, sir,” returned Conway Crawley. “ The 
 concerns of Court Fitzadelm are, in fact, disposed of.” 
 The stranger paused for a moment, then took a 
 polite leave of Mr. Crawley, and departed.

 The intended visit of the Dunore family to the 
 ancient and long-uninhabited castle of their ancestors 
 was of too general importance to the district and 
 neighborhood not to excite sensation and awaken in- 
 terest. Mr. Crawley had made no formal announce- 
 ment of the important circumstance, but the arrival 
 of the mciitre cVhotel and a French cook at the castle 
 gave sufficient indication of the event. These chefs 
 de menage, were daily followed by squadrons of non- 
 commissioned officers, in the capacity of footmen, 
 stable grooms, and grooms of the chamber, with light 
 and heavy baggage, and all the artillery of luxury, 
 comfort, and splendor, which follow in the train of 
 the great, the opulent, and the sumptuous. 
 
 The Marchioness of Dunore was all these, in its 
 fullest extent ; and she now visited the domains of 
 her son (whom she represented) with a spirit as im- 
 perially extravagant as that which accompanied the 
 fair autocrat of the North in her journeys to her an- 
 cient city of Moscow : the means alone fell short, in

 the ratio of the states of Dunore to the empire of all 
 the Russias. The arrival of her ladyship was, how- 
 ever, to the full of as much consequence to the inha- 
 bitants of the barony as that of the great Catherine 
 to the expecting Muscovites. The higher ranks 
 looked forward to festivals at the castle, and balls at 
 the court-house, election dinners, and canvassing par- 
 ties witho t end. The lower orders were equally in- 
 terested in an event which awakened that train of 
 idle hopes to which the discontented are always vic- 
 tims. To appeal from the powerful Crawleys to the 
 powerful masters of those Crawleys was a favorite 
 scheme with many, and in some nurtured and encou- 
 raged, by one who held a peculiar influence over all. 
 This important agent was Terence Oge O’Leary. 
 
 The lower Irish entertain a respect, bordering on 
 infatuation, for what they call learning; and much 
 of this respect centres in their rustic schoolmasters, 
 the depositories of their national and traditionary 
 lore. The influence of this order of men was deemed 
 so formidable during the most unhappy period of the 
 Irish rebellion, that they became objects of peculiar 
 suspicion, not to the government, but to the petty 
 magistrates, to whom the government had given 
 such frightful and unqualified power, that ignorance, 
 cruelty and personal vindictiveness were armed all 
 over the kingdom and corporal punishments were 
 inflicted with a barbarity which exceeded the horrors 
 of the rack and the wheel. 
 
 O’Leary, on whom the fever of insanity was at this 
 period still preying, had thrown out many incoherent 
 aspersions against the Crawleys, having the death of 
 the young Lord Fitzadelm for their chief point of

 237 
 
 reference ; and a note in Latin and Irish, which Mr. 
 Crawley could not read, found in his pocket, served 
 as a sufficient pretext for vengeance at a time when 
 a magistrate asserted to the Irish House of Commons 
 “that it was necessary to whip many persons, of 
 whose guilt he had secret information from persons 
 whose names he could not publicly disclose.” Under 
 such a system, O'Leary had been sentenced to the 
 lash. To his plea of innocence Mr. Crawley replied, 
 “What, you rebelly rascal! dare you speak after 
 sentence ?”* 
 
 The sentence was put in force ; it prolonged and 
 increased his mental irritation, but it elevated him 
 to the honors of martyrdom in the estimation of 
 his sympathizing compatriots. The hopes, therefore, 
 which the return of the Dunore family awakened 
 among their tenantry and dependants were confirmed 
 by the vague, mysterious declaration of the oracular 
 O Leary, who continued to repeat everywhere that 
 “the fall of the Crawleys wasn’t far off, that the 
 reign of the land-pirates was nearly over, and that 
 the red arm of the Fitzadelms would stretch forth 
 once more over the land, or perhaps join that of the 
 Mac ar'chies More, as the Geraldines and Butlers had 
 once done” (9). O’Leary, meantime, was himself con- 
 vinced that his guest was no other than Lord Adelm 
 Fitzadelm, whose incognito arrival had preceded his 
 mother’s by a few days, and whose resemblance to 
 his unfortunate cousin had already awakened his 
 affections and devotional interest. This “ noble 
 espiall” (as he termed his guest) upon the tricks and 
 puppet-show state of the Crawleys, which he likened

 to King Solomon’s court in the “fringes” (10), had 
 slept but one night at the friary, and had left Dunore 
 the next morning for Cork, with the promise of re- 
 turning in a few days. He took with him a missive 
 from the pedagogue of the precept ory to Friar 
 O’Sullivan; “touching, plaze your lordship, that is, 
 honor I mane,” said O’Leary, “ the Ogygia of the 
 great O’Flaherty, and the Histoire cVIrlande , by Abbe 
 MacGeoghegan, which Fra Denis will dispatch forth- 
 with to me by the Dunore carrier.” 
 
 “ I will bring them back myself to you, O’Leary,” 
 said the Commodore, as he mounted his Kerry 
 steed. 
 
 “ That’s too great honor entirely, my lord ; and re- 
 minds me of the goodness of him whom you liken, 
 who carried Ware’s Antiquities, and Lynch’s Cam- 
 brensis Eversus, from Dingle town to St. Crohan’s 
 for me, on one shoulder, and a string of curlews, and 
 his little ould gun, the jewel of the world ! on the 
 other; for they were of great value to me then — 
 that’s the curlews, and helped to pay the rint; the 
 ould saying being true, 
 
 ‘ A curlew, be she white or black, 
 
 Carries twelve-pence on her back.’ ” 
 
 The stranger departed. O’Leary’s doubts as to 
 the purport of this journey, w T hich were, like all his 
 thoughts, confused and wuld, became suddenly 
 cleared up by the report of the expected arrival of 
 Lady Dunore; for it was natural that Lord Adelm 
 should go to Cork to meet his mother, and to return 
 with her to Dunore, and then discomfit the Crawley 
 faction whom he had seen “in all their glory.” Of 
 the result of the Commodore’s visit to Mount Craw-

 289 
 
 ley, as of its pretext, O’Leary remained ignorant; 
 for no communication had been made to him; and 
 the respectful deference of the Fitzadelm fosterer 
 checked the suggestions of a vague but ardent 
 curiosity. 
 
 But if the population of the barony of Dunore 
 looked forward with various views of interest to the 
 arrival of the chiefs of the territory, the Crawley s, 
 who had so long and powerfully governed it in their 
 absence, felt little pleasure from the circumstance. 
 They “ wanted no change;” and the irritation of old 
 Crawley’s spirit could scarcely subdue itself, from the 
 moment he had received Lady Dunore’s letter, or 
 suffer him to listen to the prudent suggestions of his 
 youngest son, 
 
 “ His bosom counsellor, and better self.” 
 
 It was in vain that Conway enforced the necessity 
 of “ representation,” of fitting his conduct to “ exist- 
 ing circumstances,” and meeting exigencies with “ ap- 
 plicable expediency.” To all this primer jargon of 
 the young diplomatic apprentice, old Crawley only 
 replied with an ominous shake of the head, and the 
 observation of— “ And the Glannacrime business going 
 on so illigant; and that rebelly thief, O’Leary, drinking 
 the downfall of the Crawleys at the Dunore Arms, as 
 Jemmy Bryan tells me, who was on the look out; and 
 that stranger whom Miss Crawley flopped down on 
 us at dinner the other day, lodging for a night at the 
 friary, and then exeunt manent , before Jemmy could 
 make out a tittle about him. But what signifies talk- 
 ing now ; £ on time’s uncertain date eternal hours de- 
 pend,’ as the dial-plate on the new clock says ; and 
 so send to Cork for colored lamps to light up Mount

 Crawley ; for the town of Bunore is going to illumi- 
 nate, and wouldn’t be behindhand with it.” 
 
 “ On the contrary, sir,” replied his son, “ we should 
 be beforehand, and light up New-Town Mount Craw- 
 ley, and order your new corps under arms imme- 
 diately.” 
 
 “ And a few- de-joy,' 7 cried old Crawley, cheering 
 up ; for his new corps was the master-passion of his 
 present existence \ and his son well knew the chord 
 by which his relaxed spirits could be restored to their 
 habitual tension. 
 
 Miss Crawley, who was not very deep in the fa- 
 mily politics, was the only member of the house of 
 Crawley to whom the arrival of the noble Marchio- 
 ness and her fashionable party gave any pleasure. 
 Lady Bunore had said, in that fatal letter which an- 
 nounced her intentions, that she meant “ to instal the 
 always obliging Miss Crawley (for whose prettily 
 painted skreens she returned a thousand thanks) as 
 dame du palais , or mistress of the ceremonies at 
 Bunore Castle, where she would herself be necessarily 
 the greatest stranger.” 
 
 From this distinguished promotion, Miss Crawley 
 saw a train of delightful consequences, all big with 
 influence, benefit, and importance. She would pre- 
 side over the ingress and egress of the castle, exclude 
 or admit whom she pleased, blacken and whiten, ac- 
 cording to her own personal feelings, towards the fa- 
 vorers or thwarters of her vanity and pretension. 
 She would have the Bunore patronage and the Bunore 
 purse for her “ subscription, cheap, charitable reposi- 
 tory in Bublin,” where piety and patchwork were sold 
 together for her evangelical school at New-Town

 Mount Crawley (standing equally opposed to the 
 Protestant and Catholic schools at Dunore), and for 
 her ‘ society for disseminating cheap tracts; ’ got up 
 for the especial diffusion of intolerance, and for sow- 
 ing division among the families of the credulous and 
 unenlightened : but, most of all, and best of all, she 
 would have the opportunity of converting, saving, 
 and governing the gay, dissipated, and worldly, but 
 most noble Emily Augusta, Marchioness of Dunore ; 
 of accompanying her back to London, and presiding 
 over religious conversaziones at Dunore House — her- 
 self the star of attraction to parliamentary saints and 
 borough-mongering devotees. 
 
 The evening destined for the arrival of Lady Dunore 
 at last approached, not “ like a pilgrim clad in sober 
 grey,” but like a flaunting dame, “in flame-colored 
 taffetas.” It was one of those rich, red, autumnal 
 evenings which, in Ireland, make the sole, the short 
 indemnification for eleven months of rain and vapor. 
 For miles along the road which led to the town of 
 Dunore, the expectation of her cavalcade crowded 
 the acclivities with a long- waiting populace ; and when 
 her barouche, followed by two travelling carriages 
 and out-riders, appeared turning down Mr. Crawley’s 
 new-made mail-coach road, the old war-cry of the 
 Fitzadelm family rendered the air vocal, and u Gal- 
 ruaclgh-aboo ” (shouted from a thousand voices) w r as 
 followed by the descent of a multitude, who, with 
 countenances and gestures as wild as their cry, swept 
 down the sides of the hills, threw up their hats and 
 shillelaghs in the air, surrounded the carriage, and at- 
 tempted to unharness the horses, as a token of devo-

 tion and willing hereditary servitude to the long-ab- 
 sent Fitzadelm family. 
 
 Lady Dunore (who had never before visited Ire- 
 land), with two gentlemen and one lady, occupied 
 the barouche. Rather agitated than frightened, she 
 gave way to a strong hysterical affection. Her jour- 
 ney to Dunore, like her journey through life, had 
 been subject to sudden alternations of "excitement 
 and lassitude, of emotions as opposite as their causes 
 were inadequate. She had wept and laughed in a 
 successive series since she had left Dublin, alternately 
 amused and frightened as the sun shone or the clouds 
 lowered : she now wept and laughed together ; and 
 would have screamed had there been any chance of 
 her screams becoming audible, but that was impossi- 
 ble. The cry of the “ Irishry Mere” and the wran- 
 gling of the “ English by blood” (for Lady Dunore’s 
 sturdy English coachmen and out-riders protested 
 against the carriage being drawn with suggans *), 
 gave her ladyship no chance for a successful exhibition 
 of powerful emotion. She therefore concealed her 
 face on the shoulder of Lady Georgiana Vivian, the 
 lady who sat next her, and who, infinitely more in- 
 timidated, expressed her fears only by a death-like 
 paleness and a quickened respiration. 
 
 Meantime, one of the two gentlemen, who occupied 
 the back seat in the barouche, Lord Frederick Ever- 
 sham, being not particularly affected by the alarms 
 of either lady, wdiich he saw were perfectly without 
 cause, endeavored to dispel them by diverting atten- 
 tion, and indulging his own peculiar humor. Stand- 
 ing upright in the barouche, he waved his hat, joined

 the Irish cry, and addressed the multitude with the 
 same air of mingled drollery and affectation he was 
 wont to assume in a circle at Almacks. 
 
 “ I believe,” he said, “ I have the honor of address- 
 ing the respectable population of Dunore.” 
 
 An ill-favored, but intelligent-looking man, who 
 was walking with his hand on the carriage- do or, and 
 who was the identical travelling companion of the 
 pedlar at Lis-na-sleugh, replied — 
 
 “ We’re the Dunore boys, plaze your honor, up the 
 mountains, come down to welcome home the Mar- 
 chioness.” 
 
 “ Then, if you please, I will consider you as the 
 organ of that august body, and beg to know the 
 name of so enlightened a representative,” replied 
 Lord Frederick. 
 
 “ Is it what name I have upon me, your honor ? 
 I’m called Padreen Gar, for want of a better, sir. Is 
 yourself the young Lord, plaze your honor* the Mar- 
 quis’s brother, sir ?” 
 
 “ I am a young lord, my friend, and a marquis’s 
 brother; but not Lord Fitzadelm, if you mean that.” 
 
 “ It’s what I mane, shure enough, long life to your 
 lordship’s honor. And is the Marchioness in it, sir, 
 if you plaze ?” 
 
 Lord Frederick gently drew forward Lady Dunore, 
 who from fits of crying was now convulsed with fits 
 of laughter. 
 
 “ This, gentlemen,” he said, “ is your liege chief- 
 tainess, the Marchioness of Dunore, the mother of 
 your absent chief ; and this fair lady” (drawing for- 
 ward in her turn the still intimidated Lady Georgi- 
 ana) “ is a noble Saxon dame, come among you to

 encourage your native manufactures. See, gentle- 
 men, she wears an Irish tahinet pelisse ! que voulez 
 vous ? Here, too, is the celebrated Mr. Pottinger, 
 the Baithassar Castiglione, or complete courtier of 
 the Dublin Court, alias, the Castle. He could make 
 you a bow would astonish you, gentlemen, if he had 
 but room. The delicate task now remains of speak- 
 ing of myself. I am — I am very sorry for it — a young 
 English lord of the pale, or, perhaps, more properly 
 speaking, and as you must observe, a pale young 
 English lord. I would have been Irish, gentlemen, 
 if I had been consulted ; but, c'est une affaire arrange , 
 and there’s no more to be said on the subject. If you 
 have any interest in a name, not purely Milesian, mine 
 is Eversham, and I have the honor to be in the ser- 
 vice of the Irish Lord Lieutenant, who shortly means 
 to visit this oppressed barony, to redress all your 
 grievances, grant all your petitions, banish proctors, 
 suppress tithes, to permit every man to distil his own 
 'poteen, and every woman to drink it; — -that is, if she 
 pleases : for liberty, gentlemen, liberty is to be the 
 order of the day ; so, Erin go brack ! Ireland forever !” 
 
 “ Erin go brack /” and “Ireland for ever !” now rent 
 the air, with a thousand “ long lives” and “ successes” 
 to his lordship’s honor, and the Marchioness of Du- 
 nore. For though not one word of Lord Frederick’s 
 mock address had been understood, even by those 
 who could speak English (and they were the minority), 
 yet the exquisite good humor and gaiety of the speaker 
 had their due effect upon spirits alive to every im- 
 pression of kindness and pleasantry. 
 
 The joyousness, however, that beamed in every wild 
 countenance, and betrayed itself in every forcible ges-

 ture, was soon dispelled; for the sound of a drum and 
 fife was heard at a distance, and in a few minutes Mr. 
 Crawley, accompanied by his two sons (the two elder 
 and himself in full uniform), and riding at the head of 
 the Dunore yeomanry cavalry, approached the carriage 
 at a gallop, scattering the crowd on every side. They 
 still, however, continued their route along the ridge 
 of the hills, parallel to the cavalcade, where they rolled 
 along like a mass of dark vapor, borne by the evening 
 breeze. 
 
 “ By Confucius,” exclaimed Lord Frederick, as the 
 Crawleys and their troop approached, “ here is the 
 whole armed militia of the Celestial Empire, led on 
 by the chief mandarin of the province, issuing forth 
 to meet us on our imperial progress, with gongs beat- 
 ing, and colors flying. This is too much ! dest a 
 mourir de rire .” 
 
 “It is altogether too delightful, too odd,” said Lady 
 Dunore, in an ecstacy, who a few minutes before, with 
 sobs of terror, had pronounced it “ too frightful, too 
 barbarous.” “ Oh, my dear Mr. Crawley, how do 
 you do ? This is so very kind of you, so very atten- 
 tive !” She gave him her hand, which he took off his 
 hat to kiss, while she turned aside her head, not to 
 conceal her laugh, but to indulge it. She then recog- 
 nized Mr. Conway Townsend Crawley, begged to be 
 presented to his brothers, inquired with the utmost 
 (appearance of affection for Miss Crawley, spoke with 
 vehemence of the warm feelings of the kind-hearted 
 |poor Irish, introduced the Crawleys to her travelling 
 (companions, and meeting Lord Frederick’s eye, who 
 jwas alternately gazing on Mr. Crawley and his sons 
 llthrough his glass, was again seized with a violent fit

 of laughter, as suddenly checked by a speech from 
 Mr. Crawley to some of the peasantry, who still lin- 
 gered round the carriages. 
 
 “ I suppose, my lads,” he observed, by no means 
 pleased with her ladyship’s commendations of the 
 warm-hearted poor Irish — “ I suppose there is not 
 one of yez but knows that your district is proclaimed, 
 and that not a man Jack among you but is liable to 
 be shot dead if he’s found out of his cabin at nine 
 o’clock ?” 
 
 “ The district proclaimed !” repeated Lady Dunore, 
 in a voice of surprise and emotion. 
 
 “Shot for being out of their cabins at nine o’clock!” 
 re-echoed Lord Frederick, with a transient gravity. 
 
 “ Oh, yes, my lord, one wouldn’t sleep alive in our 
 beds only for it. Not one among them about the 
 carriage there,” he added, in a low confidential tone, 
 “ but is a murderer twenty times over and over.” 
 Lady Dunore sunk back in the carriage, and in a 
 voice half inarticulate, said : 
 
 “ I wish, sweet love, we were safe back in England.” 
 “ I wish we were,” replied Lady Georgiana, return- 
 ing the pressure of her friend’s hand ; while Lord 
 Frederick, who had been the chief cause of the two 
 ladies visiting Ireland, and who felt himself thus indi- 
 rectly reproached, endeavored to turn the object of 
 their fears into ridicule ; and pointing to Mount Craw- 
 ley, which now blazed with lights on the top of its 
 high dark hill, he exclaimed : 
 
 “ By all that’s luminous, the feast of lanterns ! the 
 interior of the celestial empire in a blaze !” 
 
 “ I fancy, Lord Frederick, ’tis an illuminated air- 
 balloon,” said Mr. Pottinger. “We sent up one

 from the Castle-yard on the occasion of the jubilee. 
 The lord lieutenant walked that night about the 
 town, accompanied only by one aid-de-camp and one 
 orderly. I had the honor of driving through the 
 streets in one of the viceregal carriages, with the 
 dear little viceregal children.” 
 
 “ Memorable events, my Potty !” returned Lord 
 Frederick, solemnly. 
 
 “ But, Mr. Crawley, pray explain to us the device 
 of that very brilliant object on the top of yonder 
 hill ; is it a temporary edifice ?” 
 
 “ No, my lord, it is nat ; it is perennial, for it’s my 
 own sate of Mount Crawley, and that part which is 
 lighted up with colored lamps and transparencies in 
 honor of her ladyship’s arrival is my Grecian vesti- 
 bule or portico, supported by cantharides. It’s quite 
 a gem, a perfect bougie, in respect of the architec- 
 ture, I’m tould.” 
 
 A general burst of half-smothered laughter 
 followed this speech, but Mr. Crawley, wholly 
 occupied with his own description and importance, 
 continued : 
 
 “ That painting in the front is done by Miss Craw- 
 ley, and is an aregorical device of Lady Dunore, in 
 the character of the horn of plenty, throwing down 
 pace and prosperity on her people. To the left is 
 the great Wellington, bating the world before him, 
 with a retrospective view of Nelson’s pillar; and, on 
 the right, the Regent’s plume, and the British lion 
 there, like a little dog, trampling down upon the 
 Boney-part.” 
 
 “ Crawley, Crawley, thou art mine, 
 
 Crawley, Crawley, I am thine,”

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 murmured Lord Frederick, in a voice of unrepressed 
 ecstacy. “ To live without thee is impossible ! to 
 live with thee is death !” and he wiped the tears 
 from his eyes ; while Lady Dunore, no longer taking 
 pains to conceal her risibility, said, in a sobbing 
 voice : 
 
 “ But my dear Mr. Crawley, if you really live on 
 the top of that mountain, how am I ever to visit 
 you? You might as well expect me to get my 
 horses up Mount St. Gothard, or Sierra Leone.” 
 
 “ Why, Lady Dunore, though Mount Crawley 
 looks mighty high, seen here from the bottom, yet 
 when you are close up to it, ’tis nothing at all of a 
 hill; besides my new approach from Dunore Town, 
 if anything, has an incline downwards.” 
 
 Lady Dunore, whose hysterical affection had re- 
 cently taken a tone of risibility wholly beyond her 
 own control, now absolutely screamed with laugh- 
 ter ; while the civil Mr. Pottinger, full of the “ re- 
 spectability” of the Crawley family, and of the excel- 
 lence of Mr. Crawley’s dinners, observed in a low 
 voice : 
 
 “ I assure your ladyship, for all his lapsus lingua , 
 Mr. Crawley, of Merrion square, is a most worthy 
 gentleman, and a peculiarly loyal man. He is asked 
 to the private dinners at the castle very frequently, 
 and is a prime favorite with the secretary.” 
 
 “ You don’t really pretend, Mr. Pottinger,” said 
 Lady Dunore, half haughtily, half laughing, “ to tell 
 me who or what Mr. Crawley is ? He happens to 
 have been the man-of -business person of my son’s 
 family these forty years ; he is an excellent creature, 
 to whom we are much indebted ; only,” she added,

 laughing violently, and speaking with difficulty, “ I 
 had half forgotten his slip-slop, and never having 
 seen him sur son terrein , I find him too delicious, 
 and I do not think I shall be able to live without 
 him a day.” 
 
 “ A day!” exclaimed Lord Frederick, “ an hour, a 
 minute. Life I see will now be insupportable, parted 
 from Ching-Foo Crawley of the yellow button ! He 
 is mine henceforth, par tons les dieux .” 
 
 During this short dialogue, young Crawley was 
 urging his father to withdraw from the side of Lady 
 Dunore’s carriage, and permit the party to proceed 
 at a more rapid rate, while he took his place him 
 self, and enteied into conversation with the marchio- 
 ness. He had seen with the sensitive quickness of 
 self-love, always on the watch to sustain its own con- 
 sequence, that the blunders and vulgarity of his fa- 
 ther, while they were admirably adapted to amuse 
 the idleness, and feed that love of the ludicrous, in- 
 cidental to the class with which he was now asso- 
 ciated, were likewise throwing, by reflection, a shade 
 of ridicule upon the whole family ; and, having suc- 
 ceeded in removing him, he endeavored to efface the 
 impression of old Crawley’s folly by his own intel- 
 lectual superiority, and his knowledge of persons, 
 whose acquaintance in London were calculated to 
 increase his own consequence. He inquired for mi- 
 nisters, and men in high office, whom he had met at 
 Dunore House, asking for them by their names and 
 omitting their titles. He told Mr. Pottinger that he 
 had been made devilish ill by their friend the Irish 
 secretary’s bad claret, quoted some lines to the 
 rising moon, compared the present state of the

 southern counties to a slumbering volcano, and then 
 turned the conversation to the Glannacrime election, 
 to speak of the three hundred freeholders of his fa- 
 ther and his uncle the commissioner (who had lately 
 purchased an estate in the county), all registered in 
 time, for the benefit of Lord Adelm, whose absence 
 as yet had produced no ill effect. 
 
 “ There was no doubt,” he added, “ that his own 
 and his father’s strenuous exertions, and the influence 
 which his family’s personal and estated interest .car- 
 ried, would ensure success. The hour of attack was 
 approaching, and he w T as impatient for its arrival, for 
 it would not fail to be the hour of triumph.” 
 
 All this succeeded with Lady Dunore ; it did not 
 wholly fail with her friend Lady Georgiana ; it pro- 
 duced a whispered remark from Mr. Pottinger, that 
 young Crawley was a most talented fellow, and a par- 
 ticular friend of the secretary. 
 
 On the mind of Lord Frederick it impressed the 
 conviction that he was vulgar and presuming ; for 
 vulgarity and presumption were qualities readily dis- 
 cernible by the man of fashion and high birth, even 
 though pedantry and affectation might escape him. 
 
 The splendid cavalcade at last arrived before the 
 turretted gates of the castle of Dunore ; and as the 
 carriages rolled over the pavement of the gloomy 
 court, and the tenants of the old rookery in the rear 
 of the castle screamed their disapprobation of the 
 unusual intrusion, Lady Dunore’s susceptible spirits 
 again sunk from their high- wound pitch. 
 
 “ God send us safe out of this wild country,” said 
 her ladyship, with a deep sigh. 
 
 “ Amen,” said young Crawley, most emphatically. 
 


## p. 251 (#257) ############################################

FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 251 
 
 “ Amen,” repeated Lord Frederick, most theatri- 
 cally, adding — 
 
 “ The raven himself is hoarse, 
 
 That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan 
 Under my battlements.” 
 
 “ Good heavens,” exclaimed Lady Dunore, “ how 
 can yon, Lord Frederick ! you, too, who were in part 
 the cause of bringing me here, with your ridiculous 
 account of the 1 celestial empire,’ and your ‘ chop- 
 mandarins,’ that made me die with laughter in Lon- 
 don, but are a monstrous dull set out here ! ’ 
 
 The carriage stopped before the last gate; and the 
 lights flashed full upon “ God’s providence is my in- 
 heritance.” Lord Frederick read aloud the inscrip- 
 tion with solemn emphasis ; the ladies alighted, and 
 Miss Crawley appeared in the centre of the dark oak 
 hall, to welcome them to the castle, and to avail her- 
 self at once of the immunity which had elevated her 
 to the enviable station of Dame clu Pa ais. 
 
 Lady Dunore, who had seen her twice in London, 
 and had received a hundred pretty notes and paper 
 presents from her, was, notwithstanding this basis of 
 intimacy, on the point of addressing her as the house- 
 keeper, when Conway Crawley, anticipating, perhaps, 
 the probable mistake, stepped up to obviate it, by 
 presenting his aunt in form, as one “ equally willing 
 and capable of being useful to her ladyship, in a place 
 where all must be to her new and strange.” The 
 sliding, smiling, devoted, and reverential manner of 1 
 Miss Crawley, all homage, zeal, and humility, decided 
 at once a strong prepossession in her favor; and 
 Lady Dunore, familiarly taking her arm, as the party

 proceeded to the saloon, left the rest to follow as 
 they might, and observed : 
 
 “ My dear Miss Crawley, I must throw myself en- 
 tirely on your kindness. I am afraid I shall be mon- 
 strous unpopular here ; I do not at all know what is 
 to be done with your Irish folk ; you understand I am 
 expiring to be popular, and get Fitzadelm his elec- 
 tion ; I suppose there is nothing, absolutely nothing, 
 in this old castle. Poor Dunore, I believe, only sent 
 over a small table service and batter ie de cuisine ; but 
 you can borrow plate anywhere, can’t you, my dear 
 Miss Crawley, for our election dinners ? And then 
 we must have cups and saucers, and cut glass and 
 things for the country ladies. Somebody told me 
 they are very particular in Ireland about that sort of 
 machines. I am the plainest person in the world my- 
 self. I don’t care in the least if I eat off yellow delf: 
 I can put up with anything, only let me have plenty 
 of lamps and loungers. But, oh ! the misery of these 
 chairs, where one must sit bolt upright ! This is all 
 poor Dunore’s doing, when he would have everything 
 Gothic. Georgy, love, we shall get the lumbago. By- 
 the-bye, my dear Miss Crawley, have you any doctors, 
 or things of that kind here ? I take it for granted, 
 you know, that we must put up with every sort of 
 misery and inconvenience ; but I am myself equal to 
 anything. Heavens! here’s an old French parquet, 
 and no carpet. Good God ! is it possible to imagine 
 such a thing in the nineteenth century! My dear 
 Miss Crawley, do make me out something to put un- 
 der my feet. I don’t care the very least in the world 
 what it is ; a bit of Turkey carpet, or a Merino wool 
 rug, or a bear-skin, or anything that is soft and warm

 yon know. Heneage, will you just inquire for a 
 couvrepied , that is lying loose somewhere in the car- 
 riage ; or one of my doe-skin travelling blankets ; 
 anything, no matter what. You know I don’t care 
 j in the least, provided I have something under my 
 < feet.” 
 
 * 
 
 Mr. Heneage arose to obey, but the approach of 
 dinner, ordered to be ready at nine o’clock, obliged 
 ' the party to retire, and make some change in their 
 dress before they sat down to table. Meantime the 
 I Crawleys, though pressed to stay, took their leave. 
 When Miss Crawley’s carriage was announced, Lady 
 Dunore observed : 
 
 “ Well, I hope you will muster as strong about me 
 as possible, remember you will dine here to-morrow 
 — -and Miss Crawley, you will come over early in the 
 morning. You know I am altogether in terra in - 
 i cognita .” 
 
 Miss Crawley readily complied with this summons, 
 hinting, however, that she was just then occupied 
 with a family party who would remain a day or two 
 at Mount Crawley, and thus getting her two younger 
 brothers’ families included in the dinner invitation al- 
 ready given. 
 
 The cognizance and device assigned to Lady Dun- 
 ore, by the fanciful gallantry of Lord Frederick, was 
 a branch of the orange tree in fruit and flower, with 
 the motto — “ Le fruit ne fait pas tomber la fleur 
 and her fine person, even at forty-five, was an illustra- 
 tion of the emblem. Time indeed had faded some 
 tints, and effaced some lineaments of loveliness, which 
 no care, no art could rescue from his touch ; yet still 
 she had preserved her claims to personal admiration,

 which were not suffered to lie idle for want of being 
 asserted. 
 
 But if Lady Dunore’s personal charms had slightly 
 suffered from the effects of years, her character had 
 submitted so little to their influence, that she pre- 
 served to senility all the incoherence and unregulated 
 feeling which had distinguished her youth* and she 
 was still as fresh in folly and inexperience as when, 
 at the age of eighteen, she had eloped from a window 
 by a ladder of ropes, though the hall-door was free 
 of egress, to marry the Honorable Gerald Fitzadelm, 
 the insolvent and younger brother of a ruined Irish 
 peer. 
 
 Brought up in boundless indulgence, free as the 
 winds, which she resembled in violence and instabil- 
 ity, compliance had become to her satiety, and oppo- 
 sition enjoyment. The besoin cle sent.ir was her dis- 
 ease; and excitement, whether a pleasure or pain, 
 was necessary to 'her existence. Habit and time in- 
 creased the demand for a variable series of sensa- 
 tions ; and her marriage with the bankrupt, younger 
 brother of an Irish peer, in wanton opposition to her 
 father s will, was the brief abstract of her subsequent 
 life. 
 
 Love had no share in the union of Lord Fitzadelm 
 with the self-willed heiress of the house of L.; and 
 cupidity, disappointed by the will of his wife’s incensed 
 father, retaliated its mortification on its imprudent 
 victim. Lady Emily, in all the humiliating privations 
 of indigent rank, and all the vicissitudes of a game- 
 ster’s fortunes, led a life more consonant to her 
 unregulated character, than favorable to her happi- 
 ness. The remote chance of a succession to the

 255 
 
 Dunore property and title 1 enabled Lord Fitzadelm 
 to raise money from credulous usury ; and they were 
 enabled to support an existence, which frequently 
 touched upon the extremes of fortune, until a bank- 
 rupt credit in England drove them, after a struggle 
 of fifteen years, into an economical retreat in Italy. 
 
 The ravages of an hereditary disease in the elder 
 branch of the house of Fitzadelm, gradually brought 
 her husband nearer to the goal of his long-cherished 
 hopes. The succession was the die upon which Lord 
 Fitzadelm had staked his fraternal feelings, his honor, 
 and almost his life ; and when he was upon the point 
 of obtaining the object of sacrifices, never to be 
 remunerated by any worldly good, death snatched 
 him from its enjoyment. The old Marquis of .Dunore, 
 his remote kinsman, having followed his son and his 
 grandsons to the grave, survived his ambitious heir, 
 Baron Gerald Fitzadelm, by some years. 
 
 By her husband’s death, Lady Emily was at last 
 relieved from a precarious existence, and restored to 
 that immense fortune, of which the continuance of 
 his life had by her father’s will so long deprived her. 
 
 At the head of this princely property, and mother 
 to the heir presumptive of the Marquis of Dunore, 
 she beheld herself possessed of the disposal of three 
 voices in the senate, at a moment when even the echo 
 of a voice had its price, when the British House of 
 Commons was considered by the ministry as a 
 market where the barter of independence was openly 
 to be carried on. To this actual interest, Lady 
 Emily added the chance of an influence over the 
 political opinions of her son and his boroughs ; and 
 she became at once an object of anxious solicitude to

 ministerial intrigue and political craft. Thus sud- 
 denly raised to the summit of consideration, she 
 found no difficulty, on her son’s succession to the 
 marquisate, in obtaining for herself and younger 
 child the rank of a marquis’s wife and son; she 
 became queen at arms in the world of fashion, pre- 
 sided despotically over its heraldry, bestowed or 
 rejected claims to notoriety at pleasure, and was at 
 the head of that small exclusive class of women, who, 
 in London, hold in their own hands the keys of the 
 paradise of vogue, and give or withdraw the patent 
 bon-ton, as whim, taste, passion, or prejudice decide. 
 
 While the ministers succeeded to their fullest desire 
 with the mother, the sons (who were assailed, even 
 before they were of age, by all the undermining arts 
 which power exerts to seduce where it cannot con- 
 vince, and to attain by numbers what it wants in 
 efficiency) were found wholly untractable. Self- 
 willed and perverse as their mother, their obliquity 
 had taken another direction : they laughed at her 
 politics, and held those from whom she received 
 them in utter contempt. It was curious also to 
 observe the family temperament breaking out in a 
 third generation ; and what had been violence, bor- 
 dering on insanity, in the grandfather, exaggeration 
 of feeling, even to childishness in the mother, ter- 
 minating in absolute madness in the elder son, and 
 betraying itself in the younger, in a brilliant but 
 eccentric genius, tinctured by all the wildness, 
 oddity, and irregularity of the family infliction. The 
 young Lord Dunore had not long enjoyed his new 
 honors when it was found necessary to put him 
 under strict confinement; and his mother had the

 interest to get herself appointed his representative 
 and sole guardian* 
 
 Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, the object of all her 
 solicitude, and of whatever she possessed of maternal 
 affection, still held his supremacy by his opposition to 
 her will. Dependent during her life upon her 
 bounty, he turned even his dependence into a 
 tyranny. His extravagant demands upon her purse 
 gave occasion for that resistance and complaint 
 which now formed the principal good of her too 
 prosperous existence. His opposition to all her 
 political ambition in his favor, his refusing a seat in 
 the house, and an office at court, were sources of 
 eternal reproach increasing her artificial stock of 
 “ Unheedful passions, and unfruitful woes 
 and while his frequent absences from England, his ec- 
 centricities, and his extravagance, afforded her a con- 
 stant supply of delightful misery, he became neces- 
 sary to her existence in proportion as he tormented 
 it : and had he been more amenable to her will, he 
 would have been less dear to her affections. 
 
 Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, who went wrong by sys- 
 tem, and right by impulse, wanted only the spur of 
 necessity to have become supereminent in whatever 
 direction his talent might have taken. But fortune 
 had spoiled all that would have been a counter- 
 balance to a morbid temperament. Without occupa- 
 tion, contemning the strenuous idleness of official in- 
 efficiency as he despised the political system which 
 might have devoted him to it, he gave himself up 
 without reluctance to his natural disposition. Indo- 
 lent and meditative, subtle and fanciful, he possessed 
 the acuteness and querulousness of melancholy, with-

 out its causes. The victim of a metaphysical hypo- 
 chondriasis, he indulged in every species of eccen- 
 tricity, and was gratified by the singular reputation 
 it acquired for him in a society where dulness and 
 apathy, mediocrity and moderation, formed the pre- 
 vailing characteristics of his less gifted cotemporaries. 
 Vain and capricious, but high-spirited and liberal, the 
 shadows of his faults, like those of evening, fell with 
 a breadth disproportionate to the objects which pro- 
 jected them, and were spread far and wide before the 
 world’s gaze ; while his merits, like the rays of light 
 collected on a focus, were circumscribed within the 
 narrow circle of intimacy, where they burned brightly 
 in proportion to their concentration. He had made 
 the world the confidant of his errors, and was almost 
 jealous of the friend who acknowledged that he had 
 discovered his virtues. 
 
 Lord Adelm was in Portugal in the pursuit of some 
 object of dominant caprice, when a communication 
 was made to the Marchioness of Dunore through Mr, 
 Crawley, from the loyal corporation of Glannacrime, 
 of their wish that she should set up her youngest son 
 for that borough, on the demise of their last member, 
 and in opposition to the family of O’Mahoney, noto- 
 rious Whigs, and supported by the independent inter- 
 est. Lady Dunore, by the advice of her ministerial 
 friends, acceded to this request ; and while her uncon- 
 scious son was wooing the muse of Camoens, in the 
 shades of Coimbra, she determined to have him placed 
 in nomination for the vacant borough. A letter he 
 received, containing a few lines, without name or 
 date, but with an English post-mark, informed him of 
 the whole intrigue. This letter had nothing singular

 about it, but the motto of the seal, which was Portu- 
 guese, and was “ Sou utile aincla quc briccandoP 
 The friends or acquaintances of the. Marchioness of 
 Dunore were composed of such persons as are usually 
 found following the great to their temporary retreats, 
 from what is designated the world ; and were picked 
 up by accident, chosen by caprice, or tolerated from 
 necessity. Her dear friend and quondam rival ( selon 
 les regies ), Lady Georgiana Vivian, was a person of 
 high rank and moderate fortune, one of the supreme 
 exclusives of the supreme bon-ton. With a character 
 vibrating between sentiment and libertinism, refined 
 in her manners, free in her conduct, she had already 
 replaced the bloom of youth by the complaisance of 
 experience, and secured an ascendency over the amoiyr- 
 propre of her male friends, which brighter charms in 
 vain disputed. Acting with desperation against the 
 world’s rules, she obtained by her address its suf- 
 frages and sanction : and with an air 
 
 “ Silent and soft as saints removed to lieaven,” 
 
 
 she had the courage to venture beyond those barriers 
 of discretion, which others of freer deportment trem- 
 bled to approach. 
 
 The character and appearance of Lady Georgiana 
 formed opposite extremes. Her conversation was a 
 murmur, her look simplicity, her manner naivete . 
 She coquetted through a series of attitudes with her 
 lovely children, and talked of poor dear Vivian, 
 whom she had left at home in the gout, with a tone 
 so tender, that it was difficult to decide how so fond 
 a mother and so devoted a wife could live without 
 the objects of her affection. A letter received by her 
 ladyship from Lord Frederick Eversham had been

 shown by her to Lady Dunore. This letter contained 
 a most overcharged and ludicrous description of the 
 country from which Lord Frederick derived a salary, 
 very acceptable to the younger brother of one of the 
 poorest dukes in Great Britain. But most of all, his 
 descriptive ridicule rested upon the little court of 
 which he formed a part, and on the government, out 
 of -whose arrangements his sinecure originated. He 
 had visited many courts ; was familiar with princes, 
 and known to monarch s ; he had fought in the field 
 with emperors, and done the honors for sovereigns ; 
 a court without a government, a representative of 
 majesty without power, patronage, or influence, 
 seemed, therefore, to him an incongruous combina- 
 tion; while the solemn trifling formalities, in which 
 he was himself officially involved, afforded him end- 
 less amusement. The whole recalled to him some- 
 thing he had heard or read of the formal puerilities 
 distinguishing the government and court of China ; 
 and from the moment he discovered the similitude, 
 Ireland was to him the celestial empire, the castle of 
 Dublin,* Tien Sing , or the ‘ Heavenly Spot] and sec- 
 retaries, chiefs, subs, aids-de-camp, and officers of the 
 household, were chop-mandarins of every colored 
 button in the prismatic scale. 
 
 The letter of Lord Frederick which promised 
 amusement, the epistles of the Crawleys which 
 threatened dangers, a dead season, hatred of water- 
 ing-places, an offer from Lady Emily to accompany 
 her friend, a promise from Lord Frederick to com-

 pose a party faite a ravir for Dunore Castle, combined 
 to fix the wavering intentions of Lady Dunore. She 
 had a few weeks before given up all idea of attending 
 the election; and her new orders, issued with the 
 promptitude of lightning, and executed with equal 
 celerity, enabled her to reach Dublin before she could 
 find leisure to inform Mr. Crawley that she had 
 changed her mind. 
 
 The party promised by Lord Frederick to dissipate 
 the ennui of Lady Dunore, consisted of Mr. Heneage, 
 a young Englishman of fashion, and brother aid-de- 
 camp, and a Mr. Pottinger, whom Lord Frederick 
 had described in his letter as the “ Baldassar Castig- 
 lione,” the Cortegiano of the Irish court, and the very 
 representative of its insignificance, formality, and ob- 
 sequiousness to all the powers that be. To call forth 
 the results of these qualities had indeed been the 
 principal amusements of Lord Frederick’s life, ever 
 since his arrival in Ireland; while Mr. Pottinger, 
 proud of being distinguished by any great man, 
 looked up to the brother of a duke with a deference 
 which no consciousness of Lord Frederick’s ridicule 
 ever disturbed. 
 
 Mr. Heneage was of the rising order of dull dan- 
 dies ; he had just sufficient volition to choose his call- 
 ing, and sufficient energy to iron the cravat that indi- 
 cated it ; he spoke little, because he had nothing to 
 say, and would have spoken less had it been possible 
 in the necessary intercourse of life to use fewer 
 words; for he believed that to be truly fine, one 
 should not speak at all. His dandy aphorism was, 
 that every lady should be her own link-boy, and his 
 dandy system was to suffer her to be so.

 Lord Frederick, though a young man, was a dow- 
 ager dandy, and was among the original founders of 
 that now degenerate and declining order. Great 
 tact, savoir vivre and humor had distinguished his 
 early probation, when to be a dandy it was requisite 
 to be something more than a coxcomb. Two years’ 
 residence in Paris (where as a prisoner of war on 
 parole he had been the delices of every fashionable 
 circle) had confirmed him a m,erveilleux ; and he now 
 so pleasantly mingled the fopperies of his home vo- 
 cation and foreign calling, that it was difficult to say 
 whether St. James’s street or the Chaus see cPantin 
 had the fairest claim to his peculiarities. For the 
 rest, Lord Frederick was one 
 
 “ Whom folly pleases, and whose follies please,” 
 who almost dignified vanity, and rendered affectation 
 supportable by the good sense and good feeling 
 which, in spite of his efforts to conceal both, formed 
 the basis of his character. 
 
 In gallantry aimer en courant was his device ; and 
 it was literally en courant from Dover to Dublin 
 (where his new appointment awaited him) that he 
 dropped into the opera, saw Lady Georgiana Vivian 
 in Lady Dunore’s box, found or fancied in her what 
 he called “ the delicious laissez aller ease of a charm- 
 ing French woman;” and after a few days devoted 
 aux petit soins , left London in love and despair. 
 
 Lord Rosbrin, who did not arrive with this party 
 faite a ravir , but who was to join it from his seat in 
 the neighborhood, was a foolish-looking young man, 
 whose vacant countenance seemed to beg Macbeth’s 
 question of 
 
 Where got’st thou that goose look T

 He was born and educated in England ; his vast pro- 
 perty lay in the south of Ireland ; and his first visit to 
 that country was for the purpose of enlisting himself 
 into the service of the Kilkenny theatricals, where 
 his rank not obtaining for him a high cast of parts, 
 he was contented to exhibit himself as one of Mac- 
 heath’s gang, and to appear in the character of mutes, 
 senators, generals, and others. 
 
 The intellectual capabilities of Lord Rosbrin went 
 further towards overturning the doctrine of innate 
 ideas than all Locke has written on the subject, with- 
 out, however, affording much testimony in favor of 
 ideas acquired. His mind was a tablet upon which 
 memory, the genius of fools, had made some traces ; 
 and upon this stock of tag-rag recollections, obtained 
 from play-books, he had traded through life, without 
 any one calling into question his property in the pos- 
 session. Yain, in proportion as he was weak, his 
 dramatic vocation had arisen from the applause be- 
 stowed upon his recitations when a child ; and the 
 blue and silver draperies in which he had played Ariel 
 at a private theatre, decided his calling for life ; from 
 that moment to him “ all the world was a stage, 
 
 ‘ And all the men and women merely players.’ ” 
 
 His mind was stored with theatrical associations, 
 stage properties, and stage anecdotes, leaving him 
 little better than a walking prompter’s book. Ambi- 
 tioning the first class of parts in the theatre he was 
 building at Kilrosbrin, he looked down upon all sen- 
 ates but that in Othello ; and preferring the potent, 
 grave, and reverend signors of Venice to the potent, 
 grave, and reverend signors of St. Stephens, he 
 threw his Irish boroughs into the hands of a political

 stock-jobber, who dabbled so successfully for him in 
 the funds of ministerial influence, that from a mere 
 Irish baronet he in a few years became Baron, Vis- 
 count, and Earl of Rosbrin of Kilrosbrin in Ireland, 
 and Mount Wareham in England. 
 
 To meet this party, Lady Dunore had sent from 
 Dublin a most pressing invitation to her maternal 
 uncle, the Right Honorable Hyacinth Daly, of Daly’s 
 Court, in the province of Connaught, who obeyed 
 the summons with such alacrity, that he was seated 
 at his niece’s toilette the day after her arrival at the 
 castle. He loved her for her mother’s sake, whose 
 frailty and misfortunes had substituted pity for the 
 resentment which had risked his life in a duel with 
 her betrayer. Mr. Daly, now in his seventieth year, 
 of an ancient Irish family, which for two centuries 
 had represented their native county, a privy-coun- 
 cillor of forty years’ standing, and one of the small 
 minority which went out on the occasion of the 
 Union, was in person, character, and manners, a 
 genuine epitome of the ancient Irish gentleman. He 
 preserved, even at his advanced age, that species of 
 chivalrous gallantry in his manners, which not long 
 since distinguished the gentry of the country, and 
 which sent them forth to foreign courts the most 
 accomplished cavaliers of their day; or as a mon- 
 arch, who was himself a fine gentleman, named 
 them, “ the finest gentlemen in Europe.” Time, 
 which had shed its snows on the venerable head of 
 Hyacinth Daly, had not “ thinned his flowing hair,” 
 which he still wore dressed with infinite care, and 
 precisely as he had worn it forty-four years before,

 when he first took his place in the Irish House of 
 Commons. 
 
 Mr. Daly had distinguished himself in the House 
 of Commons, in the memorable year 1782, when 
 Ireland for a moment was a nation ; and he had kept 
 his noble mansion in Dublin until the Union ; then, 
 having followed the liberties of his country from 
 their cradle to their tomb, he retired forever from 
 the scene of their ruin, spent his winter in London, 
 and his summer at Daly’s Court ; and never saw the 
 capital, but to pass through it, for the purpose of 
 crossing the Channel. His mansion in Dublin (now 
 a barrack) had been open to all the rank, talent, and 
 worth of the land. There, all that has been flatter- 
 ingly said of the genius, spirit, and gaiety of the Irish 
 character, was realized in its circles : there he had 
 lived with the Charlemonts, the Burghs, the Grat- 
 tans, the Currans, the Floods : and there, many a 
 beauty, who had afterwards added splendor to the 
 galaxy of British loveliness, had imped her wing for 
 conquest, — the Gunning, Monroe, or Birmingham of 
 her day.

 George Dandin. 
 
 The time, thoughts and feelings of Lady Dunore, 
 on the day after her arrival, were wholly engrossed 
 by the three leading members of the Crawley family, 
 whom she had received in her dressing-room after 
 breakfast. 
 
 The elder Crawley overwhelmed her with mano- 
 rial business, plunged her in all the endless details of 
 rents and roads, leases and fines, bills, parchments, 
 and accounts, till her eyes were dazzled with figures, 
 and her head ran round with fatigue. The business, 
 upon which she had at first entered with eagerness, 
 as being new and out of her way, became intolerably 
 wearisome and insupportably disgusting in its pro- 
 gress. Throwing from her therefore a pile of papers, 
 with which Mr. Crawley had heaped her table, she 
 exclaimed in a tone of exhaustion : 
 
 “ There, Mr. Crawley, I can hold out no longer ; 
 pray remove these horrors from my sight if you wish 
 me to live. You are the best judge of what is for 
 my son’s interest. You have always been active in 
 our service. Only we want money to carry on the 
 war, observe ; for you Irish are always dreadfully in

 arrears, and we must get our rents better paid. For 
 the rest, if you wish me to remain among you ano- 
 ther week, never overwhelm me again in this way. 
 I would rather,” she added, gradually working her- 
 self into a fever of annoyance, “ I would rather be 
 mistress of an Irish cabin, and live upon your Irish 
 potatoes and buttermilk, than submit to this, Mr. 
 Crawley ; and if such is the tax upon Irish property, 
 give me back the ‘far niente 7 of my Italian indigence, 
 where, when one enjoyed the climate, one enjoyed 
 everything; and where time, patience, temper, plea- 
 sure and health were not sacrificed for leave to live 
 in a melancholy old castle, on a savage sea-coast, at 
 the head of a beggarly town, amidst clouds and 
 storms, and among people who, as Mr. Conway says, 
 even when quiet, may be compared to a slumbering 
 volcano.” 
 
 Old Crawley, having thus attained his point, swept 
 up all his papers and parchments into his green bag, 
 with a mingled look of obsequiousness and humor, 
 and was succeeded by the law agent for the election. 
 He, in his turn, poured forth a tirade of invectives 
 against the whiggish O’Mahonys, whom he repre- 
 sented as sturdy opponents of the present order of 
 things, and as inflaming the minds of the people for 
 their own private ends. He spoke of strengthening 
 the hands of her ladyship’s ministerial friends, talked 
 jocosely of “ we the corruptionists,” paraded, with 
 great pomp of words, his electioneering schemes, de- 
 tailed his wonderful successes, and went through a 
 general account of the large sums which had already 
 been lavished in the prosecution of the cause. 
 
 With this specimen of his business talents he con-

 trived to mingle some smart jokes and good points, 
 drew forth his “ little equipage of wit!” dealed 
 largely in quotations, poetical and French scarps, 
 and rounded on his peroration with a well-timed, 
 well-placed and well-received flattery, offered to the 
 rank, political importance, and even personal attrac- 
 tion of his noble patroness. 
 
 “Well,” interrupted Lady Dunore, yawning, as he 
 attempted to return to some details of the freehold- 
 ers lately registered ; “ well, for the present that will 
 do, Mr. Conway; but spare me the refrain of the 
 eternal election. You have managed so well that I 
 think we may promise ourselves a dull kind of suc- 
 cess enough. It would set one wild, though, if Fitza- 
 delm should come over and spoil all, by refusing the 
 borough, after so much money has been spent upon 
 it.” And she added, with a look that indicated it 
 would not be an unpleasant thing if he did, “ but 
 there is no chance of that, and so things will go on 
 sleepily enough; and I don’t think I need go to 
 oatch one of your Irish typhuses, that you describe 
 so frightfully, by personally canvassing your greasy 
 corporation people of Glannacrime. But, oh dear, 
 Miss Crawley, what pretty things are you making 
 out of that scrap of couleur de rose note paper? 
 Couleur de rose is such a relief to the eye after yel- 
 low parchments.” 
 
 “ It is an invisible fly-trap, madam, to catch the 
 little epicures who come to feast upon hands, which, 
 as Cleopatra says, 1 kings have lipped,’ ” replied Miss 
 Crawley with an insinuating smile. 
 
 Miss Crawley, with scissors and cut-paper, now 
 succeeded in her turn to her brother and nephew.

 But pink paper, like yellow parchments, and fly-traps, 
 as well as elections, were destined rapidly to wear 
 out the attention of Lady Dunore ; and Miss Craw- 
 ley had recourse to the castle, of which she voted 
 herself the cicerone, to revive her flagging interest, 
 and to engross her ladyship to herself for the rest of 
 the day. In the course of two hours they had mounted 
 to the highest turret, descended into the deepest dun- 
 geon, penetrated the darkest closet, stood exposed 
 upon the rudest battlement, talked of ghosts and 
 rebels, balls and insurrections, marked out alterations 
 and improvements, ramparts to be thrown down, and 
 verandas to be raised, swans to be procured, and 
 ponds to be cut for them, the sea to be banked out, 
 and rivers to be turned in, families to be excluded, 
 and families to be admitted : all this was diversified 
 with discussions upon evangelical schools, quotations 
 from evangelical tracts, and many, very many soft, in- 
 sinuating, penetrating compliments from the diplo- 
 matic Miss Crawley, on the reform which the power, 
 influence, rank, talents, and virtues of Lady Dunore 
 might effect in a dark, unfortunate, and bewildered 
 people. 
 
 Reform, with Lady Dunore, meant change : change 
 was always delightful; and, for the present, so was Miss 
 Crawley, who indicated its possibility, and who had al- 
 ready awakened so strong a prepossession in her in- 
 tended neophyte, that Lady Dunore would not part with 
 her, to return to Mount Crawley to dress for dinner, 
 till she had promised that, as soon as her family visi- 
 tors should leave her, she would come and take up 
 her residence at Dunore. The male Crawley s had 
 fatigued with their facts, the female had amused with

 her speculations; both served their own purposes, 
 while they played with her feebleness and caprice ; 
 and as Miss Crawley drove off from the castle in her 
 jaunting-car, she mentally exclaimed, with triumph, 
 
 “ Dame du Palais indeed ! and now let Lady Clan- 
 care look to it.” 
 
 The fashionable guests at Dunore Castle had not 
 met till the idle half-hour before dinner assembled i 
 them in the saloon, into which they straggled one by 
 one. Mr. Pottinger was engaged with Debrett’s 
 Peerage, Mr. Heneage with his cravat, and Lady 
 Georgiana in winding gold thread from an ivory reel, j 
 held by Lord Frederick, who lay lounging beside her 
 on an ottoman, when the whole house of Crawley, 
 male and female, were announced en masse ) and made 
 their entrance together. The men were in inky suits 
 of professional black, save the major, who was all 
 scarlet and medals. The ladies were covered with 
 Honiton lace, and Irish diamonds. The four tawney 
 Miss Crawleys were beflounced and befurbelowed 
 knee deep ; and Miss Leslie dragged up her gown on 
 her fat white shoulders, as she entered, with a look 
 of innocent effrontery that might put even fashionable 
 -ease to the blush of inferiority. 
 
 This “incursion of the Kalmucks,” as Lord Fred- 
 erick termed it, seemed to afford him strong motives 
 for amazement and delight. He dropped the ivory 
 reel, seized his glass, and murmured his observations 
 to Lady Georgiana, who seemed no less amused than 
 himself, while, according to precedence precise and 
 formal, they passed up to the top of the room, where 
 Mr. Pottinger, with his old habits of ceremony, stood 
 receiving them in the absence of Lady Dunore, the 
 
 \

 lady lieutenant of the hour. The eldest Miss Crawley 
 was the first, as proudly pre-eminent in ridicule, to 
 attract Lord Frederick’s attention; and he asked 
 Lady Georgiana, whose spy-glass followed the direc- 
 tion of his own, “ Now, in pity, who is that Berg ere 
 derangee , so withered and so wild in her attire ? — 
 the oldest piece of mortality, surely, that ever took 
 shelter under a white chip hat. Cela a cent ans 
 sonnes ! not an hour less ! and then the matron, with 
 the green necklace and the green eyes, set apparently 
 by the same hand ; — and those four little 1 tawny tight 
 ones,’ and the fat pretty roily polly soul, with the 
 brogue in her shoulders ! dest impayable . But here 
 comes Ching-foo Crawley, of the yellow button, at 
 the head of the Chop Mandarins of the interior. I 
 must go and do ko-tou, and renew my acquaintance 
 with him. No, the whole celestial empire furnishes 
 nothing like my Ching-foo Crawley.” 
 
 While Lord Frederick, with great cordiality, re- 
 turned the familiar pressure of Mr. Crawley’s two 
 hands, who, as his lordship afterwards expressed it to 
 Lady Georgiana, was an “ embrasseur impitoyable ,” 
 Lady Dunore entered, leaning upon her uncle’s arm, 
 flushed and animated by the bustle and excitement 
 of the morning, and by the arrival of her venerable 
 relation, who was the most welcome of all her guests, 
 because he was the last. She received the whole 
 Crawley congress, to’ many of whom she was a 
 stranger, with an air imposing from its decided but 
 carelessly betrayed consciousness of high superiority; 
 and which was the more marked by the exaggerated 
 condescension in her manner and cordiality, which,

 though eminently conciliating, was anything but 
 familiar. 
 
 When the first salutations were over, the Crawley 
 phalanx, “ taking close order,” ranged into a formal 
 circle, and seating themselves in a row with the regu- 
 larity of nine-pins, looked as if they were incorporated 
 with their chairs, and remained silent, motionless, 
 and under evident restraint. The women, when 
 called upon by Lady Dunore, minced their Irish 
 accent, and spoke in monosyllables to conceal it : the 
 men for the moment were struck dumb by the 
 appearance of the “ great Daly of Daly’s Court,” who 
 was out of their caste and class, and whom they had 
 never seen at the castle dinners. The intermitting 
 fever of Lady Dunore now seized upon her imagina- 
 tion, as she contemplated the group of which she was 
 the restless centre. The Crawley circle was a circle 
 she never could break ; the Crawley dulness was a 
 duln ess she never could dissipate; and she fluttered 
 and floundered, as if under some spell, which, all 
 restlessness, motion, and ennui, she in vain endeav- 
 ored to dissolve. Lord Frederick, seated by Lady 
 Georgiana, followed her motions with transport, and 
 whispered to her as she hovered near him : 
 
 “ Marquise de mon ame , that circle is your death- 
 warrant. You die the death of a bored: this day, 
 this fatal day, je vous en repond , bel idol mio. Look ! 
 ’tis the hieroglyphical circle of eternity ! the serpent 
 with his tail in his mouth ! an image of the durability 
 of the celestial empire ! and of the reign of the Craw- 
 ley mandarins and mandarinas, without beginning or 
 end!” 
 
 “ I won’t wait another minute for Rosbrin,” said

 the marchioness, reddening to the eyes, and pulling 
 the bell with a violence that left its cord in her 
 hands. “ I will have dinner directly !” 
 
 “ Wait for Rosbrin !” repeated Mr. Daly : “ no, to 
 be sure ; nobody waits for Rosbrin. His movements 
 are more likely to be regulated by a prompt-book 
 than a time-keeper ; for while your soup cools at Du- 
 nore, he is probably ‘ supping, full of horrors,’ at 
 Macbeth’s banquet; or perhaps flinging a shoulder of 
 mutton at Catherine’s head, while your venison drops 
 from the spit.” 
 
 Of all the members of the Crawley family, ole? 9 
 Darby, though lowest in professional rank, was the; 
 person most at ease with respect to himself, and the) 
 circle in which accident might place him. His proud 
 consciousness of native humor, if it did not enable 
 him to distinguish between being laughed with or 
 laughed at, led him to risk himself in all situations : 
 for, save where his worldly interests were concerned, 
 there was an obtuse, inveterate, untractable dulness 
 about him, which left him the most unguarded mark 
 the point of ridicule could aim at. The distinguished 
 attention paid by the marchioness to his family, the 
 desire to show off before Mr. Daly, and to evince to 
 him the intimacy in which he stood with the Dunore 
 family, now led him to the assumption of a more than 
 ordinary ease and familiarity; and before the mar- 
 chioness had finished her soup, he addressed her 
 with — 
 
 “ If I’m not entirely mistaken, the last time I had 
 the honor of tete-a-tete-mg your ladyship in a glass of 
 wine, as the French say, it was at your sweet little 
 villa of Sans six sous , near London : and I should be

 proud if you would allow me the honor of com- 
 memorating that pleasure now. I remember some 
 charming Madeira you had at Sans six sous. What 
 wine does your ladyship choose, madam ?” and he 
 looked in vain for the wine glaciers of solid silver, 
 which heated rather than cooled the wines of his own 
 table. Miss Crawley had equally in vain whispered 
 “ Sans souci ) during this speech, while Lord Fre- 
 derick, laying down his spoon with a look little short 
 of ecstasy, called the attention of Lady Dunore, who 
 was debating with Mr. Daly the probability of Lord 
 Rosbrin’s arrival, by saying : 
 
 “ Lady Dunore, Mr. Crawley is addressing some 
 little reminiscence to your unattending ear, about 
 Sans six sous , your villa near London. 15 
 
 “ I am after requesting your ladyship to drink wine 
 with me,” added Mr. Crawley. 
 
 91 Oh, willingly ; but I don’t drink wine at dinner. 
 I am upon a regimen just now : but I’ll take soda 
 water to your wine, Mr. Crawley, with all my heart.” 
 
 This was an innovation in Mr. Crawley’s idea of 
 good breeding, which threw him entirely off his cen- 
 tre. In his circle, ladies never refused to take wine, 
 whether they wished for it or no : and the circum- 
 stance of no wine being upon the table added to his 
 confusion ; when the butler stepping up, and asking 
 what wine he chose, relieved his perplexity, and he 
 answered, “Port, if you plaze;” adding, “if your 
 ladyship is upon a regiment, I should be sorry to 
 make you give up your proscription. So I shall have 
 the honor to drink your ladyship’s health, solus cum 
 solo” 
 
 “ Thank you, thank you, Mr. Crawley,” said Lady

 Dunore, laughing unresistingly, while Lord Frederick, 
 wholly foregoing his soup, ecstasied over the richer 
 feast presented him by Ching-foo Crawley of the yel- 
 low button. Meantime Mr. Crawley repeatedly 
 sipped from his glass with a great variety of expres- 
 sion in his countenance, each indicating disappoint 
 ment ; till at last he bent forward, and with a face of 
 great importance, said : 
 
 “ Pray, my lady, who do you dale with ?” 
 
 “ Who do I deal with, Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “ Yes, madam : I’d just be glad to know the name 
 of your ladyship’s wine merchant, that’s all.” 
 
 “ I believe that wine was sent in, two years back, 
 by poor Lord Dunore. Is it not so, Robertson?” 
 
 “ Yes, my lady.” 
 
 “ Why, then, whoever he is, he does not use you 
 well,” returned Crawley, significantly. 
 
 “ Why, what is the matter ? Is the wine bad? Pray 
 taste that wine for me, Mr. Daly.” 
 
 Mr. Daly having put the glass to his lips, exclaimed, 
 with a look of nausea, “ By Jove, ’tis catsup.” 
 
 “ I give you my honor,” said Crawley, coolly, “ I 
 thought it was no great things, no more nor the mare 
 that ran for the whiskey ; but didn’t care to be the 
 first to find fault ; for every one to their taste ; and I 
 didn’t know what might have been the bon mot of 
 London in the present day.” 
 
 u Oh, but you Irishmen are such judges of wine,” 
 said Lady Dunore, laughingly, “I suppose it is veryJ 
 difficult to please you.” 
 
 “We were,” said Mr. Daly, “before the introduc- 
 tion of that coarse, vulgar beverage, port, at our 
 tables, which the severe taxation at present obliges

 us to drink. In my time, every gentleman imported 
 liis own claret, which he drank out of the wood ; and 
 they tapped a hogshead of French wine as we now 
 broach a barrel of small beer.” 
 
 “ It is, however, to that very taxation,” said young 
 Crawley, pertly, “ together with other measures of 
 equal^wisdom of his Majesty’s ministers, that we owe 
 our present prosperity.” 
 
 “ Exactly,” said Mr. Daly, dryly. 
 
 “ Exactly,” in an emphatic tone, reiterated every 
 member of the Crawley family ; while the commis- 
 sioner made a speech upon the flourishing state of 
 the revenue, and concluded with asking lady Georgi- 
 ana to take wine. Lady Dunore, taking the hint of 
 drinking wine, whispered Lord Frederick — 
 
 “ Now pray do the honors, and help me on, or I 
 shall never hold out.” 
 
 “No, no — now pray,” said Lord Frederick, “it is 
 not in my way. Heneage always drinks wine with 
 the young ladies at the castle, as youngest aid-de- 
 camp.” 
 
 Mr. Heneage, thus called on, pointed his spy-glass 
 round the table to observe who was worthy of the 
 distinction, and at last sent the butler to Miss Leslie, 
 who sat within two of him ; and then leaning back in 
 his chair, and suffering his own man to fill his glass, 
 instead of bending forward to meet the accustomed 
 inclination of the head of the fair person he had chal- 
 lenged, he simply asked the servant, “ Wilkie, does 
 she bow ?” and being answered in the affirmative by 
 his cup-bearer, he drew his chin within his impregna- 
 ble citadel of starched muslin, and again gave up his 
 attention to his Bechamelle.

 The first course was still removing, when the at- 
 tention of the whole company was attracted to the 
 windows by a curious sort of vehicle — a chaise-marine, 
 covered with a canvas* awming, gaudily painted w r ith 
 dramatic trophies, cups, daggers and masks, sur- 
 mounted with a scarlet flag, and drawn by four horses, 
 with bells and showy harness, driven by two boys, in 
 English wagoners’ frocks, and straw hats with green 
 ribbons, resembling the carter’s, formerly produced on 
 the stage in “ Love in a Village ” 
 
 “ Good heavens !” exclaimed the startled, and there- 
 fore delighted, Lady Dunore, “ what is that ?” 
 
 Everybody rose from their seats, and Mr. Daly ob- 
 served : 
 
 “ That ! that’s Lord Rosbrin’s thespian car, as he 
 calls it, which he brings everywhere with him in Ire- 
 land, and which is freighted with theatrical para- 
 phernalia.” 
 
 “ Is he so stage-struck as that ?” asked Lady Du- 
 nore of her uncle. 
 
 u He asserts that he is so, upon political and na- 
 tional principles. Haven’t you heard of his new sys- 
 tem of civilizing Ireland, by establishing dramatic 
 encampments, and opening private theatres in the 
 remote counties, as we found schools, drain bogs, or 
 cut roads through the mountains for the public 
 good ?” 
 
 “ Do you know that I think his scheme excellent,” 
 said Lady Dunore, who, like the maitresse du tripot 
 of Scarron, “ aimoit la comedie plus que sermon ou 
 vepres u and I promise you he shall have my hearty 
 concurrence. I will have one of the turrets turned 
 into a theatre immediately.”

 A chariot and four, with out-riders, now passed the 
 windows. 
 
 “ Here is Rosbrin himself,” said Mr. Daly ; and at 
 Lady Dunore’s desire he went forth to receive his 
 grandnephew. Lord Rosbrin soon appeared, follow- 
 ing his venerable kinsman, on whose countenance 
 a good-humored ridicule was visibly marked. His 
 lordship had made his toilette at the last stage, and 
 presented himself to the delighted and astonished 
 eyes of the Crawley ladies, in the singular and elegant 
 costume of an Austrian General : his belt, studded 
 with mock stones, his embroidered pelisse, his yellow 
 boots and waving plumage, produced all the sensa- 
 tion he expected, on those who had never seen him 
 before, and even on those who had. After a mo- 
 ment’s pause, he advanced ; and having paid his 
 respects to Lady Dunore with a theatrical air, he 
 turned alternately to Lord Frederick and Mr. Hene- 
 age, giving a hand to each, with “ Great Glamis ! 
 Worthy Cayrdor !” then bowing round the table, 
 solemnly pronounced — “Now good digestion wait on 
 appetite, and health on both !” and took his place by 
 his fair hostess and cousin. 
 
 “ You seem out of spirits, Rosbrin,” said Lady Du- 
 nore, observing the short incoherent answers he gave 
 to some questions put to him by some of the company. 
 
 “ I care not for my spirits,” he answered in the 
 words of Celia, “ if my legs were not weary. But I 
 pray you bear with me, gentle coz.” 
 
 “ Bear with you ! Why, what is the matter ?” 
 asked Mr. Daly. 
 
 “Nay, mine uncle Clarence, nothing of moment; 
 but I have been fagging to death to get my theatre

 up at Kilrosbrin against November. We open with 
 Macbeth; an amazing strong cast; great tragedy 
 forces. I mean to play Lady Macbeth myself. Mrs. 
 Siddons is to lend me her old point, the finest, the 
 only original point in the world : were it mine, I 
 would not exchange it for ‘ one entire and perfect 
 chrysolite.’ Apropos of the Siddons’ dynasty. I dined 
 in private with Kemble the other day : mark me, 
 ‘ good man delver you will hear of an event in the 
 dramatic world will 1 scatter wild amazement round.' 
 Let Drury look to it : there's 1 something rotten in 
 the state of Denmark.’ I shall allude to it in my 
 opening prologue.” 
 
 “ By-the-bye, I am enchanted with your theatrical 
 scheme, Rosbrin” (11), said his fair cousin, “ and mean 
 to visit you as soon as you open the campaign.” 
 
 “ ‘ That will be ere set of sun,’ ” replied Lord Ros- 
 brin, “ that is, I mean by November, in order to fol- 
 low close upon the Kilkenny plays. Their ‘ funeral 
 baked meats will coldly furnish forth our marriage 
 feast ;’ for some of their principal performers will join 
 us ; and the Lord and Lady Lieutenant, with all their 
 suite, will attend 1 on our solemnities :’ ay, 4 we’ll 
 make the welkin dance;’ we’ll ‘ raise the night owl in 
 a catch, shall draw three souls out of one weaver.’ ” 
 
 “ Out of one waver !” repeated Darby Crawley, 
 who looked up with great deference to the rank of 
 Lord Rosbrin, though quite at a loss to discover 
 whether his strange phraseology was supreme fashion, 
 or absolute nonsense. 
 
 “ But you don’t really mean that ?” said Lord 
 Frederick, in a tone of vexation. “ You don’t abso-

 lutely mean that the castle people are coming to yon 
 in November ?” 
 
 “ ‘ Take this from this,’ ” said Lord Rosbrin, point- 
 ing to his head and shoulders, “ if this be otherwise : 
 ’tis truth, ‘if truth were ever pregnant made by cir- 
 cumstance.’ ” 
 
 “ What ! do you really mean that they come down 
 in their public capacity, with little pages and lank 
 aid-de-camps, busy chamberlains and sinecure comp- 
 trollers, fat battle-axes and battered kettle-drums, with 
 the eternal ‘ God Save the King,’ and ‘ Patrick’s Day,’ 
 and the whole set out of the ca-astle ?” 
 
 “All,” said Lord Rosbrin, in a tone of absence, and 
 going over in his mind the business of the stage for 
 the performance of Henry the Fourth ; “ all — sheriff, 
 vintner, chamberlains, drawers, two carriers, travel- 
 lers, and attendants, with the sign of the Boar’s Head 
 in Eastcheap.” 
 
 “ The Lord bless us !” exclaimed old Crawdey, much 
 astonished at this travelling equipage; while Mr. Pot- 
 tinger, dropping his knife and fork, and rubbing his 
 hands, was about to set both gentlemen right, by de 
 scribing the real arrangements of the viceregal tour, 
 as they occurred to his memoiy, when he was stopped 
 short by Lady Dunore addressing Lord Frederick : 
 
 “ By-the-bye, Lord Frederick, how does Lady B. 
 get on in her new office? Doesn’t it bore her to 
 death that kind of representation ? It must be en- 
 tirely out of her way, poor dear !” 
 
 “ Why, it does, I believe, taut soit peu ; but, upon 
 the whole, she gets on pretty fairly. For ten months 
 in the year she lives at that bel respiro , the Phaynix,

 where she rears little pigs, sows mignionette seed, 
 talks of her liver, and drinks chamomile tea.” 
 
 “ Yes, yes. I know all her fagons a Vordmaire well 
 enough. But I mean as Lady Lieutenant ! Is not 
 that the Irish phrase for your viceroy’s wife ? How 
 does she manage ?” 
 
 “ Oh ! as she can ; like the rest of them, I believe : 
 ask my Potty; he is the law and the prophets on 
 these points ; she cuts when she can, keeps clear of 
 the Kalmucks (except on the regular Ko-tou days, 
 when the yellow skreen is exhibited), and lives toute 
 comme une autre? 
 
 Mr. Pottinger opened his eyes. This was flat 
 profanation of a subject sacred to his imagination; 
 and he would have opened his mouth, but that Lady 
 Dunore went on, while her careless manner of talking 
 of the lady lieutenant and the castle astonished, and 
 almost mortified the Crawley Mandarins as much as 
 Mr. Pottinger. 
 
 “ But then, you know, Lord Frederick,” continued 
 the marchioness, “ poor dear Lady B. is such a dowa- 
 ger dowdy, and so very little en evidence in the 
 world : besides, she dresses so ill. I used to think 
 she spoiled the look of my opera supper ; didn’t you, 
 Georgy, love ?” 
 
 “Her Excellency,” said Mr. Pottinger, solemnly, 
 and endeavoring to get in a word, “ goes through the 
 necessary forms of drawing-rooms and birthdays 
 with peculiar grace and dignity ; and ” 
 
 “ And kisses all the Mrs. Maguffins and Mrs. 
 O’Gallaghers, a toute outrance ,” interrupted Lord 
 Frederick. “ Then she simpers, bobs under a canopy, 
 and she walks in and walks out to ‘ God Save the

 King,’ with a white wand, and an usher at the end of 
 
 it; then struts forth Lord B- , bored to death 
 
 (with 1 son nez en Vair ,’ and his heart under the ribs 
 of his south-downs), followed by Grizzle, Noodle, 
 Doodle, Foodie, and 1 others;’ while we English all 
 walk after, like ‘ chickens, come cluck,’ — to slow 
 music, by Jove ! Only think of my moving to slow 
 music, voyez vous , like a mute in a play ! But the fun 
 of all fun is my Potty’s face upon these high solemni- 
 ties. Ha! ha! ha!” 
 
 Here the image of the court, of which he was so 
 distinguished a member, became too ludicrous for the 
 risible faculties of the noble aid-de-camp, and amidst 
 bursts of hearty laughter, in which he was joined by 
 such members of the company as did not consider the 
 Irish court to be the Tien Sing, the “ heavenly spot,” 
 he continued to repeat, “ moving to slow music, by 
 Jove ! that’s the fun !” 
 
 The lengthening faces of the Crawleys and Mr, 
 Pottinger induced Mr. Daly to call to order; and 
 Lady Dunore, taking the hint, arose, and left the 
 gentlemen to Lord Frederick’s further details of the 
 celestial empire. She conducted the ladies to the 
 drawing-room, and then left them, desiring Miss 
 Crawley to be her lady lieutenant, and call for coffee 
 when they wished it. The two friends ascended the 
 stairs together, on their way to their respective 
 dressing-rooms, where each was in the habit of taking 
 a siesta between dinner and tea. Lady Georgiana 
 observed, in her fondling way : 
 
 “ These people bore you to death, sweet love.” 
 
 “ No, dearest,” yawned Lady Dunore. 
 
 “But,” continued Lady Georgiana, yawning in

 turn, “ they are very good sort of people, I dare say, 
 ma belle .” 
 
 “Yes, I dare say they are, mignonne; hut they 
 need not sit in a circle for all that. You have no 
 idea the effect a circle has on me, Georgy, love, — it 
 kills me.” 
 
 At this moment, her own woman passing, she said : 
 “ Do let some of the footmen go into the drawing- 
 room, and place the chairs back to back ; and take 
 the tables and things from the walls, and throw all 
 into the middle of the room, and send coffee to Lady 
 Georgiana’s dressing-room, and call me when the 
 gentlemen come out.” 
 
 “By, by, dearest,” said Lady Georgiana, kissing 
 first one cheek, and then the other. 
 
 “ Day, day, love,” said the marchioness, pressing 
 her lips to her friend’s fair forehead ; and she added, 
 “ I’ll try and doze away the Crawley stupor, till the 
 men come out.” 
 
 More than an hour elapsed before the marchioness 
 joined her guests : tea was served as she entered. 
 Lord Frederick, Mr. Daly, Lady Georgiana, occu- 
 pied an ottoman on one side of the fireplace ; and the 
 whole race of Crawley formed from that point a semi- 
 circle, which reached to the other. The marchioness 
 started back, and then raised a despondiug look ; but 
 took the seat offered her by Mr. Pottinger. A dead 
 silence ensued, interrupted first by the young coun- 
 sellor, who had been upon some political subject when 
 the lady entered the room, which he again resumed. 
 His brothers, meantime, remained silent and stupified ; 
 the high sheriff not venturing a' single observation, 
 and the major becoming absolutely confounded, after

 having made an unsuccessful effort at wigwams and 
 bivouacs, “the Peninsula,” and “ the Raygent’s levy.” 
 “ There,” said Lord Frederick, raising his glass to 
 Lady Dun ore’s face, “there’s a bored marchioness; 
 this is a coup de grace : let her survive it if she can. 
 Mr. Po — tinger,” he exclaimed aloud, “ will you sing 
 a comical song, or tell a story, my Potty — — ” 
 
 “That antique song,” interrupted Lord Rosbrin, 
 “ we had last night, 1 Music Hath Charms,’ Mr. Pot- 
 tinger ; or give us ‘ Let us the Cannikin Clink,’ or 
 ‘ Troll us a Catch;’ ” and he ran over the keys of the 
 piano-forte as he spoke. At the word music, Mrs. 
 Sergeant, and the four Miss Sergeant Crawleys, were 
 thrown into a state of gentle agitation. Mrs. Craw- 
 ley’s life had been passed in running about with her 
 accomplished daughters, from one musical system- 
 monger to another ; and the many hours a day they 
 practised, the various methods they had adopted, the 
 public exhibitions in which they had assisted, and the 
 effect they had produced at Lady Kilgobbin's parties, 
 were the eternal themes of her conversation. Al- 
 though she had not before opened her lips, (overawed 
 by the fashionable nonchalance of the two great 
 ladies,) yet now, animated by maternal vanity, she 
 ventured to observe that “music was a charming 
 talent,” inquired “ who made the piano-forte that 
 stood in the centre of the room,” and asked if it “was 
 in tune.” The hint was immediately taken by the 
 dowager Miss Crawley, always on the alert to puff 
 off the family acquirements ; and it followed, of course, 
 that the Misses Crawley were asked to perform, at 
 the sly suggestion from their aunt, that “ they were

 charming musicians, taught in Dublin, and finished 
 at Bath !” 
 
 “ Oh then,” said Lady Dunore, starting up, “ for 
 heaven’s sake, let us have music, let us have any- 
 thing;” and scattering about the chairs from whence 
 the Crawleys, on the impulsion given by this main- 
 spring of all motion, had risen, she begged the young 
 ladies would try something. The young ladies, un- 
 prepared, indeed, but never unwilling to exhibit, went 
 to the instrument ; while Lord Rosbrin, turning to 
 Darby Crawley, asked him from the Tempest, “ did 
 you ever hear the tune of our catch played by the 
 picture of nobody ?” 
 
 “ Why, then, I can’t charge my memory that I ever 
 did,” replied old Crawley gravely. 
 
 “ Music,” continued Lord Rosbrin, taking hold of 
 Mr. Crawley’s button, “ was ordained (wasn’t it ?) to 
 refresh the mind of man after his studies.” 
 
 “To be sure it was, my lord,” replied Crawley, 
 flattered at this reference; “and when my son Con- 
 way was going through his college course, he was in- 
 genuous at the flute, being always given to sedentary 
 habits.” 
 
 “ Here then well sit, and let the sound of music 
 come upon our ears,” said Lord Rosbrin; and he 
 handed Mr. Crawley a chair. 
 
 Meanwhile the four Miss Crawleys laid by their 
 gloves and fans, and arranged themselves round the 
 instrument. Two sat down to the piano-forte ; one 
 stood on the right of the keys to get in one hand to 
 play the extreme treble, according to a new system 
 of playing with five hands upon one piano-forte ; and 
 the other two prepared their voices by gentle hems !

 to sing a duet to this multifarious accompaniment. 
 They now began “Away with Melancholy,” which 
 they sang with such sad faces and tuneless voices, 
 that it made every one melancholy to hear them ; until 
 the alto Miss Crawley, who had never before played 
 out of her musical stocks, went rambling with her 
 emancipated hand over the instrument, like a colt re- 
 leased from harness, to the utter confusion of her 
 sisters, vocal and instrumental ; and to the consterna- 
 tion and agony of her mother and aunt, she suddenly 
 burst into tears, and cried out that “ she could not 
 play without her cheiroplast.” 
 
 Lady Dunore, equally delighted with tears and 
 laughter, exclaimed : 
 
 “ Poor little thing ! what is the matter ? what is 
 her cheiroplast ? Can my maid make it ? There is 
 nobody so ingenious as Dorette : what is it like ?” 
 
 Miss Crawley endeavored to explain w r hat a chei- 
 roplast was ; for Mrs. Sergeant was utterly con- 
 founded at seeing the labor of years thus overthrown 
 in a moment, and in such a moment. The young 
 ladies now rose, pulling up their gloves, and seizing 
 their fans in becoming emotion, while Mr. Crawley, 
 to relieve the general confusion of the family, took 
 fat Miss Leslie by the hand, and said : 
 
 “ Come, Miss Leslie, honey, give us a touch on the 
 piano; a song or a country dance in your own 
 sprightly way. She has a sweet little voice, I give 
 you my honor, Lord Rosbrin, and would rather hear 
 her than all the bravado singing and Italian haber- 
 dashery in the world. Kate, my dear, this is the 
 Earl of Rosbrin.” 
 
 “ Kate,” said Lord Rosbrin, taking her hand on

 this presentation, and instantly transformed into 
 Petruchio, “ the prettiest Kate in Christendom, Kate 
 of Kate Hall, my super- dainty Kate, for dainties are 
 all cates; and therefore, Kate, take this from me, 
 Kate of my consolation ;” and he kissed her hand as 
 he placed her at the piano ; while Kate of Kate Hall, 
 blushing more from triumph than shame, drew up 
 her frock upon her naked shoulders, and without 
 further preface began to sing “ My Henry is Gone.” 
 Her song ended, was encored by Lord Rosbrin, ap- 
 plauded by Lady Dunore, bravoed by Lord Frederick, 
 and epilogued by Darby Crawley, who, with a hu- 
 morous wink at the gentlemen, said : 
 
 “ The devil is in them Henry s ! I never knew one 
 of them would stay with a girl yet.” 
 
 To Lady Dunore’s horror the Crawleys were now 
 all returning to their chairs and their circle, when, to 
 her infinite joy, their carriages were announced, and 
 she bowed them out with as much pleasure as she 
 had bowed them in ; observing to Miss Crawley, as 
 she came up to wish her good night : 
 
 “ When you get rid of your friends, remember 
 your promise ; and pray get rid of them soon.” 
 
 She then threw herself on a cushion at Lady Geor- 
 giana’s feet, and laying her head on her lap, uttered 
 a pious “ Thank Heaven !” 
 
 “ Oh! don’t think you are quitte pour la peur” said 
 Lord Frederick. “ The Crawleys are yours an revoir . 
 In the meantime let us call for the brag table.” 
 
 Cards were now brought in ; and in the vicissitudes 
 of a game, in which Mr. Daly and Lord Frederick 
 played desperately high, their variable hostess forgot

 the Crawleye (dull and clever), and their spell-bound % 
 circle, which, for want of some greater source of an- 
 noyance, had become the phantom of her easily ex- 
 citable imagination.

CHAPTER X. 
 
 “ Citizens ! your voices !” — S hakspeare. 
 
 Centuries of cruelties and injustice — of misrule and 
 military violence — had not subdued the spirit of the 
 people of Ireland, a spirit which might be said to be- 
 long almost to their temperament ; and other means 
 were resorted to in order to quench a fire which di- 
 rect oppression could not extinguish. Their parlia 
 ment, filled with men selected by the English govern- 
 ment, and separated m feelings and in interests from 
 the people it affected to represent, set the country up 
 to sale, and concluded their “ bargain” on the ruin and 
 degradation of the land. 
 
 By this act of political suicide, which banished at 
 a blow the entire rank, illumination, and wealth of 
 the kingdom, the political and legislative interests of 
 the people were intrusted to a foreign and a rival 
 senate ; while one hundred Irishmen, the representa- 
 tives for the most part of the English ministry, and 
 of the dominant religious faction, were added to the 
 mass of corruption already festering in their unre- 
 formed British parliament. 
 
 Among what are vulgarly called the rotten boroughs 
 of Ireland, Glannacrime stood conspicuous for its cor- 
 ruption and servility to the dominant power of the 
 day, whatever that; power might be. Mr. Crawley

 assured Lady Dunore that the corporation was at her 
 devotion, and that any effort on her part would be but 
 a work of supererogation. This assurance, so often 
 reiterated, had wholly lulled the interest and solici- 
 tude which the chance of a strongly contested elec- 
 tion could alone have maintained alive in her capri- 
 cious mind ; and in a few days, the event would have 
 become wholly indifferent to her, if not quite obliter- 
 ated from her memory, but for the open and candid 
 declaration of Mr. Daly, that whatever interest he 
 possessed, or could make in Glannacrime, should be 
 exerted against his grandnephew, and in favor of 
 Mr. O’Mahouy. 
 
 This determination, far from annoying Lady Dunore, 
 revived all her faded electioneering ambition; she 
 found the unbiased independent intentions of her 
 uncle as he stood opposed to his own kinsman, and in 
 favor of a stranger whom he had never seen, new, 
 extraordinary, and therefore charming ; and she even 
 proposed that they should both set fortH in the same 
 barouche to canvass on their different sides. To this 
 Mr, Daly objected, as giving a ludicrous air to the 
 business ; but when he mentioned that he should ride 
 over to Glannacrime for the purpose of trying his 
 interest, Lady Dunore then ordered her carriage with 
 the same intention ; and while he took one road on 
 horseback, she, attended by Lady Georgiana and the 
 two Mr. Crawleys, took the other in an open ba- 
 rouche. 
 
 With the successful electioneering talents of the 
 celebrated and lovely Duchess of D. full in her ima- 
 gination, (for she had read an account of the famous 
 Westminster election in an old magazine on the night

 before,) Lady Dunore, all life, spirit, and expectation, 
 performed the first three miles of her journey with a 
 restless and eager impatience to commence her can- 
 vass : and insisted that she should stop at the first 
 freeholder’s residence of whose vote there was any 
 doubt. 
 
 u We are now,” said young Crawley, with a signi- 
 ficant look at his father, 11 within a few paces of the 
 residence of a genuine Irish freeholder, who is as yet 
 undetermined between the contending interests of 
 Fitzadelm and O’Mahony. Shall I pull the check- 
 string, Lady Dunore ?” 
 
 “ Oh, by ail means in the world,” said the marchio- 
 ness eagerly, and arranging the becoming gossamer 
 shade of her Brussels lace veil, while she asked Lady 
 Georgiana, “ am I blue, Georgy, love, perfectly blue, 
 with this northeast blast ?” 
 
 “ On the contrary, sweet love,” replied Georgy, 
 love, drawing down her own veil, never wholly raised 
 in broad daylight, “ you are absolutely petrie de lis ct 
 ! de roses” 
 
 The coachman was now ordered to turn to the left, 
 while young Crawley observed : 
 
 “ It is a narrow rough road ; but I think your lady- 
 ship’s springs are equal to it.” 
 
 “ I’ll venture my springs,” returned Lady Dunore, 
 
 ; gayly : “ never mind the springs, Mr. Conway.” 
 
 The barouche now wound along the rutted road of 
 : a little valley. On either side, peat mixed with rushes 
 seemed the only produce of a soil almost beyond the 
 I reach of cultivation. The few patches of grass which 
 were discernible were of a brown and stunted growth. 
 As the carriage came in front of a small dunghill,

 which usually forms the first vallum to the residence 
 of an Irish peasant, Mr. Crawley pulled the check- 
 string. A hut or cabin rose behind in all the irregu- 
 larity of architecture which the most extravagant 
 lover of the picturesque could desire. The cabin it- 
 self was built of rounded stones, which, like the edifice 
 in the Fairy Queen, were 
 
 “ Cunningly, and without mortar laid.” 
 
 Tile door was removed from the doorcase, and laid 
 crossways, to keep in the children and pigs ; on each 
 side were two holes, both partially stopped up, the 
 one with an old hat, the other wuth straw. Another 
 aperture in the roof, near the gable end, was sur- 
 mounted by a broken pitcher, being a refinement upon 
 the mere hole in the roof, and intended to exhibit an 
 improvement little known in the peasant architecture 
 of Ireland — -a chimney. The roof of this curious, but 
 not singular building, luxuriated in a variety of vege- 
 tation : being composed of potato-stalks and grass 
 sods, it sent forth vigorous shoots, and bloomed amidst 
 the surrounding sterility. 
 
 “ What is this ? Why do we stop here ? Can’t 
 we proceed ?” asked Lady Dunore, impatiently. 
 
 “ Certainly,” said young Crawley, “ but your lady- 
 ship would, of course, like to see and speak to the 
 master of this freehold.” 
 
 “ Freehold!’ repeated Lady Dunore faintly, and 
 holding her eau tie luce to her nose, as the midday 
 sun dre w up the putrescent vapor of a flax pit ; and 
 as every gush of smoke which burst from the hut, 
 and rolled over the open carriage, came fraught with 
 the stench of the cabin’s pestilential atmosphere. 
 Two little half-naked and bloated children, who were

 plucking up some dead brambles for firing, raised 
 tbeir eyes in stupid wonder on the carriage, and then 
 ran into the cabin, with looks of consternation. The 
 next moment they returned with a group, consisting 
 of two smaller children, followed by a man and 
 woman, the father and mother of this ill-thriven brood. 
 The man, like the Southern peasantry of Ireland, 
 many of whom are descended from a Spanish colony, 
 was dark, meagre, and of a countenance marked by 
 strong lineaments. His clothes were a patchwork of 
 every color. His worn-out brogues were stuffed with 
 straw. His beard half an inch in length ; his long 
 black hair, clotted and overshadowing his eyes, indi- 
 cated the neglect of hopeless and irremediable po- 
 verty. The woman, who came forward wiping her 
 mouth (for they had been at their customary meal of 
 potatoes and salt), inquired in a whining voice and 
 broken English, “ what was their honors’ will ?” 
 
 Barefooted and barelegged, her eyes bleared with 
 smoke, her form attenuated by insufficient diet, her 
 complexion bronzed by exposure to the inclemencies 
 of the weather, her dress in shreds, she still had a 
 cheerfulness of manner that seemed ill-assorted to her 
 situation. 
 
 Such, in general, is the family, and such the dwell- 
 ing of the Irish forty-shilling freeholder. Old Craw- 
 ley, who was perfectly aware of his son’s manoeuvre, 
 and who had sat silently enjoying the disappointment, 
 surprise, and disgust of his patroness, now exclaimed 
 in the usual tone of familiarity with which he ad- 
 dressed the lower orders, from whom, in manner and 
 language, he was so little removed : 
 
 “ Morrow, Denis Regan ; how is it with you, man?”

 “ Musha ! long life to your honor, I’m brave and 
 hearty, sir; and hope you’re well, Mr. Crawley, dear.” 
 
 “And how is the woman that owns yon, Denis? 
 How are you, Judy?” 
 
 Judy dropped a courtesy to the ground. “ Well, I 
 thank your honor’s asking, praise to God, amen, and 
 am glad to see you looking so beautiful, Mr. Crawley, 
 sir.” 
 
 “We are come for your vote and interest, Denis, 
 for the approaching election ; and while I think of it, 
 1 have ordered ‘ bog leave’ for you from the bailiff.” 
 
 “ Och, to be sure, and why wouldn’t you have it, 
 sir, to be sure, only Mr. O’Mahony, sir.” y 
 
 “And here’s Lady Dunore come to solicit your 
 vote in favor of her son, Lord Fitzadelm,” interrupted 
 old Crawley. 
 
 “ See that, now ! and shall have it, sir, if it was 
 worth thousands, any friend of your honor’s or the 
 young counsellor’s, sir, long life to yez ; and hopes my 
 lady will spake for us to your honor, sir, about the 
 trifle of rint, and times going hard.” 
 
 A dead silence now ensued, the Crawleys pur- 
 posely making an opening for Lady Dunore to exert 
 that electioneering talent, of which she had so fre- 
 quently boasted during the ride ; but, with her hand- 
 kerchief stuffed in her mouth, and her look divided 
 between curiosity and disgust, she remained sunk in 
 the back of the carriage. 
 
 “Would your ladyship wish to alight?” asked 
 young Crawley. 
 
 “ Alight ! why the road is ankle deep. Pray let us 
 get out of this shocking spot,” said Lady Dunore, with 
 a countenance bespeaking nausea.

 “ I am afraid, however, your ladyship must alight, 
 for this road is terminated by a bog ; and there will 
 be some difficulty, if not danger, in turning the car- 
 riage in this narrow spot.” 
 
 “ Good God ! how could you bring us into such a 
 scrape, Mr. Conway Crawley ?” asked Lady Dunore, 
 angrily. 
 
 “ Madam,” he replied, in affected consternation, “ I 
 hope I did not mistake your ladyship’s order. I 
 thought it was your ladyship’s wish to stop at the 
 
 door of the first freeholder, who ” 
 
 “ Yes, yes, but I could not for a moment suppose 
 that this wretched place, these wretched persons — in 
 short, if I stay a moment here, I shall catch a typhus 
 fever, or be suffocated by the stench. Thompson, 
 why don’t you turn instantly ? Do you hear me ?” 
 
 “ Yes, my lady, I’ll try; but this is a bad bit of 
 ground to turn in.” 
 
 Aware, from experience, that his lady’s orders were 
 indisputable, however difficult they might be in exe- 
 cution, Thompson endeavored to turn ; but the 
 horses, frightened by the sudden flutter and flight of 
 a flock of geese, near the cabin door, became quite 
 unmanageable, resisted rein and whip, and ran off 
 with a velocity neither to be checked nor overtaken. 
 The Regan family set up the usual Irish cry, “ Millia 
 murther wdiile young Crawley, coolly looking after 
 the flying vehicle, indulged in a smile, which there 
 was no one to witness. Meantime, the coachman, 
 with the utmost skill and effort, could not restrain 
 the horses’ speed, and every moment threatened de- 
 struction to the springs and wheels of the carriage, 
 and fracture or dislocation to the limbs of its occu-

 pants ; when a peasant, who was clamping turf in the 
 bog, sprang forward, seized the reins of the leaders, 
 and, with no less skill than strength, not only suc- 
 ceeded in stopping the horses, but assisted the coach- 
 man in turning the carriage. 
 
 Lady Dunore and Lady Georgiana, recovered from 
 their fright, were loud in exclamations of gratitude 
 and admiration to their deliverer, who had refused 
 their proffered liberality, and who, in answer to their 
 inquiries as to his name, replied coldly, “ Plaze your 
 honor, my lady, it’s but a bad name. I’m Padreen 
 Gar, madam, the boy that welcomed your ladyship 
 home when we came down from the mountains to * 
 meet yez.” 
 
 “ It’s by no means a bad name,” said Lady Dunore, 
 “and I shall take care not to forget it, Mr. Gore.” 
 
 The Crawleys smiled significantly ; and Lady Du- 
 nore, offended by looks which had not escaped her, 
 ordered her coachman to drive back to Dunore, con- 
 versed in Italian with Lady Georgiana the whole way, 
 preserving a dignified silence towards the Messieurs 
 Crawley. Thus placed under the ban of her tempo- 
 rary displeasure, they received all its symptoms with 
 the enduring complacency of persons whose patient 
 servility can abide the stormy brow of greatness, in 
 the certain expectation of the harvest of its returning 
 sunshine. 
 
 A few days had succeeded to that on which the un- 
 ruly horses had formed a sort of adventure, in an ex- 
 istence already deemed monotonous by the lady of 
 the castle. Lady Dunore, who generally took up an 
 opinion out of opposition, and supported it out of 
 obstinacy, praising in spite, and approving in malice,

 had dwelt, with a duration unusual to her instability 
 
 J 9 
 
 on the gallantry of Padreen Gar, whom she persisted 
 in calling Mr. Gore. 
 
 Erected into a hero, the object of many of Mr. 
 Crawley’s plots and fears now disputed even the in- 
 fluence of Miss Crawley herself, who, since the de- 
 parture of her friends, had become a resident in 
 Dunore Castle ; and she still held her precarious 
 tenure by the tie of adulation, which her sex rendered 
 unsuspicious, and her sectarian zeal sanctified. Lady 
 Dunore now expressed her intention of becoming a 
 frequent visitant to a country which produced such a 
 fine race of peasantry as Padreen Gar, alias Mr. Gore ; 
 and time and circumstance had not yet worn out her 
 prepossession (which, however, produced no benefit 
 to its object), when a letter reached her hands that 
 broke up the spell of her partiality, while it furnished 
 new motive for action, and for agitation to her fever- 
 ish existence. 
 
 This letter was one of those productions, so fre- 
 quently circulated in Ireland among the timid and 
 credulous, to excite suspicion, awaken distrust, and 
 j to give occasion for efforts of coercion and resistance 
 j which usually produce the very events they are 
 i adopted to suppress. It was something between a 
 threat and a warning. It talked of the black flag of 
 rebellion being speedily unfurled, of meditated assas- 
 sinations and intended massacres, of a hatred to Eng- 
 lish residents and Protestant ascendency advocates ; 
 and of a probable and immediate attack upon the 
 castle of Dunore by Padreen Gar’s boys, who were 
 to assemble for a moonlight parade on St. Gobnate’s 
 eve, near the holy well of Ballydab, to plan this siege

 for the following night. To this was added, that 
 Padreen Gar, accompanied by his boys, who were 
 concealed in the pits of the bog, had intended to sur- 
 prise her carriage on the day of her proposed visit to 
 Glannacrime, but were prevented by the presence of 
 the two Crawleys, and that an artful rescue was sub- 
 stituted for the meditated attack. 
 
 To this letter Lady Dunore gave implicit cre- 
 dence, merely because she wished it to be true. The 
 threatened danger relieved the torpor of her feelings, 
 gave play to her wild imagination, and afforded 
 ample occupation to her laborious idleness. Mr. 
 Crawley and his son were on business with her when 
 this letter arrived by the post, bearing the office mark 
 of a neighboring town : its contents were, of course, 
 instantly communicated to them ; but instead of 
 urging her immediate departure, as they expected, it 
 furnished her with additional reasons for remaining. 
 To her expressions of horror at the state of the coun- 
 try, and the ingratitude of a people for whom she had 
 roasted an ox, young Crawley replied, that of all this 
 he could have informed her before, even when her 
 predilections for Padreen Gar ran highest ; but that 
 he feared to frighten her away from the country, 
 when it was his and his father’s wish, rather perhaps 
 than her ladyship’s interest, that she should remain 
 forever. 
 
 Measures for meeting the evil were now discussed. 
 Secrecy and concealment from all the guests at the 
 castle were strongly recommended; and Lady Du- 
 nore u qui aimoit terriblement les enigmes ,” readily 
 yielded her assent to this necessity. The object of 
 the Messieurs Crawley was, as they declared, that 
 


## p. 299 (#305) ############################################

FLORENCE MACAIiTHY. 
 
 299 
 
 Lady Dunore should judge for herself of the state of 
 the country, and of the people : for this purpose, the 
 band of ruffians, with the principal incendiary, should 
 be surprised and seized on the eve of St. Gobnate, 
 and brought to the castle, on their way to Dunore 
 gaol. 
 
 To all this Lady Dunore acceded, delighted to be 
 surrounded by rebels and ruffians. To hold a sort 
 of presidential court, or special commission in her 
 own castle, was an event consonant with her feelings ; 
 and while the Crawleys believed they were awakening 
 her timidity and distrust, they were, in fact, flattering 
 the dormant qualities of her being. Their low cun- 
 ning aimed only at the feebleness of the human char- 
 acter, but were ignorant of the varieties of which that 
 character is susceptible : and accustomed to work 
 with no other tools than menace and intimidation, 
 they used them with a universal and indiscriminate 
 application, mistaking the credulity of Lady Dunore 
 for a timidity foreign to her temperament and dis- 
 position. 
 
 The eve of St. Gobnate was still distant by some 
 days ) and in the anxious interval the Crawleys re- 
 gained their former influence over the lady of the 
 castle, and were frequently closeted with her for 
 hours, to the exclusion, not only of the numerous 
 visitors who called to pay their respects, but even of 
 her domesticated guests, who were left to amuse 
 themselves as they might. While the Crawleys thus 1 
 engrossed her society, they directed the channel of 
 her thoughts, and worked powerfully on her imagina- 
 tion. Ex parte statements of the events of the un- 
 happy rebellion of 1798 were added to the raked-up

 horrors of the more dreadful 1641. Mr. Conway 
 Crawley read his way to her favors through murders 
 and massacres, while his aunt cut hers through paper 
 screens and watch-papers ; thus combining the frivo- 
 lous and the sanguinary, to occupy her mind, and to 
 work upon her feelings. 
 
 Meantime, the rumor of an insurrection had been 
 spread through the town of Dunore, and had reached 
 the steward’s room and servants’ hall of the castle ; 
 thence it ascended to the drawing-room, where some 
 laughed and some trembled at it. Although Lady 
 Dunore and the Crawleys preserved a profound silence 
 on the subject, it was understood that a party of the 
 New-Town Mount Crawley supplementary auxiliary 
 legion occupied the flank towers of the castle every 
 night after sunset ; that expresses had been forwarded 
 to Dublin, and that many of the Lnglish servants had 
 applied for leave to return to tneir native country. 
 What, however, had spread the greatest consterna- 
 tion in the neighborhood, was the fact that Terence 
 Oge O’Leary’s house had been entered by constables, 
 his papers seized, and officers of justice stationed to 
 arrest any persons found lurking about the cemetery 
 of the Monaster-ny-oriel. O'Leary himself escaped 
 by being absent on some of his usual antiquarian re- 
 searches. 
 
 On that day, observed in the country as the Feast 
 of St. Gobnate, Lady Dunore descended earlier than 
 usual into the breakfast-room, her cheek flushed, and 
 her eye wandering ; she was also dressed in biack, as 
 was usual with her when under the influence of grief 
 or anxiety. She spoke little, and refused to break- 
 fast, alleging that she had been drinking gunpowder

 tea since daylight. She was restless and unquiet, ap- 
 peared and disappeared like a phantom, dispatched 
 note after note to Mr. Crawley, and seemed so agi- 
 tated by ill-suppressed emotions, that Lord Frederick, 
 who was sipping his cafeau lait , and reading a French 
 novel, at last inquired of her, in his usual tone of af- 
 fectation, “ Metis qyCest ce quHl y a done , belle Chate- 
 laine ? What is the matter, my marchioness ? Are 
 the reports we have heard of incipient rebellion in 
 the Celestial Empire really true, or are they only got 
 up by the chop-mandarins for their own special pur- 
 poses ? I dare say that professeur de bavardise , Duke 
 Conway Townsend Crawley, of the peacock’s feather, 
 is at the bottom of all this ; or that my own Ching- 
 foo, of the yellow button, is amusing himself with a 
 plot, like the honest gentleman that got his own ef- 
 figy shot at, to alarm the sleeping sensibility of the 
 lenient government people at the castle.* Now pray 
 speak : are we to be roasted, a Vlrlandaise , before a 
 slow fire, like so many chestnuts, or spitted, as the 
 children in the old rebellion, like so many snipes ?” 
 
 Here Lord Frederick was interrupted by the loud 
 stamping of feet outside the door, which was sud- 
 denly burst open; and Lord Rosbrin, in his black 
 velvet Hamlet suit, which he had been trying on be- 
 fore he dressed, with wild looks, and wilder voice, 
 rushed in, crying out — 
 
 w Oh ! horror, horror, horror, tongue nor heart 
 Cannot conceive nor name thee !” 
 
 Lady Dunore shrieked, Lord Frederick laughed to 
 hysterics, and Messrs. Heneage and Pottinger stood 
 
 * Fact : the ingenious party was a magistrate, and, moreover, 
 a clergyman.

 aghast. Mr. Daly, who had been hitherto quietly 
 reading the English papers, now started up astonished, 
 exclaiming with vivacity : 
 
 “ Why, are you all mad ! what is the matter, Ros- 
 brin ? see, you have frightened the ladies to death. 
 What is the matter ?” 
 
 “ What is the matter ?” reiterated Lord Rosbrin, 
 seizing the well-remembered lines of Macduff, “ why 
 confusion is the matter.!’ 
 
 “ Confusion has made his masterpiece, 
 
 Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope 
 The temple, and stolen thence — ” 
 
 “ Murder !” said Mr. Daly, shuddering. 
 
 u Stolen ! stolen what ?” interrupted Lord Frede- 
 rick, becoming suddenly serious. 
 
 Lady Dunore, now believing that there was reason 
 for fears, continued to scream louder than before; 
 and Lord Rosbrin, pointing to a letter he held in his 
 hand, observed, with a little paraphrase in his citation : 
 “ Approach this letter, and destroy your sight 
 With a new gorgon.” 
 
 “ Who is it from ?” said Mr. Daly, snatching the 
 letter, and searching for his spectacles. 
 
 “ Who from?” continued Lord Rosbrin, pacing up 
 and down the room with frantic, but with theatrical 
 gestures. “ ’Tis from the deputy prompter of Covent 
 Garden Theatre ; 
 
 ‘ Oh ! insupportable, oh ! heavy hour ! 
 
 It should be now a huge eclipse o’ the sun ; 
 
 for oh, my friends, Mrs. Siddon’s point lace, alas ! she 
 has no lace ! but her point lace that was , and that I 
 should have worn, is stolen away from her dressing- 
 room at the theatre ! all, all gone \

 1 Nor left a wreck behind.’ ” 
 
 “ So,” said Mr. Daly, much provoked, and resuming 
 his newspaper, “ so, as Moliere says of his capricious 
 lady, ‘ on fait la sottise , et nous sommes les sotsl ” 
 
 Meantime, Lord Frederick rolled in convulsions of 
 laughter ; Mr. Pottinger and the ladies dried their 
 humid eyes ; and Mr. Heneage, smelling a flower-box 
 in the window, observed, “ the mignonette harvest 
 had been vastly abundant this year,” 
 
 A servant at this moment entered, and presented a 
 letter to Lady Dunore, which she took with trepida- 
 tion ; but as she read it, her clouded countenance 
 brightened into smiles, and ere she finished it, she 
 said : 
 
 “ No, never vras there so fortunate an event. The 
 circuit judges dine here to-day, and will be present at 
 the trial. Well, after all, I must say there is nothing 
 like Ireland, where one is kept in a constant state of 
 emotion and occupation ” 
 
 “ Trial ! what trial ?” demanded Ml\ Daly in aston- 
 ishment. 
 
 “ Why the fact is, my dear uncle,” said Lady Dunore, 
 no longer deeming it necessary to keep a secret which 
 was beginning to be a charge , “ the castle of Dunore 
 was to have been attacked this very night, on the 
 Feast of St. Gobnate, but for the timely prudence of 
 the two Mr. Crawleys, who have discovered the plot, 
 and have hitherto concealed their knowledge of it 
 from political motives. They have succeeded this 
 morning in surprising and seizing that ferocious and 
 lawless banditti, called Padreen Gar's boys ; and I 
 am this moment expecting their arrival at the castle, 
 escorted by a party of the military, on their way to

 the gaol, "We meant to have kept all this quiet, for 
 fear of frightening Georgy, love, and alarming you all, 
 but now that the judges and things are coming to the 
 castle to dine,” she continued in a fever of delightful 
 agitation, walking up and down the room, and fan- 
 ning herself with a hand-screen, “ now we shall have 
 a regular, imposing, and, I dare say, amazingly amus- 
 ing trial.” 
 
 “ Oh ! a regular special commission,” said Mr. Daly, 
 with ironical seriousness. “ An inquest held on a 
 parcel of shanavests and caravats must he rare sport 
 for ladies. But who are the charming judges who 
 come so appropriately to preside at your ladyship’s 
 court, and to assist in getting up a scene for our pri- 
 vate amusement, at the expense of the public charac- 
 ter of the county ?” 
 
 “ Oh ! I know nothing in the world about them,” 
 said Lady Dunore, “ only they are judges of some 
 kind or other, who are on circuit, and who have in- 
 vited themselves here. Mr. Crawley will be enchant- 
 ed at this ; it will save him trouble. Here is their 
 letter : pray read it aloud,” and she tossed it to Mr. 
 Daly, who read it as follows : 
 
 “Baron Boulter presents his respectful compli- 
 ments to the Marchioness of Dunore ; he proposes, 
 with his brother judge, Mr. Justice Aubrey, having 
 the honor of paying his respects at Dunore Castle 
 this day, between his breakfast and sleeping stage, 
 on his way from circuit to Dublin, when Baron B. 
 will be happy to become the bearer of any commands 
 her ladyship may have for the metropolis.” 
 
 “The wretched accommodations,” observed Mr. 
 Daly, “ at Bally-na-scroggen, have, I suppose, induced

 Baron Boulter, who is a man of the world, and a true 
 disciple of the savoir vivre , to claim your ladyship’s 
 hospitality. But I know not what argument has pre- 
 vailed on his excellent but not always very accommo- 
 dating brother judge, for once to agree in his de- 
 cision.” 
 
 “ Oh, it is no matter what brings them here, pro- 
 vided they come. There never was such luck,” con- 
 tinued Lady Dunore, fluttering about the room ; “ we 
 shall have quite a regular special commission, as you 
 gay, my dear uncle ; I hope, though, they will not hang 
 many of these wretches. You have no idea how I 
 hate to have people hanged and she added, wiping 
 away her now fast coming tears, “ If I heard sen- 
 tence pronounced on a great many at once, and the 
 clanking of chains, and the condemning cap and 
 things -” 
 
 “ By-the-bye,” interrupted Lord Frederick, “ apro- 
 pos to hanging; isn’t Baron Boulter the facetious 
 4 hanging judge,’ who makes us all die laughing at 
 the castle dinners with his bon mots 
 
 “He is thought to be a leetle severe,” said Mr. 
 Pottinger ; “ but he is zealous for government, and is, 
 perhaps, the best punster on the bench ; that is I be- 
 lieve admitted on ail sides.” 
 
 “ An high judicial qualification, my Potty,” returned 
 Lord Frederick, gravely. 
 
 “ But should we not have something of a court for 
 them ?” asked Lady Dunore. “ Good heavens ! how 
 unlucky Miss Crawley should not have returned from 
 her eternal evangelical school at Yew-Town Mount 
 Crawley ; she would have cut me out a court ; got 
 me up a court, I mean, or something in that way, in a

 minute, something that would produce a striking 
 effect, something scenic, you know.” 
 
 “ Scenic ! a striking effect ! a good stage effect !” 
 exclaimed Lord Rosbrin. “ Leave that to me, my 
 gentle coz, my pretty coz. I have all the requisite 
 properties with me, maces and halberds, senators’ 
 wigs, ermine and all” 
 
 “ We must have the packing-cases removed out of 
 the hall,” continued Lady Dunore ; “ and tables, and 
 pens and ink, and things, you know ; for if we are to 
 give the thing an air of a regular trial, we may as 
 well do it handsomely.” 
 
 “ Trial !” repeated Lord Rosbrin, “ I have the Con- 
 vent Garden prompt-book, with the Merchant of 
 Venice trial, in my pocket; here it is.” 
 
 Lord Rosbrin now pulled out a ragged book, with 
 all the business of the stage laid down; and Lady 
 Dunore continued : 
 
 “ Do then, dear Rosbrin, get things in order, you 
 understand these matters so well ; I’ll ring the bell 
 for the servants to attend you.” 
 
 Lord Rosbrin caught her arm. 
 
 “ Leave everything to me, my fair coz. Scene — a 
 hall.” 
 
 “ I think I could assist you,” said Mr. Pottinger, 
 
 “ We shall want,” interrupted Lord Rosbrin, stop 
 ping his mouth, “ trumpets, marshal’s staff, two aider- 
 men, Archbishop of Canterbury, Duchess of Norfolk, 
 godmother — no, hang it, that’s the christening in 
 Henry the Eighth. Here is the trial scene — trumpets 
 and cornets ; two vergers, with short wands ; scribes 
 in habits of doctors. Well, only leave it to me.

 Come Pottinger, you shall act as scribe or verger, or 
 property boy. What’s in a name ?” 
 
 The peer and Mr. Pottinger left the room together, 
 followed by Lady Punore, who was all emotion and 
 gratification; while Mr. Paly and Lord Frederick 
 laughed without restraint, and Lady Georgiana said, 
 “ that poor thing will wear herself out with her 
 strong feelings. There never was such a quick irrita- 
 ble sensibility as hers.” 
 
 “ Oh, she is delicious f” said Lord Frederick, “ tak- 
 en in small and distant doses. But it were as well to 
 live in a tornado as occupy the same house with her 
 volcanoship for two months together.” 
 
 “ I have never seen her thus extravagant before,” 
 said Mr. Paly, in a tone of mortification. “ I confess 
 I lose all patience when I see her the dupe of these 
 Crawley plots, or rather of her own caprice and 
 whim, and of that insatiable thirst for scenes and sen- 
 sations that has made the torment and the enjoyment 
 of her life. I would not wonder if she has worried 
 poor Punore out of his reason, and been the cause 
 of all the eccentricity of that other forward but clever 
 boy, whom she has induced to forego his independent 
 principles, and set up for this corrupt saleable Craw- 
 ley borough. And yet I love her for her mother’s 
 sake ; for she was an angel — at least before ill usage 
 had ” 
 
 He paused abruptly, sighed, and resumed his news- 
 paper ; while Lord Frederick whispered Lady Geor- 
 giana — “ a fallen one.” 
 
 Within the ensuing hour the Judges Boulter and 
 Aubrey arrived at the castle, were announced, and

 received in the saloon, as old acquaintances, by Mr. 
 
 Daly. 
 
 The Right Honorable Baron Boulter was a col- 
 lateral descendant of the celebrated English eccle- 
 siastic of that name, who, under the title of “Primate 
 of Ireland,” governed the land with a crosier of iron. 
 Bishop Boulter, in his celebrated letters, has divided 
 the population of Ireland into his own party, and the 
 \natives ; and has added to this curious classification 
 a maxim, that “ Ireland is only to be governed by be- 
 ing divided urging, at the same time, the necessity 
 for employing spies and informers as proper agents of 
 government, and as worthy of being remunerated and 
 recompensed even unto the third and fourth genera- 
 tion. The inheritance of this family creed was the 
 sole succession of the Baron — himself the younger 
 son of a younger brother ; for little was added to it 
 but a rattle and bells, bequeathed him in his infancy 
 by his grandaunt, Mrs. Barbara Boulter, which he 
 ever afterwards preserved ; and which, even on the 
 bench, he was wont to play with gaiety enough, when 
 forensic dulness made claims on his patience, or the 
 pauses of business left leisure for innocent amusement. 
 
 Baron Boulter had nothing of the saturnine and 
 irascible spirit of his great political predecessor, the 
 primate. He was of a cheerful sanguine tempera- 
 ment ; possessed an evenness of temper that usually 
 supplies the absence of sensibility; and, anywhere 
 but in Ireland, might have been as respectable in his 
 public character as he was pleasant and courteous in 
 his social deportment. 
 
 The rebellion was the great scene of action for such 
 qualities ; and to that period, like many others of his

 professional contemporaries, he stood indebted for his 
 pre-eminence. The means of his rising became the 
 habit of his character: and he continued to joke and 
 to condemn with a gaiety and contempt for human 
 life, which belonged to his temperament, and which 
 served to uphold the reputation of his loyalty 
 
 No one trifled away liberty with more grace, or 
 pronounced sentence with more humor than Baron 
 Boulter ; and the culprit whom he jested to the gal- 
 lows (had his love of wit borne any proportion to his 
 fear of death) must almost have been reconciled to 
 his fate by the pleasantry that sealed his destiny. 
 
 His professional interests and political principles 
 aside, (which in Ireland are always closely connected,) 
 Baron Boulter was fair-judging and clear-sighted. 
 He came at results with the prompt but unlogical 
 process of a woman’s perceptions ; but living always 
 on one spot, within a narrow circle, his knowledge of 
 human nature went no ^further than the sphere of his 
 action ; and his philosophy was as local as his jokes. 
 He could flatter an Irish chancellor, adulate an Irish 
 viceroy, amuse the priggish dulness of an Irish secre- 
 tary, joke with, or sift to the very bottom of evasion 
 and circumlocution, an Irish peasant, while he gayly 
 laughed with, and secretly laughed at all. Still, his 
 human nature was always Irish nature ; and though, 
 as far as experience went, his premises were just, yet 
 they were confined, narrow, and home-directed ; for 
 the rest, social in habits, of amiable address, and 
 pleasant humor; he was sought for by the great, 
 whom he amused, and feared by the poor, whom he 
 i — hung. 
 
 Judge Aubrey was in character a mixture of those

 temperaments which produce a quick and irritable 
 sensibility, a prompt, uncalculating sympathy, and 
 a warm, deep-seated, violent indignation; qualities 
 which form so broad a basis for human excellence, 
 while they unfit it for a patient endurance of base- 
 ness, meanness, and cupidity. These were power- 
 fully worked on, and hourly called into action, by the 
 political situation of a country which he loved with 
 all the fervor of an ancient Roman, and by the sys- 
 tematic degradation of a profession he venerated as 
 the guardian of human rights. His bile and his ex- 
 perience increased together ; the hopes of the patriot, 
 and the health of the man, suffered in equal propor- 
 tion ; and the social simplicity and playful gaiety which 
 formed the charm of his domestic hearth, and from 
 which the world was shut out, deserted him in that 
 public tribunal, where the liberty he worshipped was 
 sacrificed, and the profession he revered was debased. 
 
 Ireland, his native contry, was his object : he had 
 upheld her cause in the senate, until her independence 
 had breathed its last gasp ; and he retired from the 
 scene of her run with a minority that might, in every 
 sense of the word, be deemed “ glorious.” Ireland 
 was still his object ; and the lowliest of her children 
 found redemption from his mercy, solace in his com- 
 miseration, and relief from his liberality. From the 
 bench he expounded the causes of their crimes, while 
 he lamented their effects ; he taught while he judged 
 — he wept when he condemned. 
 
 From the period of the Union, Judge Aubrey had 
 retired from what is called the world, from the 
 bustling walks of life, and from the giddy round of 
 fashionable circles. Living for and with a few, he

 had for many years made no progress in the succes- 
 sive modes and jargons of succeeding fashions ; and 
 it was in part to this circumstance that he owed 
 much of that peculiar freshness of character, and 
 Something of that austerity of manner, which the 
 friction of society is so apt to efface. This well-pre- 
 served individuality was set off by a peculiar man- 
 ner, idiom, and phrase, which, as well as his broad ac- 
 cent, were genuinely Irish. To profound classical 
 reading, and considerable scientific acquirement, he 
 added an unpretending simplicity, which is insepara- 
 bly connected with the highest order of talent, though 
 so often falsely attributed to mediocrity and igno- 
 rance. 
 
 Such were the two high judicial characters, who, 
 now linked in a professional yoke, drew as different 
 ways as untrained colts in the same harness. Since 
 the commencement of their circuit, they had never 
 agreed upon any one point, except the expediency of 
 trying the French chef de cuisine of the Marchioness 
 of Dunore, instead of relying on the gastronomic 
 talents of Judy Mulligan, of the Cat and Bagpipes, in 
 the neighboring town of Bally-na-scroggen.

CHAPTER XI. 
 
 “ The council shall hear it — it is a riot.” 
 
 “ Sir Hugh, persuade me not — I will make 
 
 A Star-chamber matter of it.” 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 On the arrival of Baron Boulter and Judge Aubrey, 
 Lady Dunore was summoned to the breakfast parlor. 
 Already she had seen a crowd of persons wandering 
 among the hills, and the glitter of arms hashing in 
 the sunshine. Her ardent imagination magnified the 
 New-Town cavalry corps, and half a dozen peasants, 
 into a prodigious military force, and a formidable 
 band of rebels ; and she rushed into the apartment 
 where the two judges were quietly taking a soup 
 after their long morning’s ride. With eyes flashing, 
 and cheeks suffused, she welcomed them to the cas- 
 tle. She expressed her gratitude to Baron Boulter, 
 in exaggerated terms, for a visit so kindly volun- 
 teered ; and uttered a fervent hope that their pres- 
 ence would give importance to an event in which 
 many lives were concerned. She then abruptly ended 
 with the question of — 
 
 “ But which of you, my lords, is the hanging 
 
 judge ?” 
 
 This question, which startled the judges, confused i 
 Mr. Daly, and threw Lord Frederick into agonies 
 (lest in her delirious ravings she should cite him as

 authority for this judicial sobriquet ), produced a short 
 silence, until Mr. Daly came to the relief of the party, 
 by observing : 
 
 “ My dear lords, I must account for this agitation 
 of my niece, Lady Dunore, by informing you that 
 her mind and feelings have been worked on by some 
 representations of the state of this province not per- 
 fectly correct. Her agent and confidential person, 
 Mr. Crawley, is a timid man, and it is but fair to say 
 that I believe he is frequently the dupe of his own 
 fears. But he also belongs to a certain party, who, 
 under the guise of inordinate and exclusive loyalty, 
 act in defiance of the law of the land, are lawless by 
 the concurrence, or at least the countenance, of those 
 in authority, and may be said, in the language of a 
 celebrated orator, to be 4 opposed to rule by act of 
 Parliament.’ Among such persons it is a favorite 
 system of tactics to create false alarms, and then to 
 ingraft strong measures upon the fears they have 
 awakened. I have some reason to think my niece is 
 at this moment the victim of this wretched and 
 hackneyed policy, and that the attack on her castle, 
 and the smothered insurrection with which she has 
 been anonymously threatened, are the phantoms, I 
 will not say the creations, of Mr. Crawley’s brain.” 
 
 Lady Dunore, mortified and disappointed by a 
 speech that threw her out of a sphere of action to 
 which all her fancies and feelings were made up, was 
 beginning an expostulation with her uncle, w T hen 
 Baron Boulter interrupted her by observing that 
 “ the Irish were a very fine people, and a very hand- 
 some people ; but that it was most certain a little 
 occasional hanging, just now and then, did them no

 harm; and though they might not, in the present 
 instance, be so deeply implicated in rebellious prac- 
 tices as the loyal and vigilant prudence of his worthy 
 friend Darby Crawley suggested, yet a little timely 
 caution and wholesome severity rarely came amiss ; 
 that he would willingly lend his aid in examining 
 into the circumstances of the case, and endeavor to 
 dissipate her ladyship’s fears by exploring their 
 cause.” 
 
 “ The people of Ireland,” said Judge Aubrey, in a 
 tone between sullenness and indignation, “like the 
 people of other nations, are pretty much what their 
 government has made them. They are factious be- 
 cause they are wretched ; and it is the fashion of the 
 day to give to their local disturbances, to their re- 
 sistance to the collection of the tythes they are un- 
 able to pay, to their murmurs against the taxes, 
 which have reduced the country to ruin, and even to 
 their personal and oft-barbarous conflicts among 
 each other, the names of insurrection and rebellion. 
 Mr. Crawley, madam, is an old alarmist ; and your 
 ladyship is, I perceive, new to the modes by which 
 affairs in this country are carried on.” 
 
 “ But when an armed force is at our gates,” said 
 Lady Dunore, in a tone of irritation and impatience ; 
 “ when letters reach my hands, Judge Aubrey, which 
 inform us that 
 
 “ The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met, 
 
 The judges arrayed, a terrible sight,” 
 
 interrupted Lord Rosbrin, as he burst into the room 
 with a billiard cue in his hand for a wand. 
 
 “ Everything is ready,” he observed: “the court

 waits, the prisoners are arrived, and the counsel will 
 be here in a few moments.” 
 
 “We have endeavored to make things comfort- 
 able for you, Baron,” said Lady Dunore, putting her 
 arm through Baron Boulter’s, and hurrying him 
 towards the hall, where she was followed by Judge 
 Aubrey, Mr. Daly, Lord Frederick, Mr. Heneage, 
 Mr. Pottinger and Lady Georgiana. 
 
 “ There,” said Lord Rosbrin, presenting two arm- 
 chairs to the judges, placed at the head of the hall, 
 before a table covered with heavy volumes, “ there, 
 my lords, that is the awful seat of judgment. Here, 
 Lady Georgiana, this is your place, and yours Ever- 
 sham and Heneage : you are the special jury. You 
 see we have a fine gallery, a charming audience,” and 
 he pointed to the corridor, which ran round the 
 hall, and was filled with valets-de-chambre, ladies’ 
 maids, with the inferior branches of the Dunore 
 household; “and,” he added, fixing some chairs and 
 a table to the left, “ this is the place for the counsel 
 for the crown, the learned Crawl eys, ‘ very Daniels 
 the prisoners, you see, my lords, occupy the lower 
 part of the hall, the back-ground being filled up 
 with guards, officers, mutes, and others ; and the 
 solitary female prisoner, the Queen Catherine of the 
 trial, though in a rug cloak, is placed, in delicacy to 
 her sex, in the shade of this recess and painted win- 
 dow.” 
 
 Everything was, indeed, in the order which Lord 
 Rosbrin had described. 
 
 The prisoners occupied the foot of the hall. The 
 New-Town Mount Crawley corps filled the portico.

 drawn over her face, was seated in the recess of the 
 Gothic window ; and the rest of the party were dis- 
 posed of according to Lord Rosbrin’s idea of the 
 stage business of the trial in the Merchant of Venice. 
 
 On the countenance of Baron Boulter was painted 
 an expression of great humor, as of one ready to be 
 amused, as to amuse. Jiadge Aubrey was, on the 
 contrary, sullenly looking over a volume of Hogarth, 
 which lay before him on the table ; evidently out of 
 patience and out of temper with the absurdity of the 
 passing scene. Lady Dunore was fluttering about 
 from place to place, and from person to person, in 
 hysterical emotions, tears in her eyes, and smiles 
 upon her lips; and Lord Rosbrin was beginning a 
 speech from the trial of Queen Catherine, and had, in 
 the legal phrase, got on his legs, when Mr. Crawley, 
 his son, and sister, followed by his clerk, Jemmy 
 Bryan, carrying a green bag, appeared pushing 
 through the crowd, which filled the bottom of the 
 spacious hall. 
 
 “ Oh ! I am glad you are come,” said Lady Du- 
 nore, speaking to them from her “jury box.” “Are 
 you not enchanted at the turn things have taken! 
 Only conceive, what luck ! Baron Boulter and Judge 
 Aubrey so kindly consenting to be present at our 
 little special commission. Rosbrin, pray show the 
 Mr. Crawieys their place. Miss Crawley, I’ll make 
 room for you here : we must put you on the jury.” 
 
 The Crawieys for a moment remained motionless. 
 To their utter amazement, the whimsicality and ex- 
 travagance of Lady Dunore had overturned all their 
 long and ingeniously-concerted plans. Instead of 
 their snug star-chamber trial, they now stood con-

 fronted before the judges of the land in the presence 
 of a Large assembly ; while the examinations of the 
 prisoners, which they meant to turn to the account 
 of terror, would now be taken out of their hands, and 
 be made a jest of by the baron, or be conducted in 
 such a way by Judge Aubrey as would betray the 
 inadequacy of the charges upon which their wild- 
 looking prisoners were to be committed. 
 
 Meantime, the clerk spread the table with deposi- 
 tions against the prisoners. Old Crawley seated 
 himself before it, and Lord Rosbrin, flourishing about, 
 with theatrical solemnity, exclaimed : 
 
 “ Now then proceed to justice, which shall have 
 Due course. Produce the prisoners. Silence ! 
 
 Read the indictments.” 
 
 The clerk put on his spectacles, and cleared his 
 voice; while Baron Boulter, endowed with a pliancy 
 of mind which permits the pursuit of many objects at 
 the same moment, and in the habit of dispatching an 
 epigram, and a warrant, of giving judgment and an 
 invitation to dinner in the same breath, now called 
 for pen, ink, and paper, that he might answer a few 
 letters, and listen to the examinations “ without loss 
 of time or hindrance of business.” 
 
 Judge Aubrey, throwing aside his book, observed : 
 “ Since I take my seat here to the quality of a magis- 
 trate, at the desire of the Marchioness of Dunore, I 
 beg that if there are any depositions to be made 
 against these men, who appear to be under a double 
 guard, civil and military, they may be gone through 
 forthwith.” 
 
 “ My lord,” said Conway Crawley, getting on his 
 legs, with the air of a counsel opening some important

 cause, “ my lord, before we proceed to read these de- 
 positions against these unfortunate men, I shall beg 
 leave to state the case as it appears to me, and to 
 give a slight sketch of the actual situation of the 
 barony.” 
 
 “ Sir,” interrupted the judge, “ I won’t hear you. 
 You can tell me nothing of this country that I do not 
 already know. I have neither time nor health to 
 listen to idle declamation, and ten times 1 told tales.’ ” 
 “ My lord, I must observe,” continued young Craw- 
 ley, petulantly, “ that among the virtues of a judge, 
 patience is the most necessary ; and Lord Mansfield, 
 my lord, obtained more credit for that virtue, than 
 for ail his other judicial merits combined.” 
 
 “ Then, sir, my Lord Mansfield never was obliged 
 to listen to you,” said the judge, coldly. 
 
 A universal smile followed this observation, which 
 was made with a sort of sullen naivete that gave it 
 great effect; while old Crawley, trembling at the 
 audacity of his son, whispered him : 
 
 “Aisy, now! aisy, Con, dear; troth you’ll put 
 your foot in it, if you let your gianius get the better 
 of you this way.” 
 
 The clerk now read the depositions in a nasal tone 
 and drawling brogue, which gave infinite amusement 
 to the fashionable part of the audience ; and at last 
 got through the sundry charges against Padreen Gar, 
 Denis Tully, Shamus Joy, Dan Brogan, Teague 
 MacMahon, Owny Sullivan, and others, who came 
 under the denomination of “ Padreen Gar’s Boys.” 
 They stood accused of feloniously assembling for 
 purposes of rebellion, and breach of the king’s peace, 
 at Saint Gobanate’s Well, under the pretence of cele-

 brating the feast of that saint ; and of acting under 
 the influence of Terence Oge O’Leary, who had ab- 
 sconded, but whose papers being seized, betrayed a 
 regular plan of insurrection, which was aided by 
 several Catholic gentlemen of the country, in corres- 
 pondence with Spain and France. 
 
 Baron Boulter, now folding his letter, called for a 
 lighted candle and sealing-wax, and addressing the 
 prisoners, said : 
 
 “ My honest friends, it appears to me, from the de- 
 positions which have been just set forth, that you 
 have ail incurred the chance of being hanged ; an 
 event that must in all probability have taken place at 
 one time or other of your lives : and I dare say you 
 will agree with me, my honest friends, that whether 
 a little sooner, or a little later, it is a matter of but 
 trifling importance. (I’ll trouble you, sir, to snuff the 
 candle.) You see, my friends, I w r ish to do nothing 
 in the dark, and am endeavoring to throw every pos- 
 sible light upon your case. There, now, is my young 
 and clever friend, Mr. Conway Townsend Crawley, 
 smiling at me ! and my old friend, Mr. Crawley, his 
 venerable father, smiling also. The Crawley s, gen* 
 tlemen, are good-humored men, and cheerful men. I 
 am, myself, a good-humored man ; and in that point, 
 at least, I resemble Lord Mansfield. And now, my 
 friends, with such active magistrates and loyal men 
 as the Mister Crawleys among you, the one a high 
 sheriff, the other a high treasurer, the one a sitting 
 barrister, and another a sergeant (not, however, I 
 trust, a permanent sergeant), with such enlightened 
 guardians of the law to keep you quiet, and put you 
 up, and put you down, it is singular that you should

 meet at St. Gobnate’s Well, for the purposes of sedi- 
 tion and rebellion. Mr. Crawley, sen., may be justly 
 styled the grand conservator of the peace of Bally- 
 dab, and with his worthy sons, I must say, forms an 
 aula regis. (A term, by-the-bye, borrowed from the 
 Norman law, as you well know, my honest friends, 
 none better.) (I’ll trouble you, sir, for a little black 
 wax.) As for Counsellor Conway Crawley, I look 
 upon him as the very repertorium of the laws ; one 
 who has read everything; Burn’s Justice, Black- 
 stone’s Commentaries, the Registrum Brevium, and 
 Paley’s Evidences ; deep read in the Saxon law, the 
 Norman law, the Brehon law, and the game law. 
 But apropos to game laws, would you, Mr. Footman, 
 step out to my servant, and tell him to take the 
 grouse out of the guncase, and present them to the 
 cook, with Baron Boulter’s very best compliments ? 
 The point to establish, my honest friends, is this — 
 were you really at Saint Gobnate’s Well for the pur- 
 poses of sedition ? Can you prove that you were 
 not? I address myself in particular to you, Mr. 
 Padreen Gar, as chief of this conspiracy : were you 
 at Saint Gobnate’s Well this morning? and for what 
 purpose.” 
 
 “ Is it for what purpose, my lord ?” said Padreen 
 Gar, advancing intrepidly into the centre of the hall, 
 and displaying a bold and careless countenance^ “ Is 
 it what brought me there, sir ? Sure your lordship 
 knows right well what would be bringing a poor 
 man to the holy well, plaze your lordship’s honor, sir ; 
 isn’t it his dewotion, my lord ? what else, sir ? And 
 has been going to the well an hundred years, and 
 more, my lord — troth we have.”

 il Will you make affidavit of that, Mr. Padreen Gar?” 
 “ I will, plaze your lordship.” 
 
 “ Then, Mr. Padreen, I can only say, that a pitcher 
 that goes so often to the well is liable to come home 
 broken at last, which I think I shall be able to prove 
 to you before I have done. But who is that in the 
 red snanavest? (I believe that is good Irish for a 
 waistcoat, as some of you know, my friends, to your 
 cost) — he wdio is seeking my attention, as I judge by 
 his expressive countenance.” 
 
 “ It’s Barney Tully, as sold your honor a horse, my 
 lord, last sizes; long life to your lordship,” said a 
 slight, meagre, but alert person, stepping before Pad- 
 reen Gar, and displaying a countenance of sly and in- 
 telligent expression. 
 
 “ So : Mr. Tully, how do you do, my equestrian 
 friend? Now, Mr. Barney Tully, though I have too 
 much respect for your name and calling to wish to 
 pry into Tully’ s offices, I must, nevertheless, institute 
 an inquiry into the cause of your appearing at Saint 
 Gobnate’s Well.” 
 
 “ Och ! plaze your honor, I’ll prove an alibi, my 
 lord; for upon oath this day, ’bove all days of the 
 year, I was working on Mr. Crawley’s new road, 
 when I was seen and taken at Saint Gobnate’s Well, 
 sir.” 
 
 “ Then, Tullus Aufidius, it is very plain you are of 
 that class in Irish zoology, so puzzling to naturalists, 
 called the bird that can be in two places at once.” 
 
 “ I am, sir,” replied Barney, smiling archly : “ sure 
 enough, an Irish bird, egg and feather ; and so was 
 my father before me, my lord.” 
 
 “We have nothing to do with your father, my

 honest friend Tully, because we do not want, in this 
 instance, to kill two birds with one stone ; and prefer, 
 in all instances, a bird in the hand to two in the bush. 
 Now, my friend in the carawat, what is your name ?” 
 He addressed a foolish-looking person with a red 
 handkerchief tightened round his neck, almost to 
 strangling. 
 
 “ I’m called Teague MacMahon, plaze your lord- 
 ship.” 
 
 “ You could not be called by a better name, Mr. 
 MacMahon, if your father 'was as-- anxious as Tristram 
 Shandy’s to give you a lucky one.” 
 
 “ Long life to your lordship, and God bless you, 
 sir.” 
 
 “ But, Mr. MacMahon, with such a name, I cannot 
 well understand how you should be guilty of such 
 disloyal practices as to join Padreen Gar’s rebellious 
 band, at that site of all insubordination, St. Gobnate’s 
 Well.” 
 
 “ Why, then, see here, plaze your lordship,” said 
 Teague MacMahon, waving his hand, and speaking 
 with great emphasis, “ I should never gone near the 
 well, and had no call, only in regard to my taste of 
 bacon, which was stolen dishonestly from me, plaze 
 your honor.” 
 
 “ Then you are one of those improvident persons, 
 Mr. MacMahon, who have not the art of saving your 
 bacon.”

 (meal), and an hundred of nails for my brogues : and 
 while I was at Mass, what should he do, but comes in, 
 and skelps off with the biggest half, and leaves me 
 only a w T eeny taste ; and so I went after him to Saint 
 Gobnate’s, where I was taken up, sir, only for look- 
 ing after the remains of my bacon.” 
 
 “ The truth then is out, Mr. MacMahon ; you went 
 in search of a man, w r ho had the boldness to make an 
 abridgment of Bacon.” 
 
 “ Och, musha ! that’s it; long life to your lordship,” 
 said Teague, triumphantly. 
 
 “I hope, however, Mr. MacMahon, that your 
 friend had the taste to preserve all the attic salt.” 
 
 “ Och ! plaze your honor, it was w^ell salted and 
 smoked, too, before he took a taste of it.” 
 
 “ Then, Mr. MacMahon, I must say, that had you 
 but smoked your friend as you have smoked your 
 bacon, you would not now be the victim of your 
 credulity, nor brought before me on suspicion of 
 high treason.” 
 
 “ My lord, my lord,” interrupted Judge Aubrey, 
 with an air of irrepressible impatience, “ I beg your 
 pardon ; but though I believe this mockery of justice 
 is got up simply for the amusement of this distin- 
 guished circle, jet I cannot witness or assist in car- 
 rying on a farce, which may in the end be pregnant 
 with evil to the persons who stand in custody before 
 us. The depositions are a tissue of absurdity and 
 nonsense ; and though magistrates can in this country 
 deprive persons of their liberty upon grounds quite 
 as slight, yet I am not quite certain that the warrant 
 upon which they have been arrested is a legal instru- 
 ment. Show me your warrant, constable.— Yes, it

 is, as I suspected, a vague mittimus ; a contrivance 
 of certain active magistrates to get obnoxious per- 
 sons into their power, and by which they baffle the 
 protection of the laws, omitting to state any name, 
 day, place, or particulars of the offences. Nothing, 
 therefore, remains but to discharge these poor men, 
 and send them to their work. 5 ’ 
 
 “ My learned brother,” said the baron, with much 
 pleasantry of manner, “ ’tis not for you or me to 
 bring in the verdict: we must refer it to the jury; 
 and I believe a fairer jury never sat. What say you, 
 ladies ? guilty or not guilty ?” 
 
 “Not guilty upon my honor,” cried Lady Georgi- 
 ana, joined by all the patrician voices present ; while 
 Lady Dunore, as much amused by the turn the mock 
 trial was taking, as she had been agitated by its 
 probable issue, cried out louder than them all, “ Oh, 
 not guilty, not guilty !” 
 
 The judges now arose; and Judge Aubrey was 
 about to address the prisoners, and to address them 
 with an admonition, when young Crawley starting 
 forward, exclaimed with vehemence — 
 
 “ Stay, my lord ! before you again turn these law- 
 less men loose upon this unfortunate district, whom 
 your lordship must be aware have had no examina- 
 tion whatever, I beg to be heard for a few minutes. 
 Your lordship has called the depositions made by 
 sundry respectable persons a tissue of nonsense and 
 absurdity ; but we know how easy it is to despise the 
 dawnings of all insurrections ; we have learned also 
 how dangerous it is to do so. The ravings of the 
 first few followers of Cromwell at Huntingdon, a 
 scuffle for apples by Massaniello at Naples, and the

 dissensions of the Poissardes at Paris, however con- 
 temptible in their origin, were yet the commence- 
 ment and causes of the mighty and terrific revolu- 
 tions which followed. But, my lords, I will, I think, 
 convince you that the seeds of rebellion have taken in 
 this province a deeper root than in the breasts of a 
 few barbarous peasants ; that foreign incendiaries are 
 at work to undermine the good will subsisting 
 between Ireland and the parent country; and that 
 intrigues are now carried on between France, Spain, 
 and some of the Catholic gentlemen of this country, 
 through the medium of an old offender, who was 
 deeply implicated in the rebellion, a sort of peda- 
 gogue named Terence Oge O'Leary.” 
 
 “ Good God !” exclaimed Lady Dunore, plunged 
 into a new series of emotions, “ how extraordinary ! 
 only conceive ! French agents in this remote spot ! 
 Go on, Mr. Conway, pray go on.” 
 
 “ Last night,” continued young Crawley, with re- 
 newed spirit, “a search warrant was procured for 
 examining O’Leary’s papers ; and, as he was not at 
 home, his desk was opened, and some curious plans 
 of the intended rebellion came to light, which were 
 forwarded by a military express to the castle, after I 
 had taken copies of them. Here,” continued young 
 Crawley, triumphantly taking up paper after paper 
 out of his father’s “ green bag,” “ here is first a list of 
 the ancient families of this province, whose descend- 
 ants (laborers in my father’s grounds, and in her 
 ladyship’s) will be doubtlessly proved one of these 
 days to be lords of the soil. Here is a fragment 
 relative to the late Florence Macarthy, a drunken old 
 dotard, who lived in this neighborhood, and was

 called the titular Earl of Clancare. It is curious, as 
 proving that he has long been considered the true 
 lord of this district, and was secretly acknowledged 
 such by his own party, which includes all the disloyal 
 people in the country ; for his paper states the follow- 
 ing fact, in the quaint old language, still used by the 
 Catholic gentry, and particularly affected by Terence 
 Oge O’Leary, — that 1 Florence Macarthy, by consent 
 of all the Popish bishops, deacons, Jesuits, friars, and 
 all the Irish nobilities assembled, was created Mac- 
 arthy More, using in creation all the rites and cere- 
 monies customary to the ancient Irish, being joined 
 by all the nobility and noblesse of the province — viz., 
 the Na Donnells-Ferrars, the Offaleys, O’Sullivans- 
 Beare, and Moriarty M'Teague ( names, my lord, 
 better known in the flourishing city of Ballydab than 
 in the Red Book or Debreet’s Peerage). It is with 
 regret, also, I add — that among those provincial 
 noblesse are inscribed the names of the Knights of 
 Kerry and Glynn, the White Knight, and* the Knight 
 of the Valley, and, in short, many members of the 
 Fitzgerald family. But what is most curious of all 
 is the following letter from a Spanish priest, on whom 
 it seems the Archbishopric of Dublin has already 
 been bestowed. This letter, without date, is ad- 
 dressed to the late Florence Macarthy, of Ballydab, 
 by the style and title of the 1 Most Excellente Earl 
 Florence Macarthy, of Clancare,’ and is well worth 
 attending to.” 
 
 “Oh! let us have the archbishop’s letter, by all 
 means,” said Lady Dunore. “ Only think, Georgy, 
 love, of giving away an archbishopric ! it is quite too 
 amusing. Pray go on, Mr. Conway.”

 Mr Conway cleared his voice, and read as follows : 
 
 “ My Good Earl : — *God is my witness, that after 
 my arrival in Ireland, having knowledge of your lord- 
 ship’s valor and learning (his valor, Lady Dunore, was 
 leading the Ballydab boys some thirty years back in 
 a contest with the Glannacrimes), I had an extreme 
 desire to see and to communicate, and to confer with 
 so principal a personage ; but the length of the w r ay 
 would not permit me. I am now departing into 
 Spain, with grief that I had not visited those parts ; 
 but I hope shortly to return to this kingdom, and to 
 give you entire satisfaction: and be assured that I 
 will perform with his Majesty vdiat a brother ought 
 to do, that he should send from Spain. Because by 
 letter I cannot speak any more, I leave the rest till 
 sight. The Lord have your lordship in His keeping, 
 according to my desire. Yo Mateo, 
 
 Arcobispo di Dublin , m 
 
 “How, my Lords and Lady Dundre, whether his 
 Majesty here alluded to be Bonaparte, or King 
 Joseph, it is evident that the late Mr. Macarthy kept 
 up a secret correspondence with the enemies of the 
 country ; and it is also pretty certain that this ‘ Yo 
 Mateo ’ has fulfilled his promise of returning to com- 
 municate what he dared not write. He has been lor 
 more than a week back lurking in this neighborhood, 
 and even had the audacity to present himself in my 
 father’s house on false pretences He is now under 
 escort on his way to Dublin ; and his coadjutor and 
 host, the successor of Mr. Macarthy in treason, has 
 absconded. But, there is no doubt, the vigilant police

 of the country will ferret him out of his hiding-den.” 
 
 The detail thus given by Conway Crawley, with 
 the singular circumstances he developed, excited a 
 very striking emotion in the English part of his au- 
 ditory. A pause of a moment ensued. 
 
 Old Crawley pulled down his wig, and stole a sly 
 glance of satisfaction at J udge Aubrey. Miss Craw- 
 ley, who for the first time learned that her saintly 
 hero was a French or Spanish spy, grew pale. 
 Baron Boulter left an epigram unfinished, and began 
 to lend a serious attention, while Lady Dunore ex- 
 hausted herself in reiterated exclamations of amaze- 
 ment and consternation. 
 
 “ Only conceive, Georgy, love, a real Spanish monk, 
 an incendiary, too ! Good heavens ! how extraordi- 
 nary ! Do you know I would not for the world miss 
 seeing Yo Mateo. But pray go on.” 
 
 “ I believe'there is little more to be added, madam. 
 The principal facts are before your ladyship and the 
 judges; and your lordship,” added young Crawley* 
 insolently turning to Judge Aubrey, “may now con- 
 ceive the propriety of our not dismissing these men, 
 at least till we are in possession of the principals and 
 leaders.” 
 
 “ I see no more reason than ever for detaining 
 | them,” returned Judge Aubrey. “ But I hope, Mr. 
 Crawley, the documents, whose copies you have had 
 the trouble to make, and to read, have not actually 
 been sent off to the chief secretary’s office by military 
 express.” 
 
 “ They are, I hope, by this time nearly in his pos- 
 session,” returned Conway Crawley, in a tone of great 
 elation.

 “I am sorry for it,” said Judge Aubrey, coolly, 
 “ very sorry, Mr. Crawley ; for as far as my black-let- 
 ter Irish studies go, and if my memory does not 
 wholly fail me, you have copied verbatim some ex- 
 tracts from the Pacata Hibernia of Robin Oarew ; and 
 you have transmitted to government a faithful account 
 of the insurrection of the celebrated Florence Mac- 
 i arthy, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.” 
 
 A burst of laughter, in which all joined, save the 
 Crawleys, followed this observation, while a voice in 
 the distance cried out— 
 
 “ To be sure he has ; sorrow lie there is in that.” 
 The next moment O’Leary, bustling through the 
 crowd, his cotamore slung over his shoulder, his wig 
 awry, and his ferule in his hand, presented himself in 
 the centre of the hall. His appearance excited consi- 
 ; derable amusement ; for, having bowed formally to 
 Lady Dunore, with a tone of uncontrollable irritation, 
 he turned upon young Crawley, exclaiming — 
 
 u I ! ll trouble you for my documents, Counsellor 
 Con ; my heads, and tails, and perorations ; my notes, 
 and minutes, and memories, for my genealogical his- 
 tory of the great Macarthy family, written in the 
 Phoenician language, vulgo-vocato Irish. What call 
 had you to them at all ? Dioui ! What right had 
 you to break open my box, and I not in it, and to 
 purloin my codices ? And what dirty lucre did you 
 expect by it, Counsellor ? If it wasn’t out of fear 
 that I’d tell to the world that your ould grandfather, 
 Paddy Crawley, took some of the property of the late 
 Earl of Clancare, in trust for him during the painals 
 (penals), sir, and refused to restore it after the repail, 
 which was the first step he got in the world : and

 troth, a dirty step it was. Now answer me that ? 
 Counsellor Con, before the English noblesse here 
 present.” 
 
 “I believe, Mr. Conway Crawley,” said Judge 
 Aubrey, significantly, “ we may dismiss all these per- 
 sons now.” 
 
 Everybody arose and came forward, good-naturedly 
 amused with the consternation of him whose preten- 
 sion and insolence had been equally entertaining and 
 imposing a few minutes before. Old Crawley almost 
 buried his head in his green bag ; but Conway, though 
 confused, still unsubdued, came forward, and address- 
 ing Lady Dunore, who was now laughing with Lord 
 Frederick and Lady Georgiana, he said, “ I must re- 
 quest your lordship’s attention and patience one mi- 
 nute more.” 
 
 “ Oh ! by all means,” said Lady Dunore, fluttering 
 back to her place. “ I don’t care in the least if this 
 trial goes on forever. I never was so agitated and 
 so amused in all my life ; now, pray all sit down. 
 My dear Judge Aubrey, pray resume your seat.” 
 
 “All that your ladyship has heard,” continued Con- 
 way, “is mere invention, mere subterfuge- — Baron 
 Boulter, better than any other, must be aware that 
 it is so ; since his lordship, as senior circuit judge, 
 has granted a bench warrant to my father to take 
 up the incognito Spanish priest upon such informa- 
 tion as his lordship certainly deemed sufficient.” 
 
 “ I certainly granted a warrant a few days back, 5 * 
 said Baron Boulter, with a look of mortification, “ on 
 informations sworn by one Mr. James Bryan, who 
 holds some place in Mr. Crawley’s office, for the pur- 
 pose of apprehending a very suspicions character,

 who, without any visible business, or means of live- 
 lihood, has for some time been lurking about this 
 neighborhood.” 
 
 This confession produced a visible change in the 
 opinion of all present, while an expression of half- 
 suppressed emotion distorted the countenance of old 
 Crawley, and he muttered, in acrimonious tone, to 
 his son : 
 
 “ You have made a pretty kettle of fish of it, now. 
 What the devil business had you to mention that 
 stranger at all, at all ? Couldn't you let him go on 
 quietly to jail? Troth, your gianius will get you 
 muzzled yet, great a scholar as you are, Counsellor 
 Con.” 
 
 The silence which Baron Boulter’s confession had 
 produced was now suddenly interrupted by a noise 
 in the portico. The crowd which still lingered there 
 gave way with a spontaneous and respectful motion, 
 and a person of singular and imposing appearance 
 advanced boldly up the hall, followed by two officers 
 of justice. He approached the table where the 
 judges sat, removing his hat with one hand, and 
 leaning the other on a pile of books, and in a voice 
 full, clear and rapid, he said : 
 
 “ I beg to present myself to Baron Boulter.” 
 
 Mute astonishment trembled upon every lip. 
 Wonder and admiration animated every eye. All 
 was breathless, eager suspense, but O’Leary alone 
 moved, and placed himself near the object of attrac- 
 tion, with a look in which wildness and triumph 
 disputed pre-eminence. 
 
 Baron Boulter was the first to recover presence of 
 mind, and he replied, “ My name, sir, is Boulter, and

 I have the honor to hold his Majesty’s commission, 
 as Baron of the Exchequer. I can only add, sir, that 
 I shall be happy to make the acquaintance of so 
 handsome a man, and so fine a gentleman ; pray be 
 seated.” 
 
 The stranger put back the chair presented to him. 
 
 “ My lord,” he said, “ I am a prisoner. On my 
 arrival in this district this morning, and in my way 
 to my lodging at the dwelling of this person, Te- 
 rence Oge O’Leary, I was arrested on a bench war- 
 rant of your lordship’s, on information sworn by a 
 notorious informer, who was condemned for perjury 
 some years back, and was saved under an indemnity 
 act procured by his employer, Mr. Crawley. I shall 
 obey your warrant, my lord, if you acknowledge 
 your signature. But in the presence of this assem- 
 bly, I deny that you have any authority to order 
 the arrest of any man, either of your own free mo- 
 tion, or on such information as that upon wfiich I 
 am now a prisoner. It is to you, therefore, my lord, 
 I shall look for responsibility.” 
 
 “You will do what you please, sir,” said Baron 
 Boulter, firmly and coldly. “ The lav/ lies open to 
 all men.” 
 
 “ And we, my lord,” interrupted young Crawley, 
 trembling with rage and mortification, while his fa- 
 ther, pale and silent, sat with his eyes bent upon the 
 stranger ; “ and we, my lord, shall find precedents 
 enough in this country to defend us.” 
 
 “ In this country !” interrupted the stranger in a 
 loud and indignant voice. “ Has this country, then, 
 a set of by-laws of its own to answer the purposes of

 333 
 
 particular individuals? Are not the laws of Eng- 
 land the laws of Ireland ?” 
 
 “ Officers, do your duty,” said young Crawley, 
 authoritatively, and almost incoherent with stifled 
 I rage. 
 
 “ I shall accompany your officers,” returned the 
 stranger coolly, “ and I have to thank them for their 
 indulgence which has confronted me with Baron 
 Boulter. His lordship, I doubt not, has been im- 
 posed upon; but for the rest I am aware that no 
 man shall be imprisoned but upon the lawful judg- 
 ment of his equals, or by the law of the land. This 
 is the charter, by this I shall abide.” Then dropping 
 his extended arm, his countenance lost all the stern- 
 ness by which it had been energized, and bowing 
 gracefully and low to the ladies, he added, “ I trust, 
 in a moment of exigency like this, I shall be forgiven 
 if I have violated the laws of ceremony in asserting 
 those of justice, and I offer a thousand apologies to 
 the Marchioness of Dunore and her distinguished 
 circle for this unseasonable intrusion.” 
 
 He then bowed slightly round to the judges re- 
 spectfully, and dropped back between the officers of 
 justice ; while Lady Dunore, in a fever of admiration, 
 and O’Leary, in the delirium of strong emotion, both 
 approached him as he retired; but the deep stern 
 voice of Judge Aubrey arrested his steps. 
 
 “ Stay, sir, you are, I apprehend, a stranger in this 
 country ?” 
 
 “ I am, my lord, an utter stranger.” 
 
 “You have then, sir, a prescriptive right to cour- 
 tesy and protection, in a land where the name of 
 stranger is still held sacred. I have no doubt my

 learned brother has been imposed on. His confidence 
 in Mr. Crawley’s zealous loyalty, and the hurry of 
 business, may have urged him to give a warrant which 
 I pronounce to be illegal, as given upon the testimony 
 of a convicted perjurer.” 
 
 “ You cannot prove it, Judge Aubrey,” exclaimed 
 young Crawley, vehemently. “You would set aside 
 all judicial privilege, all propter dignitatem , of the 
 bench.” 
 
 “ Sir,” said the judge, “ these ebullitions of a mind, 
 fraught by self-interest with arbitrary notions, are not 
 worthy of reply. The dignity of the judicial station 
 can only be degraded by him who holds it. I beg 
 your pardon, sir,” he added, hastily ; and turning to 
 the stranger, “I fear I have detained you; but I 
 would impress upon your mind, that the judges of the 
 land are the natural guardians of the oppressed ; and 
 I would suggest to you that, by giving bail, you will 
 be spared the annoyance and inconvenience of a tem- 
 porary imprisonment.” 
 
 “ My lord,” said the prisoner, “ I thank you for 
 this mark of consideration. But I have already said 
 that I am an utter stranger here; where then should 
 I seek for bail ? Where is there one that would hold 
 himself responsible for a stranger ?” 
 
 “ I will,” exclaimed a voice from a distance ; and 
 the next moment the hand of a young and very 
 noble-looking person was clasped in that of the 
 stranger. 
 
 “ And pray, who are you, sir,” demanded young 
 Crawley, stepping forward with a tone and demeanor 
 of the pertest effrontery. 
 
 “ I am,” said the party interrogated, throwing his

 335 
 
 eyes haughtily over his questionist, “ I am Lord Adelm 
 Fitzadelm : pray who are you ?” 
 
 The elder stranger started back with astonishment, 
 while among the general bursts of exclamation, which 
 rang through the hall, the shrieks of Lady Dunore 
 were predominantly audible. She threw herself into 
 her son’s arms, as much transported by the theatrical 
 scene of his unexpected appearance as if she had not 
 for months intrigued his absence. She wept and 
 laughed with hysterical alternation, presenting him 
 to those he already knew, and to those he had never 
 seen before. Then turning to the stranger, she ad- 
 dressed him as Don Yo Mateo, Archbishop of Dub- 
 lin, asked a thousand pardons, welcomed him to Du- 
 nore, and went on repeating, “ was there ever any- 
 thing so charming? anything so delightful! This is 
 Ireland par example ! Delightful Ireland, where one 
 is never safe and never ennuyee for a single mo- 
 ment !” 
 
 Meantime the hall was cleared : the company at 
 the castle, Lord Adelm, his friend, the officers of jus- 
 tice, and O’Leary, were nearly all that remained. The 
 latter stood in the background transfixed and pale, a 
 monument of consternation, and motionless as death, 
 save that his quick glancing eyes turned alternately 
 from Lord Adelm to his guest, and from his guest to 
 Lord Adelm. 
 
 “ But who is your friend ?” asked Lady Dunore, 
 eagerly, and interrupting Lord Adelm’s details of his 
 journey, and pointing to the stranger, who stood talk- 
 ing to J udge Aubrey. “ Is he a real Spanish monk ? 
 Sure you are not implicated in this rebellion, which is 
 found out to be no rebellion at all.”

 These questions were repeated by every eye, if not 
 by every tongue. 
 
 “ Allow me to present my mother to you,” said 
 Lord Adelm, taking the stranger’s hand. “ The I 
 Marchioness of Dunore, — General Fitzwalter, of | 
 South America, that brave guerilla chief, whose life ; 
 and fortune have been devoted to South American ■ 
 independence. He is doubtless already known to you 
 by fame, as he is in the Terra Firma, by the glorious 
 sobriquet of the Librador.” 
 
 Something like amazement was depicted in the 
 countenance of the stranger, while he went through 
 the forms of presentation, and listened to this detail J 
 of himself. 
 
 Lord Adelm continued : “ I do not believe, how- 
 ever, that my friend aspires to the double influence 
 of the crosier and the sword. If, at least, he am- 
 bitions the Archbishopric of Dublin, in the course of 
 our travelling companionship (for we came to this 
 country together), he has not made me his confidant.” 
 
 “ Travelling companionship !” muttered old Craw- 
 ley, with a look of alarm, while Lady Dunore reiter- 
 ated welcomes and exclamations of delight, surprise 
 and wonder. 
 
 The question of bail was then resumed ; and a form 
 being prepared, Lord Fitzadelm signed the paper : 
 but this was not sufficient, as the instrument required 
 two securities. 
 
 “ Oh !” cried Lady Dunore, gayly, “ I’ll be bail for 
 the Archbishop, that is, for the General : give me the 
 pen — only think how odd ! and, you, Georgy, shall 
 be another.” 
 
 Young Crawley, however, gravely demonstrated

 the illegality of her tender, and stated that female 
 hail was not usual. 
 
 “ Well, well, Mr. Conway Crawley, you happen to 
 be monstrously unaccommodating to-day, and very 
 tiresome,’ interrupted Lady Dunore, “ hut I suppose 
 it must he so. Then do you, Mr. Crawley, if you 
 please, sign for me. I imagine that will do as well. 
 I mean Crawley pere.” 
 
 The tone and manner in which this request wms 
 given were too peremptory to be resisted ; and old 
 Crawley, to his own amazement and consternation, 
 became bail for the person whose arrest had taken 
 place at his own instance, while he mentally observed, 
 “ Well this bates Banagher anyhow.’ * 
 
 Young Crawley, in the meantime, had left the table 
 and was engaged in earnest conversation with his 
 aunt apart. 
 
 Baron Bou&er was profuse in his apologies, spoke 
 with some harshness of the two Crawleys for being 
 led away by over loyalty, offered to discharge the 
 warrant altogether, and asked the General on a vish 
 to his house whenever he should come to Dublin. 
 
 To the discharge of the warrant, General Fitzwal- 
 ter firmly objected: the transaction, he observed, 
 must be followed to its consequences. To the prof- 
 fered hospitality he returned a polite answer, as 
 general in its terms as the proposition to which it 
 replied. 
 
 Judge Aubrey sat still, in silent triumpn; the 
 ladies’ eyes were all turned on the guerilla chief, and 
 Lord Rosbrin, seeing everything in a dramatic point 
 
 * A common Irish expression, applied to the doing of an ex- 
 traordinary thing.

 of view, talked of situations, incidents and clap-traps. 
 
 Lord Fitzadelm now came forward, and seconded 
 by his mother, pressed General Fitzwalter, with 
 earnest solicitation, to make Dunore Castle his resi- 
 dence while he remained in the country ; but before 
 he could reply, the attention of all was suddenly at- 
 tracted to the recess of the painted window, by one 
 of the bailiffs observing to Mr. Crawdey : 
 
 “ Now, what am I to do with that taymale prisoner 
 in the hall window, plaze your honor, that we took 
 up according to order, Mr. Crawley, going into 
 Terence Oge’s a little bit ago, and wouldn’t tell her 
 name, sir, nor show her face, only just axed lave, sir, 
 to send a bit of a message to Castle Macarthy, sir, to 
 the Bhan Tierna, by a bit of a gossoon, sir, and is 
 cooped up there forenent you, Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “ You may do with her what you please, Larry Cos- 
 tello,” replied Mr. Crawley, in a dejected and absent 
 tone, and still under the influence of profound chagrin 
 amazement and alarm, which were all depicted in his 
 countenance. 
 
 Larry Costello “ plazed” to let out the prisoner from 
 the dock where Lord Rosbrin had placed her, and to 
 give her her liberty, when Lord Frederick, interfer- 
 ing, said : “i>y Jupiter, this lady rebel has as good a

 that we take our seats, and empannel forthwith for

 “ Oh ! by all means in the w r orld,” said Lady Du- 
 nore, unsatiated by scenes, sensations, and surprises : 
 “ we must hear the Pucelle de Ballydab and she 
 took her son’s arm, who seemed satisfactorily to have 
 accounted for his arrival ; for to whatever he had said,

 she replied— “You are quite right — exactly — cer- 
 tainly. I am delighted to see you here.” 
 
 The party now drew up in a circle, without resum- 
 ing their seats, while the poor woman, apparently in- 
 timidated, and wishing to conceal herself, was led 
 forward for examination by Larry Costello, who en- 
 deavored to encourage her by repeating r “ Hold up 
 your head, now, honey. Sure there’s money bid for 
 you. If the Bhan Tierna will stand up for you, sor- 
 row thing you have to fear, ma’am. I’ll engage she’ll 
 carry you through, and well. Only just, sure, if you 
 don t show your face, their lordships will not see it. 
 agrah.” 
 
 Larry Costello, who was as easy in the presence of 
 his superiors as the lower. Irish usually are, with very 
 little ceremony now pulled back her grey hood, and 
 the straw bonnet it covered fell to the ground, disco- 
 vering, not the coarse features of an Irish peasant, 
 but such a head and countenance as might have be- 
 longed to that 
 
 “ Rare Egyptian, the serpent of old Nile.” 
 
 The immediate expression, however, of this singu 
 lar countenance was confusion ; but, though the eyes 
 were ri vetted to the earth, and a color, changeful as 
 thought, indicated the excess of bashful womanly em- 
 barrassment, yet the acute smile that for a moment 
 gleamed and vanished, and a certain air of mockery 
 and shrewdness which seemed the natural involun- 
 1 tary expression of the irregular, but pretty features, 
 combined to present a model for one of those happy 
 pictures of gipsy beauty, where “ fancy outworks 
 nature,” and mingles with the admiration which its 
 equivocal charms attract from the spectator, some-

 thing of fear, if not of distrust. Amazement, univer- 
 sally and almost audibly expressed, followed the sud- 
 den apparition of this unexpected vision. 
 
 “ The Bhan Tierna ! by the powers !” exclaimed 
 Larry Costello, in consternation, and respectfully 
 withdrawing from the prisoner’s side. 
 
 “ Lambh Laidar Aboo !” shouted O’Leary, throw- 
 ing up his wig instead of his hat in an ecstasy of 
 triumph. 
 
 “ Lady Clancare !” cried Judge Aubrey, coming 
 forward, and taking her hand with an air of kindness 
 and protection. 
 
 “ Lady who ?” said the marchioness. “ Lady Clan- 
 care did you say ? Good heavens ! it cannot — it is — 
 my dear, charming odd, out of the way Lady Clan- 
 care : I have no words to express my delight. To 
 meet you here of all places in the world ! a prisoner, 
 too ! a rebel chief fcainess, perhaps ! Oh ! it’s quite 
 too good ! Isn’t it, Georgy, love ? One never meets 
 with such things in London. But where are you 
 come from ? How fat you are grown ! Why did you 
 disappear so suddenly, when you had obtained such a 
 grand sncces in London ? Do you know, people said 
 all sorts of odd things of you? No one could make 
 you out in the least ; and your pretty, pretty tales, 
 and stories, and things. How tanned you are ! — how 
 well you look ! Georgy, love, don’t you know Lady 
 Clancare, who made the frais of my two last assem- 
 blies ? And my forgetting you too, dear Lady Clan- 
 care, so completely, when you were out of sight, it’s 
 so very odd, isn’t it, Georgy; but one forgets every- 
 thing in London, except what one sees every day.” 
 
 To this Georgy assented, at the same time renew-

 ing a very slight acquaintance with Lady Clancare, 
 formed at Lady Dunore’s parties in town. 
 
 While the ceremonies of recognition, and the mul- 
 tiplicity of Lady Dunore’s questions, afforded to the 
 young Irish peeress a moment of self-collection, her 
 spirits rallied ; but still, as she threw round her eyes, 
 there was an air of “ tongue-tied simplicity ’ in her 
 eloquent Hsilence, which contrasted with the expres- 
 sive character of her countenance. 
 
 Her emotion seemed something beyond the natural 
 confusion incidental to her actual position, and she 
 turned her eyes with a glance of supplication on 
 Lady Dunore, as if soliciting her interposition, to 
 withdraw her from a situation where every look was 
 turned on her ; where she formed the centre of a 
 circle evidently animated by idle curiosity and 
 amused amazement. 
 
 Lady Dunore, flattered by the claim made on her 
 protection, and understanding it, drew her a little on 
 one side, listened, smiled, laughed aloud at some de- 
 tail which Lady Clancare related in a low, murmur- 
 ing voice, and with a countenance varying, animated, 
 and humorous ; while to the conclusion of her rela- 
 tion, whatever it had been, Lady Dunore, gently 
 leading her back to the group, replied : 
 
 “ Don’t make the least apology. Oh ! no, its better 
 as it is, a thousand times. This impromptu is worth 
 an hundred formal premeditated visits ; besides, all 
 this never could happen but in Ireland. It was so 
 kind in you, to suffer yourself to be taken prisoner 
 too— you are always so amusing. But who are you, 
 my dear creature, for I forgot to ask you when in 
 London? You know, Georgy, love, one doesn’t want

 to know w r ho people are in London, especially Lions. 
 But are you really Irish, my dear Lady Clancare ?” 
 
 “ Irish !” exclaimed O’Leary, with a burst of emo- 
 tion beyond all power of control ; and darting for- 
 ward, “ ay, troth is she Irish, body and soul. Irish 
 by birth, by blood, and by descent. Irish every inch 
 of her, heart and hand, life and land ! ^nd though 
 the mother that bore her was Iberian born, Bachal 
 Essu ! she was Milesian, like herself, descended from 
 the Tyrian Hercules : and there she stands, the dar- 
 ling of the world, with the best blood of Spain and 
 Ireland flowing through her veins. A true Irish 
 woman, that loves her country, and lives in it, long 
 life to her ! and an ancient ould countess to boot, in 
 her own right, Anno 1565, Elizabeth, Regime 6; the 
 lineal heir of Florence Macarthy More, the fogh na 
 galla , and the King of the Desmondi, to this blessed 
 hour.” 
 
 A smile played over the countenance of Lady 
 Clancare, who retreated a few steps, as this address 
 again brought every eye on her, and again covered 
 her with confusion. 
 
 “ And who are you, you delightful creature ?” cried 
 Lady Dunore, walking round O’Leary with her glass 
 to her eye, and more than sharing in the general sur- 
 prise and amusement occasioned by his sudden ap- 
 pearance and speech. 
 
 “ Who am I, madam, is it ?” said O’Leary, firmly, 
 but respectfully : “ I am Terence Oge O’Leary, plaze 
 your ladyship, of the Pobbie O’Learys, of Clancare, 
 county Kerry, anciently Cair-Reight, from Cair-na- 
 Louchra-Macarthy, who was King of Munster, Anno

 Here General Fitzwalter advanced in front of 
 O’Leary, leaning on Lord Fitzadelm’s arm. O’Leary 
 started back : his voice dropped, his color changed, 
 and he paused abruptly. The general took the place, 
 from which O’Leary had involuntarily retreated ; and 
 some low-whispered words from Lady Clancare to 
 the marchioness, who had, during O’Leary’s speech, 
 drawn the arm of the Irish peeress through her own, 
 now wholly diverted her attention from the last of 
 these dramatis personcz , which the happy events of 
 this eventful day had brought upon the stage. 
 
 Withdrawing from the circle, the two ladies, in 
 earnest conversation, moved towards the portico, fol- 
 lowed by every eye. The appearance of Lady Clan- 
 care produced an instantaneous effect upon the crowd 
 assembled at the gates. 
 
 The report had gone abroad that the idol of popu- 
 lar feeling had been taken prisoner by Mr. Crawley, 
 
 !

 and brought to Dunore Castle. Hundreds of wild 
 but strong-affectioned persons had gathered for her 
 protection and rescue. Thousands were at her ser- 
 vice ; but her appearance, leaning on Lady Dunore’s 
 arm, lulled every fear for her safety. Cries of “ Bhan 
 Tierna go Brack /” rent the air ; and when both la- 
 dies sprang into a little cabriolet, drawn by mules, 
 (the carriage of Lady Clancare, which had just ar- 
 rived,) the name of the Marchioness of Dunore, 
 mingled with these more national sounds, and “ long 
 lives,” and “ long reigns,” were liberally distributed 
 to both ladies. 
 
 The guests of the castle had now advanced into 
 the portico to witness this singular scene. Lady 
 Clancare had taken the reins ; and while Lady Du- 
 nore drew her cashmir over her head and round her 
 shoulders, her new friend turned her extraordinary 
 countenance on the group in the portico ; and with a 
 mingled expression of extreme slyness and humor, she 
 threw round her dark eyes. They met alternately 
 the looks of all present; till at last fixing their 
 glances, charged with a malicious gaiety, something 
 between triumph and derision, on old Crawley, she 
 kissed her little whip in salutation to all, and drove 
 off with the lady of the castle, both laughing loud 
 and violently. 
 
 There was in all this little transaction a something 
 that gave a poetical image of an enchantress, whose 
 struggles with a rival Ogre finally prevail ; and Lady 
 Clancare looked as the Titania might be supposed to 
 look, when, on Oberon’s begging from her the 
 “ Little changeling boy to be his Henchman,” 
 
 she replies in the triumph of conscious possession,

 “ not for thy fairy kingdom !” The possession of Lady 
 Dunore seemed to her desirable as the changeling boy 
 to the fairy king. 
 
 With the departure of the two chieftainesses, Eng- 
 lish and Irish, the rest of the company, somewhat 
 fatigued, and infinitely amused by the events ot the 
 morning, dispersed, except the members of the Craw- 
 ley family who still remained in the hall, congregated 
 in close conference. 
 
 “ The game’s up,” said old Crawley, with his eyes 
 fixed on the spot where the phantom of Lady Clan- 
 care still floated before him, bearing oif the marchio- 
 ness : “ she has got her now,” he continued. “ That’s 
 the way she took my lunatic from me, whom I’d have 
 had to this day, and the management of his estate, 
 only for her. That’s the way, too, she let loose the 
 Rabragh on the world, with the help of Judge Au- 
 brey, just the ditto of herself. Well, the devil is not 
 able for her, Christ pardon me ; and believe after all 
 she is the devil in garnet, if the truth was known.” 
 
 “This is no place for idle talking,” said young 
 Crawley, at last overpowered by the contentions of 
 the day. “ Follow me to my aunt’s room ; you see 
 Lord Rosbrin is still in the portico — your discom- 
 fiture may be observed.” He then left the hall with 
 his silence-stricken aunt on one arm and his green 
 bag under the other. Old Crawley, after a moment’s 
 pause, was preparing, with a deep sigh, to obey the 
 authoritative commands of his son, when Lord Ros- 
 brin entering the hall, arrested his steps with a solemn 
 beckoning of his finger, and exclaiming with a signi- 
 ficant air — 
 
 “My gentle Puck, come hither.”

 Crawley involuntarily obeyed the summons, though 
 by no means liking the nom dc caresse which accom- 
 panied it. 
 
 “ Say, my fat lad of the castle,” continued Lord 
 Rosbrin, “ rememberest thou aught in scenic effect 
 more striking than that last dramatic incident; I 
 mean the old woman transformed suddenly into a 
 Roxalana, or an Urganda in the burletta of Cymon ? 
 Does it not beat the screen scene in the School for 
 Scandal hollow ?” 
 
 “ Hollow,” replied old Crawley, endeavoring to 
 extricate his button from Lord Rosbrin’s grasp. 
 
 “ Rememberest thou,” proceeded Lord Rosbrin 
 emphatically, “rememberest thou, since once I sat 
 upon a promontory, and heard a mermaid on a dol- 
 phin’s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious 
 breath, that the rude sea grew civil at her song?’ 
 
 “ Why, then, upon my credit, I can’t say I do,” 
 returned Crawley, with another impatient effort at 
 release. 
 
 “ That very time,” continued the peer, “ I saw— 
 thou couldst not — flying between the cold moon and 
 the earth ” 
 
 At the word moon a sudden conviction of the 
 young lord’s lunacy struck on Crawley’s mind ; and 
 bursting away, and leaving his button in Lord Ros- 
 brin’s grasp, he muttered as he went along, “ Devil a 
 bit, but I believe it is full moon with you all, men, 
 women and children, the Lord save us f” 
 
 Lord Rosbrin, looking after him, uttered a stage 
 laugh, and crying, “ a fool, a fool, a motley fool !” re- 
 tired to his dressing-room to clean some silver span- 
 gles, and cut out foil for his coronation dress in Lady 
 Macbeth,

 While the guests of the castle dispersed in different 
 directions, Lord Adelm and General Fitzwalter pro- 
 ceeded arm in arm together across the castle court 
 to a sort of terrace, once a rampart, which gave on 
 the sea. 
 
 This rampart opened by a door upon the strand ; 
 and Lord Adelm, proposing that they should direct 
 their steps beyond the reach of intrusion or observa- 
 tion, was endeavoring to draw back the rusty bolt, 
 and obtain egress, when O’Leary, with his hat 
 squeezed between his hands, and his countenance 
 distorted by agitation, caught the general’s eye as 
 he followed him at a short distance. 
 
 “ What is the matter ?” asked the general, turning 
 back on his steps, and meeting the approach of his 
 host. 
 
 “ The matter, my lord ! that’s your honor, I mane 
 gineral, sir, anyhow. Nothing is the matter, gineral, 
 only great times and great luck, sir ! and the young 
 lord, the very moral of the honorable Gerald, his 
 i father ; and the Crawley pirates foiled, sir, for oncet ; 
 and I’d only crave a word with your honor, gineral, 
 since it’s a great gineral you are, sir, and was a great

 gineral in the family an hundred years back and 
 more — that’s the ould brigadier, anno 1698, in armor 
 this day at Court Fitzadelm, only no frame — but 
 stopping a chimbley. And it’s what I’d just make 
 bould to ax your honor, and never will trouble you 
 more, sir, plaze God! if you aren’t the young lord 
 that’s laning over the battlement, waiting for you, 
 gineral, that is Lord Fitzadelm, sir ?” 
 
 “ O’Leary,” said General Fitzwalter, in a soothing 
 voice, “ O’Leary, put on your hat and go home. My 
 good O’Leary, I shall shortly follow you to the 
 friary to dress, and you may bespeak me a chaise to 
 bring me here to dinner. And, above all, O’Leary,” 
 (and he laid his hand on his shoulder as he spoke, 
 his voice softening into a tone of great affection,) 
 “ take care of the health and life of a person who is 
 very dear — that is, very necessary to me, O’Leary.” 
 
 “ And who is that ?” said O’Leary, eagerly. “ Is 
 it th’ aigle, gineral? Sure he’s dead, sir. Poor 
 Cumhal’s dead at last, your honor;” and the tears 
 dropped large and fast from his eyes ; but they fell 
 not all for Cumhal. The tone of the general’s voice, 
 and the pressure of his hand, had been too much for 
 the state of exultation in which the events of the 
 morning had left him; and the death of his old 
 companion furnished him with an excuse for weep- 
 ing, which relieved his heart, weighed down with 
 oppression. 
 
 “ Dead !” repeated the general : “ poor old Cum 
 hal ?” — he sighed, and added, absently, “ it was much 
 such an evening as this, and such a coast, too : poor 
 Cumhal — dead ?” 
 
 “ Och ? you need not moan him, gineral,” said

 O’Leary, reproachfully: “he’s better provided for 
 nor them he’s left behind him, sir. For shure, he 
 wasn’t shook off like a withered leaf from a young 
 tree, and rejected by him, that was reared on his 
 milk, that’s my wife’s milk, sir. And thought, troth, 
 we’d break our hearts the day he was weaned ; and 
 we sent back to St. Crohan’s ; and wasn’t long till he 
 
 followed us there, and ” 
 
 “ You are much altered since we met, since we first 
 met in the mountains, O’Leary,” interrupted the 
 general, as he fixed his eyes on a countenance, where 
 the perpetual conflict of revived feelings, vague doubts, 
 and uncertain hopes, had made great ravages : “ you 
 are not well, my dear O’Leary.” 
 
 “ That’s it, plaze your honor, I am not well, surely, 
 sir,” said O’Leary, eagerly, “ and thinks, betimes, that 
 it’s the lycanthropia I have got, which Maister Cam- 
 den saith was common to the ancient Irish.”* 
 
 “We will talk this matter over to-night, O’Leary,” 
 said the general, answering the impatient beckon of 
 Lord Adelm’s hand ; “ or to-morrow, or at no distant 
 period : and you shall be well again, O’Leary, and be 
 gay and contented, as I first found you, in the midst 
 of your learned disciples ; and you shall change your 
 scene, too : you shall travel with me to other coun- 
 tries ; and then you will return to Ireland, and finish 
 your genealogical history of the Macarthies, and dedi- 
 cate it to that very ancient, old Countess of Clancare, 
 in whose favor you were so eloquent to-day ; and by 
 all means get her picture if you can, for your title 
 page ; I promise you it will sell your book.”

 With these words, gayly pronounced, he left him 
 whom they had cheered, before he had time to reply ; 
 and, joining the impatient Lord Adelm, they pro- 
 ceeded along the shore together. 
 
 There was a magic in the name of the Macarthies 
 that operated like a spell upon the ideas and feelings 
 of O’Leary, and drew him from the remembrance of 
 his own griefs. It now had its wonted effect ; and 
 O’Leary, as he left the castle gates, with his usual 
 ghost, heavy step, and his hands clasped behind his 
 back, murmured to himself: 
 
 “My genealogical history of the Macarthies, in 
 troth ; and never tould me a word since he came of 
 the Ogygia of the great O’Flaherty, nor the Histoire 
 cCIrlande , by Abbe MacGeoghegan : how could he, 
 and he in jeopardy of the Crawleys ? And my 
 codices sent to the Lord Deputy, that’s the Lord 
 Lieutenant; and troth, I think they’ll astonish him. 
 And the Bhan Tierna, after all, at the castle of them 
 Dunores, after keeping out of their way, and then cir- 
 cumventing the Crawleys : ay, ‘ still on the necks of 
 the Butlers,’ Dioul ! and carrying off the great lady 
 to herself, when its what she couldn’t help appearing 
 before her ; and letting himself be taken, and turning

 And to see her standing in the midst of them Boddie

 scraws and briers that have sprung up in a night sai- 
 son, like mushrooms.” 
 
 While O’Leary was thus soliloquizing his w T ay to 
 the Dunore Arms, where a crowd was assembled, re- 
 lating and listening to the extraordinary events that 
 had taken place at the castle, the two adventurous 
 fellow-travellers were pursuing their walk up and 
 ! down the sea-shore. Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, occu- 
 pied with himself and his own views, as those usually 
 are who have long engrossed the world’s attention, 
 and have become the spoiled children of society, was 
 eager to pour the confidences of his self-love into his 
 companion’s patient ear ; and, taking his arm, as they 
 passed through the postern gate, he entered at once 
 upon the history of his feelings, and of his life, since 
 they had parted at Court Fitzadelm. 
 
 “ I am ordinarily but little influenced,” he observed, 
 “ by the ebb or flow of joy or sadness, which govern 
 the capricious tide of human affections in the every- 
 day children of the world ; yet I am glad, sincerely 
 glad, to see you here : glad that it may be in my 
 power to return some part of the hospitable rites 
 which, as a stranger, I received at your hands ; and 
 happy that my timely presence has been the means 
 of saving you from at least a temporary incon- 
 venience, and rescuing you from some intrigue of my 
 mothers friends, the Crawley’s, which might have in- 
 volved you in transient vexations, though eventually 
 they must have fallen of themselves into insignifi 
 cance.” 
 
 “ I am not quite so certain of that,” returned Gen- 
 eral Fitzwalter ; “had they succeeded in shutting me 
 up at the present moment, they might have crossed

 me in pursuits, to myself at least, big with import- 
 ance. They might have succeeded in throwing sus- 
 picion on my character, which, at a future moment, 
 might have invalidated my testimony when all but 
 honor will be at stake. Their motives of action are, 
 however, still a mystery.” 
 
 “ To me it seems impossible,” replied Lord Adelm, 
 “ that you could come into the sphere of intrigue of 
 these reptiles. The admiral of the gallant fleet of 
 Martingaria, the general-in-chief of the guerilla troops 
 of the mighty Cordilleras, a warrior, a patriot, in a 
 word, you in the power of the Crawleys ! This is a 
 solecism not easily understood, and 
 
 ‘ Comes not within the prospect of belief.’ ” 
 
 “ You measure my character by the elevation of 
 the great regions in which it was developed ; and as- 
 sociate me personally with the glorious cause in which 
 I was involved. But how came you by these facts ? 
 Where did you learn that the commodore of the Li- 
 brador had once commanded the little fleet of Martin- 
 garia, or had been distinguished by an higher com- 
 mand among the cloud-imbosomed Cordilleras ?” 
 
 “ Where ?” repeated Lord Adelm, with animation, 
 “ and how ? Why may not I have my Egeria, or my 
 daemon, as well as another ? for if I obtained not my 
 information through superhuman agency, faith, I know 
 not how I got it, or came by it.” 
 
 “ You speak enigmas.” 
 
 “ I have lived in them of late.” 
 
 “ And the sphinx who has presided over them is 
 still, I suppose, Mrs. Magillicuddy,” said Fitzwalter, 
 ironically. 
 
 “ Not exactly,” replied Lord Adelm dryly, “ except

 Mrs. Magillicuddy be a sort of petite-viaitresse sphinx, 
 fanciful and elegant as she is mysterious and power- 
 ful : one, for example, wdio traces 4 thoughts that 
 breathe, and words that burn,’ upon paper that 
 blushes roses and smells of them ; one who takes for 
 her device, love depriving flowers of their thorns, 
 and for her motto, 4 Sou utile ainda que briccando .’ ” 
 
 The general started : and Lord Adelm, producing 
 a small embroidered letter-case, took from it three 
 billets, written on rose-colored paper, and literally 
 breathing odors. The seal and motto, to which he 
 pointed, were no strangers to the general’s eyes. 
 
 44 I might,” he continued, 44 show you the contents 
 of these billets ; for with the exception of a few de- 
 tailed facts, they are vague and mysterious as Delphic 
 oracles, but that I hold them sacred to the very mys- 
 ticism they profess. In style they are almost too 
 fanciful, light, and delicate, even for a woman's dicta- 
 tion, though at the same time in substance obscure as 
 diplomatic ciphering. In short, I am lost in wild con- 
 jecture.” 
 
 44 Oh ! I see Queen Mab hath been with you,” ob- 
 served the general, laughing. 44 Are you, then, become 
 a devotee to a more philosophical sect than the school 
 of faery, one of the illuminati, the invisible brothers, 
 the fratres roris cocti , whose communion is confined 
 to sprites, sylphs, and gnomes, and whose secret of 
 all human good lies in the essence of concocted 
 dew ?” 
 
 44 ISTa y, you may laugh as you will; but I hold the 
 principles of the Rosicrucian philosophy in high re- 
 spect. Whatever elevates the imagination, whatever,

 ence, unites us to a spiritual world, shakes off th^ 
 dross of mere humanity, purifies and refines our na- 
 ture ; and is at least a glorious illusion. I do not, I 
 confess, blush to own myself the dupe of those high- 
 wrought dreams of physical possibility which inspired 
 Numa in his grotto, or Socrates in his cell ; and I 
 wish not, at this moment, to dissipate the impression 
 that there may, that there does exist for me, some 
 creature of ether and light, some legitimate child of 
 the spheres, which, always invisibly nigh, watches 
 over my sunless life path, throwing a ray over the 
 heart’s dark desolation, and shining upon the ruins of 
 memory, like the gleam that now falls upon that tot- 
 tering pile before us.” 
 
 “ It talks well : but one real lovely woman is worth 
 it all,” said the general, reddening as he spoke, from 
 the energy of his feeling : “ but your invisible sylph, 
 if sylph you will have her, seems to me a malicious 
 little imp, and more like the 1 shrewd and knavish 
 sprite called Robin Goodfellow,” than a delicate 
 serial ; for she has led you a dance 
 
 1 Over hill, over dale, 
 
 Through bush, through brier, 
 
 Over park, over pale, 
 
 Through flood, through fire,’ 
 
 without any apparent object in her agency, if it be 
 not to amuse her own splenetic gaiety, or to work 
 upon your imagination.” 
 
 “ Of you, at least,” said Lord Fitzadelm, “ whether 
 gnome or sylph, or woman, she merits well ; for you 
 are the object of her special protection.” 
 
 “ I !” said the general, starting — “ indeed !” 
 
 “ Judge for yourself. Of three billets received

 from my lovely invisible (for lovely she must be, 
 whether mortal or sprite), one led me from Portugal 
 to Ireland, by informing me of my mother’s intrigue 
 to smuggle me ben gre , malgre into the borough of 
 Glannacrime ; another fixed my residence in the 
 neighborhood of Kilcoleman, by announcing it the 
 native region of my guardian spirit (where, by-the- 
 bye, I vainly waited her brilliant apparition), and the 
 third urged my instant departure for Dunol*e, by in- 
 timating that my travelling companion, General Don 
 Fitzwalter, the illustrious South American chief, was 
 about to become the victim of the loyal suspicions of 
 the petty despots of the place. I was not surprised 
 to find that you belonged to history, and immediately 
 hastened to your assistance ; too late, indeed, to warn 
 you of your danger ; but, I trust, in time to avert its 
 consequences.” 
 
 “ This looks like magic, indeed,” said the general, 
 after a moment’s pause. u I had no reason to suppose 
 I was known to any human being in this country, 
 where I have concealed my name, profession and title. 
 But I can only be an object of interest to this power- 
 ful spirit inasmuch as she supposes me your friend. 
 It is you whom she has led from Portugal to Ireland 
 through the solitudes of the Galtees, amidst the shades 
 of Court Fitzadelm : it is for you that she has called 
 spirits from the vasty deep, in the questionable shapes 
 i of Mrs. Magillicuddy and Mr. Owny. She had pro- 
 vided you a lodging, too, in the neighborhood of Du- 
 nore, in case she found it necessary to preserve your 
 incognito; and by this arrangement I have profited; 
 for my host, O’Leary, till he saw us together, insisted 
 on my being Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, and as such re-

 ceived me for his tenant, which he would not other- 
 wise have done.” 
 
 The general, as he spoke, was occupied in search- 
 ing among some papers for the mysterious letter 
 which had preceded his arrival in the priory. “ Here,” j 
 he said,. “ is a letter from your sylph, not, however, 
 breathing and blushing roses, but written in human 
 characters on a material substance, and respiring turf 
 smoke. O’Leary, who is a Rosicrucian in his way, 
 insists that it came from ‘ the good people,’ the de- 
 signation of Irish faery.” 
 
 Lord Adelm took the letter in surprise, and read it 
 with emotion. “ It is,” he said, “ the writing and the 
 seal. May I keep this letter?” he asked, after a 
 pause. 
 
 “ Oh, certainly,” replied the general, carelessly, “ it 
 does not concern me : you, of course, will find out 
 who this invisible agent is, and then ” 
 
 “That is not so certain,” interrupted Lord Fitz- 
 adelm, she wraps herself in impenetrable seclusion, 
 throws a veil of mystery over her motions as over 
 her person, and in her fanciful epistles, though there 
 is much to excite wonder, there is nothing to feed 
 hope, further than the interest she takes in me.” 
 
 “ Interest, indeed ! but you cannot for a moment 
 consider this adventure in any other light than as 
 a mere bonne fortune , however singularly it has been 
 conducted.” 
 
 “ Oh ! there is a satiety in that thought, in that 
 term at least; and, to confess the truth, I do not 
 wish to 4 dull the delight of this mystic union by ex- 
 ploring its cause,’ or assigning it a motive or object. 
 
 I love to think that in the pauses snatched from the

 tedium of society I may inhale the sigh and listen to 
 the song of this nymph of the air, as I caught the 
 one on the ruins of Holycross, and hung upon the 
 other amidst the desolation of Court Fitzadelm ; for 
 I am convinced of her presence on both occasions, 
 and believe that our communion is divine, and that 
 our alliance will become immortal.” 
 
 “ And I,” said the general with warmth, “ I would 
 not give up the idea of this invisible correspondent 
 being a woman, a true devoted woman, were I in 
 your place, to be an object of adoration to a 1 world 
 of spirits.’ Were I the object of such zeal, vigilance 
 and devotion, had I called forth such talent, spirit and 
 ingenuity, I would not long remain ignorant of my 
 
 I invisible guardian. I would force my way through 
 the mystery which conceals her, I would follow her 
 from pole to pole, over alps and oceans, or remain 
 fixed and rooted to the spot she inhabited ; woo her, 
 
 win her, cling to her, cherish her ” 
 
 “ And marry her,” interrupted Lord Adelm, yawn- 
 ing. 
 
 “ Marry her !” repeated the general in a tone as if 
 some sudden association of ideas were abruptly 
 awakened by this proposition ; then, after a pause, he 
 asked abruptly — “ what do you think of that pretty 
 but extraordinary looking Lady Clancare ? Her ap- 
 pearance was altogether sudden and singular.” 
 
 “ Oh ! she struck me to be a mere minaudiere ! 
 some stale engouement of my mother’s, who came in 
 this extraordinary way upon the scene merely to 
 make a sensation, and startle back Lady Dunore into 
 a faded prepossession. You may trust me on the 
 score of my mother’s fancies. This wild Irish peeress

 has been one of the lions, I suppose, of a London 
 season, has been exhibited for her brogue, or her 
 howl, or shown off as 4 the lady whose father was 
 hanged in the rebellion.’ My mother, who is one of 
 the reigning autocrats of fashion, brings people into 
 vogue upon her own emotions, as the old Duchess of 
 G. did upon a fiddle-string; and w T eeps or wonders 
 them into notoriety, as her grace danced them into 
 ton. This Lady Ciancare has 4 fretted her hour upon 
 the stage,’ and was heard no more; and she now 
 issues from her own castle, a prisoner with her own 
 consent, into ours ; merely to get up a scene, and oc- 
 casion a rechauffe in my capricious mother’s 4 promptly 
 cold affections.’ ” 
 
 44 She seems, however, to have succeeded, for she 
 carried off Lady Dunore, even from you, who were 
 so little expected, so freshly arrived, and so raptur- 
 ously received.” 
 
 44 Oh ! that is quite my mother. She is an excellent 
 person in her way ; but in her engouements her feel- 
 ings are — 
 
 ‘ Momentary as a sound, 
 
 Swift as a shadow — short as any dream.’ 
 
 Be not you, therefore, misled by her favor. You are 
 made to win it ; but even you will find it 4 sweet but 
 not pearmanent.’ ” 
 
 44 I shall not remain here to put her ladyship’s sta- 
 bility to the test. I expect my little vessel round by 
 the first fair wind, and then I am off.” 
 
 “No, no,” interrupted Lord Fitzadelm, “you do 
 not mean that. You will not leave me here with 
 dawdling dandies, and cast coquettes ; for, save my 
 excellent uncle Daly, and Eversham, w r ho, though a

 coxcomb, is a perfect gentleman, the whole set-out at 
 Dunore Castle is, I saw at a glance, perfectly detesta- 
 ble ; but that I am spellbound here, I would fly off 
 with you to South America to-morrow.” 
 
 u And your election ?” * 
 
 “ I have not even thought of that yet. If I am re^ 
 turned, however, I shall pursue my own course : if I 
 am worsted, I shall be left to follow it ; but all de- 
 pends upon how my mother stands implicated : what 
 is done cannot be undone : for the present, however, 
 other objects touch me more nearly.” 
 
 The castle bell now intimated the hour for dress- 
 ing ; and Lord Adelm, urging the general’s quick re- 
 turn, subjoined an ardent request that he would take 
 up his residence at the castle, while his business de- 
 tained him in the neighborhood. 
 
 This Fitzwalter, with his wonted tone of decision, 
 promptly refused. He insisted upon their original 
 stipulation, Avhich had guaranteed mutual and perfect 
 freedom of action. 
 
 “ How necessary it is to me,” he continued, “ your- 
 self shall judge.” He paused for a moment, placed 
 himself between Lord Adelm and the postern gate, 
 at which he was about to enter, and with a low voice, 
 and rapid but emphatic enunciation, he continued — 
 
 11 1 am here in this neighborhood for the purpose of 
 recovering my birthright, of which, in my boyhood, 
 
 I was fraudulently bereaved. I am here for the pur- 
 pose of dispossessing a powerful family of princely 
 property, title, honors, and influence of vast extent, 
 which, but for my unexpected reappearance on the 
 scene, would in right be theirs. To effect this, the 
 testimony of the lowly, and proofs in possession of

 the illiterate and the prejudiced, are necessary. My 
 agents lie amongst those, purchasable by their po- 
 verty, or assailable by their simplicity. My oppo- 
 nents are among the great, the powerful, the noble, 
 and the wily. Vigor, promptitude, perseverance, and 
 secrecy, are the arms given me to contend with. 
 Judge, then, how necessary to my views are perfect 
 freedom, obscurity of position, and disengagement of 
 mind. I am here collecting witnesses, whom I dare 
 not trust with the secret of their own evidence. 
 Brought forward in society in this country, I should 
 come into contact with those *whom I am bound not 
 to injure (for I come but to claim my rights), but to 
 dispossess : it may be to receive their hospitality in 
 the common intercourse of the world, or to awaken 
 suspicion by rejecting it. I might, perhaps, too, so 
 ally myself to some one interesting member of that 
 family, who, united to me by blood, and endeared to 
 me by splendid qualities, would eventually weaken 
 my efforts in the cause of justice, general as well as 
 personal : in a word — ” he stopped abruptly ; his 
 eye darkened, his under lip trembled, and his silence 
 was that of strong emotion, — a seeming struggle be- 
 tween the impulse of a generous frankness and the 
 caution of necessary prudence. 
 
 “ Pray go on,” said Lord Adelm, impatiently : 
 “your story interests me and he seated himself upon 
 an abutment of the rampart, forgetful of the time, the 
 place, of everything, but the extraordinary person 
 who stood before him ; and who now, like a creature 
 restored to its native element, was energized by strong 
 passion, and animated by emotions best adapted to 
 his nature and existence.

 “ In a word, then,” 1 continued the general, firmly, 
 and after a pause, “ such a person as I have described 
 exists ; and I have suddenly but decidedly resolved 
 to make him, who must chiefly suffer by my claims, 
 the sole confidant of my strenuous efforts to estab- 
 lish them ; to relate to him a story which will cover 
 those nearest to him with ignominy, and tend to de- 
 prive him of the greatest objects of the world’s am- 
 bition. Imagine how highly I think of the honor and 
 the spirit of this person, of the truth of his character, 
 of the elevation of his mind, of the disinterested 
 generosity of his nature.” 
 
 “ Before heaven, I would rather be that selected 
 person,” said Lord Adelm, impetuously — “ I would 
 rather merit and obtain such proofs of esteem, confi- 
 dence, and admiration, than possess the highest sound- 
 ing titles, which eventually await me, or lord it over 
 these rich domains, which must one day be mine.” 
 
 “Would you?” exclaimed the general, catching 
 his extended hand in a grasp of iron : “ would you — ” 
 he stopped short ; a slight convulsion passed across 
 his countenance, and, suddenly letting fall the hand 
 he so firmly held, he added — “ But you shall hear my 
 story : I will confide to you events, and names blasted 
 by those events, which names have (under feelings of 
 indignation, stifled, indeed, but not extinct) long lain 
 deep buried in my heart. In my person, justice has 
 been set aside, right overthrown, nature’s holiest ties 
 violated ; my nearest kindred have been my deadliest 
 foes, and the legal guardians of my youth have torn 
 me from my natural position in society, exposed me 
 to misery, to slavery : through them I have been 
 bought and sold like a beast of burden; through

 them — •” he paused abruptly : he clenched his hands 
 with a violence that proceeded from acute and pow- 
 erful feeling seeking vent in physical sensation, acute 
 even to pain ; then, with a flashing eye, and an illu- 
 minated countenance, he added— “ But it is passed ; 
 and I have asserted all the rights of man, recovered 
 and protected them for myself and others ; I have 
 broken the chain of oppression, wherever I have 
 found it galling the oppressed ; I have fought my way 
 to glory and success : and now, I trust, I come to il- 
 lustrate the name I claim, to add to the splendor, not 
 to darken the brightness, of hereditary nobility. 
 
 This, however, is no moment ” 
 
 “ Yes, yes,” said Lord Adelm, catching his enthusi- 
 asm, and borne away by the energy and rapidity of his 
 manner, “ go on ; this is the time.” 
 
 “ Will you,” said General Fitzwalter, after a long 
 pause, “ will you trust yourself to-night in my lodging 
 among the ruins of Monaster-ny- Oriel ?” 
 
 “ To-night ! at what hour ?” 
 
 “ The tide will be out at midnight : by taking the 
 strand, you will reach the friary in less than twenty 
 minutes.” 
 
 “ At midnight, then,” said Lord Adelm, shaking the 
 hands of his companions ; and, for the first time in his 
 life, interested in the details of a story of which he 
 was not himself the hero ; for till this moment he had 
 never been associated with one whose high qualities 
 and superior endowments assimilated with his own. 
 
 The dressing bell had now ceased to ring ; and the 
 new, but firm friends, parted for the moment.

CHAPTER XIII. 
 
 “ Rong6 de fiel, et bouffi d’orgueil.” 
 
 As the judges were to proceed on their journey 
 early in the evening, dinner had been advanced by 
 nearly an hour earlier than the ordinary time ; and 
 the last bell had rung before any one had descended 
 to the saloon. The judges alone were impatiently 
 observing the gradual refrigeration of soups, fish, and 
 piles, as the party dropped into the dining-room, one 
 by one. Lord Adelm and General Fitzwalter were 
 among the last. They came in together, and all were 
 standing in expectation of the entrance of the marchio- 
 ness, when a servant presented a note to Lady Geor- 
 giana. 
 
 “ Oh !” said Lady Georgiana, as she finished a few 
 lines, written with a pencil on a bit of twisted paper, 
 “ here is a note from Lady Dunore : she desires me 
 to offer apologies to all for her absence, to take the 
 chair, and to say that she will join us at the dessert. 
 She dates from Castle Macarthy, the seat of Lady 
 Clancare.” 
 
 Some smiled at this last intelligence, and some 
 looked sad : among the former were Lord Frederick 
 and Mr. Daly : the latter were exclusively compo&ed 
 of the Crawleys — all took their places at the table. 
 The presence of the servants prevented the turn the 
 conversation would otherwise have taken from the

 circumstances of the morning ; and the dinner passed 
 off with a heaviness, which not even some occasional 
 flashes from Baron Boulter could enliven. Lord 
 Adelm, with his habitual look of haughtiness and ah- i 
 straction, sat silent and reserved. Judge Aubrey 
 talked only in a low voice with General Fitzwalter, 
 who sat next him. The Crawleys, formal and con- 
 strained, scarcely concealed the chagrin and vexation 
 under which they labored. Lord Frederick mur- 
 mured soft nonsense and satirical remarks into Lady 
 Georgiana’s “pleased ear.” Mr. Heneage was too 
 fine, Earl Rosbrin and Mr. Pottinger too busy to 
 speak, while the absence of Lady Dunore’s vivacity 
 was evinced by the general quietude of the table, 
 which was solemn and dull as any fashionable dinner 
 of extreme London bon-ton could have been. 
 
 The announcement of the judges’ carriages before 
 Lady Dunore’s return, and while the fruit was upon 
 the table, induced the whole party to rise, and ad- 
 journ a la francaise, to coffee and the drawing-room ; 
 and Mr. Daly, shocked at the want of all propriety 
 in his niece towards her high judicial guests, endea- 
 vored to apologize for her absence by jokingly re- 
 marking that she had fallen into the thraldom of some 
 enchantment; and that he did not doubt that the 
 pretty Lady Clancare was some “ Irish night-tripping 
 fairy,” who had carried her off, for special reasons, 
 known only to the high court of faery. 
 
 “ By-the-bye,” said Lord Frederick, “ I should like 
 to be better acquainted with that same Lady Clan- 
 care, who chose to be made a prisoner, just pour 
 s'cgayer ! Does no one know anything about her ?” 
 
 “Not a great deal, I believe,” said Miss Crawley,

 eagerly and pointedly, “ at least in this neighborhood, 
 my lord.” 
 
 “ More than is good,” muttered old Crawley; while 
 Lady Georgiana, not perhaps quite satisfied with Lord 
 Frederick’s inquiries, replied : 
 
 “ Oh, you must have seen her last season in Lon- 
 don. Lady Dunore showed her off for a night or 
 two, and took her from old Lady Newbank, who 
 picked her up, as she picks up odd people, and old 
 China, nobody knows where.” 
 
 “ What does she do?” said Lord Frederick, sipping 
 his coffee. “ Is she one of the ‘ Guitararie the ‘ Tu 
 mi C llamas' ladies, who thrum’d us to death, when 
 Spain was in vogue? i Et Dieu salt la racier ie que 
 c'etoit? Or does she play the 1 devil ?’ or is she a 
 waltzer, or a quadriller ? or does she invent Chinese 
 puzzles ? or make mottoes and draw trophies, or what ?” 
 “I think she was brought about for writing books,” 
 said Lady Georgiana, languidly, “ as well as I remem- 
 ber.” 
 
 “ Writing books !” re-echoed Lord Frederick in a 
 tone of alarm : “ you don’t really mean that ?” 
 
 “ Not absolutely books, I believe, but tales, stories, 
 something about Ireland, and Spain, and South Ame- 
 rica. I almost forget what ; but I fancy people 
 thought they were very amusing and odd.” 
 
 u De tout mon cceur said Lord Frederick, “ I have 
 no objection. But with respect to ladies that write 
 | books, l en tout , et par tout, je quitte la par tie? It’s a 
 j pity, too ; for she’s a pretty, odd, shy, sly-looking con- 
 ! cern enough. But really Lady Dunore’s bringing a 
 live author down to us, a porte fermee , as we are liv- 
 ing at present, is too bad ; and the worst of all au-

 thors, a noble author. ’Tis petty treason, against all 
 ease, comfort, and enjoyment. Has she a husband 
 belonging to her, do you know ?” 
 
 “ Oh dear, no,” said Miss Crawley, eagerly. “ She 
 is a peeress in her own right — he ! he ! he ! She has 
 nothing belonging to her ; she is a very independent 
 sort of person and she laughed affectedly. 
 
 “ In fact,” said young Crawley, “ we know nothing 
 of the lady whatever, except that such a person came 
 down to this neighborhood two years ago ; took an 
 old ruined mansion, called Castle Macarthy, in the vil- 
 lage of Ballydab, passed herself as the granddaughter 
 and heir of old Denis Macarthy, commonly called the 
 titular Earl of Clancare, who died in Dublin in jail about 
 that period ; and with no other inheritance than an 
 old greyhound, and no other proof of the truth of 
 her story than her own assertion, entered at once 
 upon a scheming course of litigiousness, broke some 
 leases, and——” 
 
 “ Took my illigant mountain of Clotnotty-joy from 
 me,” interrupted old Crawley, despondingly. 
 
 The pathetic tone in which this was pronounced 
 excited some mirth ; and Mr. Daly observed, “If, then, 
 she breaks leases, and made good her claim to Clot- 
 notty-joy, there can be no doubt, I suppose, that she 
 is the personage she asserts herself to be.” 
 
 “There is none whatever,” said Judge Aubrey, 
 who had sat silently listening, while Baron Boulter 
 went to the stables to look after a favorite mare, rid- 
 den by his crier ; “ there is none whatever. I have 
 had opportunities cf knowing something of this young 
 lady; but I did not know before that she labors under 
 the odium of writing books ; for there is certainly no

 personification of authorship about her — no preten- 
 sion whatever.” 
 
 “ And that’s the pity of it,” said Lord Frederick: 
 “ there is, on the contrary, an odd mixture of the shy 
 and the comic in her countenance, that one would 
 think pretty if she was not an author.” 
 
 “ Comic !” interrupted old Crawdey, gradually re- 
 suming his wonted tone of spirits, by mere force of 
 temperament, while his eye occasionally turned on 
 the stranger with a look of doubtful anxiety, as if 
 some vague, unsatisfied suspicion still lurked in his 
 mind — “ Och ! she’s comical enough — a little too 
 comical, like Paddy Mooney’s goose, full of fun, and 
 nothing to play with.” 
 
 The coarse vulgarisms of Mr. Crawley always ex- 
 cited unrestrained mirth in the finer part of the so- 
 ciety at Dunore Castle; and Lord Frederick laugh- 
 ingly replied : 
 
 “ I should like them to know Mr. Mooney’s goose 
 most particularly ; for I vote fun the best thing alive ; 
 li and if your Lady Clancare has this talent in common 
 with Mr. Mooney’s goose, I believe I should almost 
 be inclined to pardon the possession of others, even 
 though they went as far as writing books, Pray, is 
 this literary peeress in her own right rich ?” 
 
 “ Rich !” said young Crawley, “ nobody knows how 
 she exists ; and people laugh at her pretention to 
 rank. The person last bearing the title of Clancare 
 died abroad without issue ; and in Ireland titles are 
 so frequently claimed by pauper pretenders, that little 
 j attention is paid to such events : we had, not long 
 since, a basket-boy a viscount, and a turf-'cutter a 
 1 baron.”

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “ The statement which appeared respecting the ex- 
 tinction of this title was incorrect,” said Judge Au- 
 brey; “ for although the former Earl of Clancare died 
 in Italy without issue, yet a representative of that 
 title was found to exist, in the person of the late Mr. 
 Macarthy, whose lineal ancestors were included in 
 the general attainder of the Catholic peers who sup- 
 ported James the Second in the war of the Revolu- 
 tion. These attainders, however, have, with a few 
 exceptions, been reversed, L sat upon the Clancare 
 cause, which terminated in the success and the ruin 
 of the old chieftain. He obtained his title, which de- 
 scends in the female line, but died, as Mr. Conway 
 Crawley states, a few days after in prison, where he 
 had. been detained for costs. Since that event, I have 
 had the pleasure of once meeting Lady Clancare upon 
 an occasion that did equal honor to her heart and her 
 head. She interested herself in the fate of a person 
 condemned to perpetual incarceration, S under the 
 shameful Irish by-law called a 4 rule of bail.’ He is 
 now gaining an honest livelihood, and runs a chaise 
 and pair of his own, I understand, on some of the by- 
 roads between Cork and Kerry. Every one knows 
 Owny, the Rabragh* and is glad to employ him; for 
 he occasionally realizes all that has been said of the 
 shrewdness and humor of an Irish postillion.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter and Lord Adelm exchanged 
 glances of significance. 
 
 “ A little hanging would do him no harm for all 
 that, with great deference to your lordship,” said old 
 Crawley ; “ for there was neither pace nor quiet while 
 
 * An Irish scholar translated this term for me — a “ hearty 
 fellow it in fact means a rustic “ gay Lothario.”

 he was in the barony, setting up the fairs and patterns 
 after they were put down by milithary law, and burn- 
 ing me in elegy, and thinking a beau maison of him- 
 self, as the French says, at the hurling matches, with 
 his white shirt sleeves and green ribbons.” 
 
 “ I aln glad of it,” said Mr. Daly ; “ and I wish 
 with all my soul we had more rabraghs. The Irish 
 peasantry are not only more indigent than they w^ere 
 forty years ago, but they have lost much of the gaiety 
 and cheerfulness of spirit which set sorrow at de- 
 fiance. Their wakes and fairs, patterns, and Sunday 
 evening cake, are almost wholly laid aside : these, and 
 the hurling matches, that noble, athletic, and national 
 sport, are quite gone by. I remember as if it were 
 but yesterday, fifty years back, heading the Leitrim 
 boys against the Kerries, who were led on by old 
 Florence Macarthy, the very grandfather of this Lady 
 Clancare, in a hurling match between the counties. 
 Macarthy won the match, and more than the match, 
 for he won the heart of the pretty Honor O’Connor, 
 the toast of the two provinces, who he afterwards 
 married, and who, with all the reigning beauties of 
 the day, followed the fortunes of the contest.” 
 
 “It warms one’s old blood,” continued Mr. Daly, 
 starting up with animation, “even at seventy-three, 
 to think of the native energy, force, and spirit of the 
 genuine Irish character; and it chills it,” he added, 
 with a sigh, and retaking his seat, “ when one thinks 
 upon the means which must have been employed 
 within the last thirty years to weaken and turn it 
 from its natural bias. I doubt, sir,” he added, turn- 
 ing to General Fitzwalter, “ that had you remained

 those great qualities in this devoted country, which 
 have obtained for you, elsewhere, the epithet fcf the 
 Liberator, and have enabled you in a land of strangers 
 to fight your way to high command, and higher con- 
 sideration.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter had given to the details of this 
 desultory conversation that animated and earnest at- 
 tention which betokens deep interest. Thus person- 
 ally addressed, he replied, with the abrupt frankness 
 of one who rather courts than shuns observation : 
 
 “ I am an Irishman, sir, and have long been an exile, 
 but not from religious proscription (for my family 
 were of the master cast), but by circumstances con- 
 nected with the political state of the country; turned 
 adrift upon the world without compass or rudder, 
 without a home to love, friends to cherish, or a conn 
 try to defend or serve, I became by necessity a com- 
 moner of nature ; and unfettered by the distinctions 
 of clime, country, or kindred, I have early claimed 
 alliance with all who suffer, whatever might be the 
 region they inhabited. 
 
 “ The chances which threw me on the shores of 
 America brought me early in life in contact with 
 Don Narino> It was my good fortune to share his 
 dungeon in Santa Fe, his escape to Europe, and his 
 mission to England. I accompanied him also in his 
 venturous return to New Grenada, where, backed by 
 English protection, he again risked his life in his 
 country’s cause. Proscribed, marked out for de- 
 struction, pursued, discovered, taken, he expiated the

 tertained by the British ministry for separating- Terra Firma

 crime of patriotism by a long series of misery and in- 
 carceration. Narino has since appeared before the 
 world in all his original splendor ; and I, in common 
 with many of my gallant countrymen* have contin- 
 ued to follow the standard of liberty, from the mo- 
 ment it was openly unfurled among the mighty re- 
 gions of the Cordilleras.” 
 
 “ Borne it, not followed it,” said Lord Adelm. 
 
 “ The stranger,” said Fitzwalter, “ who risks his 
 fortune in a foreign land on general principles of 
 right and liberty, usually becomes the favorite of the 
 more interested partizans. I have, therefore, occa- 
 sionally led, as well as followed, in almost every part 
 of Spanish America, where the glorious impulsion of 
 freedom has been given. In a late action, more than 
 half the corps I commanded were massacred in a pass 
 of the Cordilleras ; for the war of Spain against Amer- 
 ica is named,, even by the Spaniards, a 1 war of death.’ 
 As their chief, I was reserved for torture, and for an 
 ignominious death. It was a romantic event, that 
 one of the guards, placed over me, had in early life 
 done me an injury that weighed heavily on his con- 
 science. He took this moment for reconciling him- 
 self with heaven, released, and fled with me. I es- 
 caped from the Caraccas to Demerara, where, through 
 the channel of the public papers, an event of great 
 personal interest accidentally reached my knowledge, 
 which the remoteness and occupation of my scene of 
 action, together with my more immediate incarcera- 
 tion, prevented me from sooner learning. This event 
 has brought me to my native country : and though 
 as an Irishman I should, on general grounds, lament

 the circumstances which introduced me to the castle 
 of Dunore, jet upon principles of personal gratifica- 
 tion, I am not sufficiently disinterested to regret 
 them. n 
 
 This brief sketch of autobiography was thrown 
 off with a frankness and energy of manner that gave 
 it singular effect, and bestowed upon it all the evi- 
 dence of truth, and "all the graces of modesty, while 
 it obtained for the brilliant and singular narrator an 
 admiration variously felt and expressed. 
 
 “ Go on, General Fitzwalter, go on,” cried a voice 
 from the door : “ you have no idea how you remind 
 me of Koskiusko, when I went to see him in London, 
 lying wounded upon a sofa. You racontez so like 
 him ; doesn’t he, Georgy, love ? I must say, after all, 
 that patriotism and freedom are things that always 
 sound delightfully.” 
 
 This speech drew every eye to the spot from 
 whence it proceeded ; and Lady Dunore appeared, 
 leaning her back against the half-open door, conceal- 
 ing the figure of Lady Clancare, whose dark eyes 
 were just seen peeping over her shoulder. 
 
 The ladies had entered thus far unobserved, for 
 the company sat with their backs to the door, at the 
 moment when Mr. Daly had addressed General Fitz- 
 walter ; and Lady Dunore, who loved to hear every- 
 thing about every one, and loved it the more in pro- 
 portion as events were extraordinary, stood spell- 
 bound while the general spoke, as forgetful of her 
 “dear delightful judges” as if they had never existed. 
 They were now, however, recalled to her recollection 
 by the entrance of Baron Boulter, bearing the intel- 
 ligence that all was ready for their departure ; and

 Lady Dunore, translating the reproachful look and 
 shake of her uncle’s head, came forward with a mul- 
 titude of apologies for her absence, many anxious en- 
 treaties that they would prolong their stay, and as 
 deep-formed wishes that they would return, with all 
 their wives and all their children, to pass some time 
 at Dunore, where she was going to have private 
 plays and a chapel of ease, and Lady Clancare, and 
 perhaps more trials. 
 
 The judges, however, seemed perfectly satisfied 
 with the trials they had already witnessed; and 
 Baron Boulter, as spokesman, received and returned 
 her ladyship’s compliments with all the ardor and 
 earnestness with which they were made. The judges 
 were then conducted to their carriages, by Lord 
 Adelm and Mr, Daly, and departed. 
 
 Lady Dunore now led, or rather forced forward, 
 the really, or affectedly timid Lady Clancare, who, 
 with the manner that resembled the graceful awk- 
 wardness of a pretty but froward child, still held 
 back. Lady Dunore, heated and dishevelled, was 
 still in her morning dress, with her sautoir de cashmir 
 rolled round her head, and a gray cloak of Lady Clan- 
 dare’s on her shoulders, exhibiting a most sybil-like 
 appearance. Lady Clancare, on the contrary, had 
 exchanged her coarse unbecoming costume of the 
 morning for a black Spanish dress and mantilla, which 
 were then still in fashion. 
 
 Lady Dunore, whose eyes were fixed upon her new 
 protegee with delight and admiration, now turned them 
 on the company to observe the effect she had pro- 
 duced, and at last fixed their eager glances upon Gen- 
 eral Fitz waiter, with an expression which, if not

 attributable to her wonted extravagance., was wholly 
 untranslatable. There was in this intense stare a 
 hope, a fear, something expected, something dreaded. 
 General Fitzwalter, whose eyes, like those of the rest 
 of the company, were turned on Lady Clancare, in 
 mere curiosity, at last met those of Lady Dunore. 
 For a moment they returned her fixed look, till red- 
 dening under the intensity of her gaze, he turned 
 away, and picking up a screen, which lay at Georgi- 
 ans feet, he seized on this little act as an opportu- 
 nity for addressing her. Lady Dunore whispered 
 something to Lady Clancare, who smiled, and threw 
 down her eyes ; and Mr. Daly, entering with Lord 
 Adelm, was commencing his attack on his inconse- 
 quent niece, when Lady Dunore, impatiently putting 
 her hand on his mouth, interrupted him with : “ There, 
 there, I know all you would say, all any one can say, 
 on the subject j if I have done wrong, I bring my ex- 
 cuse in my hand,” and she drew forward Lady Clan- 
 care. 
 
 “You could not bring forward a fairer,” said Mr. 
 Daly, with an air of gallantry; “and had I been so 
 tempted, I, too, should have so sinned, I fear, though 
 the whole bench of bishops, and all the judges of the 
 land, had been making claims on my attention. I 
 had the honor,” he added, addressing Lady Clancare, 
 
 “ of knowing your ladyship’s venerable grandfather, 
 some short half-century back. He was not very ven- 
 erable then : he was, indeed, of a race of men, in sta- 
 ture, look and character, now almost passed away in 
 this country — we shall not look upon their like again.” 
 
 Lady Clancare bowed to this recollection of her 
 grandfather; and though she spoke not, there was

 375 
 
 something passed across her countenance, which in- 
 duced Mr. Daly to take her hand, under pretence of 
 leading her to her chair; and he felt (or he fancied 
 he felt) a gentle pressure of his, which he returned 
 with an ardor that did not quite belong to seventy- 
 three. 
 
 “ Oh ! for line men,” said Lady Dunore, throwing 
 herself into an arm chair, “ I think they are really 
 quite extinct with us altogether. You know, Georgy, 
 love, we were observing at the opera, the last night 
 we were there, that we thought all the heirs of the 
 great names were pigmies. There is nothing coming 
 now at all like the Dukes of A. and H.— , the Mar- 
 quis of A — , and the old Earl of E — , in his corona- 
 tion robes, and that sort of thing. But with respect 
 to those magnificent creatures that once used to meet 
 in London, I think all that sort of thing now is con- 
 fined to the patriots, that is the Poles, and South 
 American chiefs. Don’t you think so, Georgy, love ?” 
 and she turned her eyes on General Fitz waiter. 
 
 To get rid of the awkwardness of this pointed 
 compliment, which evidently distressed its object, 
 Mr. Daly addressed General Fitzwalter with some 
 observations on a country where he had played so 
 distinguished apart. u South America,” he observed, 
 “ is well known to us in the Spanish histories of its 
 early discoverers, but it is only now become an object 
 of interest through the exertions of those States, 
 which are seeking to shake off that yoke which had 
 almost deprived them of a place in the history of na- 
 tions ; the impulse, however, must have been given 
 long since.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter replied : “ The oppression and

 cruelty of the colonial legislatures had excited, even 
 as far hack as the middle of last century, events, 
 which seemed remotely to prepare a new destiny for 
 a population of fourteen millions of its inhabitants. 
 To a torpid acquiescence of three centuries succeed- 
 ed a gathering tempest, kindling resistance. The 
 spirit of freedom, once vivified, rapidly brightened 
 into flame, shining from North to South; and the 
 period soon arrived when every American heart 
 beat in unison under its influence. Internal divisions 
 may render this conflict long and uncertain ; but the 
 cause belongs to humanity ; it springs from the laws 
 of nature and is inevitable ; it is borne along by the 
 spirit of the age and the progress of illumination, 
 and it must finally succeed.” 
 
 “ To be sure it must,” said Lady Dunore. “ Don’t 
 you think so, Georgy, love ?” 
 
 “ For my part, I don’t know,” said Conway Craw- 
 ley, with his brogue and his effrontery, “ what par- 
 sons mean about giving liberty and independence to 
 au uninformed race, defined by one of the Spanish 
 fiscals as creatures destined by nature to work like 
 moles in the mines. We have all read the solemn 
 declaration of the consulado , or board of trade, in 
 Mexico, that the Indians are a race of monkeys, filled 
 with vice and ignorance; and they have extended 
 their remarks, I believe, pretty justly to the creoles, 
 or degenerate descendants of the first Spanish settlers.” 
 
 “ That, indeed, changes the thing altogether,” said 
 Lady Dunore, “ not but a race of monkeys must be 
 very amusing, and very mischievous. Don t you think 
 so, Georgy, dear ?” 
 
 u It was,” said Mr. Daly, u these same sagacious

 fiscals who ordered the olive and the vine to be rooted 
 out of Chili, to compel a commerce with the peninsula. 
 And it was in the bosoms of these American auto- 
 mata-,” he continued, “ of these monkeys, that the 
 British Government, in 1797, resolved to cherish the 
 spark of independence already awakened there.” 
 
 “ What is, generally speaking, the condition of the 
 lower orders ?” asked Mr. Da y, turning coolly away 
 from young Crawley, and evidently anxious to draw 
 out the general. 
 
 “ Borne down,” he answered, “ by long slavery and 
 injustice, the native Indian submits to his vexatious 
 + existence with an affected patience, a seeming apathy, 
 which veils the cunning and ferocity of the enslaved 
 and degraded in all countries. Everywhere the 
 slave exhibits the same vice, jargon, and policy ; and 
 it does happen that when a native Indian rises by 
 low arts to petty power, and becomes the alcade, the 
 magistrate, or loyal man of the colonial government, 
 supported by that government, he makes common 
 cause with his superiors, and adds by misrepresenta- 
 tions to the sufferings of his country.” 
 
 “Och! the thief of the world!” said old Crawley, 
 while his son changed color, for he felt the full force 
 of the remark. “ If we had him in Ireland, we’d 
 soon take away his commission of the pace from 
 him.” 
 
 A burst of good-natured laughter from Lady Clan- 
 care excited a pretty universal sympathy ; and young 
 Crawley, trembling with acrimonious emotion, con- 
 tinued : 
 
 “The South Americans are, by temperament, a 
 bloody and inhuman people. Their very religion is

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 a religion of blood. The Spaniards found them sac* 
 rificing human beings in their temples.” 
 
 “Yes,” interrupted Miss Crawley, “so we read in 
 the abridgment of the life of Columbus.” 
 
 “And there exists a sect,” said young Crawley, 
 ransacking his schoolboy erudition, “who preach 
 purification by blood. Such are the people who are 
 to overturn a Christian dynasty, a legitimate sover- 
 eignty, and talk of rights, humanity, and that sort of 
 trash, that one is sick of.” 
 
 “They are all naturally atheists, and deists, and 
 idolators,” said Miss Crawley, triumphantly. 
 
 “ Georgy, love, did you ever hear anything so 
 shocking ?” said Lady Dunore. “ How can any one 
 wish well to such a people. Mr. Heneage, bring mo 
 my eau cle luce bottle.” 
 
 “ Such facts,” said General Fitzwalter, “ are a 
 proof of the feebleness of the human mind. In all 
 parts of the world, atonement by human sacrifice ifc 
 the dogma of nations in their infancy ; because the 
 first religion of man is the religion of fear. He suf 
 fers more than he enjoys ; and he propitiates accord* 
 ingly” 
 
 “ But I believe,” continued the general, “ we must 
 not look too deeply into the history of man, whatever 
 region he inhabits ; it is a fearful and an humiliating 
 history ; and when backed by fanaticism, it is more 
 than ordinarily blood-stained and terrific. But let us 
 take him when we can, in his best aspect, free and 
 enlightened ; or so blessed by singularity of temper- 
 ament, so formed of happy elements, that, like the 
 mild Peruvian, he performs the rites of the heart, 
 whose incense smells to heaven, and heaps on his

 sunny altars the fruits and odors of his luxuriant 
 soil.” 
 
 “ How beautiful !” said Lady Dunore ; “ there is 
 nothing like those Peruvians, par exemple , and their 
 odors.” 
 
 “ Peruvians or Mexicans, they are all a detestable 
 race,” said young Crawley, “ unworthy of a better 
 government ; and any one who knows their history, 
 and has read their absurd mythology, their deluge of 
 Coxcox, and their— — ” 
 
 Lady Dunore, now a very violent South American 
 patriot, exclaimed — “Good heavens! General Fitz- 
 walter, I hope you are come to recruit here for your 
 grand cause. I dare say there are a quantity of 
 young men among our tenantry would go for noth- 
 ing at all ; don’t you think they would, Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “ Upon my credit, my lady, I can’t take upon me 
 to say,” returned Mr. Crawley, fearful that as he had 
 already bailed his own prisoner, he would next be 
 compelled to recruit in the cause of rebellion ; “ but 
 I don’t think they have any turn to fighting among 
 the negers ; and then, I suppose, it’s a good step off, 
 madam.” 
 
 “ Nothing to signify, my dear Mr. Crawley,” inter- 
 rupted Lord Frederick ; “ and provided you will take 
 the v command of the Ballydab and Dunore heroes, I 
 don’t care if I accompany you as a volunteer when- 
 ever you please to sally forth ; for I look upon it, Mr. 
 Crawley, that you are one of those ancient preux , 
 pour fendre giant 7 de rompre harnois , et porter en 
 croupe belles demoiselles sans leur parley de men" 
 
 “ Many thanks for your compliment, my lord,” said 
 old Crawley, believing Lord Frederick must be civil,

 as he spoke in French. “ I never was much given to 
 travel ; only oncet was going to Lisburn for my health, 
 after my sufferings on duty with the. yeomanry in the 
 rebellion of ninety-eight.” 
 
 “ To Lisburn, my dear Mr. Crawley,” said Lord 
 Frederick; “ is Lisburn the Montpellier of Ireland?” 
 
 “ Not at all, my lord; I mane Lisburn, the capital 
 cf Spain,” replied Mr. Crawley. 
 
 “ If I were twenty years younger, Mr. Crawley,” 
 said Mr. Daly, covering out the general titter by ad- 
 dressing its object, “ I should myself be tempted to 
 go forth. South America is the great stage upon 
 which the world’s eye is now fixed.”. 
 
 “A stage,” said Lord Rosbrin, shaking his head, 
 “ where every man must play his part, and mine a sad 
 one.” 
 
 “ See that now,’ said Mr. Crawley, “ and never 
 heard tell of it before, only the Yankee-doodles and 
 New York, and the likes.” 
 
 “ Man,” said Lord Adelm, starting up from a re- 
 verie in which he had indulged while leaning over 
 the back of Lady Georgiana’s chair, “ man, in what- 
 ever region he is found, may best be typified by a 
 squirrel in a cage.” 
 
 “A squirrel in a cage ! the Lord save us !” ex- 
 claimed Mr. Crawley, in astonishment. 
 
 “ His little sphere is so planned,” continued Lord 
 Adelm, “ that he can be nothing but what he is, do 
 nothing but what he does. He goes round his circle, 
 and repeats his rotations, with no difference in the 
 performance, but a little acceleration or a little retard- 
 ment. These South Americans but repeat an old 
 story : they are savage and unprotected, they are con-

 quered ; — they are slaves, and degraded, they en- 
 dure ; — they are pressed to the quick, they turn and 
 resist; — they struggle and succeed, — become great, 
 prosperous, illumined ; conquer and oppress in their 
 turn, moulder away, and leave to posterity the un- 
 heeded moral that in every clime, state, or being, man 
 is neither to be praised nor blamed, admired nor ab- 
 horred. He is what he is ; — otherwise he cannot be ; 
 for, after all, he is but an engine, a mere engine.” 
 
 “A steam-engine,” said old Crawley, shaking his 
 head, and anxious to agree with Lord Fitzadeim, of 
 whom he stood in awe ; “ sorrow a thing else.” 
 
 “ Faith, pretty much,” said Lord Adeim, with a 
 gravity none preserved but himself ; “ except that a 
 steam-engine has this superiority over him, that it is 
 neither susceptible of caprice nor distraction. It 
 turns, also, upon a beneficial principle ; while the 
 mainspring of the machinery of man inevitably turns 
 on evil.” 
 
 “ Evil to him as evil thinks,” re-echoed old Craw- 
 ley; “ honey swa key molly pause , as the French says.” 
 “ That’s not ill put, Mr. Crawley,” said Mr. Laly, 
 while everybody else laughed; “ but, my dear Fitz- 
 adeim, you, at least, admit the principle of good to 
 exist conjointly with that of evil. You will not es- 
 tablish a doctrine less consoling than that of the dark, 
 demoniac Indian mythology.” 
 
 “ Oh, I deny good as a principle altogether,” said 
 Lord Adeim: “good is merely relative, evil is posi- 
 tive. Evil is necessary to man, as the air he breathes ; 
 - an inherent part of his existence : deprive him of his 
 principle of evil, and he becomes a vegetable.”

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “ A vegetable !” repeated old Crawley ; “ see that 
 now.” 
 
 “ Evil is the source, end, and object of the pas- 
 sions ; or, to give them their proper names, the appe- 
 tites. It is the grand agitator of life, its food and 
 occupation; without evil, there would be neither 
 genius, virtue, nor valor ; for what is virtue but an ef- 
 fort against vice ? What genius ? — the nisus to over- 
 come suffering. What valor? — the necessity of mas- 
 sacre and bloodshed.” * 
 
 “ Christ save us !” exclaimed Mr. Crawley. 
 
 “ What is ambition? — the selfish wish of rule. 
 What friendship? — helplessness. What love? — a 
 want. Whence arise the liberal professions, but from 
 the innate tendency of man to evil ? The whole busi- 
 ness of life, then, is but one sustained effort against 
 evil; and without evil, in a supereminent degree, 
 skill, wisdom, virtue and courage, could not be de- 
 veloped, because they would not be called for. Tak- 
 ing, then, a just view of things, there is little to move 
 either our wrath or our admiration. He who feels 
 little and digests well — he who has a bad heart and 
 a good stomach — is, after all, the true sage and the 
 happy man.” v 
 
 Here Lord Adelm was interrupted by a servant, 
 who gave him a note. It filled the room with per- 
 fume, and covered Lord Adelm’s face with blushes, 
 warm as the hues of the paper he perused. Every 
 one smiled as he hurried away ; and though the estab- 
 lished laws of bon-ton prevented the slightest notice 
 being taken of this incident, Mr. Daly could not help 
 saying with an arch smile — “ So much for the philo- 
 sophy of indifference.”

 il Philosophy !” repeated Lord Rosbrin, laying 
 down his play-book : 
 
 “ There never yet was found philosophy 
 Could bear the toothache patiently.” 
 
 The quick eye of Lady Dunore had rested on the 
 face, and observed the emotions of her son. Her 
 feelings of maternity had been so little influenced by 
 his return, that, the first pleasure over, which surprise 
 always occasioned in her, she had not been induced 
 to retire with him for a single half-hour since his arri- 
 val, but had been quite satisfied with the few words 
 he had said to her in the hall, stating the motive of 
 his journey to have been his wish to preside at his 
 own election. His sudden emotion and exit now 
 seized on her imagination. She was not yet ex- 
 hausted by the events of the day ; and after strug- 
 gling for a moment in contest with her own feelings, 
 she arose and followed him. 
 
 The servant who had delivered the note met her 
 in the hall ; but to her inquiries whence it had come, 
 the answer was, it had been left in the porter’s lodge, 
 and had come from the post-house. 
 
 Meantime, Mr. Daly had ordered the brag table ; 
 and while the party stood waiting for Lady Dunore 
 to join them, Lord Rosbrin proposed reciting “ Col- 
 lin’s Ode on the Passions,” which was by common 
 consent overruled, in favor of his imitations of the 
 favorite actors of the day. With Miss Crawley’s 
 scarf bound round his head, a casbmir of Lady Geor- 
 giana’s wound round his body, a row of candles 
 placed at his feet, and the company circled around 
 him, he gave a very close imitation of some of the

 best modern tragedians, in the parts of Othello, 
 Richard III., Macbeth, and Hamlet, successively. 
 The imitation was, indeed, so faithful, that it not only 
 rendered look for look, and tone for tone, but every 
 inflection, gesture, and grimace was preserved pre- 
 cisely the same as in the original he copied. 
 
 The exhibition, so well adapted to the idle and the 
 gay, as combining (what the great love) amusement 
 and ridicule, had so entirely occupied the minds of 
 the audience, that nearly two hours had been passed | 
 in recitations, accompanied by bravoes and encores, 
 without Lady Dunore’s protracted absence becoming 
 a subject of notice to her preoccupied guests. When 
 at last she returned to the drawing-room, her counte- 
 nance was disturbed ; there was a cloud on her brow, 
 and her cheek was stained with tears. 
 
 The lights on the floor, however, the turbaned 
 head, and draped figure of Lord Rosbrin, operated 
 as talismans on her oppressed spirits. He was com- 
 manded to go over the course again, and was again 
 rewarded with vociferated bravoes, and hysterical * 
 laughs, until Lady Georgiana observed that both 
 Lady Clancare and General Fitzwalter had disap- 
 peared during the representation. 
 
 “ Gone ! and together ?” asked Lady Dunore, 
 starting up in emotion ; “ when, where, how ?” 
 
 “ Together ! n repeated Lord Frederick. “ On crie 
 a la scandale /” 
 
 Lady Dunore repeated her question, but no one 
 could give any answer. While Lord Rosbrin had 
 strutted his hour, none had eyes or ears but for him ; 
 and the marchioness, in an agitation no one could un- 
 derstand, left the room.

 “ There she goes, like a skyrocket,” said Lord Frede- 
 rick. “ I should like to know her impulsion.” 
 
 “ If her ladyship means to watch the extraordinary 
 disappearances of Lady Clancare,” said Miss Craw- 
 ley, “ she will have something to do. x Her stealing 
 away with General Fitzwalter was, however, a strong 
 measure, if this w^as their first acquaintance.” 
 
 “ You don’t mean that, my dear Miss Crawley,” 
 said Lord Frederick, with a significant look. “If 
 this little shy thing has had an illustre foiblesse , we 
 must forgive her authorship.” 
 
 “ I don’t wish to say anything injurious of the 
 pseudo Lady Clancare,” said Miss Crawley, “ but it 
 will certainly surprise the people of consequence in 
 this neighborhood when they hear of her being re- 
 ceived at Dunore. She has now T just returned from a 
 mysterious disappearance of some months.” 
 
 “ Oh ! you are raising her cent, per cent., my dear 
 Miss Crawley,” exclaimed Lord Frederick ; “ if you 
 prove this Irish Sappho is a Sappho, head, heart, and 
 all, you redeem her to all intents and purposes.” 
 
 Lady Dunore now re-entered, her countenance 
 brightening into smiles. “ It is very extraordinary,” 
 she said, “ that none of you could tell me Lady Clan- 
 care went away twenty minutes before General Fitz- 
 w alter, wdiich I find is the case.” 
 
 • “Are we your lady’s keeper ?” asked Lord Fred- 
 erick. “ But, marchioness of my. soul, what is your 
 extraordinary anxiety about these new godsends, w T ho 
 seem to have arrived here for the sole purpose of 
 keeping up the ebb and flow of your solicitude ? 
 Your secret, lady ! Pray ‘ let me not burst in igno- 
 rance.’ ”

 “ Secret !” said Lady Dunore, laughing : u why 
 should you think I have any ?” 
 
 “ Well, then, Lady Clancare’s secret ; for we know, 
 as Rosbrin would say, only he is now too tired to say 
 anything, you ‘ could a tale unfold ;’ and Miss Craw- 
 ley has just been giving us some hints of Vaimable 
 sceleratesse of your Irish peeress. In short, it seems 
 that the inhabitants of our good city of Dunore do 
 not visit her.” 
 
 “ And does Miss Crawley presume,” said Lady Du- j 
 nore, turning full upon the shrinking Miss Crawley, 
 
 “ does Miss Crawley presume to throw a breath of 
 slander upon a friend of mine, to talk over in village 
 commerage a person of Lady Clancare’s rank and 
 celebrity ? ’ 
 
 “ I assure your ladyship,” said Miss Crawley, pale 
 with mortification and fear, “ I did not say — did not 
 mean ” 
 
 “ No, no,” said Lord Frederick, half amused with 
 the consternation he came to relieve, “ they are ra- 
 ther my surmises than Miss Crawley’s assertions, who 
 merely hinted that 
 
 1 Lips, though lovely, must still be fed,’ 
 
 and that if this lady were not fed by the gods with 
 nectar and ambrosia, her mode of existence was a 
 mystery, if not a miracle, unknown to any one.” 
 
 “ Yes,” said Lady Dunore, triumphantly, “ there is 
 a miracle and a mystery in Lady Clancare’s retreat 
 from the world ; but its secret is known to one per- 
 son, and I am that person, for the rest you may trust 
 me. I would not present in my own exclusive circle 
 one who was not in all points comme il faut. One 
 thing, however, I must generally observe to you all,

 good people : Lady Clan care must not be obtruded 
 | on ; she receives no visits from either sex ; admits no 
 strangers; and I alone have obtained permission oc- 
 casionally to join her in her solitude. Meantime, I 
 stand pledged that no constraint shall be put upon 
 her movements. She is to have free ingress and 
 egress, a plaisir , at Dunore Castle, and is to creep in 
 and creep out like a pet kitten, as she expresses it, 
 1 without let or molestation.’ ” 
 
 “ But, dear love,” said Lady Georgiana, as she dealt 
 round the cards with sparkling fingers, 11 your kitten 
 I will at least pur a little, 1 hope, for us. Do you know 
 she was not the least in the world entertaining to- 
 night ? ” 
 
 “ Well !” said Lady Dunore, “ don’t judge her 
 hastily; leave her to time and to me.” She looked 
 oracularly mysterious as she spoke, cut in as Mr. 
 Heneage cut out ; and having convinced the com- 
 pany she had some profound secret in her keeping, 
 and won fifty pounds from old Crawley, she retired 
 to bed at three in the morning, in great elevation of 
 spirits, repeating to Lady Georgiana, as they parted 
 > on the corridor : 
 
 “Well, after all, sweetest, there is nothing like 
 these wild, barbarous, rebellious countries, par exem- 
 pt e ; and gay as we are now, and amused as we are 
 with all these judges, and Padreen Gars boys, and 
 Peruvian chiefs, and things, there is no saying but 
 we may be all murdered before morning,” 
 
 With this consolatory reflection, she kissed the 
 forehead of her sleepy, smiling friend, and retired.

CHAPTER XIV. 
 
 — For I will tell you now 
 
 What never yet was heard in tale or song, 
 
 From old or modern bard, in hall or bower. 
 
 Milton. 
 
 General Fitzwalter had alone observed the re- 
 treat of Lady Claneare. There was something in 
 the popularity which she enjoyed as Bhan Tierna, 
 something in her story, as the representative of an 
 illustrious but ruined family, something in her sud- 
 den and unexpected appearance in the hall of Du* 
 nore, which, taken' together, and contrasted with her 
 youth, her very feminine person, unprotected state, 
 and extreme reserve, powerfully interested him. He j 
 had once or twice also, as he stood opposite to her, 
 met her eyes, and they were not eyes to be met 
 with impunity ; nor were their glances less impres- 
 sive from being suddenly and bashfully withdrawn. 
 Still he fancied that he could trace something sinis- 
 ter in her looks ; and the singular mobility and intel- 
 ligence of her peculiar countenance were strangely 
 opposed to her timid and unbroken taciturnity, leav- 
 ing it doubtful which was her natural habit, the re- 
 serve of a recluse, or the acuteness of a practised 
 observer. 
 
 While, therefore, General Fitzwalter pursued his 
 way along the strand, he continued to puzzle himself 
 in the research after the cause of her attraction (her

 389 
 
 attraction for him at least, for, after the first surprise 
 of her appearance, she seemed to have excited little 
 interest in others) ; he at last summed it all up in her 
 eyes. He had somewhere met such eyes before; 
 and whichever way he now turned his own, whether 
 upon the stars, which seemed to start from the hea- 
 vens like wandering fires, or downward upon their 
 fairy reflection in the smooth ebb tide, still the full, 
 dark, and fixed eyes of Lady Clancare were before 
 him. 
 
 He had not proceeded many paces from the ram- 
 part wall of the castle when Lord Adelm overtook 
 him. 
 
 “ You are an hour before appointment,” said Fitz- 
 walter, “ for the castle clock now tells eleven.” 
 
 “ How could you remain so long among these tire- 
 some people ?” returned Lord Adelm, petulantly. 
 
 “ I came away as soon as decency would permit. 
 I waited for the return of Lady Dunore.” 
 
 “ She had not then returned when you came 
 away ?” 
 
 “ Not to the drawing-room; but I heard her voice 
 in the gallery as I passed through the hall.” 
 
 “You can have no idea how she has crossed my 
 way to-night,” said Lord Adelm, in a tone of vexa- 
 tion ; “ you saw me receive a note ?” 
 
 “Yes, most appropriately. It produced in your 
 countenance a refutation of your doctrine ; and elo- 
 quently proved that mind is not wholly dependent on 
 a 1 good stomach and a bad heart’ for its happiness.” 
 
 “ Yes, I felt I was showing up most confoundedly. 
 But the circulation is still stronger than that moral 
 mover we call reason, which, after all, means nothing,

 but more or less of temperament. You guess who 
 the note was from.” 
 
 “ Certainly, by its hue and odor.” 
 
 “ W ell, she who has led me here, has followed me 
 here, or rather has preceded me.” 
 
 “ And where is she ?” 
 
 “ Perhaps bedded in that rock, or, for aught I 
 know, perched on the wing of the sea breeze that 
 whistles by us. N ow imagine, if you can, a contre 
 terns like this. The prettiest little French billet, en- 
 closed in an envelope, which bore the postmark of 
 Dunore, summoned me to a rock under the castle ter- 
 race, called the Hag’s Tooth. I was to come alone ; 
 not before ten, nor after eleven ; this was the only 
 stipulation: 1 was to be astonished — this was the only 
 promise. I found the spot with some difficulty. All 
 was solitary and silent ; not even the rippling of the 
 wave, nor the sigh of the gale. I had been at my 
 appointed post but a few minutes when I perceived a 
 female form, gliding like a sea-nymph over the glit- 
 tering sand, light as air, and rapid as light. The 
 dupe of my heart, or my hopes, or what you will, I 
 stood spell-bound. Had I beheld a vision descending 
 from the clouds, it could not have held more influence 
 over my imagination. I had scarcely power to 
 breathe, to stretch forth a hand to clasp that which 
 was presented to me. — I did, however, clasp it.” 
 
 “ Then it was a mortal hand, true flesh and blood, 
 after ail ?” interrupted the general, eagerly. 
 
 “ It was,” said Lord Adelm, stamping his feet, 
 and grinding out his words : “ it was my mother’s 
 hand.” 
 


## p. 391 (#397) ############################################

FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 391 
 
 “Then the promise of astonishment was at least 
 fulfilled.” 
 
 “ Lady Dunore, it seems, had herself received a 
 note,” continued Lord Adelm, “ advising her to 
 watch my steps this evening. I half suspect it was 
 some trick of those delectable Crawleys. She follow- 
 ed me out : I was annoyed, bored beyond all expres- 
 sion, and not over guarded in concealing my feelings, 
 a scene often repeated ensued between us. I con- 
 demned and contemned her interference upon all oc- 
 casions: she reproached, retorted, and wept; then 
 grew hysterical as usual ; and in this way I conducted 
 her home. Trembling with apprehension and solici- 
 tude, I again issued forth, when that petite evaporce , 
 my mother's new Irish caprice, appeared in the por- 
 tico, getting into her mule cart. I had now to make 
 a second retreat, and saw her take the strand road 
 with such feelings of patience and pleasure as you 
 may suppose. At last, literally speaking, the coast 
 was clear, and I bent my steps towards the rock of 
 my disappointed hopes ; for there I found only this 
 black handkerchief, or scarf, a token of my ill luck, 
 and an indication, of course, that my sylph had been 
 true to her appointment, and had kept it, while I was 
 conducting my mother home. Now what think you 
 of all this ?” 
 
 “ Think ! why, that your sylph is some devoted 
 woman; so ingenious, so zealous in her devotion, 
 that did there exist for me such a being ” 
 
 “ I have examined the handkerchief,” interrupted 
 Lord Adelm, “ and I should think there was magic 
 in the web of it; but that it bears a sign to conjure 
 away all magic : a red cross is embroidered on its

 centre ; it is, too, of Spanish manufacture, of true 
 Barcelona workmanship.” 
 
 “ ’Tis altogether most strange, most romantic, and 
 most flattering,” returned the general, thoughtfully, 
 as they proceeded arm in arm, and in silence, each 
 apparently wrapped in profound musings, till they ar- 
 rived beneath a sweep of irregular and massive cliffs, 
 above which, dark and indistinct, rose the ruins and 
 cemetery of Monaster-ny-Oriel. 
 
 The pathway to the coast, cut centuries back by 
 the monks, and the round-topped, perforated cross, 
 which they had raised at its entrance, to the honor of 
 St. Peter, the fisherman, and as a landmark to dis- 
 tressed mariners, still remained. The friends as- j 
 cended this rude, rocky avenue by a flight of steep, 
 unevenly hewn steps, piled on either side with a stra- 
 tum of human bones (a gloomy order of architecture 
 not unusual in the ancient burying grounds of Ire- 
 land), and terminating in a circular and spacious man- 
 dra (13). The night was still and dark; a few stars 
 only glimmered in the cloudy firmament. 
 
 The peculiar genius of Lord Adelm was well 
 adapted to scenes and seasons characterized by images 
 gloomy and fantastic as his own morbid fancy. He 
 paused frequently in his wearisome ascent, while his 
 more active companion strode on rapidly before him : 
 and when he had reached the summit of the rocks 
 which formed the site of the monastic ruins, he 
 halted, and looked around him. The scene was wild, 
 desolate and silent — rocks, ruins, remote mountains, 
 bounding the land view; while the steep Atlantic 
 spread wide and dark, and lost itself in the distant 
 clouds.

 u These are scenes,’ 5 said Lord Adelm, “ that trans- 
 port us beyond the present, that bear us into regions 
 of thought and feeling, beyond all mean ambition and 
 human cares.” 
 
 “ They are better adapted to prelude the tale I 
 would unfold to you,” said Fitz waiter, impressively. 
 
 “ Your story !” said Lord Adelm, in a tone of recok 
 lection (for over the mirror of his imagination reflec- 
 tions passed rapidly; and it was only now he recol- 
 lected the purpose for which he accompanied his new 
 friend to the Friary of St. John’s at an hour so un- 
 seasonable) — “ Oh ! ay, I had half forgotten your 
 story.” 
 
 They now ascended the spiral stairs of the tower, 
 O’Leary , from above, held forward a lamp, whose 
 light produced uncertain shadows upon the dark 
 damp wall ; but when he perceived by its flickering 
 ray that his guest was accompanied by Lord Adelm 
 Fitzadelm, he started back, then came again forward, 
 and drew up against the doorcase to let them pass, 
 changing the lamp to his left hand, that he might 
 make the sign of the cross on his breast with his 
 right, as a sort of exorcism, on an event which, to his 
 confused and wandering mind, appeared little less 
 than miraculous. He then followed them into the 
 room, where a fire had already been kindled in the 
 open hearth ; the candles also stood ready lighted ; 
 yet, under various pretences, he lingered in the 
 , apartment, occasionally coming forward with the 
 snuffers, and snatching hasty and anxious looks at 
 the two gentlemen, who were already seated at a 
 little deal table, both leaning on their elbows, both 
 earnestly conversing in Spanish. O'Leary, as he

 gazed on them with a half-murmured exclamation; 
 crossed himself devoutly, and made new causes for 
 delay; till the general, telling him that he had no 
 further occasion for his services that night, perempto- 
 rily desired him to retire to rest ; he then slowly re- 
 treated, and was twice called back to shut the door 
 before he obeyed. 
 
 The morning after this midnight interview, O'Leary, 
 at an hour later than usual, entered the apartment of 
 the general to attend at his toilette and breakfast. 
 He found him, however, asleep, in Friar O Sullivan’s 
 great chair, w T here he had left him seated the night 
 before, and his bed had not been occupied. His re- 
 pose was so profound that O’Leary had rekindled his 
 turf fire, and got ready his dressing things, without 
 awakening him. But the heavy pacing about the 
 room, and murmured ejaculations of the pedagogue, 
 at last aroused him from his slumber. 
 
 “ I’m afeard I put the sleep astray upon your 
 honor,” said O’Leary, with an anxious look. 
 
 “ It is time, I believe, to rise, O’Leary, is it not ?” 
 said the general, starting up, and shaking off his 
 “ obedient slumbers,” as one accustomed to snatch 
 repose, when, where, and as he could, and to dismiss 
 it at will. 
 
 “ To rise !” said O’Leary, shaking his head, “ and 
 your honor not in bed, gineral, the whole live long 
 night, sir !” 
 
 “ How do you know that, O Leary ?” 
 
 “ How do I know it ? Why, the day was breaking 
 on the Atlantic, plaze your honor, when I saw the 
 young lord going down the rock, there, and you 
 looking after him from the top of the Friar’s Leap,

 as it is called : and wonders but he’d be afeard to be 
 wandering his lone that way in the country. It’s lit- 
 tle his father, Baron Gerald, would dare it, great a 
 i Calebalaro’* as he was ; for he was a sould man, sir, 
 from the time he planned the ruination of young De 
 Montenay ; and it’s only for him your honor would 
 be alive and hearty this day ; not all as one — that’s 
 his own nephew I mane ; and when I saw you both 
 seated cheek by jowl last night, and my Pacata Hi- 
 bernia between yez, it minded me the ,last time I seen 
 the two brothers at Court Fitzadelm together ; it was 
 a little time after the Honorable Gerald had married 
 the great English lady, th’ ould marchioness that is 
 now, and who came over his lone to Ireland. They 
 were seated together in th’ oak parlor, that's the two 
 Tiernas, with a tankard of claret, and a bottle of 
 brandy to qualify it, between them. I was only 
 called in about a date, being then at the court, and 
 corned to see the child; for the rumor was, he was 
 going to be carried to Dublin by his uncle : and his 
 mother only buried the week before ; and the Tierna 
 Dhu handed me a glass of wine, saying, pleasantly, 
 he believed I’d rather the whiskey.’ 7 
 
 “ I’m afraid,” said the general, smiling, who was 
 preparing for a sea-bath before he went to breakfast, 
 “ I’m afraid, O’Leary, that preference still clings to 
 you ; and I was sorry when I looked in on you this 
 morning, to find you sleeping in your clothes, with a 
 bottle of spirits half consumed by your side. This i3 
 not the way to recover your health and compose your 
 mind, O’Leary.” 
 
 M And did your honor look in on me ?” said 
 
 * Cavalier.

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 O’Leary, in a softened tone. “ And never feltf you 5 
 gineral, dear ; for when I went to my truckle I fell 
 asleep like a rock, sir. But as to the whiskey, sir, 
 you need not fear it, and only laves it by way of two- 
 milk- whey at my bedside ; for whiskey, plaze your 
 honor, is so qualified in the making, that it dryeth 
 more, and inflameth less, than other hot confections. 
 It showeth age (saith the philosopher), and helpeth 
 youth; it reviveth the heart, lighteneth the mind, 
 quickeneth the spirits, keepeth the veins from crump- 
 ling, the bones from aching, and the marrow from 
 soaking. Musha ! it’s the elixir of life, and only for 
 it, i’d be dead long ago. For when the world de- 
 serted me, that staid by me ; and when I lost joy else- 
 where, sure it’s there I found it, sir.” 
 
 O’Leary had pronounced this eulogium on his fa- 
 vorite beverage as he followed the general down the 
 rocks to a little creek, or basin, which was always suf- 
 ficiently full to afiord a bath ; and then, having left 
 him his dressing-gown, at his desire he went back to 
 prepare his coffee. When the general returned, and 
 had seated himself at the breakfast-table, with a book 
 in his hand, as he was wont, O'Leary, who attended 
 him, took his place in a window-seat, at a respectful 
 distance. He drew forth an old tattered volume, 
 which for a few minutes fixed his attention ; but, ha- 
 bitually wandering and unsettled, his rapid eyes 
 glanced frequently from his studies to the general, 
 who, like himself, seemed incapable of giving a conti- 
 nued attention to the book, which he held open in 
 his hand. O’Leary, perceiving that his guest had 
 laid down the volume, and leaned thoughtfully on his 
 f A common Irish idiom.

 elbow, closed also his own ; and, advancing to pour 
 out some coffee, observed : 
 
 “ I think, your honor, the memoir I am perusing of 
 the Fitzmaurices of Lixnow, a great branch of the 
 Geraldines, and Lords of Muskerry, would plaze you 
 intirely. Och ! it’s a great legend ! It’s done into 
 rhyme, sir, Irish rhyme, by a priest, who was confes- 
 sor to the family. The argument runneth thus : The 
 young Lord Thomas Fitzmaurice, of Lixnow, was in 
 foreign parts fighting against the pagans, when the 
 Barony of Muskerry fell to him by right. And, it 
 being reported that he was captured by the Turks, an 
 usurper, a bastard of the family, did forthwith start 
 up and seize his title and domains. And the Lord 
 Thomas, when the wars were over, would have re- 
 turned a beggar, but for his faithful fosterer, one J oan 
 Harman, sir, an ould Irish servitor of the family, mar- 
 ried to an English bowman. She was aged and in- 
 firm; but, when the rumor was spread of the devised 
 usurpation, she took ship at Dingle (then a great 
 port), and was landed in France, where the young 
 lord was at court, as became his nobility (having 
 changed the service of the Emperor of Austria for 
 that of the French king). And there Joan sought 
 him out, and made him acquainted with the ill tidings, 
 and brought him back without delay ; and saw him 
 cross the threshold of his own castle, and restored to 
 his fair possessions. And one calendar month, from 
 the date of her mission, as she foretold, she died ; 
 
 * being the day of the young lord’s investiture in his 
 [ancient honor. For I’ve heard tell the heart will 
 break with joy as well as sorrow; and shows the 
 room to this hour where Joan Harman died. Och !

 it would not grieve me a taste to be old Joan Har- 
 man this day, if it was the will of God ; for it’s re- 
 markable that affections of fosterage never weaken, 
 but 
 
 { Per longas invaluere moras.’ 
 
 And there was little use in making gossipping and 
 fosterage treason, by the famous statute of Kilkenny; 
 for they both only just flourished the more. 
 
 “ Now gossipred, or confraternity, plaze your 
 honor, was said to produce confederacies of actions 
 in all things, whether lawful or unlawful; but foster- 
 age proved an iron link to bind the affections for 
 laudable purposes, not only of the fosterers and fost- 
 ered, but of the friends and relations on each side ; 
 and it bound the Irishry to the English by descent : 
 as the O’ Callaghans to the Butlers formerly, and the 
 O Learys to the Fitzadeims to this blessed hour, do 
 you see, your honor.” 
 
 “ But,” said the general, throwing down his book, 
 which he had for a moment resumed, and rising in 
 agitation, to place himself opposite to O’Leary, who 
 had resumed his seat, but who now rose also — “ but, 
 O Leary, love and faith are not alone sufficient, where 
 there is a perilous confidence to place, where the 
 point at issue may be property, freedom, 1 life itself;’ 
 there must also be discretion, prudence, firmness, 
 vigilance, command of thoughts, of looks, of feelings, 
 and of language.” 
 
 As he spoke, O’Leary advanced step by step, but 
 trembling, and gradually folding and compressing his 
 hands, his mouth half open, his color livid, as if he 
 expected something he almost feared to learn. 
 “ 0 ; Leary,” continued the general, in a calmer voice,

 and throwing himself back in his chair, “ O’Leary,*^ 
 sit down, compose yourself, and hear me.” 
 
 O’Leary in part obeyed. He sat down, but his 
 composure was irrecoverable. He remained for a 
 few minutes silent. Suspense, hope, fear, almost to 
 agony, were pictured in his countenance ; while, with 
 a mechanical motion, he stooped to pick up a black 
 silk handkerchief which had fallen from his breast, to 
 wipe the cold drops that now bedewed his furrowed 
 forehead, and rolled down his colorless cheek. A 
 crimson cross worked in its centre caught General 
 Fitz waiter’s eye ; he started up, and snatched the 
 handkerchief from O’Leary’s hand. 
 
 “ How came you by this hankerchief?” he asked, 
 eagerly. 
 
 O’Leary, with a wild and wandering look, his mind 
 bent upon other objects, made an effort at recollec- 
 tion, then replied : 
 
 “ The kerchief, sir ? is it the kerchief with the cross 
 on it? Oh! plaze your honor, I did not mane 'to 
 purloin it, only return it, sir, to the right owner, 
 plaze God.” 
 
 “ And who is that ?” demanded the general, with 
 impatience. 
 
 “ Is it who owns it, gineral ?” replied O’Leary, en- 
 deavoring to recover himself. “ If it is not the Span- 
 ish- American nun, sir, owns it, one Madam Florence 
 Macarthy, I don’t guess who can own it ; that’s in 
 respect of the blessed and holy cross.” 
 
 “ Did you say Florence Macarthy ?” asked the gen- 
 eral, with great emotion, and in a voice scarcely arti- 
 culate — “ a nun from Spanish America?” 
 
 “ I did, your honor,” replied O’Leary in a low

 voice, as he contemplated with apprehension the 
 change which had taken place in the general’s coun- 
 tenance — u Florence Macarthy, sir, Did you know 
 her, gineral, in foreign parts ? Her father was son 
 to the ould Earl of Clancare’s brother. He went to 
 be made a merchant of in some of the West India 
 islands ; and was the first of the family that turned 
 his hands to business, which made a great noise in 
 the country ; and then he went into South America, 
 and joined the wars there, when they first broke out, 
 as I heard tell, and was killed, or died there ; I disre- 
 member me which. And his daughter, Florence 
 Macarthy, his only child, went into a convent, her 
 aunt being an abbess somewhere in Spain : so Father 
 O’Sullivan tould me. And when it was broke up by 
 the French army, who let loose the craturs, she fled 
 back to Ireland, to her people in her own barony, 
 which she had quit when a child ; and none was in it 
 left, only the Bhan Tierna, and one Mrs. Honor Ma- 
 carthy, called Honor ni Sancta , or Holy Honor, who 
 is the superior of ‘Our Lady of the Annunciation , 1 
 near the Abbey of the Holy Cross ; and when there 
 wa s a place vacant in the convent, which was soon, 
 Madam Florence Macarthy went to the convent, and 
 was brought there by the Countess, who has no voca- 
 \ tion that way, the little sowl, with her caencothar , as 
 her ould grand dadda used to call her curly black head ; 
 and the mouth and teeth of her, just like a young 
 hound’s, in regard of her red gums, gineral.” 
 
 A silence of many minutes succeeded to this in- 
 formation and accompanying digression of O’Leary’s, 
 who usually “ drew the thread of his verbosity finer 
 than his argument.”

 At last the general, who was walking up and down 
 the apartment in great agitation, stopped opposite to 
 O’Leary, and asked, “ Where did you find that hand- 
 kerchief? How came you by it ?” 
 
 “ How came I by it, sir, is it ? I came by it, sir, 
 when I was just creeping out for a mouthful of fresh 
 air, before dawn, this morning, and was looking up at 
 the light in your casement, gineral, and thinking there 
 must be shanaos* between you and the young lord, 
 would keep you up all night, and my foot caught in 
 this kerchief, sir, and I thought it was my own ; only 
 when daylight came I saw it was not, for, by the 
 cross marked on it in the centre, I thought it must be 
 Madam Florence Macarthy’s, in regard of the cipher 
 done in weeny red letters, sir.” O’Leary pointed to 
 the small f. m. in the corner as he spoke. “ But the 
 wonder of the world,” he added, “ is, what would be 
 bringing her here among the rocks, and she settled 
 down in her own convent in Tipperary County, sir, 
 and is to take the vow in the beginning of the month, 
 and a great sight it will be.” 
 
 “Did you ever see this Florence Macarthy?” asked 
 the general, after a pause, and standing opposite to 
 O’Leary, with his eyes fixed on him. 
 
 “ I did, gineral, often, when she was for a month at 
 Castle Macarthy, and afore she went into her convent, 
 and used to come down here to the great Macarthy- 
 More’s tomb in the monastery, and remained half the 
 length of the day on her knees before it. Och ! sir, 
 that’s the saint, if there’s one upon earth ; and it’s ex- 
 traordinary, but her cousin, oncet removed, Lady 
 Clancare would be taking a turn that way, too, — and

 she brought up in a convent, too, and never had a 
 calling, only laughing, and showing them white teeth 
 of hers, and circumventing the Crawley’s, and has 
 great learning and fine Irish, for all that, to say no- 
 thing of her being mighty comical.” 
 
 “ Does Miss Macarthy resemble her cousin, Lady 
 Clancare ?” 
 
 “ Why then, gineral, I could not well tell you that, 
 in regard of never seeing her face, only with a thick 
 black veil over it, and never showed it to sun or moon, 
 they say, barring Fra O’Sullivan, who confesses both 
 ladies” 
 
 The general now resumed his seat and book, re- 
 questing O’Leary to return to his school. 
 
 “ You may lay out my writing-desk, O’Leary,” he 
 added, “ and no ; don’t take away that handker- 
 
 chief; and pray shut the door after you : I wish to 
 be left alone.” 
 
 O’Leary sighed deeply, and laid down one writing 
 article after another ; at last, taking up a pen to mend 
 it, he observed : 
 
 “ I thought, gineral, when I was brushing your 
 coat yesterday, sir, and you dressing for the castle 
 dinner, that I heard you mintion a word of going 
 away in a day or two, if the wind was fair, sir ; and a 
 bit of a shij) coming into port of Cork ; and that — 
 and then — and I thought your honor said something, 
 sir, about the say sickness being good for my com- 
 plaint ; and that you was going to — — and the kerchief 
 then came in the way ; that's this morning, gineral, a 
 bit ago.” 
 
 “ And would you, O’Leary,” said the general, in a 
 voice of great kindness, “ would you leave your home,

 your country, to follow me, uncertain, as you must 
 : be, whom 
 
 “Would I?” interrupted O'Leary, with a burst of 
 emotion, in which consciousness and insanity seemed 
 to struggle for supremacy — “ would I ?” and he fell 
 at the general’s feet, and seized his hands, while his 
 tears fell fast. “Would I follow you, is it? Didn’t 
 I lose my senses for you ? Didn’t I leave home, and 
 i kin, and friends, to wander the world over for you, 
 when you werent in it? And now that you are be- 
 fore me, with your mother’s smile — see here, gine- 
 ral,” and he attempted a tone of firm composure; 
 
 " “ if you aren’t yourself, and would tell me that at 
 once, there would be an end of all; and I would be 
 what I was before I met you in the mountains, and 
 still would go on quietly, and would just, some fine 
 morning, lie down in the sun, like old Cumhal, and 
 ; die.” 
 
 The general, in irrepressible emotion, with difii- 
 ! culty released his hand from the maniac grasp of 
 O’Leary; then drawing from his breast an ancient 
 missal, he opened its clasps, and showed opposite to 
 one of its illuminated pages, two certificates of a 
 marriage and a birth. O’Leary seized the sacred vo- 
 lume, and kissed it eagerly and devoutly, with a look 
 of anxious recognition. The general hurried it back 
 : to his breast. 
 
 “ You stand pledged to God and to me, O’Leary,” 
 said the general in a deep and affecting voice. 
 
 O’Leary remained silent, but his lips moved rapid- 
 ly ; his eyes wandered wildly over the face that fas- 
 I cinated his gaze, till at last his clasp relaxed its firm- 
 ness, his eyes closed, and he would have fallen to

 the earth if the general had not received him in his 
 arms. 
 
 “ O’Leary, my old boy !” he said, bearing him to 
 the fresh air admitted at the open window ; and at 
 this well-remembered epithet, O’Leary, shaking off 
 his faintness, cried with a burst of hysteric laughter : 
 
 “ That's it ! that’s the voice I have heard in the 
 lone mountains by day and by night. They tould 
 me it was my fitch. My fitch ! oh, wirra !” and he 
 wept freely. Then suddenly drying his eyes, and 
 throwing their rapid glances over the face of Fitz- 
 walter, whose hand he still held, new lineaments 
 seemed to start forth to his recollection, and he con- 
 tinued to repeat : “ And there was a mole under the 
 curls of the left temple ; and axes your honor’s par- 
 don — yes, there it is; and the curls too, only far 
 blacker. Shoosheen used to call it the fairy’s lock, 
 because the world wouldn’t take the curl out of it ; 
 and weren’t drowned after all ; sure I said so. And 
 them transport ships off the coast, from Cork. And 
 how was it, gineral, dear? And the boat there, 
 turned upside down, when we went out to look for 
 you; and your foster-mother had sat up all night, 
 and had a warning. And not many nights she sat 
 up after — barring at her own wake, God help her; 
 and that was too much for any man ; and twenty- 
 two years ago ! and all that time never to claim 
 your own, nor just write one’s own foster-father a 
 line from foreign parts ; and so ready at the pen for- 
 merly, in respect of them themes and exercises !” 
 
 “ O’Leary,” said the general, in a firm and impos- 
 ing voice, “let it suffice that I live, and am here; 
 that I have returned to my native country with a

 name as distinguished, through my own exertions, 
 as that which I received from my forefathers ; a 
 name, too, not assumed, but inherited ; for, after the 
 ancient manner of my family, I have but given the 
 Norman prefix to my father’s baptismal appellation.” 
 O’Leary started, “Fitzwalter! Walter, the Black 
 Baron, and never thought of that. Och ! I’ve a poor 
 head now, and a beating in it that wears the life out 
 of me, by times. To be sure, Walter de Montenay 
 Fitzwalter; the ould Geraldine fashion evermore.” 
 
 “ For the rest, O’Leary, secrecy the most profound 
 of my present existence in this neighborhood is ne- 
 cessary. It is for the interest of many that I should 
 never reappear. My presence here, i’f even suspect- 
 ed, might endanger my life or liberty; besides, I 
 wish to avoid all publicity — to compromise rather 
 than contend, and to save the honor of my family, 
 by touching lightly on the crimes of one of its mem- 
 bers ; or, if possible, by burying them in eternal 
 oblivion.” 
 
 “ That’s the Honorable Gerald,” interrupted 
 O’Leary, “ the Marquis, and Lord Adelm’s father.” 
 
 “ It matters not whom, O’Leary,” said the general, 
 eagerly ; “ and now leave me for the present ; resume 
 your ordinary habits; be secret — be circumspect — 
 my life is in your hands ; but hold yourself in readi- 
 ness to depart at a moment’s warning. Had it not 
 been for a circumstance that has become accidentally 
 known to me this morning, I should have left this 
 country to-night, and even as it is, perhaps.” 
 
 “ To-night !” repeated O’Leary, who had moved a 
 few paces, but who still loitered at the door. 
 
 “ To-night. I must first, however, see the

 Countess of Clancare ; and I think I will try my for- 
 tune at her door in an hour hence.” 
 
 “ You will, sir !” said O'Leary, in astonishment. 
 “ See that — and in amity, plaze your honor?” 
 
 “ Certainly not in enmity,” returned the general, 
 smiling. “ But you seem surprised by my intention, 
 O’Leary.” 
 
 “No, plaze your lord- , your honor, I mane; 
 
 not a taste; for sure ’twas just the same anno 1821, 
 when the English by blood leagued with the Irish 
 mere, in the common cause, that’s ould Ireland, sir; 
 and enemies before, became fast friends sithence, as 
 Ayphraim against Menasses, and Menasses against 
 Ayphraim; and both united against the tribe of 
 Judah, that’s the Crawleys, sir, the land pirates! — • 
 and will step down and order your fine new charger 
 from Cork, sir, to be brought from the Dunore Arms, 
 and will put on my Sunday apparel, and mount 
 the little Kerry asturiones, and ride after your honor 
 in the capacity of an ecury as is right and fitting, 
 
 till your lord , till you have a better — — , and 
 
 will just induct Teague Rourke, my head Homer, 
 into the office of my coadjutor and assistant in the 
 seminary; that is, gineral, he’ll tache the classes, 
 while I’ll attind your honor.” 
 
 “No, O’Leary,” said the general, shaking his head, 
 “ that will never do. You must return to your 
 learned runagates, of whom I found you so justly 
 proud when I arrived here ; and if you do not wish 
 me to repent of the confidence I have placed in you, 
 you will in no respect change your wonted habits.” 
 “Then I’ll engage I won’t, sir,”, replied O’Leary, 
 emphatically ; “ and never will call you my lord, till

 the day of judgment — that is, till all’s proved ; and 
 your lordship, the great Marquis of Dunore (which 
 you are at this blessed moment), taking possession of 
 your castle ; for fortune, though she be portrayed to 
 stand upon a rolling stone, as being flighty by nature, 
 yet for the most part she helpeth such as be of coura- 
 geous mind and valiant stomach. Did not Thomyris 
 the Scythian queen, and collateral ancestor of the 
 Macarthies, by her great spirit, with a few hundred 
 followers, bate Cyrus entirely, with many thousands ? 
 
 and did not , but I will not bother your lordship 
 
 with needless tediousness, only just will defy the 
 world, from this day out, to prove that I care a tes- 
 toon for you; and thought, sir, that I’d ride the astu- 
 riones after you, to show you the way, sir, to Castle 
 Macarthy.” 
 
 “ I should, for many reasons, prefer going alone,” 
 said the general. 
 
 “ Och ! very well, gineral ; sure I have no controul 
 over you now, sir, why would I, only in respect of 
 finding out the Bhan Tierna, wdio does not care to be 
 in the way of the quality; foreby being always in 
 the fields, or on her own mountains, from sunrise to 
 sunset, just like a little grasshopper, the sowl ! 
 chirping and hopping, and living on dews and air, as 
 one would say; that’s as Anacreon says, sir; and re- 
 members your construing that same into mighty 
 pretty Latin ; and you only twelve years old and 
 three months.” 
 
 “ You may order my horse in an hour hence,” said 
 the general. 
 
 O’Leary now drew towards the door, throwing 
 back one eager, anxious, and affectiojnate look, which

 the general returned with an expressive smile, 
 O’Leary raised his eyes in thanksgiving, murmured 
 an Irish prayer, dashed the gathering tears from his 
 eyes, and crossing his hands behind him, retired, mut- 
 tering to himself as he slowly descended the steep 
 stairs : “ And Cumhal the cratur, not alive to see this < 
 day !” 
 
 An hour had scarcely elapsed when O’Leary, § 
 mounted on the fine horse he had alluded to, ap- 
 peared under the window of the apartment. He 
 had thrown off his pedagogue costume, was habited j 
 in his gala dress of many coats, had put on a new 
 wig and hat, was shaved unusually close* and ex- 
 hibited a countenance far indeed from placid, but 
 from which every trace of anxiety and solitude was 
 banished. The flutter of new-born, unexpected hap- 
 piness still distinguished his manner. He had given 
 his boys an holiday, and was incapable of fixing his 
 attention to his daily habits ; but there was an air of 
 contentment about him, which indicated an evident 
 revolution in feelings and ideas. His short cough, 
 and expressions of kindness to the animal on which ! 
 he was mounted, drew General Fitzwalter to the 
 window ; and he stood for a moment contemplating ji 
 this warm-hearted, zealous, and devoted being, with ; 
 an emotion of pride and benevolence, as one who, 
 true to human sympathy, beholds with triumph the i 
 happiness he has created. 
 
 In a few minutes he was mounted on his steed ; 
 and O’Leary continued to walk beside him, with one 
 hand behind his back, and the other leaning on the 
 horse's flank. 
 
 “I’ll just step on a taste with your honor,” he ob-

 served, to excuse his intrusion, “ to show the good 
 road, sir, and open the little gates, and remove the 
 brambles that stop up the gaps in the mearings, be* 
 twixt the potato grounds of the Dunore tenants.” 
 
 To this the general made no objection ; and O’Lea- 
 ry continued : 
 
 “ And so you are going, giniral, jewel, to make 
 your courtesies, and to pay your obeysance to the 
 Countess of Clancare, which makes the friar’s words 
 come true, anno 1505.” 
 
 “ What friar, and what words, O’Leary ?” 
 
 “ Och ! a holy man, your honor,” said O’Leary, low- 
 ering his voice, and raising his head towards the gen- 
 eral’s ear, “ who was superior of the order here, in 
 the time of the first Lord Dunore, who got the castle 
 after the Macarthies, and who chased away the broth- 
 erhood. He left a curse on Dunore Castle, which re- 
 mains unredeemed to this day. His prophecy, which 
 is in Irish, may be thus construed : 
 
 Macarthy More shall have his own, 
 
 When, after battles lost and won, 
 
 The Norman shall cross the threshold floor, 
 
 To woo the heir of Macarthy More : 
 
 When the dexter hand from the clouds shall bend, 
 
 And the moose deer* to its home shall wend ; 
 
 When he shall return, who was dead and gone, 
 
 Macarthy More shall have his own — ' 
 
 • Such are the words of Friar Con.” 
 
 “ The prediction of your friar, O’Leary,” said the 
 general smiling, “ like most prophecies, is sufficiently 
 vague and indefinite. It may mean anything or noth- 
 ing.” 
 
 * The dexter arm, the crest of the Fitzadelms — the moose 
 deer, that of the Macarthies.

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “ Anything or nothing !” returned O’Leary quickly. 
 “ Does battles lost and won mane nothing ? And the 
 retreat of Masha-na-glass, and the foray of Dooghna- 
 go-hoone, between the Fitzadelms and the Macar- 
 thies, about a prey of cattle, and divers other combats, 
 as will be seen in any genealogical history, written in 
 the Phoenician vulgo vocato Irish : do they mane 
 nothing ? And does the Norman crossing the thresh- 
 old floor, to woo the heir of Macarthy More, mane 
 nothing, gineral, and your honor” (here he lowered 
 his voice to a whisper), “and your honor going to 
 make your obeysance to the Bhan Tierna of the 
 world ? And does. 
 
 i The dexter hand from the cloud shall bend, 
 
 And the moose deer to its home shall wend, ? 
 
 mane nothing ? when the dexter hand’s the device of 
 the Fitzadelms; and is going in lowly suit, to tender 
 itself to the Macarthy’ s heir ; and the moose deer, the 
 crest of the Macarthies, -which was found cut beauti- 
 fully in stone among the rubbish at castle Macarthy, 
 and set up over the portal, by Lady Clancare, when 
 she came home, a wandering deer herself, the cratur ! 
 the wide world over? And then — ” he added, in 
 
 emotion, “ for him who shall return, being ” 
 
 “Yes, yes,” interrupted Fitzwalter, “that is plain; 
 but it is by no means so certain, because a Norman 
 stranger visits the heiress, or representative of the 
 Macarthy family, that he is to woo her. And if the 
 restoration of the greatness and property of the Ma- 
 carthies rests upon -that part of your friar’s prophecy, 
 I’m afraid, O’Leary, the whole falls to the ground.” 
 
 “ If she chooses it, plaze your honor, shell make

 you woo her, and win her, too,” said O’Leary, with 
 an air of mysterious doggedness. 
 
 “ Indeed !” 
 
 “Troth! and deed, sir. Sure she rules the world 
 intirely, sir ; and has greatly quelled the 4 Crawleys 
 since she came into it. And is like her great ances- 
 tor, the famed Iilen Macarthy, sharp witted, a great 
 lover of learning, capable of any study, and has, at 
 this present speaking, my Irish and Latin dictionary, 
 which she walked down herself to borrow, the very 
 evening of the day your honor set off to Cork ; which 
 was the day, sir, she arrived from England, where 
 she had been sojourning, to the intire loss of the 
 country ; and the Crawleys waxing pockish the 
 moment her back was turned ; and brings me home 
 this piece of antiquity ; ‘ and thinks it will plaze you, 
 O’Leary !’ says she; here it is, plaze your honor. 
 With your lave, gineral, I’ll peruse aloud to beguile 
 the way, which is bare and bleak.” 
 
 “I would rather you would explain to me, O’Leary,” 
 said the general, alighting and throwing the bridle 
 of the horse over his arm ; “ why, talking as you did, 
 so much and so frequently of the ancient state and 
 fortunes of this Macarthy family, you should have 
 said nothing of their present existence ; of this Lady 
 Clancare, for instance, whom you merely mentioned 
 as an ancient lady, absent from the country, and 
 whom I naturally supposed to be the widow of the 
 late earl.” 
 
 “ And isn’t she an ancient countess,„though a young 
 female, your honor ? Anno, 1568; estates regranted 
 by letters patent, to hold them of the crown after the 
 English fashion ; and sat in Parliament afore 1581 ;

 and as for not coshering* about her with a stranger 
 in the mountains (no stranger to the heart, if strange 
 to the eye), would you ax one of the Pobble O’Learys 
 to betray their Tanista, their Bhan Tierna ? and her 
 last words, laving the country in Owny, the rabragh’s 
 ould chay, being— — ” 
 
 “ Owny, the rabragh !” repeated the general, with 
 a little start. 
 
 “ Yes, my lord — sir, I mane ; the last words laving 
 the country, and the first when she came back, was, 
 not to be talking her over with strangers ; nor, ’bove 
 all, with any of the Fitzadelms, who were expected 
 over every day them two years : and when I told her 
 that I was sure I had the Lord Adelm houselled 
 under my roof, and described your honor to her ver* 
 batim et literatim , she swore me over again that I 
 would not sell her to yez.” 
 
 “ Sell her ! but what was her object in this conceal- 
 ment ?” 
 
 “ Pride, sir ; what else would it be. The pride of 
 the Macarthies, sir, the proudest race in Christendom, 
 dead or alive, this day ; and didn’t choose, the sowl, 
 to be overshadowed by them Dunores and their

 or mart ; without her warder, or constable, or gal low.

 own castle, and going afoot to Mass, barring when 
 the mules isn’t at work, and has them put to her 
 cabriole, made by ould Cormack the wheelwright. 
 
 | Mules ! Bachal Essu ! she that had her Spanish jen- 
 nets, and her Hobellers, and Asturiones, and Arabians, 
 sent over by Don Jacobus Macarthy as a gift to the 
 | great Florence ; foreby her steeds ready caparisoned 
 I afore the rack in case of a sudden foray, and the 
 O’Driscols coming down the mountains to make a 
 j prey of kine ; and that is the raison, plaze your honor, 
 why she’d wish to keep aloof of them English quali- 
 ty. Besides, she might not like, being a lone lady, 
 to come in the way of the young Lord Adelm, who 
 is, according to rumor, a rake and rapparee, one in 
 whom there is no stay, no sobriety, likening his 
 ; father, the Honorable Gerald.” 
 
 “And yet,” said the general, “Lady Clancare chose 
 to let herself be taken prisoner to Dunore, when a 
 word would have saved her the mortification of 
 standing in so humiliating a position, before those 
 : persons she was so anxious to avoid.” 
 
 “And if she did,” said O’Leary, with a significant 
 look, “ I’ll ingage she had her reasons for that same ; 
 and did not you mind that, secret and drifty as them 
 Crawleys was, to ruin the world round, and your 
 honor to boot, they were all outwitted and circum- 
 vented every step ; and, mark my words, the Bhan 
 Tierna was at the bottom of all, overthrowing their 
 complots and their policies.” 
 
 | They had now passed the last fence of the potato 
 grounds, had got upon the highway, the general had 
 mounted his horse, and was declining O’Leary’s offer

 of accompanying him to Castle Macarthy, when Lord 
 Adelm, followed by a groom, appeared galloping 
 towards them. He stretched out his hand to Gene- 
 ral Fitzwalter, who rode up to him, and took it cor- 
 dially. O’Leary stood with his head uncovered, and 
 with something between amazement and consterna- 
 tion painted in his looks. 
 
 “ I have met with a great loss,” said Fitzadelm, as 
 they rode on together. 
 
 “ You bear losses with such philosophy,” said Fitz- 
 walter, “ that it would be throwing away sympathy 
 to offer it to you. But what further trials has your 
 disinterested generosity been put to ?” 
 
 “ I have lost,” said Lord Adelm, with a melancholy 
 look, “ ray sybils kerchief.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter rode close up to him, and throw- 
 ing his arm over Lord Adelm’ s shoulder, said : “ And 
 what if I have discovered the sybil, who owns that ! 
 handkerchief?” 
 
 “ Discovered !” said Lord Adelm, almost springing j 
 from his horse, and taking the bridle of the general’s, 
 so as to draw them still closer together — “ discovered, 
 say you ! how ? when ? where ? what is she ? sybil, 
 sylph, woman, maid, widow, or wife ? Speak I conjure 
 you.” 
 
 “A woman and a wife ; almost, at least a wifej” re- 
 plied Fitzwalter, with a half-repressed sigh. 
 
 “Whose wife?’ demanded Lord Fitzadelm, with 
 the blood mantling to his cheek. 
 
 “ Mine,” was the abrupt reply. 
 
 A short silence succeeded to this singular and 
 most unexpected answer, till Lord Adelm, recovering

 from the shock a reply so mysterious was calculated 
 to give, at last observed : 
 
 “ Everything about you is extraordinary. You 
 are out of the pale of every-day creation. All things 
 connected with you are calculated for amazement or 
 admiration ; but that any one you have deigned to — 
 to — should turn her eyes on me ! — in short, you trifle 
 
 with my folly, you play with my credulity — you ” 
 
 “At the present moment,” said the general, “I 
 cannot satisfy your doubts, or clear up your perplexi- 
 ties. I am myself doubtful and uncertain, — perplexed 
 in the extreme. If the owner of the mystic kerchief 
 is the person I suspect she is, or might be still — but 
 I demand your indulgence, and the suspension of 
 your curiosity. To-night it may be in my power to 
 become more explicit. Till then, or till that moment 
 arrives when I can fully explain myself, confide in my 
 truth, rely on my friendship, and believe that my 
 feelings are not more at ease than your own. Where 
 can I see you this evening ?” 
 
 “ Where ! ’where but at the castle ? My mother’s 
 dinner card of general invitation is now on its way to 
 you. It is with difficulty I could confine her to that; 
 not but that I consider your delicacy as morbid and 
 sickly upon this point.” 
 
 “ It must not, and it ought not to be,” said the 
 general. 
 
 “ It must and #ught. It’s folly to act otherwise. 
 To me it is privation, and in you suspicious. I will 
 call on you in my way home, and we will return to 
 dinner together ; or, rather, I wish you would accom- 
 pany me now.”

 44 To Glannacrime. This morning, at breakfast, I 
 thought I perceived a little intelligence between my - 4 
 mother and her election agent, to keep me for some 
 time out of the scene of action; so I ordered my 
 horse, and came off to canvass the 4 most sweet voices’ J 
 of those purchaseable worthies, in person. But this \ 
 most extraordinary intelligence, mysterious and unsa- j 
 tisfactory as it is, which you have now communicated 
 to me, leaves me without thought or view for any 
 other object, save that which has so long occupied | 
 my existence ; that which--' — Your wife ! Oh ! you 
 jest. Impossible ; you never mentioned, never hinted, 
 that you were married before ; and now . . . .” 
 
 44 To tell the truth,” said Fitzwaiter, shrugging his ■ 
 shoulders, 44 1 had almost forgotten it myself. It was ; 
 an event in my life, brief and fantastic as a dream, 
 made up of circumstances as wild and as discordant ; 
 occurring amidst scenes, perilous and foreign to such ; 
 an engagement, amidst the crash of war, the groans 
 of the dying ; when the vow, half breathed, remained 
 unratified, the benediction, half pronounced, was un- 
 finished ; and the ceremony, all but concluded, was 
 broken off in time to render the forms which had 
 passed binding only to faith, to honor, and to grati- 
 tude. These ties all remain ; and if they are to be ir- 
 revocably broken, ’tis not by me. This, you are go- ( j 
 ing to say, is all enigma; and so it is. Yet, now, I 
 will be pressed no further. To-night, perhaps . . . 
 till then farewell.” 
 
 He spurred his horse, and in a moment was out of 
 sight. There was in the tone, the air, and the man- 
 ner, more than in his own words, an imposing firm- 
 ness, and indisputable decision upon all occasions,

 when he chose to he peremptory, which left persua- 
 sion hopeless. 
 
 “ He is his own destiny and mine,” said Lord 
 Adelrn, with a sigh, as he looked after him. “ To con- 
 tend with him, or to oppose him, were to struggle 
 with fatality.” In this conviction there was some- 
 thing extremely accordant to the habits of mind and 
 morbid imagination of him who embraced it. Mys- 
 tery was his element ; and whatever was wild or ter- 
 rible, dark or extraordinary, whatever roused pro- 
 found emotion, or gave feeling to extraordinary con- 
 jecture, was calculated to engross and interest him ; 
 the commander of II Libradcrr did both.

 It was a bright warm September morning that, for 
 the first time since his arrival in the country, General 
 Fitzwalter entered the village of Bally dab. But nei- 
 ther the noonday sun which shone on its views, nor 
 the mountain breeze that blew over them, rich in the 
 perfumes of plants peculiar to the southern moun- 
 tains of Ireland, could lend a charm to this ruinous 
 retreat of indigence and misery. Bally dab, the El 
 Dorado of O’Leary, the once fair dependency of its 
 own feudal castle, an ancient borough, which had 
 formerly sent two members to Parliament by pre- 
 scriptive right (for its charter was not upon record), 
 Ballydab, once noted in military and ecclesiastical 
 history, was now a desolate and ruinous village, 
 scarcely more imposing or less miserable in its ap- 
 pearance than the deserted city of Kilmallock in the 
 same province (15). The remains of a wall which 
 once surrounded the town were still visible. The 
 site of a Dominican Abbey of Black Friars, erected 
 in the fifteenth century by “ the sovereign, brethren 
 and commonalty,” was yet ascertainable; and the

 ruins of other castles and monasteries afforded shel- 
 ter to many wretched families who had built their 
 perishable huts against the walls of edifices whose 
 strength had stood the shock of ages. Desolate, im- 
 poverished and neglected, the surrounding land given 
 up to jobbers, it bore all the signs, not only of dis- 
 tress, but of squalid and hopeless pauperism. Its in- 
 habitants were deemed lawless, they were, indeed, 
 occasionally desperate ; no natural demand being 
 made upon their native activity, their restlessness 
 had sometimes degenerated to mischief; and it was, 
 perhaps,- as much their misery that they had few 
 wants, as they had still fewer means of supplying 
 them. Their cabins were, for the most part, ruined 
 hovels; and in the centre of the town, a swampy 
 marsh sent up ordinarily a pestilential vapor, though 
 now unusually dry. 
 
 • Yet, amidst these symptoms of general wretched- 
 ness, evidences of recent and progressive improve- 
 ment were to be seen. The mountain which shelter- 
 ed the town was cultivated and green to its summit. 
 Several of the hovels were newly whitewashed ; and, 
 in a few instances, freshly-plastered chimneys emitted 
 the smoke, which more commonly found egress at 
 the door. In the front of one cabin a poor man was 
 employed in filling up a stagnant pool, and a heap 
 of manure was removing from before another. At 
 the door of a barn a number of children were em- 
 ployed in making green rush matting, and at a little 
 | shebeen house a piper sat upon a stone bench playing 
 j a gay Irish lilt. 
 
 I From every point of the village the castle was 
 conspicuous, standing on the brow of a hill that

 overhung it; and upon a precipice which imme- 
 diately arose from a river, formed of many tributary 
 streams, and flowing into one of the many bays, 
 which, a mile further on, indented the coast. All 
 that now remained of the original edifice of Castle 
 Macarthy was a coarse square building, rude, inele- 
 gant, and wholly destitute of the architectural orna- 
 ment which distinguished the beautiful and perfect 
 castle of Dunore, a building more modern by about 
 a century. The ballium, the barbican, the parapets, 
 the embrasures and crenelles, described by O’Leary, ' 
 and existing only in the memory of what he read, or 
 the imagination cf what he Avished, were vainly 
 sought for in the chapter of realities. Ills castle j 
 was literally “ a castle in the air.” 
 
 As General Fitz waiter approached more closely, 
 and ascended the steep and rutted lane, or ap- 
 proach, he perceived a fosse partly filled up, and a 
 flagged causeway crossing it. The stone pillars 
 of the gates still remained ; and the castle bawn, the 
 demesne of feudal recreation, lay to the left, and was 
 still fenced round with a low 7 Avail of mud and bram- 
 bles. It was now, however, planted Avith potatoes, 
 rich in their bright silver and orange flowers. The 
 mountain rose almost perpendicularly above the cas- 
 tle ; and to the left, a romantic glen, Avild, irregular, 
 and rocky, afforded a passage to the many mountain 
 brooks Avhich swelled the greater streams and fell 
 into the sea. Two or three irregular sashed win- 
 dows appeared scattered over the front of the castle; 
 but it was principally lighted by loophole casements. 
 
 The hall-door, of black bog oak, lay open, and the 
 crest of the Macarthies, alluded to by O’Leary, the

 moose deer, cut in stone, was raised above it, with 
 the date of 1500. A knocker would have been 
 vainly sought for; nor was any person visible, ex- 
 cept two women, who appeared at a distance, weed- 
 ing a patch of ground at the extremity of the potato 
 ridges ; while a venerable greyhound, which lay bask- 
 ing in the sun before the door, the sole guardian of 
 these ruined towers, only growled at the stranger’s 
 approach, half raised himself, and then lay down 
 again to sleep. 
 
 General Fitzwalter entered the stone-roofed hall; 
 and, in the hope that some one might accidentally 
 appear, occupied himself in examining the singular 
 ornaments with which it was decorated. A wolf’s 
 head, the last caught in Ireland, (as was inscribed on 
 a brass plate, bearing date 1710,) hung from the cen- 
 tre of the ceiling. Beneath it, on an old stone table, 
 the enormous fossil horns of a moose deer were ex- 
 tended ; a few old pictures were dropping from their 
 frames ; and, on either side of the hall, two narrow 
 arched ways led to dark, damp stone passages. He 
 was at last tempted to proceed through that on the 
 left, guided by the sound of a voice, which had sud- 
 denly raised a lilt, and as suddenly stopped it, when 
 some one ran forcibly against him, hastily drawing 
 back and exclaiming, “ Christ save us, Amen !” 
 
 The general followed the person whose surprise or 
 fears had extorted this ejaculation, and found himself 
 at the, door of an old, spacious, smoky kitchen. In 
 removing the alarm he had just awakened, he in- 
 creased the surprise of the intimidated person. It 
 was a young woman, who courtesied and blushed, 
 with something like recognition in her looks; and

 putting back her locks beneath her round-eared cap, 
 she remained silent and confused. On the inquiry 
 whether Lady Clancare was at home, she court esied 
 still lower, and said, “ Is it my lady, sir ? Oh yes, to 
 be sure she is, your honor — I ax your pardon. This 
 way, if you plaze, sir. Have a care ; there is a little 
 stooleen in your way. I’ll but step afore your honor.” 
 Still engaged in arranging her dress, she led the way 
 to the stone passage, on the other side the hall, and 
 passing under a Gothic arched way, she threw open a 
 door at the further extremity of the passage, and 
 ushered the visitor into a low-roofed but spacious 
 room. His conductress having wiped a large arm- 
 chair, and pulled it near the dying embers of a turf 
 fire, which she replenished from a huge turf-box that 
 stood near the hearth, she was retiring, when he 
 called her back, and giving her his card, desired her 
 to carry it, with his respectful compliments, to the 
 Countess of Clancare. The girl looked at the card, 
 and then at him, and a smile just visible stole over 
 her feat ures as she retired. 
 
 The room into which he had been shown occupied 
 his attention during* the moment of waiting. It was 
 of dimensions disproportionate to its height ; and 
 from its dark and irregular figure, and the immense 
 width of the wall (marked by the deep recess of its 
 only window), it appeared to occupy one of the 
 towers which flanked the castle towards the precipi- 
 tous glen ; it was not, therefore, perceptible from the 
 front. 
 
 The walls, neither wainscotted nor papered, were 
 partially covered with faded tapestry, the figures of 
 which were antique and grotesque. Above the ample

 and ungrated hearth, a lofty, cumbrous, but handsome 
 chimney-piece of gray marble, the produce of the ad- 
 joining quarries, arose nearly half-way to the ceiling. 
 For two feet above the floor, it was incrusted with 
 brick, and seemed to have been but lately discovered. 
 On its entablature was carved the following inscrip- 
 tion : Donagii Macarthy Comes de Clancare me fecit, 
 1656. The floor was of beaten earth, mixed with 
 freestone sand, and was covered near the fireplace 
 with some new rush matting ; an oak table, a tattered 
 Indian screen, a high ponderous Japan chest, and a 
 few long-backed, curiously carved oak chairs, com- 
 posed the whole furniture of this antique and gloomy 
 apartment; a spinning wheel stood near the hearth, 
 and a Spanish guitar, and a parasol, oddly contrasted 
 to it, lay on the table. The recess window was evi- 
 dently devoted to the purposes of a study. The view 
 it commanded was enchanting, for it hung immedi- 
 ately over a glen ; and a river, seen sparkling through 
 the rich underwood, brawled beneath, and rushed 
 through a cleft in the rocks towards the distant bay. 
 
 The floor of this recess was covered with a piece 
 of old, but once rich, Turkey carpet : the table, which 
 nearly occupied it, was heaped with books and manu- 
 scripts ; the latter, however, not bearing the stamp 
 of antiquity, but fresh written ; and the humid pen 
 was evidently but just laid down. Two books stood 
 open, marked with a pencil and a flower. The one 
 was Hanmer’s Chronicle, the other Campion’s His- 
 tory of Ireland. An Irish and Latin Dictionary, and 
 an odd volume of Lopez deVega, Bum’s Poems, and 
 a small edition of Shakspeare, with an antique missal, 
 bound in crimson velvet, bearing the arms and

 coronet of the Clancares, formed the whole of this 
 little collection. Some flowers, seemingly just 
 gathered, stood in a handsome China vase, upon the 
 table ; and an embroidered work-bag, such as are 
 worked in foreign convents, with a silver cross and 
 rosary, hung over the back of the chair, and com- 
 pleted the paraphernalia of this little recess, which 
 might have served equally for the retreat of the sage 
 or the saint, or as a reposoir for the fantastic taste of 
 a petite maitresse . The flowers and the work-bag 
 were at once assignable to the timid, but evidently 
 affected Lady Clancare— for Lord Adelm’s epithet 
 of the petite evaporee seemed not ill-placed. The 
 rosary and the cross, and the missal, were as mark- 
 edly appropriate to the Spanish nun, Florence Mac- 
 arthy, who had been so lately an inmate at the castle. 
 
 General Fitzwalter had learned, by experience, to 
 distrust the extravagant exaggerations of O Leary, 
 when the family of his hereditary Tiernas was con- 
 cerned. He had no doubt that the character of Lady 
 Clancare had been confounded, in his wandering ima- 
 gination, with that of the celebrated Illen Macarthy, 
 of Queen Elizabeth’s days ; and that the learning and 
 potency attached to this female Tanaist in his descrip- 
 tions had no more certain existence than the bal- 
 i limns, crenelles, and barbican, which he had given to 
 her dilapidated castle. Even the exertions she had 
 made to liberate an oppressed man, through her ap- 
 plication to Judge Aubrey, while it evinced great 
 goodness of heart, was deemed sufficient to explain 
 the popularity she so evidently enjoyed among a peo- 
 ple equally alive to kindness and neglect. 
 
 But whatever might be the character of this fair

 recluse, her tastes, like her appearance, were mani- 
 festly delicate and feminine ; and there was some- 
 thing peculiarly touching, and even pitiable, in the in- 
 digence betrayed in this ruinous asylum, of one so 
 young, so nobly born, so destitute, and so unprotected. 
 Her assumption of a title she had no means of sup- 
 porting, her retirement from the world to a solitude 
 so dreary, showed at least the pride of birth ; and 
 pride, from whatever source it springs, when at variance 
 with poverty, forms one of the most painful contests 
 of feeling to which humanity is subject. 
 
 As these thoughts passed rapidly through the 
 mind of Fitzwalter, he almost unconsciously took 
 down an antique s^vord, which hung against the wall; 
 and mused, as he examined its curious structure, on 
 the untowardness of a fate in which he found some 
 parallel to his own. 
 
 “ Man,” he involuntarily exclaimed, brandishing the 
 weapon, and clasping it with a warrior’s grasp — 
 “ man, with such an instrument as this, can always 
 cut his way to fortune or to death ; and, rushing for- 
 ward to meet the evils of his destiny, can, by oppos- 
 ing, end them ; but woman, hapless woman ! what is 
 her resource when fortune deserts, when adversity 
 assails her ? Desolate and unguarded, with scarce 
 one path left open to her exertions, scarce one stay 
 left to her weakness, endangered even by her perfec- 
 tions, risked and enfeebled by all that makes the de- 
 licious excellence of her nature,— woman— — 
 
 The door opened, and she, whose destiny had pro- 
 bably given birth to this apostrophe, interrupted its 
 conclusion. There was a sort of half start, a sudden 
 pause in the approach of Lady Claneare (as if the

 visit and the visitor were equally unexpected), which 
 communicated something of its brief confusion to her 
 guest. He bowed, then stood for a moment, slightly 
 embarrassed ; and, still armed with the antique sword 
 of Macarthy-More, he not inaptly realized to the eyes 
 of his fair descendant the picture left on historic 
 record of that magnificent chieftain. 
 
 Lady Clancare was the first to recover herself'; and, 
 slightly courtesying, addressed her guest by name, 
 motioned him to a chair, and advanced, with a light, 
 quick step, to the centre of the room. With a disen- 
 gaged air she gradually disencumbered herself of a ^ 
 deep straw bonnet, a gray cloak, gloves incrusted 
 with earth, and a black apron full of mountain ash 
 berries, all of which articles were deliberately laid 
 upon the table. Lady Clancare, as she now stood, 
 was the very personification of health, in all its force 
 and freshness, vigor and elasticity. The crimson of 
 haste and exercise glowed in her cheek ; and there J 
 was a life palpitating through the whole frame, throb- 
 bing in every pulse, and vibrating in every fibre, that 
 was visible to the observer’s eye. But whether she 
 Yv as animated or agitated, breathless from hurry or 
 from emotion, it would have been difficult to ascer- 
 tain. Her countenance had lost nothing of its pecu- 
 liar modesty; but from her half-closed eyes one glance 
 met his, that, to him at least, seemed charged with 
 triumph, — a sort of smiling malicious triumph ; the 
 triumph of conscious success, of conscious superiority, 
 and infelt powder ; such a look as he had seen her 
 wear when, in carrying off Lady Dunore, she had 
 bowed her laughing, and almost insolent, salutation 
 to the discomfited Crawleys.

 This look, whether real or fancied, was, however, 
 transient as lightning ; and now, disencumbered of 
 her coarse out-of-door garments, she turned round a 
 face dimpled with a thousand smiles ; and, with the 
 ease of a woman of the world, but the ?iaivete of one 
 beyond its forms and formalities, she apologized for 
 having so long detained him. “ This is,” she added, 
 pointing again to a chair, and throwing herself into 
 an immense old-fashioned fauteuil, this is nay farming 
 season and farming hour. We are digging our pota- 
 toes to-day ; for you must know, General Fitz waiter, 
 the potato vintage is to us poor Irish of as great mo- 
 ment and interest, though not quite so susceptible of 
 picturesque description, as the gathering of the rich 
 grapes in the luxuriant vineyards of the Loire and the 
 Garonne. I always preside on these occasions my- 
 self,” she added, carelessly untying a silk handker- 
 chief which encircled her neck ; “ for I dare say you 
 will agree with me, that no work goes on so lightly 
 as that which is shared by the master.” 
 
 To this proposition General Fitzwalter returned no 
 answer. He had mechanically taken the chair as- 
 signed him, and sat with his right arm thrown over 
 its back, and his left leaning on the old sword. His 
 eyes were rivetted on Lady Clancare, with that eager, 
 animated, penetrating gaze natural to them wdien he 
 sought to discover or dive at once into the secret of 
 a character that appeared to elude observation. 
 Hers, however, as it now equivocally appeared 
 through her easy, animated, disengaged manners (so 
 opposed to her “ outward seeming” at the castle of 
 Dunore), w T as all enigma. Her childish shyness, her 
 timid and affected carriage, which had induced Lord

 Adelm to give her the epithet of a minaucliere , had 
 disappeared. There was now something of the sybil 
 in her looks ; and her incomprehensible change of 
 manner assimilated with the present character of her 
 person and character. Meantime the silence of her 
 guest, though marked and singular, seemed not to 
 displease her; and she sat demurely patting and 
 caressing the old greyhound that had followed her 
 into the room, as if she awaited an explanation of the 
 visit, which appeared wholly unexpected, though it 
 was natural to suppose was not without cause or ex- 
 cuse. At last, as if to relieve the awkwardness of the 
 pause, she stretched forth a very pretty little hand, 
 and asked, smilingly — 
 
 “ Shall I take that sword from you? 'tis a cumbrous 
 article.” He laid the sword upon the table, and she 
 drew it towards her. “ Have you examined this an- 
 tique weapon, General Fitzwalter ? I am told it was 
 found in a bog in 1748. It was sent to me the other 
 day by a neighboring farmer, into whose hands it fell 
 accidentally : for he was pleased, poor man, to con- 
 sider me as the lady of the manor. What makes 
 these brazen swords a valuable relic to the Irish an- 
 tiquarian is, that they serve to corroborate the opinion 
 that the Phoenicians colonized this country; since 
 they insist that the sword-blades found upon the field 
 of Cannae were of the same metal and construction. 
 Consequently, you know, General Fitzwalter, some- 
 thing more than a mere presumption arises that Ire- 
 land had her arts and letters from the country of Cad- 
 mus, as all her traditions affirm, in spite of all Dr. Led- 
 wich has said to the contrary.” 
 
 All this was uttered with a sort of mock emphasis,

 429 
 
 that left it very doubtful whether she believed a word 
 she spoke, or whether it was mere ironical badinage ; 
 it served only to involve General Fitzwalter in deeper 
 perplexity. 
 
 • “ Now, what is ygur opinion ?” she added with em- 
 phatic gravity. “ Do you really think we are Tyrians 
 by descent ?” Then laughing and assuming her gay 
 tone, she added, “ O ! I see you are no antiquarian, 
 though you are the guest of my friend O’Leary. 
 W ell, then, neither am I ; and to confess the truth, 
 the present state of this poor country interests me 
 more than its ancient greatness, real or fabled ; and 
 I should rather see my neighbors of Ballydab succeed 
 in reclaiming and cultivating that mountain, to the 
 right of the casement (my dear Clotnottyjoy), or im- 
 prove in the rush and straw work I am endeavoring 
 to teach their idle, helpless, haked children, than es- 
 tablish beyond all controversy tjiat the Macarthies 
 are descended from the Tyrian Hercules, or that Ire- 
 land was the seat of arts and letters, when the rest 
 of the world was, according to my family genealogist, 
 the sage O’Leary, buried in utter darkness. Do you 
 know — apropos to ancient greatness,” she added, 
 with a quick transition of voice, “ that as I entered 
 this room, there was something in your appearance, 
 as you stood brandishing that antique weapon, that 
 reminded me of a picture I have seen of our family 
 hero, Florence Macarthy ; though to Miss Crawley’s 
 deep-read mind, and ready literary associations, I 
 dare say you would have recalled the image of Achil- 
 les, in the court of Lycomedes. 
 
 ‘ In questa mano,

 A ravissar me stes.so, ah ! forso a fronte, 
 
 A mille squadre, e mille — !’ ” 
 
 “ And if I were,” said General Fitzwalter, inter- 
 rupting her impulsively, and borne away by the ani- 
 mation with which she had repeated these lines, giv- 
 ing an almost dramatic effect; “ and if I were a fronte , 
 a mille squadre , e mille , my position, perhaps, would 
 be less hazardous than that I at present occupy.” 
 
 “ It would at least be more in your way,” she re- 
 plied, significantly. 
 
 “ How do you know that ?” he asked eagerly. 
 
 “ Oh ! I kno w nothing. I merely guess it. I have 
 a true woman’s mind : no judgment, no reflection, no 
 knowledge ; but some intelligence, and a rapidity of 
 perception, that goes before all experience, and lights 
 upon facts by accident, which it would take an age 
 for philosophy to puzzle at.” | 
 
 “ Then, perhaps,” he returned, “ you are already 
 intuitively aware of the cause of this intrusion upon 
 proscribed ground, where the soles of unblessed feet 
 are not, I understand, permitted to press.” 
 
 “ Oh ! to be sure I am. The cause is — that of 
 most of the untoward things that men do (heroes, as 
 well as others), a woman.” 
 
 “ That , my visit to your ladyship sufficiently indi- 
 cates. But the purport of this visit to a woman, 
 whose dwelling is forbidden to a stranger’s steps — to 
 all male intrusions I understand— — ” 
 
 “ That, I confess,” returned Lady Clancare, laugh- 
 ing, “ surpasses my oracular divinations. I trust, 
 however, it is sufficient to sanction the infringement 
 of one of the most strictly observed laws in the sta- 
 tute-book of— Ballydab. But whatever be the pur-

 port of your visit, I honestly confess that you owe 
 your admission to the simplicity of my maid — a little 
 Tipperary nymph, and a stranger, whom I have just 
 brought to this country ; so that I have not yet had 
 time to initiate her into all the mysteries of her voca- 
 tion. My seclusion,” she added earnestly, is no “ af- 
 fectation, no lure to quicken curiosity, or attract at- 
 tention. It is indispensable that I should live much 
 alone; my avocations require it, my peculiar situ- 
 ation demands it, my circumstances enforce it. You, 
 however, have taken me by surprise : may I, there- 
 fore, beg to know the purport of the visit so unex- 
 pected ?” 
 
 “ The purport, madam,” said General Fitzwalter, 
 “ of this visit, which certainly demands an apology 
 for such unwarranted intrusion, is to return this 
 handkerchief to its right owner.” 
 
 He arose as he spoke, and drawing from his breast 
 the handkerchief, dropped by Lord Fitzadelm, pre- 
 sented it to Lady Clancare. Her complexion, which 
 had varied to hues of every shade of red as she spoke, 
 now r faded to an unearthly paleness. The ardent 
 eyes of General Fitzw^alter pursued its flight, and 
 contributed, perhaps, by the intensity of their gaze, 
 to recall it to the surface it had deserted, 
 
 “ And to whom, then,” she asked in a low and un- 
 steady voice, “ do you suppose this handkerchief be- 
 longs ?” 
 
 “•I did,” he replied, emphatically, “ suppose this 
 morning, from particular circumstances, that it might 
 belong to a lady of the name of Florence Macarthy, 
 a kinswoman of your ladyship, a refugee nun from 
 Spanish America, and now, as I have just accidentally

 learned, a resident in a convent in the neighborhood 
 of Holycross. Her father served for a short time in 
 the guerilla war of South America : his death, which 
 was the purchase of my life, imposed on me an obli- 
 gation I would have requited to his daughter; 
 but — ” he paused in some confusion, then rapidly 
 added — “ Of the early part of this gallant man’s story 
 I know little. He had assumed a Caraquian name ; 
 having in horror and disgust abandoned the royal and 
 persecuting army. It was from his death-words only 
 that I gathered his connection with the illustrious 
 house* of Macarthy in this country. That he was 
 high-spirited and brave, I collected from my own ob- 
 servation ; that he was unfortunate, and in exile, it 
 was natural to suppose ; for he was an Irishman, and 
 a Catholic.” 
 
 Lady Clancare had listened to this detail with an 
 adverted head ; she now turned round, with the deep 
 inspiration of one who suddenly recovers from a 
 shock, in which the mind and body had alike partici- 
 pated. She opened the handkerchief, ran her eyes 
 rapidly over it, and observed, carelessly — “ There is 
 mo doubt this little scarf must be Florence Macarthy’s ; 
 here is the cross, the holy device of these fanciful 
 saints, who, you see, general, must have their petti- 
 nesses in piety, and are women even to the last. I 
 remember it well. I have seen it thrown over her 
 shouldefs an hundred times in our stolen twilight 
 walks ; for these cloistered creatures are coy, even to 
 the very air, ‘the chartered libertine,’ wdiicli blows on 
 all alike, the sinner or the saint. Yet, to my know- 
 ledge, my cousin has not been in this part of the 
 country since she took up her residence with Our

 Lady of the Annunciation. Besides, she is so sober, 
 steadfast, and demure, that she would scarcely step 
 out of her way to woo a soul to heaven, much less to 
 fling the handkerchief. .. Come, confess ; have you, 
 then, been besieging her convent, opposing your mili- 
 tary tactics to the wdiole army of martyrs ; and has 
 she sent you this appropriate device, as a flag of de- 
 fiance or of truce, till further parley ; and am I to be 
 the herald, the negotiator?” 
 
 The sudden transition of Lady Clancare’s look, the 
 playful ease which succeeded to her evident but tran- 
 sient consternation, the rapidity of her utterance, and 
 the directness of her question, confounded General 
 Fitzwalter. A new-born surmise, which for a mo- 
 ment had arisen out of her confusion, was stifled in 
 its birth ; and his suspicions as to the mysterious and 
 invisible mistress of Lord Adelm w^ere lost, or rather 
 no longer remembered, as he listened to a rallying 
 pleasantry which he was wholly unprepared to an- 
 swer ; and he unconsciously took up the handkerchief 
 which Lady Clancare had thrown on the table. 
 
 “ I have only this morning learned,” he replied, 
 “ that Miss Macarthy was in this country ; nor do I 
 hold myself at liberty to reveal more of the strange 
 circumstances connected with this handkerchief, which 
 your ladyship insists to have been hers, than that it 
 came by romantic and singular means into the hands 
 of a person w 7 ho prized it much, who knows that it is 
 now in mine ; and that we are both, though from differ- 
 ent motives, interested in discovering the real owner.” 
 “I think the initials sufficiently indicate,” said Lady 
 Clancare, gravely, “ that it is, or has been, the pro- 
 perty of Florence Macarthy ; but, after ail, the fact

 may be that she has bestowed it upon some young 
 novice, or convent boarder ; some fondled little friend 
 de par Peglise . If the handkerchief, therefore, has 
 been thrown at you, General Fitzwalter, as you loi- 
 tered in some country town, or reproachfully sent to 
 you with the pretty device of 
 ‘ When this you see, 
 
 Remember me, 
 
 Though far asunder we may be ; 
 or if you yourself took it (the owner nothing loath), 
 to wipe away tears worth an Hebe’s smiles, and now 
 wish to return it, with a heart wrapped up in it, no 
 
 longer of any use to the present owner ; or if you ■” 
 
 “ To spare your ladyship any further conjectures,” 
 said General Fitzwalter, with a countenance rather 
 expressive of annoyance, “ I must repeat to you, the 
 handkerchief is not mine, was neither sent to, nor in- 
 tended for me; and the object of this intrusion goes 
 no further than to learn from your ladyship if — that 
 is, where, or how — — ” He paused and colored. 
 The eyes of Lady Clancare now archly fixed on his, 
 and again confounded him. He threw himself back 
 into his chair, and petulantly, but with the naivetz of 
 one whose feelings goaded him beyond all power of 
 disguise, added, “ The fact is, madam, I scarcely re- 
 member what was the object of my visit.” 
 
 “ Pray, do not hurry yourself,” said Lady Clancare, 
 resuming her serious and demure look. “ I will await 
 your leisure, General Fitzwalter. It is now sufficient 
 for me to know that you were the friend of the gal- 
 lant Colonel Macarthy, that you are interested for 
 his daughter. You may, therefore, of course, com- 
 mand me. Her interests, her happiness, are mine.

 And I would do much to effect the happiness of 
 Florence Mac ar thy : I have done much — too much, 
 perhaps ; but hitherto I have failed, wholly failed. 1 ’ 
 
 She spoke with a voice of great emphasis, a coun- 
 tenance of great emotion, indicating a capability of 
 powerful and passionate feelings ; then hemmed 
 away a sigh, drew forward her spinning wheel, and 
 gave up her attention very strenuously to arranging 
 the cobweb thread upon its reel : then placing her 
 little foot upon the pedal, and turning the wheel 
 rapidly round, she gave one sly demure look at 
 General Fitz waiter, and awaited in patient expecta- 
 tion the narration which she anticipated, but which 
 he was less than ever enabled to make. The quick 
 motion of the prettiest foot he had ever seen, care- 
 lessly, but inevitably , displayed, the delicate fingers 
 which twisted and drew out the finespun thread with 
 fairy nimbleness, the occasional throwing back of her 
 dark divided hair, and the changing hues of a com- 
 plexion which bore testimony to the consciousness 
 of being gazed at, rendered even her silence eloquent, 
 and combined to form a picture, new, and, therefore, 
 fascinating to her sole observer. His modes of exist- 
 ence had indeed led him but rarely to those walks 
 of society, in which woman appears with all the 
 superadded attraction of mind, talent and the graces. 
 
 He now leaned on his arm, with his eyes fixed on 
 her figure, silent, intent, and yielding to the fascina- 
 tion of an influence, of which, at the moment, he was 
 scarcely conscious. He saw before him a woman be- 
 traying her vocation to feel and to please, in every 
 fibre, lineament, feature, and motion ; he beheld her 
 distinguished by spirit, feeling, softness, and gaiety ;

 and by that talent, so pardonable even in a woman — * 
 the talent of amusing, by the charm of endless variety. 
 The whole was guarded by a modesty which even 
 licentiousness dared not violate ; and it was set off 
 by an occasional shyness, the lingering habit of a 
 seclusion which may be sometimes dispelled, but 
 never is totally overpowered. 
 
 Ail this he saw, and saw nought beside. Lord 
 Adelm, the handkerchief, Miss Macarthy, the purport 
 and object of his visit, were alike forgotten; even 
 O’Leary’s prophecy and assurance of the potency of 
 his liege lady were no longer remembered. There 
 was now but one object in creation for him, and that 
 was the Bhan Tierna. 
 
 Meantime the wheel went merrily round ; many a 
 circling thread was spun off’, many an impulse given 
 to the twirling reel, and its monotonous hum was 
 alone interrupted by Lady Clancare’s carelessly ad- 
 verting to the primitiveness of her occupation, prob- 
 ably for the purpose of breaking an awkward silence. 
 
 a This is a rude, rustic work,” she observed, “ for 
 ladies’ fingers ; but our grandmothers of the highest 
 rank in Ireland were all spinners. This wheel be- 
 longed to the last Lady Clancare, who had the blood 
 royal of Ireland in her veins. My grandfather pre- 
 served it for me, and he had little else to bequeath 
 me. It has already obtained me some celebrity. I 
 am reckoned an excellent spinner; and in fact I like 
 it beyond all other work. I like its humming noise, 
 which disturbs the dreary tranquillity of the long 
 winter evenings which I pass here alone in my 4 Val 
 chiusa .’ It relieves my worn-out eyes from the daz- 
 zle of the paper, on which necessity has urged me to

 trace so much nonsense, in order that I may live, and 
 that others may laugh; for possibly you have heard, 
 General Fitz waiter, that I am, by divine indignation, 
 a — -sort of an author, un maniere cFesjyrit, and it is 
 quite true. With Ireland in my heart, and epitomiz- 
 ing something of her humor and her sufferings and 
 my own character and story, I do trade upon the 
 materials she furnishes me ; and, turning my patriot- 
 ism into pounds, shillings and pence, endeavor, at 
 the same moment, to serve her, and support myself. 
 Meantime my wheel, like my brain, runs round. I 
 spin my story and my flax together; draw out a 
 chapter and a hank in the same moment; and fre- 
 quently break off the thread of my reel, and of my 
 narration, under the influence of the same associa- 
 tion; for facts will obtrude upon fictions, and the 
 sorrows I idly feign are too frequently lost in the 
 sufferings I actually endure.” 
 
 “ The sufferings you endure P interrupted Fitzwal- 
 ter. “You! gracious heaven! You, who look the 
 very personification of health, spirit and enjoyment !” 
 
 “ Enjoyment !” she repeated, shaking her head, and 
 throwing her eyes significantly from the bare walls 
 of the gloomy apartment to its cold earth floor. 
 
 ^Yes,’ 1 he said, replying to her look, “if external 
 objects were anything to you, that may be true; but 
 with a spirit apparently so buoyant — a spirit that 
 sparkles in your eye, varies your complexion, gives 
 life, soul, and animation to every feature, and every 
 word you utter ; with an imagination to create 
 around you a perpetual Paradise, an imagina- 
 tion — — •’ 
 
 “ An imagination,” she interrupted eagerly, “ to

 exalt every anguish, to exaggerate every suffering, 
 to embellish the distant good and embitter the pre- 
 sent evil, to oppose the dreariness and privation of a 
 rude and ungenial solitude to all the refined and 
 elegant tastes of polished social life, whose details 
 (passing through the prismatic medium of fancy), 
 like the broken and worthless particles flung into 
 the kaleidoscope, arrange themselves in symmetric 
 beauty and harmonic coloring, to charm or to de- 
 ceive, and to assume forms, hues and lustre, beyond 
 their own intrinsic qualities.” 
 
 “ But, good God 1” he exclaimed, seduced by a 
 frankness so flattering, struck by a detail, which in 
 delivery opposed the energy of strong feelings to the 
 playfulness of constitutional gaiety, “your solitude 
 after all must be an act of choice, an election made 
 for the noblest purposes— for serving your com- 
 patriots — for cherishing in retreat the enthusiasm, ‘ 
 the true source of genius, and which is so soon lost 
 in the passionless trifling circles of society. You 
 
 have only to appear in the world and to ’ 
 
 “ And to be shown off like a wild beast ; as the 
 woman that writes the books; to be added to the 
 menagerie of such lion leaders as that halfmaniac 
 Lady Dunore; to ‘con wit by rote,’ and ‘ d'sennuyer 
 la sottise and then, having worn out curiosity with 
 novelty, to be sent back to my den, with an assur- 
 ance from my keeper that I am perfectly harmless, 
 and not half so dangerous as might be supposed. 
 Oh, no ! better, far better that I should be shut up 
 with my Irish inheritance of pride, poverty and ta- 
 lent ; better leave the mind in the spacious circuit of 
 its own musing.”

 She smiled, paused, and then continued: “Here, 
 at least, I stand aloof from debasing protection, from 
 the taunt of envy, and the sneer of malignity, the 
 overbearing of upstart pride, the contumely of self- 
 satisfied ignorance. Here, too, I still do some good. 
 I thwart the evil genii of the place, the ogrish Craw- 
 leys, immortalize the supercilious folly of my neigh- 
 bors, which, even here, would look down upon me 
 with that hatred, ‘ all blockheads bear to wit ;’ colo- 
 nize my dear little Clotnottyjoy; encourage the arts, 
 by allowing two and eightpence halfpenny per week 
 to a piper; and give ‘my little senate laws’ — the 
 Cato and Lycurgus of the flourishing city of Bally- 
 dab. Besides, I clo much in giving an example of 
 constant, ceaseless industry and activity to my peo- 
 ple. When I am not writing I am planting pota- 
 toes, or presiding over turf bogs; or I am seated 
 Avith my wheel in a barn, in the midst of the would- 
 be loitering, lounging, lazy matrons of Clotnottyjoy; 
 and A\ r hen the Bhan Tierna’s Avheel goes round, every 
 wheel in the parish turns with it. With all the pre- 
 judices which run so strong in favor of the repre- 
 sentatives of their ancient chiefs on my side, born 
 and reared among them, speaking their language, 
 and assimilating to them in a thousnnd Avays, I have 
 still excited rebellion against my sovereign authority 
 by the innovations of erecting chimneys and filling 
 up pools ; and all my arguments are answered Avith 
 — ‘ Och ! long life to you, my lady; sure you’ll lave 
 us our taste of smoke, madam, anyhow, that keeps 
 the heat in us through the long winter, and not a 
 skreed to cover us. And, mushaj sure the pool, 
 why, is the life of us, madam, in regard of the little

 clacks and pigs; for what would we do with them 
 only for the pool, my lady ? and only them to pay 
 the rint and keep a rag on the child re,’ The worst 
 of it L3 that it is all true,” she added, shaking her 
 head. “ But pray, what do you think of me, Gene- 
 ral Fitzwalter, in the character of Mrs. Larry Hoola- 
 han, pleading the cause of her pigs and poultry ?” 
 
 As she asked this question, she laid her laughing 
 face on her arms, which were now folded on her si- 
 lent wheel, and fixed her dark, round, arched eyes on 
 those of her auditor. 
 
 “ What do I think of you ?” he exclaimed abruptly, 
 and drawing his chair closer to hers, yet with an air 
 of eager impressiveness, which showed him uncon- 
 scious of the act. “ To tell you all I think of you 
 would, perhaps, be as impossible as to follow the 
 changes of your character and your countenance, 
 which have all the brightness and evanescence of a 
 rainbow. What I think of you now is 'lost in what I 
 think of you a moment after. Nor can I, in the Lady 
 Clancare of to-day, trace one feature of the other 
 Lady Clancare whom I beheld, for the first time, a 
 prisoner in the hall of Dunore Castle.” 
 
 “ Well,” she replied, laughing, “ I sometimes almost 
 lose my own identity ; for I am absolutely beyond 
 my own control, and the mere creature of circum- 
 stances ; — giving out properties like certain plants, 
 according to the region in which I am placed ; and 
 resembling the blossom of the Chinese shrub, which 
 is red in the sunshine and white in the shade, and 
 fades and revives under the influence of the peculiar 
 atmosphere in which it is accidentally placed. The 
 strong extremes, and wild vicissitudes of my life have,

 perhaps, given a variegated tone to my character, and 
 a versatility to my mind, not its natural endowments. 
 Abandoned in my infancy by my parents, who went 
 to Spain, my mother’s native land ; left to the care of 
 my genuinely Irish, improvident, and enthusiastic 
 grandfather; brought up with all his Irish pride and 
 prepossessions, among his greyhounds and finders, on 
 the mountains ; left a charge upon the rent-roll of 
 Providence; forced by poverty, and the imprudence of 
 my mother, into a Spanish convent there; released from 
 my unwilling seclusion by her death ; and joyfully fol- 
 lowing a widowed father, amidst the privations of a 
 military life, in a distant land ; reduced to close his 
 eyes among the dying and the dead ; helpless and 
 hopeless, I returned to my native land, to seek the 
 protection of my aged grandfather — to find it in a 
 jail ; to labor for his support and my own ; and, by 
 the light which shone through his prison bars, to trace 
 scenes of fancied joy and ideal happiness. Thus 
 thrown upon life, friendless, unprotected, and depend- 
 ent upon my own exertions for subsistence, I have 
 continued always before the world, yet always in se- 
 clusion ; know T n to ail in my public capacity, to none 
 in my private character. I have carried into society 
 the awkwardness of a recluse, the susceptibility of a 
 sensitive feeling equally alive to notice or to slight ; 
 but, in the freedom of intimacy, in communion with 
 kindred minds, by the ardor of my nature, and in- 
 dulging the easy, extravagant playfulness of my con- 
 stitutional gaiety, I have yielded to still loving the 
 world, yet unable to live in it ; enduring solitude, not 
 enjoying it ; blessed with health, and animated by a 
 spirit that never yet struck sail to vileness, depend-

 ence, or oppression ; noble by chance, an author by 
 necessity, and a woman—” She paused for an in- 
 stant, and then hastily added: “I have given you 
 this little autobiography, General Fitz waiter, to save 
 you the trouble of guessing at me ; for I see you have 
 been conning me over, as children do conundrums, 
 beginning with my first, and getting on to my second, 
 but quite in the dark as to the strange combination 
 which makes my tout . It now lies before you ; and 
 I have thus intruded upon the right of intimacy, and 
 kidnapped you into an unsought confidence, because 
 you have been long known to me ; because your po- 
 sition with respect to Florence Macarthy is known 
 to me : this is my sanction, my excuse. I know you 
 are going to employ me, and I thus put you in pos- 
 session of my bearings, before you instal me in my 
 agency.” 
 
 They had now both arisen ; General Fitzwalter in 
 amazement, in emotion, and admiration, he had no 
 power or inclination to conceal ; Lady Clancare, with 
 the color heightening in her cheek, and her manner 
 less collected, less easy, less disengaged, than when 
 she had first begun to speak. There was a breathless 
 anxiety in her countenance when she paused ; an ap- 
 prehensiveness that seemed relieved by the door 
 opening, and entrance of the maid, who stepped up 
 and whispered something in her ear. 
 
 Whatever this communication might be, it excited 
 considerable confusion; and when the girl had re- 
 ceived her answer, and had hurried out of the room, 
 Lady Clancare, turning round in great embarrass- 
 ment, said, “ General Fitzwalter, you must leave me 
 instantly. Whatever you may have to say relative

 to Colonel Macarthy’s daughter, it must be reserved 
 for another moment ; not now — pray go. This may 
 seem strange, but it is inevitable ; and let me en- 
 treat — ” she clasped her hands, and spoke with great 
 earnestness — “ let me entreat you will not take the 
 road you came — the Dunore road. Turning to your 
 left, you will come out upon the beach. My maid 
 will conduct you. The tide must be out or in: if 
 out, you can ride along the strand; if in, my boat is 
 moored among the rocks. You can paddle it easily; 
 I do myself— and your horse shall be sent after you 
 to O’Leary’s. I had it put up as I entered. Now 
 then go — farewell !” He took the hand she extended 
 to him, and holding it firmly, though it gently strug- 
 gled in his grasp, he said, “ I will go in any way you 
 wish me to go ; but tell me as frankly as I ask the 
 question, is Lord Adelm Fitzadelm the person you 
 expect ? for I perceive I am in somebody’s way.” 
 Lady Clancare interrupted him with the quickness 
 of lightning, and haughtily liberating her hand, she 
 repeated, “ Lord Adelm ! — General Fitzwalter, you 
 are the first person of your sex and rank who ever 
 obtruded upon this solitude, where pride and poverty 
 have sought an asylum, which delicacy and prudence 
 should have rendered inviolable.” 
 
 She turned away her head ; but not before he had 
 perceived her eyes glistening with tears, prompt as 
 her smiles, but infinitely more dangerous. They were 
 the first tears he had ever brought to a woman’s eye ; 
 and from whatever source they sprang, however in- 
 adequate their causes, (and he felt they were inade- 
 quate,) their effect was electric : they left him shocked 
 and confounded, covered with shame and self-re-

 proach. Lady Clancare was moving towards the 
 door : he followed, and prevented her exit. 
 
 “ Lady Clancare,” he said, “ you must take me as I 
 am, as one under the influence of tyrannical feelings, 
 habitually hut vainly combatted. You have thrown 
 me off my guard. I have offended you unwarily : 
 hear me a moment; I will explain to you — — ” 
 
 “No, no! not now. You must leave me; you 
 must not be seen here,” she answered in a hurried 
 voice. 
 
 “ I will not leave you, be the consequence what it 
 may, till you promise me another, and immediate op- 
 portunity of seeing you. I must see you, for my own 
 sake, for Florence Macarthy’s sake, for your sake, 
 perhaps.” 
 
 Lady Clancare turned aside her head as he spoke. 
 Something between a smile and a frown struggled on 
 her countenance, and she replied : 
 
 “I ought not, I cannot receive you here by ap- 
 pointment under my own roof. You can write to 
 Florence Macarthy ; I will convey your letter ; I will 
 do every thing to forward her happiness, short of en- 
 dangering my own character; but leave me now, I 
 entreat, I insist.” 
 
 “ I have written,” he said, .producing a letter, 
 a but—” he hesitated, and still held it back, as if un- 
 willing to part with it,— u but I know not how far 
 this letter may now’— — ” 
 
 Lady Clancare snatched it eagerly, and placed it 
 in her bosom. u There,” she said, “ she shall have it 
 immediately : you may depend on me where she is 
 concerned, and I will forward you her answer. I 
 told you you would employ me : but remember this

 visit, so unexpected on my part, so unwarranted on 
 yours, is not to be repeated, and never to be revealed 
 —remember that.” 
 
 “ Never to be revealed ! I swear solemnly,” he re- 
 plied, with energy; “but by all that is sacred, I will 
 not leave this country without seeing you again ; 
 without seeing you here. Observe me, Lady Clan- 
 care ; I am a man who has fought against a wayward 
 fortune ; by the force of perseverance, firmness, de- 
 cision, and enterprise, success has followed the bias 
 of these natural impulsions. I have no other guides, 
 and I shall still obey them. If you are the owner 
 of that handkerchief ; if you are the person who — ” 
 He paused and then added in a hurried tone, “ That 
 ascertained, I shall then come once more, and bid 
 you an eternal farewell. If Florence Macarthy, on 
 the contrary, is the invisible demon or angel who fol- 
 lows, or rather leads, the steps of Lord Adelm, 
 then 
 
 “ The marchioness is walking up the court, my 
 lady, and has left her coach at the gates below,” said 
 the maid, putting in her wild head with a fluttered 
 look. Lady Clancare stamped her little foot with 
 impatience. “ Go now, for God’s sake I” she cried. 
 
 “ Do you then,” he said, seizing her hand, and 
 with a countenance which had undergone a rapid 
 change since the maid had announced Lady Dunore as 
 the expected visitor, “ do you return to the castle 
 with her — with Lady Dunore to-day ?” 
 
 “Yes, yes, I dine there; but if you notice me 
 there, or anywhere, without my special permission, 
 you lose me forever— that is, you lose the benefit of 
 my agency with Florence Macarthy. Now, then,

 pray follow the servant ; she will conduct you to the 
 beach. 5 ’ 
 
 He had half raised her hand to his lips while she 
 was speaking, but he suddenly dropped it and fol- 
 lowed the maid, who led him through the stone passage 
 to a little door that opened on the strand. There he 
 found his horse fastened by the bridle to an iron an- 
 chorage ring in the rocks. The tide was coming in, 
 but lie outgalloped its stealing progress, and arrived 
 with incredible celerity at Monaster-ny-Oriel. 
 
 He found O’Leary before the door of the chauntry, 
 exposing to the air a large open deal box, lined with 
 pictures of saints and devils, his countenance full of 
 bustling importance, and his voice raised to the high- 
 est pitch, singing Carolan’s famous “lleceipt for 
 Drinking . 55 
 
 “I was just, plaze„your honor,” said O Leary, 
 coming forward to take the general’s horse as he 
 alighted, “ I was just airing my chest, sir, in respect 
 of getting ready for our journey, and was conning in 
 my own mind, when your honor galloped up, whether 
 it would contain my Genealogical History of the 
 Macarthies, or whether I’d divide them into two turf 
 kishes, just to make a show travelling through the 
 country ; for when Carte got lave to take the Or- 
 monde papers out of the evidence chamber at Kil- 
 kenny Castle, to compose the life of the great Duke 
 of Ormonde, he filled three Irish cars with them; 
 and I’d be sorry, troth, that the documents of the 
 real Irish Macarthies-More, Kings of Munster, would 
 be of less bulk than the papers of them Saxon 
 churls, the Butlers.” 
 
 “ I am afraid, however,” said the general, smiling,

 “ we must dispense with their honorable burthen in 
 our immediate journey, O’Leary.” 
 
 “ We must, gineral?” replied O'Leary, in a tone of 
 mortification ; “ and there being mixed through the 
 Macarthy papers many notes and codices,” he added, 
 in a whispering voice, “ that might be serviceable on 
 the trial ; for they’ll fight a great fight afore they give 
 up, sir, and right vanquisheth might.” 
 
 “ I am not so certain of that,” said General Fitz- 
 walter; “ but at all events, O’Leary, I shall not leave 
 this country as soon as I expected.” 
 
 “You won’t, gineral?” he replied, with a counte- 
 nance expressive of curiosity and surprise ; then, after 
 a pause, he added, “ Och ! then I’ll have my docu- 
 ments home from the lord deputy before we start. 
 And thinks Moriagh will plaze you, the day, in regard 
 of a dinner, sir, and ordered a bottle of Portugal 
 wine from the Dunore Arms myself, your honor, just 
 in honor of the day ;” and he looked at the general 
 significantly. 
 
 “ I am glad of it,” said the general ; “ but I shall 
 not dine here ; I dine at Dunore Castle.” 
 
 O'Leary started, put his hand under his wig, with 
 a look of perplexity, but only repeated, “At Dunore 
 Castle !” then giving the horse to one of his scholars, 
 who was waiting about the ruins, -he followed the 
 general to his tower, observing, “Well, gineral, so 
 you didn’t see the Bhan Tierna after all, I’ll ingage.” 
 “ Why should you think that ?” 
 
 “ Because, plaze your honor, I heard she was in 
 the mountains the morning, seeing the praties got in, 
 and sorrow^ a foot she’d lave that for the King of 
 England, if he was to come to see her. Och ! she’s a

 great farmer, and has done more for Clotnottyjoy in 
 a year and a half than the Crawleys ever could ; in 
 respect of the hearts and hands of the whole country 
 being with her, and her giving every man his own 
 little lase.” 
 
 To this observation the general made no reply ; 
 and they ascended the stairs together ; the guest to 
 dress, and the host, under pretence of assisting him, 
 to loiter about his person.

 General Fitz Walter was dressed for dinner a full 
 hour before the usual time of assembling at Dunore 
 Castle. All his motions were involuntarily acceler- 
 ated ; a feverish restlessness urged his most trivial 
 actions : his whole existence had received a new im- 
 pulsion by the operation of one unaccustomed and 
 absorbing sentiment; an overpowering motive had 
 unexpectedly sprung up to actuate his conduct ; and 
 the obedient will followed its spring with a prompti 
 tude and energy consonant to his nature and his 
 habits. 
 
 Woman, who had hitherto imperiously governed 
 his senses, now for the first time obtained a moral 
 influence over his mind, and became, not the object 
 of a caprice, but of a passion ; and passion, whatever 
 might be its cause, w r as his element. 
 
 The person of Lady Clancare was not particularly 
 distinguished by its beauty, but it was characteristic. 
 Fresh, healthful and intelligent, she had neither the 
 symmetry of statuary loveliness, nor the brilliant 
 coloring of pictured charms ; but she was piquante, 
 graceful and vivacious : her mouth and teeth were

 well compared by O’Leary to those of a young 
 hound ; her head was picturesque, and her whole ap- 
 pearance the very personification of womanhood. 
 Silent, and at rest, she was scarcely distinguishable 
 from the ordinary class of women ; but when her 
 countenance was thrown into play, when she spoke 
 with the anxiety to please, or the consciousness of 
 pleasing, there was a nobility, a variety of expression 
 and coloring, which corresponded with the vigor, 
 spirit and energy of her extraordinary mind. 
 
 This indication, which might have repelled others, 
 was the charm that fascinated Fitz waiter. The 
 
 kindling susceptibility it betrayed harmonized with 
 his own prompt and impetuous disposition, bespeak- 
 ing a congeniality of feeling, and a reciprocity of 
 intelligence, which he had never found in man, which 
 he had never sought for in woman, and which, 
 whether it took the calm and steady form of friend- 
 ship, or the bright intoxicating aspect of love, was 
 still the object of his unconscious research, and the 
 indispensable ingredient of his permanent schemes of 
 happiness. 
 
 This conviction struck at once upon his imagina- 
 tion with that force which accompanied all its strong 
 and promptly received impressions. It awakened 
 his passions in all their natural vehemence ; and, im- 
 patient of all suspense, ill-brooking inevitable delay, 
 he would have gone at once to the “ head and front” 
 of his views and hopes ; he would, in his own lan- 
 guage, have followed their object “ from pole to pole, 
 over alps and oceans, or have remained fixed and 
 rooted to the spot she inhabited, wooed her, won 
 her, clung to her, and cherished her and, according

 to the startling conclusion of Lord Adelxn, “ married 
 her;” but that he was already married — married, at 
 least, he considered himself, in honor, in gratitude, 
 until she who shared his bondage voluntarily broke it. 
 
 There was, too, another barrier to the impulse of 
 his passionate feelings. It was just possible that all 
 he admired and all he sought was devoted to another. 
 Those powers and endowments, so attractive in his 
 eyes, might be applied to the subjection of cue who 
 would only prize them so long as their versatility and 
 ingenuity could confirm and feed his visionary tastes 
 and metaphysical delusions ; so long as they could ex- 
 cite ideal prepossessions in favor of the invisible 
 agent, which the actual woman would probably nei- 
 ther awaken nor perpetuate. 
 
 From several corroborating circumstances, Fitz- 
 walter was almost convinced that Lady Clancai e was 
 the Egeria, the demon of Lord Adclm, who had 
 either watched over or bewildered him, had made 
 him the object of her care, or the victim of her ca- 
 price, since his arrival in Ireland. Her knowledge of 
 himself his name, and profession, which she had re- 
 vealed to Lord Adelm, might have come through de- 
 tails received from her cousin, Florence Macarthy ; 
 but where she could have seen him in Ireland, or how 
 Miss Macarthy had learned his arrival, were still 
 enigmas. 
 
 The talent and love for the embroglio which Lady 
 Clancare had herself confessed to have inherited from 
 her Spanish mother, and which took from the sim- 
 plicity of her character what it added to its spirit 
 and ingenuity, pointed her out as the agent of mys- 
 tery, who had directed the conduct and led the steps

 of the accomplished idealist ; and who had summoned 
 around her “ most willing spirits to do her service” 
 in the incongruous forms of Mrs. Magillicuddy and 
 Owny, the Rabragh. The object of employing so 
 clumsy an agent as the former was not very obvious ; 
 but tiie latter personage was manifestly devoted to 
 her orders, and might for many reasons be deemed 
 capable of promoting her still inexplicable views. 
 He was her foster-brother, that bond of service and 
 devotion so sacred in Ireland. She had also relieved 
 him from misery and incarceration by her exertion 
 and interference. He had conveyed her from Dunore 
 to Dublin, according to O’Leary’s account, and he 
 might, on her return to the south, have been naturally 
 summoned to meet her at Cashel, either to carry her 
 home, or to “ do her behests.” 
 
 Irishmen of his class, endowed with zeal, activity, 
 and evasion, might with great probability have en- 
 gaged in any scheme to forward the interests of his 
 benevolent patroness, as he would be true to any 
 trust reposed in him ; more especially by that popu- 
 lar Bhan Tierna, whose health he had pledged at'the 
 cottage at Lis-na-sleugh with a solemnity almost 
 religious. 
 
 This act had not escaped the observation of Fitz- 
 walter, and these suppositions and inferences (quite 
 possible, and more than probable) were gradually 
 worked out, distinctly examined, and rapidly com- 
 bined in his fluctuating thoughts, as he pursued his 
 way on foot to Dunore Castle. To a mind so quick 
 in its perceptions, so energetic in all its workings, 
 slight data were sufficient to lead to a just result ; and

 his natural acuteness got the start in this, as in many- 
 other instances of progressive investigation. 
 
 To detect Lady Clancare in her concealed and 
 mysterious character was one thing; to ascertain the 
 motive, to arrive at the object of her singular and al- 
 most equivocal conduct, was another. His life had 
 not been a life of reflection ; and woman, though fre- 
 quently an object of his devotion, had never been to 
 him a subject of analysis. Yet he knew enough of 
 the general principles of human nature to understand 
 that human conduct must be motived by passion ; and 
 he could conceive but one passion incidental to fe- 
 male existence — and that was love. 
 
 He would have decided at once that Lady Clancare 
 was in love with Lord Adelm, but that the supposi- 
 tion was too painful to indulge. He knew not why, 
 but it maddened him; and he was rescued from its 
 poignancy by the reflection that Lord Adelm had 
 never seen her, except on her first appearance in the 
 hall of Dunore, where she had given him the impres- 
 sion of being a mere minaudiere , a caprice of his mo- 
 ther. As a woman of talent, one, too, who had ob- 
 tained celebrity by that talent, Lord Adelm would 
 have detested her ; and the spirit and vigor of mind 
 which made her charm with Fitz waiter, would have 
 rendered her insupportable in the eyes of one who 
 placed the perfection of woman in her fatuity. Still 
 he believed that, in spite of her equivocal and playful 
 evasion, the handkerchief found by Lord Adelm was 
 purposely dropped by Lady Clancare. The motive 
 of this mystery, as well as the train of events in which 
 he had in some respects been involved himself since 
 his arrival in Ireland, remained unfathomable.

 The suspicions which now gradually lighted on 
 the head of Lady Clancare were necessarily with- | 
 drawn from Florence Macarthy, the refugee of the ; 
 Convent of the Annunciation. With this person the : 
 fate of General Fitzwalter was strangely linked. His 
 connection with the daughter of the brave Colonel 
 Macarthy, to which he had alluded in his conversa- 
 tion with Lady Clancare. and with which, to his 
 amazement, and a little to his confusion, that lady 
 had confessed she was already acquainted, was a ro- 
 mantic episode in the strange history of his eventful 
 life. To that event memory referred with a painful 
 sensation that originated in feelings not at rest with 
 themselves. If there was one circumstance in Lis life 
 which had left a shadow behind it, it was his connec- 
 tion with Florence Macarthy. 
 
 His efforts to become reconciled to himself were 
 reduced to a proposal, which, hastily conceived, and 
 as hastily executed, wuis contained in the letter 
 which he now lamented having trusted to Lady Clan- 
 care. 
 
 The business which had brought him to Ireland 
 was effected. It was his interest to return imme- 
 diately to England, and he could give to himself no 
 plausible cause of delay, but the necessity he fancied 
 or believed himself to be under, of waiting an answer 
 to the letter he had dispatched to Florence Ma- 
 carthy. It would have been more consonant to his 
 habitual modes of acting himself to have flown to her 
 convent, and sought a personal interview, an imme- 
 diate and decisive sentence ; but his feelings opposed 
 themselves to a conduct so natural ; and he was more 
 inclined to defer, than to expedite, personal comma-

 nication with one whose presence could only awaken 
 ungracious associations, and who was perhaps the 
 only human being in existence before whom he would 
 have blushed to present himself. 
 
 After a long, slow-paced, circuitous route, consid- 
 erably lengthened in fact, but shortened in idea, by 
 the agitation of his thoughts, and the preoccupation 
 of his mind, he at last arrived at the portico of Dun- 
 ore ; and, with the exception of old Crawley, who 
 had left Dunore that morning for Dublin, and of 
 Lord Adelm, who had not yet returned, he found the 
 usual party assembled in the great hall of the castle, 
 and disposed in a manner as ludicrous as it was un- 
 expected. 
 
 Lady Dunore occupied the foreground. She stood, 
 with a coarse bib and apron tied over her superb din- 
 ner dress of crimson satin, and filled with green rushes, 
 which she was fastening in sheaves. The floor was 
 spread with the same materials, which Mr. Heneage, 
 Mr. Pottinger, and Miss Crawley were engaged in 
 peeling; while Mr. Daly and Conway Crawley were 
 reading the papers ; and Lord Rosbrin, covered with 
 rushes, was spouting “Mad Tom;’ 5 Lord Frederick 
 and Lady Georgiana, as usual, were lounging on an 
 ottoman, and laughing together at the whole party. 
 At the sight of General Fitzwalter, Lady Dunore 
 sprung delightedly forward, and welcomed him with 
 an ardor for which even vanity itself could find no 
 adequate cause. 
 
 “ This is so good of you,” she said, “ so unexpect- 
 edly kind ! Fitzadelm endeavored to persuade me 
 this morning that you were bored to death with us 
 all ; that we did not in the least amuse you ; that you

 were engaged in business and law, and things ; that, 
 in short, you would neither breakfast, dine, nor sup 
 with us; and that, as to sleeping, you would as soon 
 take up your lodging in Bedlam. You can’t imagine 
 how this fretted and annoyed me, because I wanted 
 
 you for a particular ” She paused abruptly, and 
 
 added, “ that is, I wanted you to, to — help me to peel 
 rushes. You see we are all occupied with this rush 
 manufactory. I hope, if you settle in this neighbor- 
 hood, which perhaps,” she added, with a significant 
 look, “you may, that you will encourage the rush 
 manufactory ; for the whole misery of this country, 
 General Fitz waiter, arises out of the w^ant of work, 
 and food, and things. Isn’t it so, Lady Clancare ?” 
 General Fitzwalter followed the direction of this 
 question, and, not without emotion, perceived Lady 
 Clancare seated in the arm-chair at the back of the 
 hall, which the preceding day had been occupied by 
 one of the judges. She looked pale and spiritless, as 
 one exhausted, and under the reaction of overex- 
 citement. She colored, however, slightly at Lady 
 Dunore’s appeal, and returned an affirmative but si- 
 lent nod of the head. Every one smiled, and this 
 smile increased the color in her cheek. 
 
 “ The fact is,” continued Lady Dunore, following 
 the general’s eyes with triumphant satisfaction in 
 her own, “ no one knows anything of the real state 
 of this country but Lady Clancare. She has given 
 me an entirely new view of things. It is too dread- 
 ful, too heartrending. It is all a tragedy clu plus 
 beau noir . I have cried myself sick as l drove here.” 
 Every one tittered, the Crawdeys almost aubibly ; 
 and Lady Clancare colored deeper than before.

 “ The miracle is,” said Lady Dunore, in a vehement 
 manner, and wholly engrossed with her own sensa- 
 tions, “ the miracle is that they don’t all arise and 
 murder us. They will do so soon ; and I think they 
 are quite justified. I wbuld not bring them to trial 
 if they were to murder my whole household. I will 
 have no more secret committees, no more green bags 
 and special commissions ; 4 employ, not hang,’ that’s 
 my maxim now. It is, however, curious enough to 
 see people troubling their heads about elections and 
 evangelical schools, and private theatricals and cha- 
 pels, and bible societies and things, when the people 
 to be represented are starving ; the people to be edi- 
 fied, amused and instructed, are literally perishing 
 for want. Give them something to eat first, and 
 then instruct them; teach them to labor, and then to 
 read; give them wants that civilize humanity, and 
 that raise them above the brute creation, and then 
 edify them ; for, after all, the first law of nature is to 
 exist. People must live, in order to live piously; 
 and it is a fact that bread is as necessary as books ; 
 and if people will die of the typhus from cold, want 
 and filth, why they cannot then read the multitude 
 of evangelical tracts which are written for their use, 
 and population will thin as tracts multiply. Is it not 
 so, Lady Clancare ?” 
 
 This question, asked with emphatic gravity, ex- 
 cited new smiles of ridicule or amusement; for all 
 were quite aware that Lady Dunore’s inspiration 
 and authority came from the same source— a source 
 which now, for the moment, ruled the ascendant. 
 Meantime, Lady Clancare’s downcast but rapidly 
 moving eyes seemed to take in the suffrages of the

 whole circle. She colored, and only replied to Lady 
 Dunore’s parroted details with another oracular nod, 
 while the officiating priestess went on under the in- 
 fluence of her delpliic deity: 
 
 “No one can be more devoted to the Irish Go- 
 vernment than I am, and all their measures ; and I 
 think our Irish secretary the cleverest little creature 
 in the world, as I said to the premier, after he made 
 
 his maiden speech. As to the viceregal B s, 
 
 they happen to be my particular friends, and I was 
 quite - delighted they got such a good thing, poor 
 dears ! and, in fact, they could not have gotten on at 
 all if they had not been sent over here, and got their 
 thirty thousand a year. But when it comes to con- 
 sidering Ireland in its actual state; and when one 
 hears you, Mr. Pottinger, talk of your Lady Lieuten- 
 ant’s encouraging the Irish manufactures, because 
 she wears a tabinet gown on St. Patrick’s night, or 
 St. Patrick’s day, or in St. Patrick’s Church ; or, 
 what is it, Lord Frederick, about the kettle-drums 
 and things, and Noodle and Doodle? And you, Mr. 
 Conway Crawley, talking of the Chief Secretary’s 
 expedients and measures of necessary coercion, his 
 eminent worth and that sort of thing, when all he 
 can know of Ireland must be collected from such 
 people as you and your father; or, as he whirls 
 through the country in a chaise-and-four to shoot 
 partridge or grouse at Lord Clan — this, or Lord Kill 
 — t’others ; some of your new-made lords, par exem- 
 ple, who are excellent people, only no one cares 
 much about them with us ; it’s quite too ridiculous ! 
 Don’t you think so, Lady Clancare ? and when the 
 prettiest rush- work in the world might be done, and

 F ! encouraged by them all, as it is done, at that very 
 j ancient ruinous town of Ballydab, the Irish Balbec, 
 as one may call it. For my part, I shall employ all 
 the poor at Dunore at rush- work. I’ll have rush so- 
 • fas, rush chairs, rush mats, rush fillagree, rush lights, 
 ! and rush carpets ; everything, in short, that can be 
 1 made of rushes.’ , 
 
 ! i “ Then,” said Lord Rosbrin, flourishing about the 
 hall, 
 
 i “ Then shall we wantons, light of heart, 
 
 Tickle the senseless rushes with our heels.” 
 
 Here dinner was announced, and Lord Adelm 
 alighted at the door at the same moment, and went 
 to dress. The rest of the party proceeded to the 
 dining-room. 
 
 Mr. Daly officiated at the head of the table, in the 
 place" of Lord Fitzadelm. Lady Clancare took the 
 seat her rank assigned her, on his right hand. Lady 
 Dunore took hers by the side of Lady Clancare ; and 
 she contrived to place General Fitzwalter opposite to 
 both, by directing him to a seat, most mal-apropos, 
 between Miss Crawley and her nephew. There was 
 something in the presence of this extraordinary 
 stranger which had becofne extremely irksome to 
 the Crawleys. They had received a sort of half-given 
 confidence respecting him from old Crawley, which 
 had terrified and confounded them ; and though, 
 either in timidity or distrust, he had never fully and 
 explicitly opened his heart to them on a subject 
 which began to oppress his conscience in proportion 
 i as it awakened his apprehension, they had yet ga- 
 thered enough to inspire considerable alarm ; and 
 they had urged the old man to go to Dublin, previous

 to his election for Glannacrime, for the purpose of 
 anticipating or frustrating a discovery, which could 
 not long be retarded, and was pregnant with evil to 
 the character, influence, and property of the whole 
 Crawley family. 
 
 Miss Crawley and her nephew now sat silent on 
 either side of their ill-boding neighbor ; while Lady 
 Dunore, with her mouth in Lady Clancare’s ear, and 
 her eyes fixed on General Fitzwalter, continued 
 wholly inattentive to the rest of her guests. 
 
 Lord Adelm entered the room with the second 
 course. 
 
 “ How did you get on at Glannacrime, Fitzadelm ?” \ 
 asked Lady Dunore, carelessly, as soon as he had 
 finished his soup. 
 
 “ I don’t know exactly what your ladyship’s ques- 
 tion points at, but I got off as soon as I could.” 
 
 “ Did you speak to them ?” she returned, with a 
 look of nausea ; “ I mean, to those horrors, the forty- 
 shilling freeholders ?” 
 
 “ Speak ! oh, yes, of course, ‘ in wholesome manner, 
 madam.’ ” 
 
 “ Indeed! Well, and what did you say, my dear 
 Adelm?” continued Lady Dunore, with a little in- 
 creasing interest. 
 
 “1 bid them wash their faces, and keep clean their 
 teeth, and so troubled them no further.” 
 
 “ That must have surprised them,” said Lady Du- 
 nore, much pleased with what she took very literally ; 
 
 “ but it was excellent advice.” 
 
 “ I think it must have astonished them a little,” 
 said Mr. Daly, laughing. 
 
 “ Yes,” observed Lord Rosbrin, “ it must ; but you

 might have chosen a better speech, Fitzadelm. You 
 should have said, as I did from the hustings of Kil- 
 rosbrin, before they got me into the upper house : 
 
 ; Your voices ! For your voices I have fought, — 
 Watched for your voices ; for your voices bear 
 Of wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six 
 I’ve' seen and heard of. For your voices have 
 Done many things, some more, some less !’ ” 
 
 “ And did they believe you, my patriotic Corioros- 
 brin?” asked Lord Frederick, languidly. 
 
 “ Yes,” replied Lord Rosbrin, abstractedly. “The 
 first citizen said — 
 
 ‘ He has done nobly.’ 
 
 The second citizen — 
 
 ‘ Therefore let him be consul. 
 
 The gods give him joy, and make him friend 
 To the people.’ 
 
 And all cried— 
 
 ‘ Amen ! amen ! God save the noble consul !’ 
 
 And then exeunt O. P. I speak from Covent Garden 
 prompt-book.” 
 
 “ Had I known of your lordship’s intention of visit- 
 ing Glannacrime this morning,” said young Crawley, 
 “1 should have accompanied you.” 
 
 “It was quite unnecessary,” said Lord A delm, coldly. 
 
 “ How were you received, Fitzadelm ?” asked Mr. 
 Daly. 
 
 “Not at all; they did not know me. I look upon 
 it as against the freedom of election to come forward 
 personally. I went, however, to their sessions-house, 
 where a committee was sitting in my favor. I told 
 them Lord Adelm’s opinion in a few words : that he 
 was aware they would elect him if they could make 
 anything of it ; but that they would sell him and their

 votes together, if they could make more by the bar- 
 gain.” 
 
 “ That must have widened the little eyes of the 
 yellow buttons and peacock’s feathers,” observed Lord 
 Frederick, laughingly. 
 
 “ It is a new mode of electioneering,” said Mr. 
 Daly, evidently pleased with his grand-nephew. 
 
 “ And will doubtless succeed,” said Conway Craw- 
 ley, in a whisper to Mr. Pottinger. 
 
 Conversation now took a desultory turn, and the 
 ladies retired early. Lady Dunore and Lady Clan- 
 care walked from the dining-room into the court, 
 though it was after nightfall. Lady Georgiana went 
 to sleep, as usual, in order to call up her looks for the 
 evening ; and Miss Crawley retired to brood over her 
 own venom, which every hour was increasing by the 
 events of the day. 
 
 Mr. Pottinger had scarcely bowed out the ladies, 
 and closed the door after them, when Lord Adelm 
 beckoned General Fitzwalter to the window. 
 
 Well,” he said, with a lock of anxious impatience 
 
 “Well!” said the general, something perplexed. 
 “ I have nothing to tell you, save that the person to 
 whom I alluded this morning is not, cannot be, your 
 sylph, your woman.” 
 
 He dwelt with a species of inveteracy on the latter 
 word; and Lord Adelm, pronouncing with a sigh of 
 disappointment, and a look of mortification, “ I thought 
 so, and I am now as far as ever from the ideal 
 presence,” they both resumed their seats. 
 
 The gentlemen sat late ; conversation had taken a 
 wide range. When they adjourned to the drawing- 
 room, even the most temperate were a little animated,

 if not flushed, by Lady Dunore’s excellent claret ; yet 
 scarcely more wine had been taken than served to 
 dissipate the apathetic dulness which, in spite of Lady 
 Dunore’s own impetuous spirits and vivacious charac- 
 ter, habitually presided over the circle at Dunore. 
 
 When the men entered the drawing-room, they 
 found it only occupied by Lady Georgiana and Miss 
 Crawley ; the former, with her elegantly draped figure, 
 lying apparently half asleep on a canopied couch ; the 
 latter, seated near her, was so occupied in some nar- 
 ration she was muttering, that the gentlemen had ad- 
 vanced into the middle of the room before she ob- 
 served them. Lady Georgiana, with a pretty affected 
 start of astonishment, opened her soft, languid eyes, 
 and made an effort to rise. Lord Rosbrin, meantime 
 hanging over her, exclaimed — 
 
 “ Her body sleeps in Capulet’s monument, 
 
 While her immortal part with angels live.” 
 
 “ I think,” said Lord Frederick, taking his coffee, 
 and throwing himself on a divan, near Lady Geor- 
 giana, “ we all appear to be buried in the tomb of the 
 Capulets. I had no idea the divine Marchesa meant 
 to consign us all to such immortal dulness. We are 
 already almost reduced aux muets interpretes , and 
 shall gradually fall into the eloquent silence of that 
 round-eyed, tongue-tied Lady Clancare, who, par 
 parenthese , looks as if she were extracting us all for 
 her common-place book, and will doubtless bring us 
 out in hot-press, sans dire gar /” 
 
 “ I doubt she will ever bring out anything half so 
 good,” said Conway Crawley ; “ as yet that is not in 
 her line; she has had too few opportunities of 
 studying fashionable life to attempt anything in that

 way. Her position here, at least, is so extremely ob- 
 scure, that I believe the castle of Dunore is the first 
 fine house in the country into which she was ever ad- 
 mitted.” 
 
 “ And,” said Miss Crawley, smiling, and in spite of 
 her former discomfiture unable to contain her acri- 
 monious spirit, “ and perhaps it may be her last.” 
 
 “ Her principles,” continued young Crawley, “ as 
 disseminated in her ‘ National Tales,’ as she calls 
 them, are sufficient to keep her out of good society 
 here.” 
 
 “ I thought I had heard you say, Mr. Crawley,” 
 observed Mr. Daly, “ that you did not know Lady 
 Clancare was an author ?” 
 
 “ I did not till this morning,” said Crawley, a little 
 confused. “ When Lady Dunore mentioned the titles 
 of her works, and the initials representing the 
 author’s name, I recollected having looked over those 
 tomes of absurdity and vagueness, of daring blas- 
 phemy, of affectation, of bad taste, bombast, and non- 
 sense, blunders, ignorance, jacobinism, falsehood, 
 licentiousness, and impiety, which it now seems are 
 the effusions of the pseudo Lady Clancare.” 
 
 Young Crawley, already flushed with wine, grew 
 still more red with rage as he spoke. 
 
 “ Oh, my dear Mr. Crawley,” interrupted Lord 
 Frederick, with unusual vivacity, “ say no more, or 
 you will make us in love with the author and her 
 work together ; for, really, a book that could com- 
 bine all these terrific heterogeneous qualities, and yet 
 be read, must be very extraordinary : pour le moins .” 
 “ Very extraordinary indeed,” said Mr. Daly, “ con- 
 sidering that with all these vices and faults they have

 465 
 
 been so read, and bought, as to realize an inde- 
 pendence for their author, and enable her to carry on 
 a suit which has deprived the elder Mr. Crawley of 
 his dear Clottnottyjoy. It would at least appear that, 
 in spite of professional criticism, the public are al- 
 ways with her.” 
 
 “ Oh, her flippant and arrogant ignorance has its 
 market,” returned Conway Crawdey, “ and the 
 sylphed Miss Macarthy, the elegant Lady Clancare, 
 is, in fact, a mere bookseller’s drudge. Her impu- 
 dent falsehoods, and lies by implication, the impious 
 jargon of this mad woman, this audacious worm ” 
 
 “ Are you speaking of Lady Clancare, sir ?” said 
 General Fitzwalter, who had been talking to Lord 
 Adelm, but who now turned shortly round on young 
 Crawley with a tone and look that stunned the 
 hardy railer ; “ are you applying such language to a 
 woman — to any woman ?” 
 
 “ I — I — -I was speaking, sir,” said young Crawley, 
 nearly sobered at once, and growing pale at this ad- 
 dress, “ that is, I was repeating the criticism of a 
 celebrated periodical review, which may, perhaps, be 
 deemed severe, but which is edited by men of the 
 most — — ” 
 
 “ Men ! do you call them,” said General Fitzwalter, 
 with a sharp, contemptuous laugh, and turning on his 
 heel. “ Men, indeed i” 
 
 A momentary silence ensued. The indignant con- 
 tempt with which General Fitzwalter had fixed his 
 eyes on Crawley was observed by all. Crawley was 
 physically timid; he shrunk back, and took up a 
 book ; Miss Craw ley changed color ; and at that mo- 
 ment the marchioness entered, leaning on Lady Clan-

 care’s arm. They were both wrapped in their shawls ; 
 and the freshness of the evening air, and the deep 
 coloring of exercise, gave a vivid brightness to their 
 complexions. 
 
 “ We have had a delicious walk of some miles ; 
 two or three, I believe,” said Lady Dunore, sinking 
 into a chair, and calling for coffee ; while Lady Clan- 
 care modestly took her seat rather behind than be- 
 side, so as just to raise her face over the back of 
 Lady Dunore’s chair, in a position equally shy and 
 observing. For a moment she attracted every eye, 
 and all sought to trace in her countenance some indi- 
 cation of the audacious, lying, profligate, ignorant 
 and pretending jacobin. 
 
 “ There is nothing, after all,” said Lady Dunore, 
 gradually unmuffling herself, “ like the security, and 
 moonlight, and things of that kind, of Ireland. I am 
 so in love with my Irish solitudes, that I am not cer- 
 tain I shall not remain here through the winter.” 
 
 “ Then, marchioness of my affections,” said Lord 
 Frederick, “ I must beg my bouquet d ’ adieu ; for 
 though I agree in the old sentimental tag of La soli- 
 tude est une belle chose , yet — — ” 
 
 “ Oh, sweet love,” interrupted Lady Georgiana, 
 who, as well as Lord Frederick, had her reasons for 
 disliking the extreme smallness of the petit comite , in 
 which they had lived at Dunore, and which placed 
 every one so constantly before the eyes of the others 
 — “oh, sweet love, you have no idea what an ex- 
 cellent society you have about you, if you would but 
 let in the Aborigines . Miss Crawley has been amus- 
 ing me this evening with a description of your neigh- 
 bors for twenty miles round. I dare say they would

 amuse you greatly. Now do, Miss Crawley, pray 
 show your list to Lady D. Miss Crawley has made 
 out a list for you, Ma Heine 
 
 n Oh, you may let in who you like,” said Lady Du- 
 nore : “ I shall not in the least object, if there are 
 cups and saucers and things for the Irish ladies, who 
 are monstrously particular, I hear; and provided 
 they won’t expect me to go to them in return, they 
 may come and welcome. Who shall we have ? Who 
 shall we let in, Lady Clancare ? Who is there really 
 presentable and amusing ? But mind, I won’t have 
 any circulars ; I won’t have those Chinese hiero- 
 glyphics, with their tails in their mouths, that is the 
 serpents — what is it, Lord Frederick, about eternity, 
 you know, and the Chinese mandarin? You have 
 no idea how that word 1 eternity 7 ennuies me. Now 
 come, Lady Clancare, do speak : who shall we have ? 
 Is there no one at Balbec, at Ballydab I mean ?” 
 
 The Crawleys laughed (aside), but were yet heard 
 and seen by all, Lady Dunore excepted, who was 
 now arranging her dishevelled hair at a mirror over 
 the chimney-piece. 
 
 “ I should like to make you, dear Lady Clancare, 
 my returning officer, as old Mr. Crawley says of the 
 electioneering business. Now who shall we have ?” 
 and she resumed her seat. 
 
 Lady Clancare begged, in her low soft voice, to 
 have the office assigned to Miss Crawley, who was so ♦ 
 much better known in the neighborhood. 
 
 “ Oh, dear ! no, ma’am,” minced Miss Crawley : “ I 
 could not think of obtruding on your ladyship’s pro- 
 vince.” 
 
 “ Now pray do as Lady Clancare desires you, Miss

 Crawley,” said Lady Dunore with her usual income * 
 quent and peremptory tone. “ Rosbrin, draw the 
 writing-table near me: you shall be secretary to the 
 committee ; you shall name the persons, Miss Craw- 
 ley ; and then we’ll talk them over, and elect accord- 
 ingly.” 
 
 Miss Crawley now advanced in implicit obedience 
 to the commanding fiat of her future neophyte, 
 Every one gathered round the table placed before 
 Lady Dunore, except General Fitzwalter and Lord 
 Adelm. The one stood aloof, looking partly in curi- 
 osity, and partly, perhaps, in contempt, on this group 
 of grown children; the other was stretched upon a 
 sofa, -occupying a recess window, and partly shadowed 
 by its drapery. 
 
 “ Let us see,” said Lady Dunore, taking a paper 
 out of Miss Crawley’s hand, on which she had written 
 some names. “ Who is this ? Lady Lisson ! Who 
 is she, Miss Crawley ?” 
 
 “ She is a young widow lady, madam, of large for- 
 tune. They say she has more diamonds than the 
 queen ; and is niece to our bishop, with whom she is 
 now on a visit.” 
 
 “ Do you know anything of her, Lady Clancare ?” 
 said the marchioness, turning coolly to her “ Cynthia 
 of the minute,” 
 
 “ I have seen her,” said Lady Clancare, in her 
 wonted tone and look of real or affected simplicity. 
 
 “ Is she presentable ? What is she like ?” 
 
 “ Like ?” said Lady Clancare, as if searching for 
 some object of comparison—' “ like a diamond beetle 
 —small, shining, and insignificant. You would find 
 her tiresome for anything exclusive, but she might

 answer for a ball — you might ask her to that, on the 
 strength of her diamond necklace ; it helps to dress a 
 room.” 
 
 This was the first sentence Lady Clancare had ut- 
 tered aloud since her introduction at the castle ; and 
 its oddity, contrasted to her timid look, had its due 
 effect. 
 
 “ Oh ! put her down, by all means, Rosbrin,” cried 
 Lord Frederick, laughing. “ Down with the diamond 
 * beetle, with a ‘ N. B. The necklace to be included in 
 the invitation.’ ” 
 
 “And who is this, my dear Miss Crawley ? You 
 write such a very pretty, precise, cramped hand — oh ! 
 Mr. and Mrs. Wiggins, of Fort Wiggins. That sounds 
 bad,” added Lady Dunore, shaking her head. 
 
 “ However it may sound, madam,” said Miss Craw- 
 ley, a little piqued, and resolved not to be worsted 
 by Lady Clancare— “ however it may sound, Mr. 
 Wiggins holds a distinguished office of trust under 
 government ; and Mrs. Wiggins is supposed to have 
 more titles at her parties than any one, except Lady 
 Kilgobbin.” 
 
 “ I wish somebody would kill Lady Kilgobbin,” 
 said Lady Dunore, “ for I am sick of her name. I 
 suppose if these Wiggins people are government folk, 
 we must have them. But I hope your Mrs. Wiggins 
 is not a quiz, Miss Crawley. Do you know her, Lady 
 Clancare ?” 
 
 “ I saw her in Dublin, madam, at a few assemblies.” 
 
 “And what is she like? Now do throw her off 
 for us, a trait de plume. Now pray what is she like ?” 
 
 “ Like — like a scarlet flamingo, lean and lank, all 
 legs and neck, in an eternal red velvet gown.”

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “ I’ll have nothing to do with your flamingo, my 
 dear Miss Crawley. The eternal red gown would 
 destroy me in two nights. I cut the flamingo and 
 the velvet gown, positively, legs, neck, and all.” 
 
 “No, no,” interrupted Lord Frederick, “the fla- 
 mingo must go in with the beetle. Only conceive ‘ 
 you will stand here like your mother Eve, surrounded 
 by all the birds of the air, and beasts of the field. 
 Rosbrin, down with the flamingo, as a pendant for 
 the beetle ; they are charming ; and here is,” he added, 
 looking over Lady Dunore’s shoulder, “ here is Mrs. 
 Randal Royston — delicious name ! and the three Miss 
 Roystons.” 
 
 “ There were originally seven Miss Roystons, with 
 seven China oranges,” said Lady Clancare, with kin- 
 dling spirits, and now evidently piquee au jeu , “ but 
 Mrs. Randal has married, or rather lunched off four.” 
 
 “ Lunched olf! Good God, how good !” said Lady 
 Dunore, laughing ; “ but how lunched off, my dear 
 Lady Clancare ?” 
 
 “ Why, when maternal speculation, with balls, din- 
 ners, and suppers, wholly failed, Mrs. Royston adver- 
 tised sandwiches to morning saunterers, and got rid 
 of her W estphalia hams and her marriageable daugh- 
 ters together.” 
 
 Everybody laughed, Miss Crawley made an effort 
 to speak, but was overpowered by the loud, shrill 
 voice of Lady Dunore. 
 
 “ Here, read on, Lord Frederick : do you read. 
 This is too amusing.” 
 
 “ Here is,” said Lord Frederick, “ General and Mrs . 
 General Jenkins.” 
 
 “ But not the general Mrs. Jenkins,” said Lady

 Clancare, “not the general Mrs. Jenkins ; on the con- 
 trary, she is the exclusive Mrs. Jenkins, one who dis- 
 criminates by the indices of the Red Book, estimates 
 qualities by the nobs on coronets, and ranges all worth 
 and talent under the privilege of walking at a corona- 
 tion ; for the rest, she is fussy, fidgety, and fretful, 
 but useful in getting up balls, to extract names from 
 a porter’s book ; and might herself pass the muster- 
 roll of gentility unnoticed, but for her idears, winders, 
 Mariars, Mirandars, and all the whole race of r’s in 
 the cockney vocabulary of Bow-bell.” 
 
 “ Now, Lady Dunore,” interrupted Miss Crawley, 
 more annoyed at the amusement Lady Clancare was 
 exciting than by the abuse of Mrs. General Jenkins, 
 “ now I must observe to you that this Mrs. Jenkins, 
 the object of Lady Clancare’s ridicule, happens to be 
 her own friend ; and if her ladyship ridicules her own 
 particular friends ” 
 
 “ My own particular friends !” said Lady Clancare, 
 gravely ; “ and if I don’t laugh at my own friends, 
 whose friends can I take the liberty of laughing at, 
 Miss Crawley ?” 
 
 “ Really, madam,” said Miss Crawley, sneering, “ I 
 at least do not see the necessity ” 
 
 “ Necessity ! Oh, pardon me, — the necessity is ob- 
 vious, inevitable, plus fort que moi ) and does not leave 
 a shadow of free will in the case.” 
 
 “ My aunt, madam,” said young Crawley, “ must 
 decline all logical disquisition with you on necessity 
 and free will. She is not quite so learned in meta- 
 physics, and does not advertise her study of Locke 
 for the benefit of the public. I believe, and hope, 
 indeed, she never read him.”

 “ Did not she ?” asked Lady Clancare. “ Then she 
 must not speak of him, Mr. Crawley : for there’s no 
 getting at Locke by deputy. There is no quartering 
 review of him ! no opinions to be picked up at second 
 hand, no cut-and-dry criticisms, neat, compact, and 
 portable, made up in small parcels, and ready for im- 
 mediate use, as soon as delivered to the purchaser— 
 you understand, Mr. Crawley. But,” she added, with 
 a total change of countenance and manner, and a sort 
 of fondling voice, opposed to the sharp acute accent 
 she had first spoke in, “ you must not believe, my 
 dear Lady Dunore, that I am the ‘ ingrate and cam 
 kered Bolingbroke.’ ” 
 
 “ Henry Fourth, act first, scene third,” observed 
 Lord Rosbrin, raising his eyes from his list to Lady 
 Clancare’s face, with pleasure and surprise. 
 
 “ I am not,” she continued, following up her blow 
 on the heart of Lord Rosbrin, and on the temper of 
 the Crawleys at the same moment — “ I am not guilty 
 of this 1 ungrateful injury,’ as Coriolanus has it, against 
 Mrs. General Jenkins. ^She is not my friend: judge 
 if she merits that name. On my coming down to this 
 country, some two years back, Mrs. Jenkins, herself 
 then a stranger, came to visit me, on the strength of 
 my title, and did not get into my ruined towers, to 
 ! view the nakedness of the land ; so she sent me an 
 invitation to her house. I went, pour voir ce que cela 
 devienclra , and accompanied her to an assize-ball 
 where she suddenly dropped me ; for, having found 
 out that I was but a pauper peeress, and fitter for the 
 parish books than the red bench, she charitably con- 
 signed me to my destiny, and now meets, stares at, 
 and passes me ; while I, with my 4 good den, Sir

 Richard,’ am answered with, a 1 gad have mercy, fel- 
 low.’ But I advise you to ask her to your files, 
 whenever you give any ; for she twines holly and ivy 
 wreaths for garlanding the walls, cuts flowers out of 
 turnips and carrots for ornamenting supper-tables, 
 and has a recipe for making very tolerable lemonade, 
 without the expensive addition of lemons,” 
 
 “ No, no; no Mrs. General Jenkins,” was the gene- 
 ral cry: while Lady Duriore, equally delighted with 
 the amusing powers of the awakened Lady Clancare, 
 as with the discomfiture of her ex-favorites, the 
 Crawleys, who, it was evident, were gradually losing 
 ground in her changeable opinion, cried out louder 
 than all, “ Go on, go on, Lord Frederick. Who have 
 we next? Now, Lady Clancare.” 
 
 “Mrs. Wilkinson,” pronounced emphatically Lord 
 Frederick. 
 
 “ A great favorite of our late lord lieutenant,” said 
 Mr. Pottinger, who was on the Crawley side, “ quite 
 a beauty in the grand style.” 
 
 “ Yes,”, said Lady Clancare, laughing, “ a very 
 Mammoth of loveliness, ponderously pretty, with no 
 more joints than an elephant, quite as heavy, and as 
 mischievous withal ; for she’ll tread the nap off your 
 carpet, while she talks down the character of your 
 friends, and never moves or breathes but to injure.” 
 
 “ Yet, for all that,” said Lord Frederick, “ we must 
 have the elephant to complete the menagerie. Put 
 her- down, Rosbrin, with the beetle and the flamingo; 
 so,— here are Mr. and Mrs. Twiggle, too : I like the 
 name — -it bodes well.” 
 
 “ Mr. Twiggle is one of our great Irish financiers,” 
 interrupted Miss Crawley, endeavoring to get the

 pas : “ for our rich army agents here answer to the 
 financiers of France, as described by Marmontel in his 
 sweetly-written Memoirs.” 
 
 “ I shall say nothing of the army agents,” said Lady 
 Clancare, “ till there’s a peace.” 
 
 “ Scrub ! hem !” said Lord Rosbrin, chuckling. 
 
 “ Peace or war,” said young Crawley, much irri- 
 tated, “ the Twiggies must always hold a situation of 
 trust and emolument. The government will always 
 take care of them ; and as to Mrs. Twiggle, she is a 
 woman of first-rate abilities, one of the best critics, 
 and one of the most eloquent persons I ever listened 
 to. She has indeed none of that flippant smartness, 
 which is rather the pertness of pretension than the 
 ebullition of genuine ability ; but she has a flow of 
 language— 
 
 “ Flow, do you call it ?” said Lady Clancare in sur- 
 prise : “ a flow !— a flood, that carries down with it 
 all sorts of rubbish. In fact, the eloquent Mrs. Twig- 
 gle is not ill-represented by a long-necked bottle, 
 shallow and noisy. My dear Lady Dunore, you 
 would die of it. A windmill is a hermitage to the 
 neighborhood of the eloquent Mrs. Twiggle.” 
 
 “ Away with her, away with her !” cried Lord Ros- 
 brin, theatrically. “No Twiggle,” w r as the general 
 cry ; while young Crawley, without temper or taste 
 to enter into this idle playfulness, without art or 
 talent to counteract the growing popularity of Lady 
 Clancare, rudely snatched up the paper from Lord 
 Rosbrin, and said in a tone of great irritation, “ I 
 believe, Lady Dunore, my aunt will rather decline 
 giving any further assistance on this occasion. For, 
 as she happens to know and visit all the persons of

 475 
 
 distinction who inhabit this neighborhood, it is rather 
 mortifying to her to hear calumnies launched against 
 all the leading gentry and principal people of the 
 province.” 
 
 “ Calumny !” reiterated Lady Clancare, with mock 
 solemnity, and solemnly spreading her little hand on 
 her bosom, “ I deny the accusation. I deny that the 
 Lissons, and Wiggins, and Jenkins, and Roystons, 
 and Twiggies, are the gentry of the province. 
 Though some be nieces of embarrassed English cler- 
 gymen, suddenly become Irish bishops, though they 
 be placemen, and pensioners, and army agents, and 
 revenue commissioners, yet their names were unheard 
 of in this country a few years back ; and I therefore 
 deny that they are the genuine nobility and gentry 
 of this country. My dear Lady Dunore, if you would 
 invite only the Irish aristocracy to your castle, you 
 must deliver your cards to king’s messengers, and 
 send your invitations to every court in Europe, ex- 
 cept our own, where alone the Irish nobility are not 
 to be found. But if the true gentry of the country 
 will satisfy you, the descendants of her brave chiefs 
 and princes, the O’s and the Macs, there is no pro- 
 vince in Ireland can furnish a more national or delight- 
 ful circle than Munster. I promise you you will be 
 delighted with them. You will, perhaps, find more 
 brogue and bows than you would meet with in your 
 English assemblies ; but you will also find something 
 of the refined courtesy and gay spirit of the Irish 
 cavalier. They are prompt, indeed, to suspect slight, 
 but they are ardent to repay kindness ; for, like the 
 Irish wolf-dog, the Irish people are devoted when ca- 
 ressed, and fierce only when provoked. I propose

 then, in this great election for the independent bor- 
 ough of your ladyship’s favor, the O’s and the Macs 
 as worthy candidates.” 
 
 “ I second the motion,” cried Lord Frederick. 
 
 The O’s and the Macs echoed on every side, while 
 Lord Rosbrin, flourishing his handkerchief, cried out, 
 “a Mug, a Mug, a Mug !” # 
 
 Lady Dunore, delighted with the noise, because 
 noise always delighted her — charmed by the transi- 
 tion in Lady Clancare’s manner, because all transitions 
 gave her sensation — and gratified by the amusement 
 it had, and still might afford her, embraced her new 
 favorite a la francaise and cried out : 
 
 “ You are quite charming. I told you how popular 
 you would become, whenever you would shake off 
 your mauvaise ho ate. You shall ask whom you like 
 to the castle, and nobody but whom you like ; for I 
 now constitute you the mistress of the revels of 
 Dunore.” 
 
 “Do you?” said Lady Clancare, with vivacity; 
 “ then I’ll make the 1 welkin dance,’ or at least Clot- 
 nottyjoy ; and if I could find out a copartner in my 
 labors, I would get up a series of festivities that 
 should last out your banishment here. We would 
 perform a masque for the amusement of the nobles 
 of the castle, as in the older times ; we would have 
 the most lamentable comedy and cruel death of Fy- 
 ramus and Thisbe;” and her countenance now as- 
 sumed the dull stupidity of Peter Quince; “or we 
 would try ” 
 
 Lord Rosbrin, as if touched by an electric spark, 
 here interrupted her with the rejoinder of Bully Bot- 
 * Mayor of Garret.

 tarn, “ a very good piece of work, and a merry — ” 
 Then taking her hand, to the amusement of all, he 
 added, with great gravity : 
 
 “ Come, my queen ; in silence sad, 
 
 Trip we after the night shade. 
 
 We the globe can compass soon, 
 
 Swifter than the wand’ring moon j” l 
 
 while she replied significantly : 
 
 “ Come, my lord, and in our flight 
 Tell me how it came this night, 
 
 That I sleeping here was found 
 By these mortals.” 
 
 “ Sleeping indeed !” said Lady Dunore ; “ but you 
 have awakened us all now, I trust.” 
 
 “ Macbeth hath murdered sleep,” added Lord Ros- 
 brin. “ But what mirth, what revelry shall we begin 
 with ?” 
 
 “A mask presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634, on 
 Michaelmas night, before the Right Honorable John 
 Earl of Bridgewater, Lord President of Wales, called 
 Comus,” said Lady Ciancare, looking at Lord Rosbrin, 
 who replied, fluttering about in an ecstasy : 
 
 “ Music by Henry Lawes. Here we’ll cast it forth- 
 with and he dropped on his knees and seized the 
 pen. “ What are the characters ? I have not looked 
 into Comus these six months.” 
 
 “ There is the elder brother,” said Lady Ciancare, 
 dictating gravely — “ General Fitz waiter ; younger 
 brother, Lord Adelm ; the lady, by Lady Georgiana ; 
 Comus, your lordship ; the Crew, Mr. and Miss Craw- 
 ley, Mr. Pottinger, &c.” 
 
 “And Euphrosyne, Lady Ciancare,” said Lord 
 Rosbrin.

478 
 
 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “Now then,” said Lady Clancare, with all the 
 spirit and sportiveness of the character assigned to 
 her, 
 
 “ Welcome song and welcome jest, 
 
 Midnight shout and revelry, 
 
 Tipsy dance and jollity. i 
 
 Braid your locks with rosy twine, 
 
 Dropping odors, dropping wine.” 
 
 “ Brava ! brava !” re-echoed on every side. 
 
 “ For the audience,” she continued, “ Lady Bridge- 
 water, seated under a canopy, and dressed in the old 
 English habit, shall be represented by the Marchio- 
 ness.” 
 
 4 1 have one,” interrupted Lady Dunore, “ made 
 for the last opera masquerade.” 
 
 “ The Lord President will be admirably done by 
 Mr. Daly ; and the O’s and the Macs will look stately 
 and quaint in the boxes ; while the Wiggins, and 
 Twiggies, and Roystons, 1 will fill a pit as well as 
 better men.’ ” 
 
 “ To be sure they will,” said Lady Dunore ; “ we’ll 
 parade them all on the occasion ; and that won’t be 
 the least part of the fun.” 
 
 “We must have an afterpiece,” said Lord Rosbrin, 
 gravely, and in a thoughtful attitude. 
 
 “ Let it be something Spanish,” said Lady Dunore, 
 “ in compliment to General Fitzwalter.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter was leaning over the back of a 
 chair, pursuing the variations of Lady Clancare. 
 
 He started at this application to his amour propre , 
 and bowed slightly, and in some confusion, while 
 Lady Dunore, her eyes still fixed on him, whispered 
 something in Lady Clancare’s ear, who blushed, threw*

 down her eyes, and shook her head incredulously. 
 This was not the first time he had observed a mys- 
 terious communication between these two ladies, of 
 which he was evidently the object, but he had never 
 been struck so forcibly as now, for the deep blush of 
 Lady Claficare gave it no trifling effect. 
 
 In the meantime Lord Rosbrin, puzzling his head 
 for a Spanish- American piece, could think of nothing 
 but Pizarro, which it was impossible to cut down into 
 a farce ; and so, as a succedaneum, he proposed the 
 Spanish farce of the Padlock, in which Lady Clancare 
 offered to play Mungo to his Leander, except Mr. 
 Heneage had a preference for that part. Mr. Hene- 
 age declared that he would not blacken his face for 
 any earthly consideration; and Lord Rosbrin ob- 
 served he should much like to try his talent at singing, 
 but that he had no wooden leg among his properties 
 for Leander. Lady Clancare suggested that the 
 wooden leg was a worn out commonplace ; that tying 
 up the limb in a handsome blue scarf would be a new 
 reading ; and that, with the help of a cane, he would 
 manage it admirably. 
 
 “ Exactly,” said Lord Rosbrin, charmed with the 
 idea of a new reading : “ such a scarf as this,” and 
 he took one off Miss Crawley’s shoulders. “ Here, 
 Heneage, lend me your arm. How, Pottinger, fasten 
 this round my ankle, so ; and then round my neck, 
 so. Thank you, Lady Clancare, for your assistance ; 
 how well you understand these things ! that’s a little 
 too tight, though ; not quite so many knots. Oh, the 
 devil! your ladyship’s tying my heel to my head. 
 Stay, I’ll try a few bars of the serenade : 
 
 ‘ Oh thou whose charms have won my heart.’

 Confusion ! this is torture. I — I — ” and suddenly 
 seized with the cramp, Lord Rosbrin now fell to the 
 ground, almost screaming with pain and crying, “ By 
 Jupiter! I have got the most intolerable cramp; 
 loose me, for pity’s sake, or I shall die of it.” 
 
 Every one now hastened to relieve him, but Lady 
 Clanoare’s nimble fingers had tied a Gordian knot ; 
 no one could loosen it. Lord Rosbrin roared, and 
 Mr. Daly at last cut boldly what could not be untied. 
 Everybody laughed, as if the sufferings of the noble 
 ameteur were “ sport for ladies.” Miss Crawley re- 
 ceived back her mangled scarf with a look of vexa- 
 tion and dismay. Lady Dunore, equally amused by 
 the sufferings of one friend, the annoyance of the 
 other, and the espieglerie of the third, turned round, 
 after a fit of laughter that brought tears to her eyes, 
 to reproach Lady Clancare for no", assisting at a 
 denouement she had rendered so difficult to effect, but 
 — she was gone.

 But yet I say, 
 
 If imputation and strong circumstance, 
 
 Which lead directly to the door of truth, 
 
 Will give you satisfaction, you may have it. 
 
 SlIAKSPEARE. 
 
 General Fitzwalter retired early from the circle 
 at the castle, and was passing rapidly through the 
 hall to his carriage, when the figure of Lord Adelm 
 caught his attention, moving under the projecting 
 corridor, and tearing some paper in a thousand 
 pieces, which he had trampled under his feet. His 
 countenance was marked by strong traces of passion, 
 and his obvious confusion and embarrassment, when 
 his eyes met Fitzwalter, almost tempted the latter to 
 pass on without addressing him : suddenly, however, 
 turning back upon his steps, under the influence of a 
 prompt and ardent sympathy, as easily excited as it 
 was uncontrollable, he demanded : 
 
 “ What is the matter ? You appear to suffer. Has 
 anything happened to annoy you ?” 
 
 “ Annoy me, indeed!” he repeated, while the 
 general took his arm, and walked for a minute in 
 silence by his side, 
 
 “ What can have occurred within the last hour, 
 when I saw you smiling in mockery at the buffoon, 
 Lord Rosbrin ? Fancies, not facts, I trust : for I

 would rather believe your nymph had discovered 
 herself, and so dispelled your illusions, than ” 
 
 “ Discovered herself with a vengeance! she has 
 discovered herself.” s 
 
 “ Ha ! has she so ?” 
 
 “ Oh ! with a frankness perfectly original. For, 
 with an ingenuous confession, that she has made my 
 vanity and credulity the dupes of her devices, and the 
 instruments of her own views, she absolves me from 
 her spells, restores me to my freedom of agency, re- 
 leases me from leading-strings, and with a mysterious 
 allusion to the convent of Nuestra Senora de las 
 Angustias, the ruins of the Holycross, and my visit 
 to Court Fitzadelm, she signs herself mine au revoir , 
 Mary Magillicuddy. And thus,” he added, tearing 
 to atoms the fragments of the letter he still held — 
 “ thus ends a dream I would not have exchanged for 
 any good real life could have bestowed.” 
 
 “ I’m glad of it,” replied the general, emphatically ; 
 and there was a beaming satisfaction in his animated 
 countenance that ratified the assurance, as if he was 
 himself relieved from some unpleasant conjecture 
 which weighed heavily on his mind. “ All mystery 
 is bad,” he added ; “ you will now be restored to 
 yourself. Passion, genuine and correspondent to 
 your age and character, will succeed to distempered 
 fancies, realities to visions, and the heart w T ill act 
 where the imagination has so long exclusively oper- 
 ated.” 
 
 “You think, then,” said Lord Adelm, “that I am 
 to rest here, to return solemn thanks for my delivery, 
 and to sit down quietly in the pleasant conviction of 
 having been the dupe of some idle or wilful person,

 who construes the enthusiasm and elevation of my 
 character into vanity and credulity, and insolently 
 laughs at the simplicity with which I have submitted 
 to the imposition. No, by all my hopes, time, acci- 
 dent, or perseverance in the research, must yet dis- 
 cover this arrogant unknown. If it be a man, the 
 result is obvious, and if a woman — ” He clenched 
 his hands, and ground his teeth. “ To be revenged, 
 I would pursue her under every form, device, and 
 stratagem, that could woo and win ; to punish, I 
 would even marry her, and thus make her future life 
 the slow- working expiation of her momentary inso- 
 lence.” 
 
 Either the general saw the folly of contending with 
 the first burst of suffering of wounded self-love, or 
 his own thoughts so deeply engrossed him, that he 
 permitted a long silence to succeed to this singular 
 denunciation ; then starting, as from a profound 
 revery, he said : 
 
 u I shall be detained here a few days longer, con- 
 trary to my intention. Your election may be deter- 
 mined in the interim ; and the revelation, which must 
 then take place ” 
 
 “ Yes,” interrupted Lord Adelm ; “ but it is an ob- 
 ject with me that this revelation be protracted. Noth- 
 ing effectual can be done till the opening of term.” 
 
 “ Nay, you shall name the time, the moment, your- 
 self. I too have my reasons for prolonging my in- 
 cognito yet a little longer.” 
 
 “ What !” said Lord Adelm, with a bitter smile, 
 “ have you too a phantom to contend with ?” 
 
 “ No : my object of contention, as you call it, is, 
 simply, a woman.”

 “ The betrothed wife to which you alluded ?” asked 
 Lord Adelm. 
 
 “ You shall know all at a future moment,” was the 
 reply. 
 
 Here the opening of the drawing-room door, and 
 the sound of approaching steps and voices, separated 
 the friends. Lord Adelm retreated to his dressing- 
 room, and the general threw himself into the Dunore 
 chaise, and returned to his tower. 
 
 The sentiment, inspired by one as much an object 
 of suspicion as of admiration, occupied General Fitz- 
 walter with a despotism, which a sense of honor, and 
 of his own peculiar situation, could alone repress or 
 resist. Still it possessed, it engrossed him ; it chased 
 repose from his pillow by night ; it agitated and dis- ] 
 turbed the dream of the morning ; and it drove him 
 into scenes of solitude, wild as his passions, and 
 lonely as his existence. 
 
 It was his wish, and might almost be called his 
 principle, to avoid the castle of Dunore ; yet he had 
 no po»wer to accomplish the purpose ; and though 
 in the interim which must necessarily elapse before 
 the arrival of an answer from Florence Macarthy, he 
 escaped the invitation of the marchioness, by the pre- 
 tence of a visit to the romantic and locally celebrated 
 glen and hermitage of the Gougane Barra, yet in four 
 days that he had ridden about the country, he had 
 seldom lost sight of the turrets of Dunore, or the 
 ruined towers of Castle Macarthy. 
 
 On the afternoon of the fifth day he found himself 
 on the edge of a wild moor, or what in Ireland is 
 called a shaking bog, which skirted the heights of 
 Clotnottyjoy. He alighted from his horse to inquire

 for a bridle-way more safe than that he pursued, frorl 
 a man who appeared whitewashing the walls of a 
 wretched hut, which arose lonely and desolate amidst 
 the bleak and dreary scene. As he advanced he per- 
 ceived a woman, in a gray cloak and straw bonnet, 
 standing near the cabin, and seemingly giving direc- 
 tions. The sound of his horse’s feet caught her ear. 
 She took off her bonnet, shook back her dark hair, 
 and discovered the glowing countenance of Lady 
 Clancare. 
 
 General Fitzwalter started at this unexpected 
 vision, and then advanced and moved his hat ; but 
 wuth her upraised hand she beckoned him back, and 
 exclaimed with much earnestness : 
 
 “No, no, pray don’t come here : go back, General 
 Fitzwalter, I beseech you.” 
 
 “ For what reason ?” he demanded coolly, and still 
 advancing. “ This is my road.” 
 
 “ For a thousand reasons,” she replied, moving ra- 
 pidly away, and speaking with, her head turned over 
 her shoulder. 
 
 “ One will suffice,” he rejoined, still approaching. 
 “There is a fever raging in that house. Nay, it 
 may not be safe even to come in contact with me.” 
 
 “ In contact with you !” he answered, with a voice 
 full of emotion, and now walking beside her, with his 
 horse following at bridle’s length. “ But if a fever 
 *rages here, why then are you here yourself?” he de- 
 manded anxiously. 
 
 “ Oh, because I bear a charmed life,” she returned, 
 laughing, but quickening her pace, as if to get beyond 
 the sphere of contagion ; “ because if I did not come, 
 four wretches who lie there, dying for want of pro-

 per care, would perish. The neighbors hold this 
 typhus in such dread, that though they come and 
 leave a little drink at the door of the cabin, they dare | 
 not enter. No, no, you shall not speak what you are 
 going to say about charity and — a good heart ; that 
 virtue always ascribed to those who have none — to 
 the capricious and the unregulated. The fact is, 
 these poor people are my tenants. I induced them 
 to settle in this swampy tract, and feel myself in part 
 answerable for their existence.” 
 
 “ But if there is infection here ?” 
 
 “ I laugh at the idea of infection ; that is, in my 
 own person. The fever which sweeps away the poor 
 people is, in my mind, the pure result of their poverty 
 and its concomitants, filth and starvation. Their 
 moral and physical ills are closely linked, and arise 
 out of the same cause.” 
 
 “ But how is it you warn others of a danger you 
 contemn yourself?” 
 
 “ The imagination,” she returned, smiling, “ goes a 
 great way in this business, and I keep mine exclu- 
 sively for my books. This disease I believe to be 
 epidemic, and not infectious. I have exposed myself 
 constantly to it these two years, and here I am, still 
 directing Lawrence Toole how to whitewash his hut.” 
 
 “ But,” she added, suddenly pausing, and slacken- 
 ing her rapid pace, “ is not this rencounter a breach 
 of our original stipulation ? We were not, I think, 
 
 to hold any communication till the arrival of ” 
 
 “ I did not understand that accidental rencounters 
 came under the head of your proh bition, which, you 
 perceive, I have otherwise religiously observed.” 
 
 “ You take the advantage of the letter, and neglect

 the spirit of the enactment, I observe, and neither 
 keep the promise to the sense, nor the ear.” 
 
 “ No, in this instance, as through life, I merely give 
 myself up to the tide of circumstances as they flow ; 
 adapt them to my wishes and my views as I can; 
 render them serviceable to my purposes as I may ; 
 turn them to the best account of which they are sus- 
 ceptible ; but, when they become wholly untr actable 
 and adverse, then I trust I shall stand the brunt of 
 their resistance with fortitude, and, with Milton’s 
 demon hero, acknowledge that 4 to suffer, as to do, 
 our strength is equal.’ I had no hope of meeting 
 your ladyship this morning ; but most assuredly I will 
 not neglect the good the 1 gods provide me . 7 I am 
 too selfish, perhaps, to consult your wishes ; but still 
 you will not find me unprepared to obey your com- 
 mands. Do you desire me to leave you ?” 
 
 “ Wishes, obedience, and commands !” repeated 
 Lady Clancare, shaking her head. “ You are resolved 
 to leave me no female doubling to escape by. You 
 bring me to my purgation at once, and put to the 
 rout the host of little diplomacies with which we 
 habitually come at our object, without any visible in- 
 terference on our own part. Suppose, now, I did not 
 wish you to go, and yet thought it right to command 
 your departure. You see,” she added, with her bril- 
 liant laugh, “ to what you have reduced me, and 
 plenary confession is all now that remains.” 
 
 “ If for one moment,” he added, with warmth, “ I 
 may suppose you do not wish me to go, even your 
 commands should not banish me. Will you take my 
 arm, and permit me to see you home ?” 
 
 She declined the offer wdth a slight bow, and after

 a short pause, observed, “ You seem, General Fitz- 
 waiter, to have lived but little with women ?” 
 
 “ So little, madam, that I fear I am scarcely fit to 
 live with them, and yet am unable to live without 
 them. Woman is to me the spring in the desert, 
 precious and rare, seldom found in my life’s wild and 
 dreary track ; but when found ” 
 
 Lady Clancare looked full in his eyes, and, laying 
 her forefinger on his arm, pronounced emphatically 
 “ Florence Macarthy !” A deep crimson rushed over 
 his face. “ Since,” he said, “ you revert yourself to 
 that strange circumstance, you will allow me to enter 
 fully on an explanation of conduct, governed only by 
 that inevitable course of events which, in human life, 
 governs everything.” 
 
 “ Not one syllable,” she interrupted, eagerly. “ I 
 am one of those legislators, the first to break the laws 
 they make, but, withal, rigid as to the infringement 
 of others — a perfect Lord Angelo. But raise your 
 eyes to the right. Do you not see an abrupt conical 
 hill ?” His eyes followed the direction of her hand. 
 
 “ It is called,” she continued, “ Cahir Conreagh, the 
 fort of the king, and is the scene of much romantic 
 story. It rises, as you see, in a plain, open and sunny, 
 like the life-path of the prosperous; that is your way; — 
 and here, to the left, behold, is a little gloomy den, 
 obscure and cloud-capped — it is rude and obstructed, 
 and leads to solitudes and ruins — that is mine ; fare- 
 well.” 
 
 She turned abruptly away towards the spot she 
 had so singularly described, and moved on with ra- 
 pidity ; but Fitzwalter as rapidly followed and over- 
 took her.

 « Lady Clancare,” he said, imperatively, “ yon must 
 hear me. I will not neglect the opportunity afforded 
 me by accident — -accident is fate, is fortune ; and 
 fools or cowards only neglect its favors, or miss its 
 tide. I am not much in the habit of governing my- 
 self, or of being governed — more practised in com- 
 mand than in obedience; yet I have obeyed you, 
 without reservation, as far as your orders were di- 
 rected by prudence, discretion, or any other cold, ne- 
 cessary quality, which the world takes upon trust, in 
 place of better feelings. I am prepared to obey you 
 still, in the world. There, reject and banish me as 
 you will, if it must be so ; but here, in this place, so 
 lonely, no eye to watch, no tongue to wound, no 
 malice to misrepresent, why should you refuse to 
 hear me on a subject connected with the future des- 
 tiny of one whose happiness you hold so dear to you ? 
 Hitherto I have lived the creature of my own for- 
 tunes, independent of any human being for my con- 
 duct, without one object to interest, one tie to bind 
 me ” 
 
 “ Without one tie ?” interrupted Lady Clancare, 
 emphatically, yet obviously intimidated by the im- 
 petuosity of his manner; for he spoke with vehe- 
 mence — his eyes flashing, his cheek glowing. 
 
 “Well then,” he said, “if you persist in calling 
 that a tie, it is to that tie I would allude. I would 
 account to you for an act so romantic, that even the 
 feelings which led to it can scarcely excuse it — my 
 strange, equivocal, uncompleted marriage with Flo- 
 rence Macarthy.” 
 
 “ Then, General Fitzwalter,” replied Lady Clancare, 
 with firmness, “ on this subject, neither here nor any-

 where ought I to hear you, until empowered to do so 
 by Florence Macarthy herself. A few days must put 
 you in possession of her own sentiments and deter- 
 mination. But in the interim,” she added, with a 
 smile, “ like other diplomatic agents, I must neither 
 act nor speak without instructions.” 
 
 “ Then, madam,” he replied, with petulance, “ it 
 were, perhaps, best to relieve you from your over- 
 cautious agency. I will fly myself to Florence Ma- 
 carthy ; overtake, perhaps anticipate, a letter, which 
 never should have been written before a personal in- 
 terview had taken place ; and learn, viva voce , what 
 it is idleness to wait for in dilatory suspense.” 
 
 u Are you sure she will receive you ?” asked Lady 
 Clancare, coolly. 
 
 “ She must receive me,” was the stern reply. 
 
 “ True, even a convent’s bars yield to a husband’s 
 intrusion.” 
 
 “ Husband !” repeated General Fitzwalter. “ Hus- 
 band to a woman I scarcely looked upon ! whom I 
 might not even again recognize !” 
 
 u Yet so earnestly did she look at you,” said Lady 
 Clancare, in a voice full of softness and reproach ; 
 “ so well are you remembered, that from her descrip- 
 tion alone I should have known you among a thou- 
 sand. Hay, I did instantly recognize you, from the 
 picture she had drawn, even before you were an- 
 nounced in the hall of Dunore. So much for the 
 rapidity of a woman’s perceptions, the fidelity of a 
 woman’s memory, where the heart is engaged. 
 
 “ The heart ! the heart engaged ?” he interrupted, 
 “ in one sudden, short, agitated interview ! under such 
 circumstances too 1”

 “The circumstances of that interview quickened 
 and deepened the impression, and were calculated to 
 affect and influence a woman’s feelings and imagina- 
 tion. A soldier’s daughter was well fitted to be in- 
 terested in a soldier’s virtues. She beheld you, for 
 the first time, flushed with conquest, soothing a 
 father’s death-bed anxieties, for the fate of his friend- 
 less child, by the offer of all you had to bestow, your 
 hand, fortune, and a name destined for immortality ; 
 and when Florence Macarthy described you as bearing 
 her wounded, dying parent in your arms, from the 
 field of battle to the neighboring convent, from which 
 she herself had beheld the fatal conflict — when she 
 painted you as generously answering all his parental 
 solicitudes, by offering to give his child the only pro- 
 tection a man of your age could afford a woman of 
 hers— when she dwells upon your valor and disinter- 
 estedness, your prompt, uncalculating, romantic gen- 
 erosity—” 
 
 “ Lady Clancare,” said General Fitzwalter, in great 
 emotion, and coloring deeply, “I cannot hear you 
 out. That Miss Macarthy should have received such 
 an impression, that you should thus recapitulate ” 
 
 “Me!” she replied, carelessly: “you don’t suppose 
 I was imposed upon by the representations of a love- 
 sick girl? No, I have but little respect for military 
 heroes. Luck and temperament usually form the 
 compound of a hero; and for one Caesar on th^ list 
 of military immortality, there is many an illiterate 
 Marlborough, without education sufficient to spell his 
 own dispatches, and many a brutal Saxe, without in-_ 
 tellect enough to compose them. O ! your heroes 
 follow a fearful and an hireling trade, at best : some-

 times the butchers, sometimes 'the gaolers of the 
 species; rarely its advocates or benefactors. Vain- 
 glorious abroad, worthless at home, despotic in the 
 camp, dull in the circle — -it has been well, though 
 quaintly said : 
 
 ‘ Hercules was a fool, and straight grew famous ; 
 
 For fool’s the stuff of which heaven makes a hero.’ ” 
 
 “ If a man,' 5 said Fitzwalter, with a bent brow, and 
 a compressed lip, “ambitioned the character of a 
 hero, your ladyship's description would but little flat- 
 ter his passion.” 
 
 “ I admit exceptions, however, and would make 
 one in favor of the Librador, to whom American 
 gratitude may yet raise statues ; but I do not admit 
 them to Florence Macarthyf It has long been my 
 system to oppose her fatal, fruitless prepossession in 
 your favor, by representations calculated to weaken 
 them; and when she would excuse your desertion, 
 by the untoward circumstances of a party of royal 
 troops rushing down upon the convent, at the mo- 
 ment when the marriage ceremony was performing 
 in its chapel, which obliged you to drop the hand of 
 the weeping (and entre nous ), maudlin bride, and to 
 seize the sword — when she dwells upon your being 
 forced from the altar to the field, upon your bravely 
 opposing, repulsing, pursuing a sanguinary foe, being 
 surrounded, taken prisoner, condemned to death, 
 rescued by your own devoted troop, then I take up 
 the tale, to add — and once more free, and crowned 
 with fresh laurels, did he return to lay them at your 
 feet, to claim his half- widowed bride, to ratify his 
 imperfect vows !” 
 
 She paused, looked under her eyes ; and there was

 a malignant archness in her countenance which had 
 its effect. In a tone of irritation and impatience he 
 replied, “ I was the victim of circumstances. I did, 
 however, return.” 
 
 “ When ?” asked Lady Clancare hastily. 
 
 “ At the expiration of some months, and found the 
 convent, where Miss Macarthy had been placed by 
 her father, during the campaign in which he fell to 
 save me, razed to the ground by the Spanish army.” 
 
 “And with the convent,” continued Lady Clan- 
 care, laughing, “ fell your hopes and wishes, and all 
 the et cetera of disappointed love. War was, in fact, 
 your mistress, as glory was your passion ; and now 
 Florence Macarthy is left to find herself the 1 spouse 
 of God in vain for though, after your desertion, she 
 struggled hard in her vocation, the human feeling 
 was superior to the heavenly calling : ‘ not on the 
 cross her eyes were fixed, but you.’ She followed 
 you through all the public events of the day. Every 
 gazette was a register of your actions and heroism. 
 The guerilla chief, II Librador, became the hero of 
 her imagination, that first stronghold in the pregna- 
 ble garrison of a woman’s feelings.” 
 
 She paused. The general sighed deeply, walked 
 on with a slackened pace and folded arms, and lent 
 not a pleased but an ardent attention, interrupted by 
 occasional starts of amazement, while she again con- 
 tinued ; “ Unwooed, unsought for, forlorn, abandoned, 
 poor and friendless, the destruction of the convent 
 which had afforded her an asylum, urged her return 
 to Ireland. Since then her life has been a blank : 
 with one bright object glittering upon its surface, 
 like the brilliant spot, self-formed, in the eye, when

 all around is darkness. You, however, I trust, have 
 come to dispel that darkness, and to give that bright 
 speck a more definite form and a steadier lustre ; for 
 I take it for granted you are returned in search of a 
 wife, though I confess that you negotiate the re- 
 covery with a sang froid that renders your ardor in 
 the research very doubtful.” 
 
 u I came to this country,” he said, thoughtfully, 
 and with a countenance marked by painful embar- 
 rassment, “ upon a very different business, upon a 
 mission less generous than you suppose.” He pressed 
 his hand to his forehead, and abruptly broke off; 
 then, after a few moments’ silence, interrupted only 
 by a deep inspiration, he added, “ I will see Miss 
 Macarthy, madam. I will leave Dunore for her con- 
 vent to-morrow ; and if her feelings are disposed as 
 you describe them, if her religious like her marriage 
 vows are still unratified — — ” 
 
 “ If they were ratified,” interrupted Lady Clancare, 
 eagerly, “ with her great-uncle, Don Dermutio Ma- 
 carthy, a Cardinal of considerable influence with 'the 
 Pope, and resident at Rome, there would be no diffi- 
 culty in procuring a dispensation.” Then, after a 
 long pause, she added with earnestness — “ Go then, 
 General Fitzwalter, and hear your destiny from the 
 lips of her whose life and happiness lies, I fear, in 
 your decision ; and take with you my prayers for 
 your happiness, my hopes that whatever has drawn 
 you to this poor country, it will yet benefit by your 
 talents and philanthropy; and that the liberator of 
 the enslaved in other lands may become the advocate 
 of the oppressed in his own.” 
 
 She spoke w r ith a feeling, an energy that was in-

 fectious; and when she pronounced “farewell,” and 
 extended her hand to Fitzwalter, he seized it with a 
 grasp almost painful in its pressure ; his eyes were 
 fixed upon her, as he searched, or would have searched, 
 her inmost soul ; and the agitation of his countenance 
 evinced the conflict of deep and strongly-opposed 
 emotions by which his own was torn ; yet he continued 
 silent. 
 
 “ Should Miss Macarthy’s ^answer arrive in your 
 absence, enclosed to me,” demanded Lady Clancare, 
 gently, but vainly endeavoring to liberate her hand, 
 “ where am I to forward it ?” 
 
 “ If,” said he, dropping her hand with a deep sigh, 
 and recovering from his abstraction, — “ if you expect 
 an answer so soon — ” he paused. 
 
 “ I must have one in a day or two at furthest,” 
 she replied. “ I did not trust your embassy to our 
 uncertain cross-posts ; I dispatched one of our Irish 
 pedestrian couriers, who, if not quite as graceful as 
 1 a feathered mercury,’ is always trustworthy. He 
 will return wdth an answer in the shortest possible 
 time that the surprise, I may say joy, of poor Flo- 
 rence will permit, in order that she may coolly sit 
 down and reply to your unexpected proposals.” 
 
 “ Then,” he said, “ I will remain here, as I first in- 
 tended, until this — answer — arrives.” 
 
 “ Perhaps it were best,” replied Lady Clancare, 
 carelessly ; “ but you must now leave me. I know 
 not how I have been thus led on to enter upon a topic 
 forsworn; a woman is always the slave of circum- 
 stances and of her own garrulity.” 
 
 “ But I have still much to say,” replied Fitzwalter, 
 with earnestness, “ much to ask,”

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 “ You must not say it now, not here, for we are 
 near the high road to Dunore. I must not be seen 
 walking with you by the persons of this neighbor- 
 hood, who have no quadrant to take the altitude of 
 my character, and yet affect to calculate my conduct. 
 I have set out in life with wind and tide against me ; 
 and now that, by prudence and circumspection, I 
 have been enabled to anchor in a safe, though rude 
 harbor, I would fain have no enemy to contend with 
 but 4 winter and rough weather.’ Yet, even here, 
 calumny has reached me.” 
 
 “ But if you forbid my intrusion elsewhere, you will 
 at least release me from an observance of your orders 
 of reserve at the Castle of Dunore. Will you permit 
 me to address you there when we meet ?” 
 
 “ Not for a wilderness of monkeys,” she replied 
 eagerly, and smiling ; “ for I hold my tenure in Lady 
 Dunore’s favor by a clause, in which, somehow or 
 other, your not appearing to know me makes an item.” 
 “Indeed! But, good God, what object can her 
 friendship be to you, or—” 
 
 “ Her friendship ! the maniac !” she interrupted, 
 with an indignant laugh that changed the whole ex- 
 pression of her countenance. “ She my friend ! — she 
 is my instrument, my agent, my tool, my anything. 
 You look amazed, General Fitzwalter; it will not 
 lessen your amazement when I tell you that I am 
 playing a part upon which all the prosperity and hap- 
 piness of my life depends. It was necessary that I 
 should get into the Castle of Dunore, and obtain an 
 influence over its mistress. This was effected by 
 means as wild and extravagant as her mind and habits. 
 I was to astonish her into prepossession, and secure

 her by a series of events which should gratify her 
 love of strong excitements, and keep up the constitu- 
 tional fever of her being ; which should make her 
 mine, give me the use of her house, the sanction of 
 her authority, and keep aloof the idle, frivolous circle, 
 which, privileged by the charter of society, would, out 
 of mere curiosity, without beseeching, have gained 
 admission to my den, intruded upon the time they 
 could neither compensate nor occupy, and then have 
 left me to oblivion and neglect. As it is, I counter- 
 act the pernicious influence of the Crawleys on her 
 mind, serve the poor of my neighborhood, by direct- 
 ing the caprices of Lady Dunore to relieve their 
 vrants, keep oft* her train by her own prohibitions, 
 and have obtained ample ‘ scope and room enough’ 
 for all my machinations ; for, to tell you a secret, at 
 this moment I move more puppets by my art than 
 one.” 
 
 As she spoke, she looked like the magician she de- 
 scribed herself. “ I perceive,” she continued, with a 
 voice and glances which became every moment more 
 acute and penetrating, “ that while I gain upon your

 ject, you will admit the legality of the means, extra- 
 ordinary as they are, extraordinary as they will ap-

 myself upon Lady Dunore as your wife ” 
 
 “ My wife !” he exclaimed, starting with the look 
 of one thunder- stricken. 
 
 “ Yes, your wife!” and she laughed, but colored 
 deeply, and turned pale in the succeeding moment.

 “In a word, I have assumed the story of Florence 
 Macarthy ; have persuaded Lady Dunore that I have 
 found my renegade husband in her circle without 
 being recognized by him ; for with a little dramatic 
 license, such as being much changed in my person, 
 having only been dimly seen through the shade of a 
 Spanish mantilla by my unknown bridegroom ; with 
 all those combinations which might have existed in 
 the instance of Florence Macarthy, (nay, which did, 
 according to her own account,) I have imposed on 
 her by facts extraordinary beyond the utmost daring 
 of fiction. Her object is that I shall win this cold, 
 insensible husband as Lady Clancare, whom as Flo- 
 rence Macarthy I could not secure. While engaged 
 in the perpetration of this scheme she is wholly in 
 my power. But if you really should fall in love with 
 me, General Fitzwalter,” she added playfully, “it 
 would be the ruin of all my plans, by curtailing the 
 time necessary for their accomplishment ; that is, if 
 you betray your unhappy passion; for a married 
 man, the husband of my own, dear, long-suffering 
 Florence, must be unhappy, you know, for the sake 
 of the moral of poetical justice.” 
 
 General Fitzwalter, stunned in the first instance, 
 continued to listen to her with increased emotion ; 
 but when he would have spoken she interrupted him 
 and continued : 
 
 “ I am playing a desperate card ; I have set my all 
 upon the chance. I am actuated by the two strong- 
 est passions of which a woman’s heart is capable. 
 They have each their object. One has already al- 
 most succeeded ; the other” — she pressed her hand 
 upon her heart, as if to check the violence of its

 throb, suddenly awakened by some singular associa- 
 tion. At that moment her quick eye discovered 
 some person moving slowly under the stone fence 
 which separated the heath on which they were walk- 
 ing from a car-road ; but the figure instantly disap- 
 peared, and the deep cuts in the bog on the other 
 side the road favored concealment, if' that were an 
 object. 
 
 “ We are observed,” said Lady Clancare, anxious- 
 ly ; “ no retirement here is sacred from observation. 
 I suppose you are aware that you are an object of 
 suspicion and of attention to Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “ What, now ?” said Fitzwalter ; “ why should you 
 suppose it ?” 
 
 “ I know it. Many respectable, but timid persons 
 in the neighborhood, observing your residence in the 
 country, without any ostensible object, or occupation, 
 are anxious to have you removed, even although you 
 are received at Dunore, the ordinary criterion of ail 
 worth and distinction. Your reception there is at- 
 tributed to the predilection of Lord Adelm.” 
 
 “ Lord Adelm,” he observed, “ is one whose vir- 
 tues are overshadowed by his fojlies. He is noble, 
 just, generous and disinterested.” 
 
 “ Yain, capricious, fanciful and heartless,” she 
 added. 
 
 “ And yet,” said General Fitzwalter, turning ab- 
 ruptly his eyes on Lady Clancare, “ he is the star 
 that holds the ascendant, that governs the conduct 
 of one who otherwise seems above all human con- 
 trol. Lady Clancare,” he added, rapidly, “ I have 
 now not the slightest doubt that he is the object of 
 what you have yourself termed your machinations

 of the part you are playing, and of the agency so 
 ingeniously, whimsically and singularly conducted; 
 so singularly conducted that it cannot be surprising, 
 with his heated imagination and unregulated fancy, 
 he should ascribe it to superhuman influence. All 
 that you have so candidly confessed deepens and 
 confirms this suspicion, and that he is the object of 
 the passions by which you are actuated, the strong- 
 est of which a woman’s heart is susceptible.” 
 
 Lady Clancare interrupted him : “ May I beg your 
 assistance,” she said, offering him her hand, for they 
 had now reached a stile, at which her cabriolet stood, 
 attended by a boy. Then seating herself, and taking 
 the reins and whip, she turned her laughing eyes 
 full round on Fitzwalter, and nodding her head 
 significantly, she said, “ Le terns et moi ,” and drove 
 off. 
 
 Fitzwalter stood transfixed to the spot on which 
 Lady Clancare had left him: his eye still followed 
 the rustic carriage that conveyed her, till it descended 
 into the glen she had pointed out to his notice, and 
 was lost in its windings. He then turned shortly 
 round to mount his horse, and came abruptly in con- 
 tact with some person who stood close behind him. 
 It was O Leary. There was a shrewd, sly glance, 
 lurking in the old man’s eyes, mingled with the sur- 
 prise and pleasure expressed at the general’s appear- 
 ance, which did not escape him at whom it was 
 levelled. He colored slightly, and said, with some 
 coldness, “ So, O’Leary !” 
 
 u Agus cead mille failthe , your honor,” said O’Leary, 
 moving his hat : u ten thousand welcomes, and ten 
 million welcomes home; and hopes the Gougane

 Barra plazed you, sir, and Father O’Mahony’s her- 
 mitage.” 
 
 Fitzwalter was never less in a mood to with- 
 stand the annoyance of unseasonable intrusion. His 
 thoughts were deeply occupied, and beyond the 
 power of interest, or distraction from any other sub- 
 ject. The presence of O'Leary, and the peculiar and 
 significant expression of his countenance, embarrassed 
 and provoked him. He mounted his horse in silence ; 
 but the tremulous and boggy surface he was treading 
 obliged him to walk the spirited animal slowly and 
 cautiously over the irregular and undulating turf. 
 O’Leary walked beside him for a few minutes in si- 
 lence, raising his eyes at intervals to his face, with an 
 affectionate and apprehensive look, as one who feared 
 to have offended ; at last, with a deep sigh, he said : 
 
 “ I’m afraid I’m not agreeable to your honor.” 
 
 “ It is certain, O’Leary,” said the general, with a 
 petulance of temper he could not command, “that 
 you do not leave me many moments to myself.” 
 “Don’t I, gineral, jewel?” said O’Leary sorrow- 
 fully. “ Then aren’t it quite na’t’ral, that where the 
 heart is, there will the body be also ; troth it will.” 
 
 “ But, my dear O’Leary,” said Fitzwalter, in a voice 
 of kindness, “you must be aware that there are 
 moments when the presence of the dearest friend 
 may be felt as intrusion.” 
 
 “ His dear O’Leary !” murmured the schoolmaster 
 to himself. “ Why, then, see here, gineral, jewel, 
 sorrow bit but I’d throw myself from the top of 
 Mangerton, afore I’d be a burthen to you, dead or 
 alive; and axes nothing bettef in life than just to 
 sarve you by day and by night, and to be looking in

 your face, when your back’s turned, not to be un- 
 plazing to you ; and wasn’t thinking of you at all, at 
 ail, only wondering when you’d be back; and was 
 going on an errand to the Bhan Tierna from Father 
 Mulligan, about his dues, owed to him by a poor 
 family on Clotnottyjoy, and heard from little Ulic 
 Macshane, her boy, who was leading round the ca- 
 briole by the bog road, that she was here convenient 
 at Larry Tool’s cabin, a fever house” (and he crossed 
 himself). 
 
 “Well, it’s only a thrifle, them dues,” went on 
 O’Leary, “ but thrifle as it is, Shane Gartly wasn’t able 
 for it, in respect of great sickness, and none to get 
 in his potatoes for him, and he on the broad of his 
 back, only just for the Bhan Tierna, the blessing of 
 God and the Virgin Mary light on her every day she 
 sees the sun. When she got Clottnottyjoy into her 
 hands, it was a desolate, neglected place, with only a 
 little handful of cattle grazing on it in the autumn 
 time. The first ever she settled on it was this Shane 
 Gartly, whom she found big, bare, and ragged, 
 walking the world with a wife and four childre, and 
 a blanket and kettle; and says she, if you’ll settle 
 down here, my lad, and labor, I’ll give you a taste of 
 land to be yours forever, and help you to raise a 
 shed, and lend you three pounds to stock and begin 
 the world with ; and so she did. Under God, and 
 her ladyship, Shane was doing bravely, and many a 
 one followed his example, and Christians were seen 
 now where only bastes thriv before ; but, 
 
 Hand facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat, 
 
 Res angusta domi,

 with all the labor and pains and industry of the 
 eraturs, let them work night and day, and let them 
 have ever such good friends to back them, it’s hard 
 for them to get before the world; and then, if any 
 accident happens, if the cow dies, or the rood of bar- 
 ley fails, it's the greatest of distress that comes over 
 them ; and so it was with Shane, when the hard sum- 
 mer and the fever overtook him. But I’ll ingage, 
 with God and the Bhan Tierna on his side, he’ll fight 
 it out yet.” 
 
 “ From your account, O’Leary,” said the general, 
 interested in a conversation that took for its topic 
 the object which exclusively engrossed him — “ from 
 your account, Lady Clanclare is the tutelar genius of 
 the soil and its inhabitants.” 
 
 “ Why then it’s just that she is, the lares- and the 
 penates of the poor man’s cabin, long life to her; and 
 if there were many of the likes of her, plaze your 
 honor, who would be after staying at home with us, 
 w T hy then the reformed and the civil sort would be 
 cherished, and the poor and the ignorant would be 
 instructed and well exampled ; and sorrow one of us 
 w r ould be beholding to them Crawley pirates, bad 
 luck to them, and their likes, who, by polling and 
 pilling the poor to make good their own fortunes, 
 and carrying on many false and cautelous practices, 
 ruin the land. But though they send strangers to 
 rule us, strangers I mane to our history, our natures, 
 and our ways, that neither know, nor read, nor study 
 us, and though, as Sir Henry Sydney said to the 
 Queen, they pound us as in a mortar — though they 
 perish us w T ith want, and burn us with fire, still the 
 Irish spirit is to the fore ; and until the sword of ex-

 termination passes over us, as was once proposed, it 
 is not in the breath of the English to blow it out, or 
 extinguish it.” 
 
 “ I doubt, however, the existence of this Irish 
 spirit,” returned the general, gratified to observe that 
 the mind of O’Leary was becoming hourly more col- 'i 
 lected-as the cause of its derangement was removed. 
 
 “ The result of this misrule and oppression of ages, I 
 of this religious disqualification, of this arraying one- 
 half the people against the other, by fanaticism and 
 jealousy, is to extinguish what you call Irish spirit, 
 by which, assuredly, you do not mean the spirit of 
 idle, unfounded discontent.” 
 
 “Unfounded!! BachalEssu!” interrupted O’Leary, 
 vehemently ; “ when ould Elizabeth herself said of 
 the government of Ireland, it will be objected to us, 
 as to Tiberius by Bato, concarning the Dalmatians, 
 
 ‘ you it is that be in fault, who commit your flocks, 
 not to shepherds, but to wolves.’ Unfounded! when 
 three-fourths of the people are, as it were, branded 
 on the forehead, like the descendants of Cain, and 
 wandering in foreign lands, because they profess the 
 faith of their forefathers. For, as I said to Lord 
 Adelm Fitzadelm, when he scoffed at Butler’s Lives 
 of the Saints this morning, when I found him seated 
 his lone in your chamber, gineral, and the blessed and 
 
 holy book in his hands ” 
 
 “ Lord Adelm ! was he at the Friary to-day !” 
 
 “ He was, gineral, and yesterday — and did not 
 much like his turning espial on you, like Jemmy 
 Bryan, who watches your very shadow.” 
 
 “ Indeed ! But did Lord Adelm leave no message 
 for me ?”

 “ None in life, plaze your honor. Only, hearing 
 you might be expected this morning, sat him down, 
 and took up Fra Denis O’Sullivan’s books, one by 
 one, and held a disputation with me, wherein he 
 showed more wit than faith, until Madam Florence 
 Macarthy s handkerchief caught his eye, lying on the 
 table, where you left it, gineral, and forthwith he put 
 me on my trial.” 
 
 “What do you mean by that ?” 
 
 “ Crass examining me all about it, gineral, how it 
 came there, and marvelling that it should belong to 
 Madam Macarthy, and she not in it.” . , 
 
 “ And did he take it away ?” 
 
 “ No, plaze your honor, gineral, he did not; and 
 minded me of the honorable Gerald with his curling 
 auburn hair, and toss back of the head, as if the world 
 was made to be his slaves — the very moral of the 
 father of him ; a great calabalero in his time.” 
 
 At this moment, a turn in the path brought them 
 up the high road to Dunore, by a causeway formed 
 over a bog dike by branches of trees and sods of turf ; 
 and Lord Adelm himself appeared, followed by a 
 groom, and rode up to them. He looked somewhat 
 confused, as if the rencontre was neither pleasant nor 
 expected. It was, however, inevitable, and he drew 
 up as Fitzwalter approached him. To his abrupt in- 
 quiry of whither Lord Adelm was going, he replied, 
 carelessly : 
 
 “ To follow your example ; change the scene for a 
 day or two, get rid of time, myself, of the society 
 with which I have, for my sins, been for some days 
 shut up ; in a word, promener mes ennuis aitleurs .” 
 The general threw his eyes over the valis strapped

 FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 behind the groom ; but Lord Adelm, as if to avoid 
 all further interrogation, came close to him, and con- 
 tinued, in a low voice, — 
 
 “ I congratulate you on your escape these few days 
 back. Those who were fools before are now mad, 
 stark, staring mad ; bitten by Rosbrin, and that art- 
 ful little adventuress, Lady Clan care, w r ko has now 
 brought them all round to her side, even Lady Geor- 
 giana and Lord Frederick, and who is taking the 
 short-cut to Rosbrin’s heart by flattering his stage- 
 struck vanity.” 
 
 “ Lady Clancare ! — adventuress ! — Lord Rosbrin’s 
 heart !” repeated Fitzwalter breathlessly. 
 
 “Did you not observe the other night that he was 
 the Prometheus that awakened the statue ? that it 
 was for him she kindled, sparkled and blazed forth ? 
 All her words were addressed to him, and all her 
 dramatic airs and citations, and setting my mother 
 afloat on the article of private theatricals, — her flip- 
 pant cast of the characters of Comus, her assigning 
 the daudling parts of the prosing brothers to us, and 
 giving the hero to him ; all go to the same tune of 
 Kilrosbrin, and the great house in Portman Square.” 
 
 “ I perceived her kindling, as you call it ; but that 
 Lord Rosbrin was her inspiration, ’tis preposterous 
 to suppose.” 
 
 “ Why had she ears or eyes but for him ?” 
 
 “ She certainly did not do the honors by your self- 
 love, nor by mine, for she noticed neither,” said Fitz- 
 walter, endeavoring to smile through the air of 
 thoughtfulness w r hich had taken possession of his 
 features. 
 
 “ Yes,” said Lord Adelm, biting his lips, “ as she

 tied up Rosbrin’s leg, I heard her call us ‘ the two 
 Gentlemen of Verona;’ and the fool laughed as if she 
 had said the cleverest thing in the world ; the soubri- 
 quet, too, has stuck to us ever since, for when you 
 were missed, you were inquired for by the title of 
 1 Sweet Valentine,’ and I was addressed as c Gentle 
 Proteus.’ You will find them all in the paroxysm of 
 the dramatic mania at Dunore, at least they have 
 been so these four days; and Lady Clancare will 
 keep up the epidemic till she is secure of exchanging 
 her castle of Ballydab for the mansion of Kilrosbrin.” 
 So saying, he galloped off, followed by his groom, 
 who had been talking to O'Leary ; and Fitzwalter, as 
 one who had undergone a sudden revulsion of ideas 
 and feelings, heaved a deep sigh, and continued his 
 route to the Friary. 
 
 By a few indirect questions, he discovered that 
 O’Leary had given Lord Adelm sufficient notices on 
 the proprietorship of the handkerchief to induce him 
 to learn the address, situation, and story of its sup- 
 posed owner; and he entertained no doubt that his 
 friend was now engaged in a pursuit of errantry, in 
 the supposition of having discovered the unknown 
 spell which had governed his recent life. But no- 
 thing could come of nothing. If Lady Clancare, the 
 frank, though mysterious, unaccountable, incompre- 
 hensible Lady Clancare, could be depended upon, the 
 devotion of Florence Macarthy to himself, ideal and 
 romantic as it appeared, would sufficiently frustrate 
 the hopes of Lord Adelm, whether they sprang from 
 vengeance or from love. If, however, contrary to all 
 expectation, prepossession yielded to ambition, he 
 would himself stand released from an engagement

 to which honor alone now bound him. In either case, 
 the pursuit and absence of Lord Adelm boded him no' 
 ill ; it was, indeed, a subject dwelt upon but for a mo- 
 ment, and rapidly forgotten for one which gradually 
 possessed itself of his mind with an uncontrollable 
 influence. 
 
 Lady Clancare’s views on Lord Rosbrin, as detailed 
 to him by Lord Adelm, he could neither credit nor 
 disbelieve ; he had not yet been a witness of the 
 operations upon which Lord Adelm’s inferences were 
 founded. He saw at once that, like all vain persons, 
 Fitzadelm was easily piqued by the semblance of ne- 
 glect, even in a woman who neither interested nor at- 
 tracted him, and that his suspicions might have 
 originated in the discoloring source of wounded self- 
 love. He resolved, therefore, to judge for himself, 
 and for this purpose once more to join the circle at 
 Dunore — painful as it was, to become involved in 
 Lady Clancare’s strange intrigue, and to support the 
 character assumed by her direction. 
 
 Wrapped in reverie, he was still seated before the 
 untasted dinner which O’Leary had provided for him, 
 when a note from Lady Clancare increased the pulsa* 
 tion of his heart, and propelled the blood with a vio- 
 lence that induced O’Leary to observe, as he stood 
 watching him : 
 
 “ Ho bad news, I hope, gineral, sir ? It was a bit 
 of a gossoon gave old Morraigh that missive, your 
 honor, while I was attending on you, sir, and hope 
 the Crawleys have no hand in it. Devil speed the 
 whole kish* of them, I pray !” 
 
 “ Inquire if the messenger waits,” said Fitzwalter, 
 
 * Kish, a basket. 
 


## p. 509 (#515) ############################################

FLORENCE MACARTHY. 
 
 509 
 
 and when O’Leary left the room he re-perused the 
 note, already hastily read. It ran as follows : 
 
 “ General Fitzwalters letter has been received and 
 acknowledged. The struggle of contending feelings 
 prevents an immediate decision, and an interval for 
 reflection is consequently required. Love and pride, 
 hope and fear, are all at variance. Meantime, it is 
 expected General F. will not present himself at the 
 Convent of the Annunciation without a special invita- 
 tion. Should Lady Clancare have the honor of meet- 
 ing General Fitzwalter this evening at Dunore Castle, 
 she may find some moment, a la dcrobee , for being 
 more explicit. 
 
 “ Castle Macarthy. 
 
 Monday , six o'clock .” 
 
 The handwriting of Lady Clancare, the paper 
 folded by her, fluttered, the pulse of him to whom it 
 was addressed, and for a moment even the nature of 
 the communication was forgotten. When at last re- 
 verted to, the contents of the note came like a re- 
 prieve ; he believed that there was no necessity for 
 remaining where he was to receive the sentence by 
 which he was resolved to abide. He had arisen from 
 the table, and was about to replace the note in its en- 
 velope, when the seal caught his attention ; its motto 
 w^as 
 
 “ Sou utile ainda que bricando.”

 In the brief sketch which Lord Adelm had made 
 of the social economy of the Castle of Dunore, he 
 had scarcely exaggerated the epidemic influence of 
 the reigning folly of the day. The dramatic mania 
 which had seized the marchioness, indirectly or di- 
 rectly favored the views, interests, or vanity of every 
 member of her circle. It broke through the spell of 
 that all-pervading demon, ennui, and provided that 
 something to do, or to discuss, so essential to those 
 who are habitually dependent upon external circum- 
 stances for occupation and interest ; to those who, 
 from their elevated position in society, are unprac- 
 tised in the exercise of their own resources. It re- 
 moved likewise the prying eye of concentrated ob- 
 servation from those who wished to elude its glances ; 
 and, by opening the door to strangers, it enlarged a 
 circle whose members had long become weary of 
 each other.

 Even Conway Crawley and his aunt, the only per- 
 sons of that family then at the castle, found their ac- 
 count in an event, which afforded to the poetical 
 vanity of one an opportunity of writing an opening 
 address, while it left him a more undisputed manage- 
 ment of the Glannacrime election ; and to the other 
 it held out means of operating the conversion of 
 Lady Dunore, which overcame her conscientious 
 aversion to theatricals, private or public, and recon- 
 ciled her to the sin, as an instrument of contingent 
 good. 
 
 Meantime her own little frippery tastes and paste- 
 board talents had ample scope in planning decora- 
 tions for the prosenium of the new theatre, in as- 
 sisting Lord Rosbrin in the getting up of stage pro- 
 perties, and in suggesting devices and mottoes to or- 
 nament the frontispiece. She disapproved, it is true, 
 and spoke against the whole business with edifying 
 eloquence; but she seized not less willingly the 
 scissors and the pencil, at the command of Lady 
 Dunore ; domineering over the dressmakers of the 
 theatrical wardrobe, as over the semptresses of the 
 cheap repository ; dictating to machinists as she had 
 done to neophytes, and flattering herself that she 
 was forming a balance to the preponderating influence 
 of Lady Claneare, who had so nearly turned the 
 vacillating scale of her patroness’s favor against her. 
 
 The difficulties, obstacles, and contrarieties, which 
 were to be overcome, or reconciled, made up the 
 'whole charm of the arrangement to Lady Dunore, 
 who, in her capacity of manageress, had to contend 
 with that inordinate vanity, that overweening amour 
 propre, usually attributed to actors, public or private;

 the contrariety, though wearied, fatigued, and fe- 
 vered, was not less a source of gratification than of 
 annoyance. 
 
 It was in vain that plays were selected, proportion- 
 ate to what Lord Rosbrin technically called “ the 
 strength of the company,” and that parts were ju- 
 diciously cast, according to the talents of the re- 
 spective actors. The corps dramatique of Dunore 
 was a company of first-rates; all stars, all chiefs, 
 either of the sock or buskin, or of both : none were 
 subalterns ; and, with a profusion of supernumerary 
 Romeos and Doricourts, Macbeths and Macheaths, 
 there were none to take the inferior characters. 
 
 A young lady from Cork (introduced by Miss 
 Crawley as an “ Irish gentlewoman bred and born,” 
 soon to come forward on the Dublin boards, and 
 already, by the stamp of private opinion, superior 
 to the Barries and Siddonses of other times,) took 
 possession at once of the tragic heroines, with a 
 spirit of monopoly that was not without opposition. 
 Contentions ran so high on the subject of Othello, 
 that at last it was laid aside; and three tragedies 
 were placed in the stock list, in which each of the 
 tragedians were in turn to play the principal part, 
 and engross exclusively the attention of the audi- 
 ence. 
 
 Lady Dunore, meanwhile, far from reconciling these 
 dramatic disputes, endeavored by every species of 
 tracasserie to nourish and perpetuate them. Alter- 
 nately chosen by the contending parties as referee 
 and umpire, she became the very genius of discord ; 
 and before the first rehearsal, one-half the company 
 had sent the other to Coventry, and held no commu-

 nication but in their assumed characters of heroes 
 and heroines. 
 
 In this floating capital of vanity and exhibition, the 
 largest portion of stock seemed to have been con- 
 tributed by Lady Clancare. The first line in comedy 
 had been assigned to her by Lord Rosbrin ; and the 
 oddity, whim, and originality with which she de- 
 livered certain passages in the Rosalinds, Beatrices, 
 and Roxalanas, whether they were or were not true 
 to the author’s conception, obtained universal ad- 
 miration. 
 
 The influence, however, which she had obtained 
 was not exclusively through her histrionic talent. She 
 had made herself necessary to the amusement of 
 those so difficult to amuse ; and she consequently as- 
 sumed an overweening importance, which never fails 
 to succeed with indolence, or mediocrity, in all ranks. 
 She now affected to consider acting as the first of 
 talents : she spoke, as if a great tragedian or come- 
 dian, male or female, was of more consequence to 
 society than the philosopher who instructs, the genius 
 who enlightens, or the artist who improves it : and 
 she who, as an author, an inventor, Or an originator, 
 had appeared in this bon-ton circle, modest, nervous, 
 timid, and unpretending, now, in her newly assumed 
 character of an actress, an imitator, a detailer of 
 other person’s ideas, became imposing, self-sufficient, 
 and inconsequent. She took without hesitation the 
 place which the new prepossessions of the frivolous 
 society in which she lived had assigned her, and 
 gave that boundless fling to whim and caprice, in 
 'which the spoiled of every class indulge, at the ex- 
 pense of those who make them what they are.

 Always surprising, or disappointing', she set calcu- 
 lation at defiance ; and the certainty that the corps 
 dramatique could not do without Ler, rendered them 
 submissive to all her oddities. Still refusing to sleep 
 at Dunore, a carriage, horses, and servants, were kept 
 in continued requisition to go between that mansion 
 and Castle Macarthy, a journey which they performed 
 a dozen times a day. Not unfrequently she was su- 
 perintending her turf clamps, while her Solyman, the 
 magnificent, fretted his hour upon the stage in ex- 
 pectation of his sultana;— or was busied with literary 
 composition, or in getting in her potatoes, while Or- 
 lando stood in the forest of Arden, in vain attendance 
 on his whimsical Rosalind. But while she thus ill- 
 treated her co-partners, for authors she had no mercy. 
 Seemingly occupied with the idea that she alone could 
 amuse or interest the audience, her efforts to stand 
 supereminently forward, to secure the leading points 
 and “ clap-traps,” as Lord Rosbrin called them, were 
 incessant and extravagant. She cut, interpolated, 
 subjoined, transposed, and changed the text of her 
 part, until scarcely an original intention of the man- 
 gled author remained; and in this sacrifice to her 
 monopolizing ambition, Shakspeare and O’Keeffe, Ben 
 Jonson and Morton, the author of the day, or the 
 poet of the ages, were treated with equal severity, or 
 rather with equal indifference. Still, however, dis- 
 satisfied with all she could effect by efforts, naturally 
 opposed by the contending selfishness of rival candi- 
 dates, she finally resolved (and her versatile talents 
 forwarded the intention) to write a monologue for 
 herself, in which, uniting various characters, she 
 would alone occupy the stage and the audience.

 The sketch she gave of her interlude (then new and 
 unworn) met with general approbation. Even the 
 literary talent expended upon its composition was 
 forgiven, in favor of the more highly-prized ability 
 which was requisite to enact it ; and they who would 
 have scarcely inquired the name of the person who 
 ( produced the clever thing, were wild in praise of the 
 j actress who only realized the conceptions 
 
 “ But, good heaven ! my dear Lady Clancare,” ob- 
 j served the marchioness, as Lady Clancare, the centre 
 of a circle of listeners, concluded the reading of the 
 rough sketch of her monologue, “ why don’t you 
 write plays, instead of those romantic tales about 
 your own country, which everybody reads, and no- 
 body believes ?” 
 
 “ Ay, why, indeed !” said Lord Rosbrin. 
 
 “ Because,” replied Lady Clancare, “ if I wrote 
 plays, I am afraid I must draw characters.” 
 
 “ To be sure,” said Lady Dunore ; “ and what then ? 
 Is there anything so delightful as characters ?” 
 
 “ Provided they resemble nobody,” said Lady 
 Clancare. 
 
 . u How do you mean ?” asked the marchioness. 
 
 “ Simply that, should I ever abandon my high 
 strain of romance, by the advice and supplication of 
 my dear friends, les belles et bonnes dames de par le 
 monde , and hold the mirror up to life, you would all 
 fancy you detected in it your own reflections, and 
 each 
 
 1 Would cry, that was levelled at me.’ ” 
 
 “ Certainly,” said Lady Ceorgiana ; “ if one saw 
 one’s self shown up, one would feel and resent it, and

 so, too, I hope, would all one’s friends; at least, I 
 should expect it.” 
 
 ‘ But what is the genre of character,” said Lady 
 Clancare, “ which, if in true keeping to life and man- 
 ners, should not be found to resemble anybody? 
 There is no beau ideal in human life ; combine quali- 
 ties as you may, to the very verge of extravagance, 
 the world will furnish models, trace likenesses, and as- 
 sign originals. Let your conceptions be as universal 
 as they can— paint classes and describe genera, classes 
 and genera are still made up of individuals ; and even 
 vanity will find out resemblances where malice could 
 not trace similitude. There, indeed, my patience 
 quite fails me. Conscious vice, conscious absurdity, 
 and apprehensive eccentricity, when combined with 
 masculine energies and decided volitions, may be ex- 
 cused for indulging in such fanciful appropriations ; 
 but that the walking no-characters of every-day life, 
 the dear, dull 
 
 6 Unfinished things, one knows not what to call, 
 
 Their generation’s so equivocal,’ 
 
 should imagine themselves fit subjects for indignant 
 reprehension, or sportive caricature, and live in fear 
 of authors, lest they should put them in their books.” 
 “ But why write at all ?” exclaimed Lord Rosbrin, 
 who was now considered as the professed admirer of 
 Lady Clancare, and who took an interest in all she 
 said or did. 
 
 “ Simply,” she replied, “ to live — you may, perhaps, 
 add quelle necessity ; and, perhaps, also,” she added 
 significantly, “ you are right.” 
 
 “ No,” answered Lord Rosbrin, “ I should reply no 
 such thing. I would have you live to be the first

 actress of the day, which you would, should you ever 
 be tempted to go on the stage” 
 
 “ One never did see a peeress on the stage,” said 
 Lady Dunore, delighted with the new idea “ it would 
 be quite curious, charming.” 
 
 “ So it would,” said Lady Clancare, as if suddenly 
 struck with the proposal; and inclined to adopt it. 
 
 “ You would have made the first actress in the 
 world,” continued Lord Rosbrin, “ and, perhaps, 
 would net ten or twenty thousand pounds in a year 
 or two.” 
 
 “ More than you could make in a long life by writ- 
 ing the best book that ever was read,” observed Lady 
 Dunore. 
 
 “ A great deal more,” replied Lady Clancare. 
 
 “ Besides,” continued Lord Rosbrin, “ so far from 
 derogating from your rank, it would probably pro- 
 mote it. The greenroom is now the shortest road 
 to the red bench.” 
 
 “ Exactly so,” replied Lady Clancare. 
 
 “ And many English peers,” continued Lord Ros- 
 brin, with meaning in his looks, “ who would not 
 think of you as a gentlewoman, or a genius, would 
 be happy to lay their honors and their fortunes at 
 your feet, as a celebrated and popular actress.” 
 
 “ Chi pent se rapporter a votes, par exempted said 
 Lord Frederick. 
 
 “Then,” said Lady Dunore, “you would be so 
 much more fetee as an actress than as a genius.” 
 
 “ Besides,” said Lord Rosbrin, “ who cares when an 
 author dies ?” 
 
 “Nobody,” said Lady Clancare, shaking her head. 
 
 “ What is there in the death of twenty celebrated

 writers, to the solemnity of one great tragedian tak- 
 ing leave of the stage? Handkerchiefs streaming, 
 eyes winking, sobs heaving, laurels flying, awful 
 pauses, broken sentences, and hysterical screams. 
 I’d rather be a great actor, taking leave of the stage, 
 than die the greatest hero of the age. 7 ’ 
 
 “ Then when you do die,” continued Lord Ros- 
 brin, heated by his subject, “ what honors await you ! 
 Dukes hold the pall — earls chief mourners — Dead 
 March in Saul — monument in Westminster — dust 
 mingled with kings and conquerors !” 
 
 Here a sort of Irish howl, bursting from the lips 
 of Lady Clancare, produced a shout of laughter from 
 all present, save Lord Rosbrin, to whom she replied, 
 shaking her head, and wiping her tearless eyes, “ Ho, 
 never did I think I should weep so much at my own 
 funeral; for I am now determined to adopt your 
 lordship’s advice; and like other dramatis per some 
 1 to that complexion must I come at last. 7 ” 
 
 “ Then, 7 ’ said Lord Rosbrin, “ I promise yen com- 
 plete success,” and he added, in a low whisper, “ more 
 than that.” 
 
 “ In that case,” said Mr. Pottinger (who, since Lady 
 Clancare’s popularity with the “people of quality,” 
 had taken her into special consideration), “ in that 
 case I fear your ladyship cannot go to the castle, that 
 is, on public days. You could not well take your 
 place on the red bench as an actress, although you 
 are a peeress.” 
 
 “ That, indeed,” said Lady Clancare, as if suddenly 
 struck with the mortifying conviction, “ that makes 
 all the difference.” 
 
 “ But,” said Lord Rosbrin* “in that case you will

 not come to Ireland, except as a star, in the after 
 season, when Covent Garden is shut ; and I'll answer 
 for it, the viceregals will be enchanted to give you 
 les petite s entrees at the Phoenix. I remember when 
 the arrival of an Italian opera singer in Dublin turned 
 the heads of the court, and of all the officials, major 
 and minor. Imagine, then, how another Darren, 
 another Abingdon, would be received.” 
 
 “I wish, Lady Clancare,” said Lady Georgiana, 
 with her usual supercilious, high-dame-of-quality air, 
 “ I wish you would raconier a little of your history : 
 I dare say itf would be very amusing and odd.” 
 
 “ A mourir cle plaisir , no doubt,” said Lord Frede- 
 rick, raising his glass to her face. 
 
 “ No,” said Lady Clancare, conceitedly throwing 
 herself into an arm chair, “ I am not equal to details 
 to-night : besides, should my story be serious, you 
 would yawn over it ; should it be romantic, you 
 would quiz it; if philosophical, you would not under- 
 stand it; if commonplace, you would abuse it; it 
 extraordinary, you would doubt it. Now it happens 
 to be all this, and I should thus unite every species 
 of criticism against me.” 
 
 “I have not a doubt,” said Lord Rosbrin, “ that 
 your life would be quite as amusing as George Anr.e 
 Bellamy’s apology, or Miss Baddeley’s memoirs.” 
 
 “ And as edifying, too ?” asked Lady Clancare. 
 
 “ But I appeal to Lady Dunore, if it be possible for 
 me to reveal all the circumstances of my life ?” 
 
 “ By no means,” said Lady Dunore, with a mys- 
 terious air, and throwing her eyes to that part of the 
 room where General Fitz waiter stood, and she in- 
 stantly gave the conversation another turn.

 After a short struggle Fitzwalter had yielded to 
 the temptation of Lady Clancare’s indirect appoint* 
 ment, and had joined the evening circle at Dunore, 
 where he was received with courtesy by the mar- 
 chioness, but with indifference by all the rest. Mr. 
 Daly ; the only person capable of appreciating him, 
 had departed; driven away by the noise, confusion 
 and discomfort, the bus$e and contentions of the pri- 
 vate theatricals. The little society that had been en- 
 joyed at Dunore Castle was now quite broken up, 
 conversation was at an end, and even cards and bil- 
 liards were suspended, the whole intercourse being 
 confined to criticisms on the drama, compliments be- 
 tween the actors on their respective merits, or com- 
 plaints of rival monopolists. 
 
 The hope which had led General Fitzwalter to the 
 castle was wholly frustrated. Lady Clancare had 
 afforded him no opportunity of addressing her. On 
 entering the saloon he beheld her the yprimum mobile 
 of the circle which surrounded her. During the 
 evening she scarcely noticed him by a look; and 
 when she retired, which she did early, Lord Rosbrin 
 led her to the carriage and took her willing hand 
 with the air of Henry the Eighth handing out Anne 
 Bulleyn at Cardinal Wolsey’s banquet and murmur- 
 i ing as they passed Fitzwalter, 
 
 “ The fairest bud I ever touched. Oh, beauty, 
 
 Till now I never knew thee !” 
 
 While she, humoring his folly, replied : 
 
 “ I do not know 
 
 What kind of my obedience I should tender, 
 
 More than my all is nothing. 
 
 Beseech your lordship, &c„, &c.

 The words were lost as she disappeared, and a 
 conviction of the truth of Lord Adelm’s observation 
 struck forcibly on Fitz waiter’s mind. He turned 
 away in indignant irritation, while Lady Dunore, 
 with her eyes fixed expressly on his, observed : 
 
 “ Is not Lady Clancare an excellent actress ?” 
 
 “ Excellent !” he replied in a tone of ironical sig- 
 nificance. 
 
 “Lord Rosbrin is amazingly in love with her,” 
 added Lady Dunore emphatically. 
 
 “ It is a proof of his taste,” replied the general coldly. 
 
 “What do you think of her?” demanded Lady 
 Dunore with an inquisitorial look. 
 
 Aware of the object of all these remarks and ques- 
 tions, General Fitzwalter felt confused and indignant 
 at the strange situation into which Lady Clancare’s 
 imbroglio had thrown him. Lady Dunore evidently 
 enjoyed his confusion ; without reiterating the ques- 
 tion she added, “ She is extremely clever, but by no 
 means does the honors by her own talents ; and, un- 
 til we hit on these delightful theatricals, had no suc- 
 cess whatever with my set. Since then, she has 
 come out wonderfully. She is the most delightful 
 ' Beatrice I ever saw, and capable of making a Bene- 
 dict of the most' obdurate wife hater.” With these 
 words, uttered with a mysterious air, she fluttered 
 away and joined in a conversation in another part of 
 the room. 
 
 General Fitzwalter found himself for two or three 
 successive evenings in the saloon of the castle a spec- 
 tator rather than a member of its society. His vis- 
 its, however, were apparitions. He came and dis- 
 appeared abruptly, as if in search of some object

 never obtained yet still pursued. His character was 
 more than usually energized; and, though he com- 
 monly stood wrapped in silent but acute observation, 
 in sullen and marked abstraction, yet he occasionally 
 came forward in conversation with a boldness and 
 originality that chequered the monotonous flow of 
 some modish opinion and startled commonplace re- 
 mark from its wonted track. 
 
 His first appearance at Dunore as a guerilla chief 
 insured him that species of favorable reception given 
 equally to learned pigs and French conjurers, Esqui- 
 meaux warriors and Irish giants ; but first preposses- 
 sions faded away in proportion as it became known 
 that he was engaged in a cause wholly inimical to 
 the sentiments of the greater part of Lady Dunore’s 
 circle; and he had upon the whole, after the first 
 surprise occasioned by his abrupt and splendid ap- 
 pearance, become an object of somewhat less conse- 
 quence than Thady Windham Crawley, with his pen- 
 insular honors, bivouacks, wigwams, and the Ra- 
 gent’s levee. 
 
 The night of the first representation was now ar- 
 rived. The play of “As You Like It” was to be per- 
 formed ; and a crowded audience, furnished from the 
 guests of the castle and the neighborhood of Dunore, 
 had already assembled, when a note from Lady Clan- 
 care returned by the carriage which had been sent 
 for her informed the marchioness that she should not 
 play Rosalind that night, and hinted that she had 
 been seized with a typhus fever. 
 
 The confusion which this unexpected circumstance 
 created was excessive. Persons had arrived from 
 immense distances ; expectation was at its height.

 The first music was over and all was consternation. 
 Lady Dunore stamped her feet and wrung her hands 
 as if the most dreadful affliction had befallen her; 
 she abused Lady Clancare as if her misfortune was 
 her fault ; and would have set off for Castle Macar- 
 thy but for the apprehension of the infection so long 
 the object of her terror. In the midst of this dilem- 
 ma Lord Rosbrin, already dressed for Orlanlo, pro- 
 posed to undertake the part of Rosalind ; while the 
 second Amoureux ) who was to have performed Syl- 
 vius, should assume Orlando. The second Amou- 
 reux declared that Orlando was the part he had ori- 
 ginally intended for himself, and that he was perfect 
 in it. One of the foresters engaged to perform Syl- 
 vius delighted to escape from the mortification of 
 enacting a mute. Lord Rosbrin’s proposed arrange- 
 ment was accepted with transport by Lady Dunore. 
 If he played the part with propriety Lady Clancare 
 would not be missed, if he did it ridiculously her 
 place would be still better supplied. 
 
 The place teas still better supplied, and the shouts 
 of laughter which hailed the entrances and exits of 
 Rosalind were testimonies that the audience were 
 satisfied and amused up to their bent. The play 
 went off brilliantly, bravoes and archi-bravoes mark- 
 ed every speech, and the original Rosalind was left 
 extended on her bed of sickness, without one thought 
 of her situation, and given to instant oblivion. The 
 disappointment she had occasioned Lady Dunore in 
 the first instance had overthrown the frail structure 
 of her prepossession at a blow, and the creature who 
 could no longer amuse, no longer interested, or lived 
 in the memory of her soi-disant friends and admirers.

 Lady Dunore, wearied and exhausted, was the last 
 to quit the scene of festivity, and the most anxious 
 to prolong it. She had presided at a splendid sup- 
 per after the play, and had reluctantly bowed out 
 her guests, and bestowed her usual embrassades on 
 her dear friend, Lady Georgiana ; she was now tak- 
 ing one lingering look at the silent and deserted 
 theatre in her passage to her own apartment when 
 the sound of a footstep closely following her own 
 alarmed her, she knew not why. Without “ casting 
 a look behind” she was hastily ascending the stairs 
 when a voice called after her, “ Aisy, aisy, my lady, 
 if you plaze. I’d just beg a word with your ladyship 
 incornuto for a moment.” 
 
 At the well-known voice and accent of Darby 
 Crawley Lady Dunore turned round. “ Good God !” 
 she said, “ Mr. Crawley, is it you ? When did you 
 arrive from Dublin ? Were you at our play ? 
 Conceive my not seeing you !” 
 
 “ I was not, my lady, but came here a few hours 
 back, and has been lying” — he whispered — “ per dor 
 in Anne Clotworthy’s room till the play was over, 
 and the company gone, not wishing to show myself 
 for raisins of state. Would your ladyship just turn

 in here for a moment and grant me a hearing on 
 very particular business 
 
 “ Certainly,” said Lady Dunore, following him into 
 the dark, spacious dining-room. Crawley shut the 
 door cautiously, took the chamber candlestick out of 
 Lady Dunore’s hand and placed it on a table, then 
 drew forward a chair for her and another for him- 
 self, picked up her reticule and presented it with a 
 bow, then drawing his hand over his face, as if at a 
 loss how to begin, he at last abruptly inquired : 
 
 “ Does your ladyship know anything of Lord 
 Adelm Fitzadelm ? for he is not here it seems.” 
 
 “ Gracious heavens !” exclaimed Lady Dunore, sud- 
 denly alarmed : “ if anything has happened, let me 
 know it at once and she started from her chair. 
 
 “ Where is Fitzadelm, and what do you know of 
 him?” 
 
 “ Nothing in life, I give you my honor, Lady Du- 
 nore ; and wouldn’t keep you in suspince half a 
 minute if I did : only just axed out of curiosity, if 
 he’s at a distance ; that’s all, I give you my honor.” 
 
 “ I don’t know where he is,” said Lady Dunore, be- 
 tween the hope and the fear of having some cause for 
 alarm and agitation: “he is upon one of his wild 
 rambles.” 
 
 “ Tom-Mew , as the French says, Lady Dunore ; for 
 he has a mighty odd, quick way with him, and isn’t 
 always inclined to hear raison.” 
 
 “Nor I neither, at two in the morning, my dear 
 Mr. Crawley !” yawned his disappointed auditress. 
 “Surely your coming at so unseasonable an hour 
 must have some extraordmary motive,” and she took 
 up her candlestick.

 “ Noways extraordinary at all, at all, madam; for 
 such things happen every day : what brings me here 
 to your ladyship, masquerading at this hour of the 
 night, is about a hitch in the election. I suppose 
 Conway has tould your ladyship that the sheriffs 
 precept for the election is issued, and the polling will 
 begin to-morrow.” 
 
 “I believe he did; but really,” and she yawned 
 again, “ I have been so deeply engaged of late, and 
 Fitzadelm’s absence, and my dependence on you, and 
 your son, and things, that I did not particularly think 
 about it ; but ” 
 
 “ But,” continued Crawley, gently taking the light 
 out of her hand, “ he did not tell you (and how could 
 he, and he never near Glannacrime this fortnight?) 
 that, contrary to our expectation, there will be a vio- 
 lent opposition ; and that it isn’t noways impossible 
 but the Dunore interest will be trodden down by 
 those O’Mahony Whigs.” 
 
 “ Trodden down !” interrupted Lady Dunore, in- 
 dignantly, and reseating herself — “the Dunore in- 
 terest trodden down !” 
 
 “ Except, in addition to the hundreds already dis- 
 tributed, there is a couple of thousand pounds more, 
 to carry on the war during the polling,” added old 
 Crawley, with some hesitation. 
 
 “ And is that all ?” asked Lady Dunore, languidly. 
 
 “ All !” repeated Crawley, with a look of pleased 
 surprise. “ Oh ! if that does not shoot (suit) you, 
 ma’am, your ladyship may follow the bent of your 
 generosity and make it double or quits. But the 
 murther of it is, Lady Dunore, that after you have 
 expended thousands upon thousands, and after Lord

 Aclelm is elected, (which he will be as sure as eggs 
 is eggs, and no thanks to them,) it seems his oppo- 
 nent manes to petition against him in parliament, on 
 the score of what they, the spalpeens, call his bribery 
 and corruption, his trates and his presents, and other 
 illegal practices to which he has had recourse ; that’s 
 if you’ll believe the likes of them, the rebelly thieves !” 
 
 “ Bribery and corruption ! illegal practices ! My 
 son, Lord Adelm Fitzadelm, guilty of this, Mr. Craw- 
 ley!” interrupted Lady Dunore, with a mingled ex- 
 pression of anger and surprise. “ What does all this 
 mean, Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “Why, it manes, my lady, plain enough, that in 
 Ireland, as throughout the world, a little bribery goes 
 a great way. The people, ma’am, are used to it ; it’s 
 the way of the place, time immemorial, and will be 
 evermore. The voters and freeholders, and corpora- 
 tion of Giannacrime, require a taste of a dewshure, as 
 well as their betters — why wouldn’t they ? and noth- 
 ing has been done here, that hasn’t been done since 
 the beginning of the Europayan world, at all elec- 
 tions; and would pass muster anywhere, only for 
 them jacobin whigs, the O'Mahonys, that are just 
 ready, like drowned men, to catch at a straw. It's 
 only them and the likes of them that is always open 
 mouthed against loyal men, or would go to call a 
 little trifle of a prisant made to the burgesses of Gian- 
 nacrime a bribe.” 
 
 “ I don’t care what they call it,” said Lady Dunore, 
 rising in violent emotion, as the high honor and lofty 
 spirit of her son started to her recollection, coupled 
 with these accusations — “ I don’t care what your 
 Irish creatures call it ; but what will my son say ?

 What will Lord Ad elm Fitzadeim say to this impu- 
 tation on his honor and principles ?” 
 
 “ What can he say, madam ?” returned Crawley, en- 
 deavoring to keep pace with Lady Dunore, who was 
 now walking in agitation up and down the room. 
 “ What can his lordship say, hut that while he was 
 star-gazing in Lisburn, the capital of Spain, among 
 them Papists, his friends at home was working for 
 his interests, like gallows slaves, sparing neither time, 
 money nor labor to keep out the ould enemies of his 
 family, and get in himself?” 
 
 “ He will murder you, Mr. Crawley; I promise you 
 that,” said Lady Dunore, coolly, |ind stopping short 
 in her quick pacing. 
 
 “ The Lord save us !” ejaculated Crawley, looking 
 round him fearfully. 
 
 “You know,,” she continued, “he already holds 
 you and all your family en franche et belle aversion .” 
 
 “ He does !” said old Crawley, guessing rather 
 than understanding the purport of this sincere assu- 
 rance. Then with a low, half insolent, half mys- 
 terious tone, he added, “ Why then, in spite of all 
 that, Lady Dunore, it’s me and my family can be the 
 saving of him and his yet.” 
 
 “ Indeed !” said Lady Dunore, with a laugh of 
 irony. 
 
 “ Indeed !” repeated Crawley, unintimidated ; “ and, 
 Lady Dunore, will you just hear me for a minute ; 
 and then I’ll never spake more, if I don’t contint you 
 to your heart’s desire.” 
 
 There was something imposing in the manner of 
 Crawley which induced the marchioness to resume

 her seat, and to grant him (what she so rarely 
 granted any one) a patient hearing. 
 
 “ Now, Lady Dunore,” he continued, “ it will tell 
 ill for the greatness, and grandeur, and honor of the 
 Fitzadelm and Dunore families, that him, who may 
 be said to be their representative, should be little 
 better than a rogue and a rapparee, and give handle 
 to the Whigs in the House of Commons, to be 
 talking of the corruptionists and Irish electioneering 
 bribery, and the likes. But as sure as Lord Adelm 
 is returned, all this will come to pass. He’ll be pe- 
 titioned against in the House of Commons, to the en- 
 tire satisfaction of the Whigs.” 
 
 “ I would not for a thousand worlds,” interrupted 
 Lady Dunore : “ I should never stand London, and 
 the insolence of the opposition women.” 
 
 “ Then, my lady, sorrow thing there is to be done 
 at all, at all, in the business, but to withdraw Lord 
 Adelm altogether for the present, who takes no 
 pleasure in the election; and instead of being can- 
 vassing, is at this moment philandering it, like a 
 beau maison , after some skittish young fawn of a 
 female. Just, you see, consint to set him fairly 
 aside ; and then, you see, Lady Dunore, we’ll get 
 another person agraiable to all parties, to set up in 
 his stead, who will be elected forthwith, and sorrow 
 word you’ll hear of corruption, or bribery, or the 
 likes, I’ll engage.” 
 
 “ And so save our honor,” said Lady Dunore, “ and 
 lose all our money.” 
 
 “ No, but save both,” interrupted Crawley; “ for 
 we’d take care to set up a person that would be a

 for the real member till the desolution, which will 
 soon come ; for ail the world as your ladyship’s foot- 
 man keeps your box for you at the theatre till you 
 arrive yourself.” 
 
 “ This all sounds plausibly, Mr. Crawley ; and you 
 certainly are a very long-headed person, in spite of 
 your teinture de ridicule , which renders you very 
 amusing. But where could we get a person to take 
 Fitzadelm’s place, in whom we could rely, in whom 
 we could confide , who would act, for the time being, 
 as our deputy, and vote as we bid him ?” 
 
 “ Why, then, I’d offer myself with all the veins,* 
 Lady Dunore, only that crassing the say just fairly 
 kills me.” 
 
 “ You !” said Lady Dunore, bursting into a fit of 
 laughter. 
 
 “ And what would ail me ?” he answered, in a tone 
 of mortification. “ Sure, many a man as isn’t fit to 
 hold a candle to me, Lady Dunore, has been sent over 
 from this country a ready cut and dried parliament 
 man. I give you my honor, I’d do as well as the 
 best of them, if I was in it, and make them split their 
 sides laughing, which is all the go now. But if it’s 
 eloquence and poethry you want, and one readymade 
 to their hands, and just in their own way, quite 
 ministarial, isn’t there Counsellor Con, the darlint of 
 the corporation, and would prefar him ’bove the 
 world ? I’ll engage he’d be returned as soon as no- 
 minated ; and has been merely known as law agent 
 for the election, and has nothing to do with what the 
 Whigs call bribery, but stands with clane hands ; and

 would lay down his life for the Dunores, though 
 Lord Adelrn trates him de ho -on baw , as the French 
 says.” 
 
 Iiei^ Crawley paused, looking from under his- 
 shrewd little eyes on Lady Dunore, and puckered up 
 his mouth, in silent expectation of her answer to this 
 hazardous proposition. 
 
 Lady Dunore, after a few moments’ silent cogita- 
 tion, exhausted alike in body and spirit, and already 
 weary of a subject which now ceased to agitate her, 
 at last observed : “ Well, Mr. Crawley, you have hi- 
 therto conducted this business your own way. I am 
 quite ignorant of the details ; but all I know is this, 
 the deputy member for G-lannacrime must be a staunch, 
 thorough-going friend to the present ministry.” 
 
 “Lave him alone for that,” interrupted Crawley, 
 “ sure isn't he after their own heart ?’’ 
 
 “ And the honor and intentions of my son must 
 never even be called in question.” 
 
 “ How can it, when there will be no petition against 
 him, if he is not elected ?” 
 
 “As to Lord Adelrn,” continued Lady Dunore, 
 “ the borough of Glannacrime is evidently an object 
 of indifference to him, pour le moins ; and I shall be 
 the less anxious, as I shall command the voice of 
 your son, in addition to my other voices in the house ; 
 for Conway is, after all, and notwithstanding what 
 people call his vulgar effrontery, a very clever, and, 
 as you observe, eloquent creature.” 
 
 “ Why, then, he is that same, every taste of it, and, 
 without wishing to alarm your ladyship, or give you 
 unaisy drames to-night, I must just say that the time 
 may not be far off ” Here he paused, looked

 cautiously round, advanced to the door to see if it 
 was fast, and then returning on tiptoe, continued— 
 
 “ when you can’t have too many voices in the house, ! 
 nor too many friends in court, as the saying goes.” 
 
 “What do you mean?” demanded Lady Dunore, 
 startled, and amazed more by his manner than his 
 words. 
 
 “ Och ! it’s no matter what I mane, now,” said old 
 Crawley, coolly ; “ 1 on time’s uncertain date eternal 
 hours depend ;’ but I won’t now detain your ladyship 
 another moment.” 
 
 The clock at this instant struck three. 
 
 “ I shall not leave this room now, be the hour what 
 it may,” said Lady Dunore, throwing herself back in 
 a chair, and putting her feet on another, to mark her 
 determination, “ until you explain to me the myste- 
 rious words you have just uttered, Mr. Crawley.” 
 
 “ Why, then, see here the dilemia I have reduced 
 myself to,” said Crawley, with an air of perplexity. 
 
 “ I give you my honor, Lady Dunore, I would rather 
 walk with paize (peas) in my shoes than annoy your 
 fine feelings ; and it three in the morning, and you 
 tired.” 
 
 “ I am not in the very least tired, Mr. Crawley. I 
 am equal, at least I fancy I am, to any communica- 
 tion you have to make to me ; so pray go on.” 
 
 Old Crawley, with hesitation, and a marked reluct- 
 ance, either affected or felt, began and broke off se- 
 veral sentences, hemmed, cleared his voice, and cried : 
 
 “ Well, to be sure, of course my late noble friend and 
 patron, your ladyship’s late, dear, and ever-to-be-la- 
 mented concert, has often mentioned to you an idle 
 story, set about by his enemies in regard of a claim-

 ant of the title of Fitzadelm, for there was then no- 
 thing else to claim; and who ” 
 
 “ Not a word,” interrupted Lady Dunore, im- 
 patiently. 
 
 “Not a word!” repeated Crawley, with surprise. 
 “ And never tould your ladyship that his eldest bro- 
 ther, Walter, Lord Fitzadelm, commonly called the 
 Black Baron, had a son, an only son?” 
 
 * “Never.” 
 
 “ Who was drowned, but about whom there were 
 some mighty ugly reports ?” 
 
 “ What reports ?” 
 
 “ Oh ! just that his uncle and his father connived to 
 put him out of the way, to raise money ; that at one 
 time his uncle thought to bastardize him, by proving 
 him the son of a nurse who first suckled the young 
 Fitzadelm ; that this attempt failed ; and that after his 
 brother’s death he had the boy kidnapped, and sent 
 no one knew where, among the black negers, and 
 then trumped up a story of his drowning.” 
 
 “ ’Tis a most curious romance !” said Lady Dunore, 
 interested in the story in proportion to its wildness, 
 and forgetting the part her husband had been accused 
 of playing, or how deeply it affected her own sons. 
 
 Oh, mighty interesting,” said old Crawley, ironi- 
 cally. “ But no one ever believed a word of it, only 
 the inimies of the Fitzadelms. But I suppose my lord 
 tould your ladyship that the herald’s office in Dublin 
 refused him for a long time the style, title and arms 
 of Baron Fitzadelm ?” 
 
 “ Never a syllable.” 
 
 “ Nor of the convei’sation he had with the Ulster 
 King at Arms whom he knocked down, and stood his

 trial for it afterwards in Dublin ; my brother, the 
 sergeant, acting as counsel, and I the attorney, and 
 brought him off illigantly ?” 
 
 “ Never,” said Lady Dunore, with increasing amaze- 
 ment and interest : “he never would allow me to ac- 
 company him to Ireland. It was a subject of eternal 
 contest, with many others. (She sighed.) I led a 
 most miserable life with poor, dear, Lord Fitzadelm, 
 Mr. Crawley ; yet, upon the whole, I have known no 
 happiness since his death : but go on ; your story is a 
 most extraordinary one.” 
 
 “ The most extraordinary part is to come, Lady 
 Dunore : for after all had died away, and poor Lord 
 Fitzadelm dead with the rest, and your son Marquis 
 of Dunore, and everything going on fair and aisy, at 
 the end of three and twenty years, and when people 
 were thinking of nothing at all, at all, the story is re- 
 vived again ; and go which way you will, there is 
 nothing but whispering and coshering, more particu- 
 larly among the lower orders, that the son of Walter 
 Lord Fitzadelm has reappeared to several persons, 
 with the intent of making good his claims to the Du- 
 nore estate and title, and of throwing out your lady- 
 ship's sons, the most noble the marquis, and his bro- 
 ther Lord Adelm Fitzadelm.” 
 
 To this observation, a silence of many minutes suc- 
 ceeded. Lady Dunore sat thunderstruck, with a suc- 
 cession of strange and contradictory emotions hitting 
 over her strongly working countenance. There was 
 something in this wild and romantic tale that har- 
 monized with her unregulated imagination, with her 
 love for the marvellous, and her passion for excessive 
 sensation ; for there was a probability at least of the

 635 
 
 story being true, and a chance of conflict and vicissi- 
 tude, of defeat or success, which flattered her feverish 
 necessity for excitement, exertion, and occupation ; 
 but there yet remained a sufficient source of annoy- 
 ance, apprehension, and anxiety, to counteract emo- 
 tions of a more fanciful nature. Old Crawley sat de- 
 liberately gazing on her, his hands folded, his thumbs 
 twirling, his round, vulgar, bronzed face in strong 
 relief from the light of the taper ; while the pale and 
 haggard countenance of Lady Dun ore, half thrown in 
 shade by the surrounding darkness of the spacious 
 and gloomy apartment, stood opposed in picturesque 
 contrast. 
 
 At last, after a long-drawn inspiration, Lady Du- 
 nore again exclaimed, “ This is a most extraordinary 
 tale, Mr. Crawley.” 
 
 “ It is, indeed, Lady Dunore, mighty extraordinary, 
 if it’s true.” 
 
 “ You do not believe it is so ?” 
 
 “ Believe ! the Lord forbid ! If it was true, my 
 lady, what would become of the marquis your son ? 
 What good would there be in all the mortgages, bar- 
 gains, leases and purchases, made under the Black 
 Baron and your ladyship’s dear late lord, and the 
 present marquis ? Why, if it was proved to be true, 
 Lady Dunore, wouldn’t it be the murther of the 
 world, the ruin of us all ? Sure we must prove it 
 isn’t true, if we spend the last tinpenny we have in 
 the world.” 
 
 “Prove I Then you really think claims will be 
 made — pretensions urged ?” 
 
 “ I think, $ud is certain sure of it. All kinds of

 manyeuvering and checanery’s going on at this prisent 
 moment to prove it.” 
 
 “ But where — how — who is the pretender ?” 
 
 Old Crawley passed his hand over his face ; then 
 looked round, as if he feared a witness of what he 
 w r as going to say. He drew his chair closer to Lady 
 Dunore, and continued in a low tone, “ Where is he ? 
 Why, then, for all I know, Lady Dunore, he’s under 
 your roof at this moment. Anyhow, he was in it 
 this evening.” 
 
 Lady Dunore’s exclamation almost amounted to a 
 scream ; and Crawley, terrified at the vivacity of her 
 emotions, cried : 
 
 “ Hush ! hush ! for the love of the Lord. Keep 
 down your fine feelings, Lady Dunore, dear, and 
 smell your O-de-Lucy, or your Sally-Volatile ; ’ and 
 he searched her reticule for a smelling bottle, which 
 he had often seen her use under any agitation. Hold- 
 ing the salts to her nose (for Lady Dunore, like all 
 hysterical persons, became violent in proportion as 
 she was noticed), he continued : 
 
 “Aisy now, aisy, Lady Dunore, honey! what will 
 I do, if you give way to your asterisks, and nobody 
 up in the house to get you as much as a sup of water, 
 or a thimble full of hartshorn ?” 
 
 The effect of the sal volatile which he poured up 
 her nostrils was so powerful as to absorb for a mo- 
 ment every other sensation; and when she could 
 speak, which she did between laughter and sobs, she 
 observed, “Under my roof, Mr. Crawley! The kid- 
 napped injured son of Lord Walter Fitzadelm under 
 my roof, did you say ?” 
 
 “ Hot at all, Lady Dunore, not the raal son of Ba-

 ron Walter, but an imposture, a vagrant, a rebel, 
 who came and bullied me in my own house, in my 
 sate of Mount Crawley, and wanted to force Count 
 Fitzadelm from me, and refused to drink the 1 Glo- 
 rious and immortal,’ and snapped at Conway, and 
 put his commether upon Clotty, and passed on her 
 for a Methodist preacher, as he did afterwards upon 
 your ladyship for a great officer from the Yankees ; 
 and is neither more nor less than the bastard, saving 
 your ladyship’s presence, of Judy Laffim (who was 
 first nurse to the young Master Fitzadelm that wa£ 
 drowned), a little bit of a by-blow of my lord’s, a jew 
 cV esprit, as the French says; which was the raison 
 why Lady Fitzadelm turned her away when she 
 found she was a forepaw of my lord’s, and she gave 
 the child to that rebelly thief O’Leary’s wife. And 
 now, after everybody has lost sight of him, that’s 
 Micky Laffan, he comes to pass himself for the raal 
 young lord that was drownded, and he goes about 
 chicaning the lower orders and buying them over, 
 and conniving with Lady Clancare, his great crony, 
 though he daren’t let on to know her here, gallo- 
 wanting her in the bogs, and getting in with her into 
 every cabin in the barony, and showing himself as 
 the raal Marquis of Dunore. Isn’t he here playing 
 the great don with your ladyship, and calling him- 
 self Gineral Fitz waiter, and laying down the law to 
 yez, all as one as if he was king of the place already ? 
 And what’s more, my lady, Lady Clancare is no 
 more sick than I am ; and as soon as the curtain was 
 up and the play begun, the gineral was oft' like a 
 shot, and Jemmy Bryan, who never loses sight of 
 him, followed him to Castle Macarthy. Oh, troth,

 it’s little of your ladyship’s play she’s thinking ; no, 
 but of her own, and was humming you all the time ? 
 for the devil is not able for that one, the Lord par- 
 don me !” 
 
 This information, so extraordinary, so out of all 
 calculation, had the effect of sobering Lady Dunore, 
 and of giving for the moment a tinge almost of ra- 
 tionality to her ideas. That she had been duped, 
 deceived, played upon, was the predominant feeling 
 of her mind ; deceived by Lady Clancare, at the mo- 
 ment when she was endeavoring to serve her, and to 
 forward her views ; and she turning out to be the 
 agent of an adventurer, who had come under her 
 roof for the purpose of defrauding and dispossessing 
 her children of their rank and property. 
 
 “I see your ladyship is a little amazed,” said 
 Crawley. 
 
 “ Amazed !” she returned, collectedly, “ yes, a lit- 
 tle; but not confounded, not overcome, as you shall 
 find, Mr. Crawley. You shall see that I can shuffle, 
 and cut, and deal my cards as well as another; you 
 shall find that neither the villany of an impostor, nor 
 the arts of an adventuress, shall be too much for me. 
 The conspiracy of this hero and heroine is, I sup- 
 pose, a fair subject for legal prosecution, but that’s 
 not enough. They must be shown up upon their 
 own scene of action, and it will go hard with me if I 
 don’t make examples of them.” Her eyes darkened 
 w T ith expected vengeance as she spoke. 
 
 “ Why, then, see here, Lady Dunore : divil a bit, 
 but I give you credit for showing a proper spirit ; 
 for hasn't that fellow made you the talk of the coun- 
 try round for letting him into the castle, when not a

 house would let him cross the threshold, and was 
 obliged to take up bis lodgings with that marked 
 man, O’Leary, because the Dunore Arms thought 
 him a suspicious character ?” 
 
 “ I wish we had your son Conway here,” said the 
 marchioness, musing. 
 
 “ Och ! there’s no occasion in life for him. Haven’t 
 he and I been holding a council of war in Clotty’s 
 room while the play was going on, and everything 
 settled and planned between him and I, and only 
 waiting your ladyship’s veto, as the Papists say? 
 I haven’t come from Dublin without my credentials, 
 I’ll ingage.” 
 
 o o 
 
 “ What do you mean, my dear Mr. Crawley ?” 
 
 “ Why, I mane, that I have a warrant to bring the 
 body of this young gineral, who is an ould soger, to 
 Dublin, afore the Lord Chief Justice.” 
 
 “ Oh ! but remember your last warrant, Mr. Craw- 
 ley. You do not briller par la . You must not again 
 involve us in your ridiculous mistakes and conspira- 
 cies, and things in Queen Elizabeth’s days.” 
 
 “I’ll ingage there is no fear, Lady Dunore, and 
 Judge Aubrey not in the country to back his jacobin 
 friends, and has my charges made out in due form 
 and sworn to.” 
 
 “ Yfhat charges, pur example ?” 
 
 “ Only for a trifle of murther, that’s all.” 
 
 “ Murder ?” 
 
 “ Aye, faith, raal and undoubted murther. Didn’t 
 your ladyship hear Conway read out o’ the Hiber- 
 nian Journal, one morning at breakfast, of a rising in 
 the mountains about a still-hunting party, and of a 
 fight between the country people and the sogers, and

 a stranger on horseback getting among them to set- 
 tle the difference, as it was to appear, and taking 
 part in the disturbance, and a shot fired, and a soger 
 killed, and nobody ever able to tell by whom until a 
 lad turned king’s evidence th’ other day, and is ready 
 to swear that this gineral was the murtherer; that he 
 was seen going into a cabin before the fight, and. 
 drinking with the people, and saying he was the raal 
 Lord Dunore; and that on going away, under pre- 
 tence of relieving the people, who were very poor, 
 he gave them, as he thought, a golden guinea, which 
 turned out to be a Spanish coin, the very same that 
 the gineral gave your ladyship a prisint for card 
 counters ; and here it is, and a great evidence it will 
 be on the trial.” 
 
 So saying, he produced the coin. 
 
 “ This is most extraordinary ! This is a special 
 intervention of Providence ! It is indeed the same,” 
 said Lady Dunore, “ that this murderer gave me.” 
 
 “ Now,” said old Crawley, “ a man who is convict- 
 ed of murther, and I believe we have witnesses 
 enough to prove that, wull have but a poor chance 
 of proving his claims to a title and property in the 
 possession of a noble family as is hand and glove 
 with the ministry.” 
 
 “ But you have not got him yet,” said Lady Dunore, 
 impatiently ; “ he may still elude us all.” 
 
 “ He is now, I believe, quietly asleep in O Leary’s 
 lodgings. Jemmy Bryan saw him safe home at half- 
 past ten from Lady Clancare’s, and then came here 
 to inform Conway of it. But what would ail your 
 ladyship but to write him a line in the morning, to 
 beg he would step down to you, as you are unaisy

 about Lord Adelm, whom he flatters himself he’s bit 
 fairly.” 
 
 “ And then ?” said Lady Dunore, reddening with 
 the ardor of her newly-awakened feelings. 
 
 “And then, my lady, we’ll just nab him nately as 
 he stands all alone by himself in your ladyship’s 
 dressing-room; for he has become so populous with 
 the lower orders that if he were arrested at O’Leary’s, 
 that is the ringleader of the country, there would be 
 a rising of every ribbonman and every functionary in 
 the place round.” 
 
 “ No,” said Lady Dunore, whose feelings, all per- 
 sonal, had nothing but private vengeance in view, 
 “ that will never do ; I will have him arrested and ex- 
 posed in the presence of the party assembled in the 
 castle (whom he has imposed upon), and confronted 
 with that artful adventuress, Lady Clancare, who I 
 now see, while she was serving her paramour, was 
 upon the point of taking in poor, dear Lord Rosbrin, 
 persuading me, the little wretch ! that she did it to 
 pique that Fitzwalter ; but don’t talk of her — it mad- 
 dens me to think how I have been duped, laughed at, 
 played upon; and that- ” 
 
 “Now keep yourself cool, Lady Dunore, honey,” 
 interrupted Crawley, fearful of a return of her hys- 
 teric paroxysm, “ and just go to bed, and ” 
 
 “ I will not go to bed till I write a note of invita- 
 tion to the genera], whom we shall outgeneral in the 
 end, and leave it to be sent early in the morning ; 
 and, as to the Countess of Clancare,” and she laughed 
 hysterically, “ a countess, indeed ! a gipsy countess 1 
 with her typhus fever, — I will have the honor of go-

 ing for her myself, and bringing her, vi et armis , to 
 the castle.” 
 
 Cheered by this resolution, Lady Dunore now took 
 up her candle, and with her cheek colorless, her eyes 
 inflamed and staring, and her head wrapped in a lace 
 veil, she not inaptly imaged the sleep-walking and 
 conscience-stricken Lady Macbeth. Old Crawley, 
 meantime, with a tip-toe step, groped his way by the 
 moonlight to the bedroom of his son, who had sat up 
 to receive him, and learn the result of his extraordi- 
 nary interview with the lady of the castle.

CHAPTER XX. 
 
 How couldst thou find this dark, sequestered nook 7 
 
 Milton. 
 
 The solemn consequence given to everything con- 
 nected with the drama by Lord Rosbrin had ren- 
 dered the disappointment occasioned by the illness or 
 caprice of Lady Clancare an event of the most im- 
 portant and mortifying nature ; and he insisted on an- 
 nouncing it to the public in all the set form and 
 phrase usual upon such occasions in the public 
 theatres. He came forward, therefore, with a coun- 
 tenance in which he hoped “ men would read strange 
 things and, after a long pause, he commenced an 
 apology for the non-appearance of Lady Clancare, put 
 forth his own claims to indulgence in assuming, by 
 particular desire, and for that night only, the part of 
 Rosalind ; and concluded by reading aloud the letter 
 of the comic heroine, to whom he had undertaken to 
 act as double . It ran as follows : 
 
 “ My Dear Lady Dunore : — I am obliged to decline 
 the pretty part of the fantastic Rosalind this evening, 
 for one of a less agreeable nature ; and I trust you 
 will not think I am playing the Malade Imag inair e 
 when I assign indisposition as an excuse for my ab- 
 sence from the castle. I 'would, perhaps, ask you to 
 come and judge for yourself of my situation, but that

 the nature of my feelings at this moment, and my re* 
 cent visits to a house where the typhus fever rages, 
 satisfy me that it would be as unsafe for you, as em- 
 barrassing to me, to receive you at Castle Macarthy. 
 
 “ I am, my dear Lady Dunore, &c., 
 
 “F. Clancare.” 
 
 The apology was received with plaudits ; the au- 
 dience, better pleased with the Rosalind which chance 
 and folly had given them, than with the Rosalind of 
 which a dangerous malady had deprived them, 
 “ bound up each corporeal faculty” to expected mirth 
 and laughter. 
 
 Miss Crawley declared the excuse of Lady Clan- 
 care was all affectation, and assumed importance ; and 
 Lord Frederick observed to Lady Georgiana that he 
 saw la petite personne was, from the beginning to the 
 end, playing another part than that assigned her ; and 
 that it was very clear her intention had never been to 
 play at all. 
 
 Contrary to his first intentions, General Fitzwalter 
 found himself in the theatre of Dunore ; but upon the 
 reading of Lady Clancare’s letter, he suddenly disap- 
 peared. The carriage in which he had arrived had 
 x’eturned to the Dunore Arms, and, notwithstanding 
 the roughness of a singularly inclement night, he 
 wrapped ' himself up in a long travelling cloak, lent 
 him by one of the grooms of the chamber, and pro- 
 ceeded on foot to Castle Macarthy. 
 
 He found and ascended with difficulty the little 
 defile in the cliffs through which Lady Clancare’s 
 maid had formerly led him to the strand ; and when 
 he stood before the gates of Castle Macarthy, he felt

 that there also was the silence of dreary sequestra- 
 tion, and of desolate privacy. A faint stream of light 
 issued from the half-open portals of the hall. He en- 
 tered, without finding any human being to impede 
 his steps or to announce his arrival. 
 
 A flickering rush-light stood upon the old stone 
 table ; and its expiring ray flashed upon the skeleton 
 wolf’s head that hung suspended above it, and then 
 sunk and died into utter darkness. Fitzwalter stood 
 for a moment, his hand resting on the table, on which 
 the rain, dropping through the roof, fell with heavy 
 plashes. Unable to proceed, his feelings all tumult, 
 his spirits depressed, one image, gloomy, painful, and 
 affecting, still occupied his mind. The young, friend- 
 less mistress of this silent and dreary dwelling — she 
 who so late had appeared beyond the reach of suffer- 
 ing, so brilliant, so wooed and won by adulation and 
 attention, now neglected, abandoned, unpitied, was 
 left on a bed of sickness, by those to whom her spirit 
 and talents had recently afforded occupation, and sup- 
 plied amusement — no eye to watch her, no tongue to 
 soothe her, no hand to seek the feverish pressure of 
 hers. All her follies, all her faults (if the conduct 
 which had thwarted his passion could be so construed), 
 were forgotten ; and nothing was now remembered, 
 not even her talents, her charms, save the unpitied 
 situation to which her too intrepid benevolence had 
 reduced her. 
 
 Almost suffocating from excess of emotion, still 
 struggling with himself, in the midst of darkness and 
 of silence, he hesitated as to the manner in which he 
 should seek to announce himself, when the heavy 
 creaking of a door, slowly shut, footsteps approach-

 ing, and a faint flash of light, proceeding from the 
 narrow, dark, stone passage which led to the sitting- 
 room he had. once occupied, caught his attention. A 
 man advanced, holding a dark lantern; the light, 
 turned on himself, burnished his face and figure with 
 its yellow rays, and threw them into strong relief. 
 He was humming an old melancholy Irish croon, and 
 proceeded cautiously across the hall to the door, with- 
 out perceiving the general, whose dark figure and garb 
 were confounded with the profound shadows of the 
 place. The full and strongly lighted view of his per- 
 son instantly awakened a perfect recognition in the 
 general’s mind. It was the Rabragh. 
 
 “ Owny !” he exclaimed, advancing eagerly, and 
 seizing his arm. Owny dropped his lantern from one 
 hand, and a letter which he carried from the other ; 
 and clasping both, muttered a broken Ave Maria in 
 utter consternation and superstitious fear, the only 
 fear by which his hardy spirit was assailable. 
 
 “ Do you not remember ?” asked Fitzwalter, in an 
 impatient tone, and letting go his arm. “ You cannot 
 have forgotten the traveller whom you drove from 
 Oashel, bewildered in the Galties, and imprisoned in 
 Court Fitzadelm.” 
 
 The habitual gaiety of the Rabragh’s countenance, 
 and the natural ruddiness of his complexion, returned 
 together ; and picking up his lantern, and turning it 
 full on the apparition which had scared him into the 
 belief that he stood in the unearthly presence of the 
 famous Macarthy-More, he replied, with a smile : 
 
 “ Know your honor, is it, sir ? May be I don’t ; 
 and never will forget you, till the hour of my death, 
 if I was to live a thousand years and more ; and took

 you now for ould Fogh-na-gael , in regard of the sur- 
 prise, sir, and the place, and the ould shanaos, sir. And 
 sure wasn't I going to your honor this very minute, 
 with a letter for you from the Bhan Tierna, long life 
 to her ladyship ! and if I didn’t find you at O’Leary's, 
 was to follow you to the castle, and lurk about till 
 you came out, sir, and slip this into your hand, sir ; 
 and thinks it great luck, plaze God, to find you in it 
 here.” 
 
 During this speech the general had opened the let- 
 ter alluded to, and read as follows : 
 
 “You stand accused of murder. Depositions to 
 this effect have been laid against you, by one who, in 
 betraying the circumstance to his comrade, the noted 
 Padreen Gar, persists in its veracity. Officers of 
 justice are furnished with a warrant to take you. 
 Though your conscience be at rest, confide not in 
 your innocence, for you are powerfully beset. A 
 chaise, with a driver on whom you may depend, 
 will be ready to receive you at three in the morning, 
 and conduct you to a port, from whence you may 
 sail. Announce your arrival and future intentions to 
 La-dy Clancare, they will then securely and speedily 
 reach your wife. 
 
 “Florence Macarthy. 
 
 “ This for the present is all the answer I can return 
 to your letter, and its general proposal.” 
 
 Fitzwalter read this letter twice, with a confusion 
 of ideas and feelings that scarcely left him power to 
 comprehend its contents. The increasing paleness 
 of his cheek, the rolling of his eye, the tremulous mo- 
 tion of his under lip, fixed the shrewd but sympathiz- 
 ing gaze of the Rabragh, as he held up the lantern

 before him ; and, as the general stood silent and mo- 
 tionless, he observed significantly : 
 
 “ Hasn’t your honor better step into the dining- 
 parlor, sir, and see the countess herself? and ingages, 
 if she backs you, sir, sorrow taste there is to fear. 
 And didn’t she save my life, sir, intirely, when I fell 
 into trouble, and none to take my part against the 
 Crawleys, only God and her ladyship, sir. Shall I 
 show your honor the way?” and he stepped lightly 
 on before. Fitzwalter followed mechanically, and, 
 as the door stood half open, Owny pointed to it, and 
 retired. 
 
 The unexpected visitant paused at the threshold, 
 and the interior of the apartment was exposed to 
 his view. It was dimly lighted by a rude lamp which 
 stood on the table, before which Lady Clancare sat 
 writing. Her appearance almost justified the account 
 she had given of herself ; for her unusual paleness of 
 complexion was accompanied by the worn, anxious, 
 and exhausted look of one who suffered much. One 
 hand was spread and pressed upon the forehead 
 it supported ; the other was guiding her pen with 
 the rapidity of lightning : while at intervals she 
 raised her head, addressing the interrogatory of 
 “ well,” to a person who appeared dictating to her in 
 Irish. He presented a gaunt tall figure, and fearful 
 aspect ; but he stood with his head uncovered at a 
 respectful distance, and traces of a reverential feeling 
 softened the harsh lines of his wild and marked 
 countenance. It was Padreen Gar. In another part 
 of the room Lady Clancare’s youthful attendant, as- 
 sisted by an old woman, was engaged in packing up 
 a small travelling-trunk. Struck by a combination

 s 6 extraordinary, by the peculiar situation of Lady 
 Clancare, and by the presence of her singular asso- 
 ciates, Fitzwalter stood for a moment unnoticed, and 
 wrapped in profound observation ; when the eyes of 
 Lady Clancare suddenly and accidentally turning to 
 the spot where he stood, with his dark pale’ coun- 
 tenance just visible above the cloak which wrapped 
 his figure, she uttered a faint exclamation, smiled, at- 
 tempted to rise, and would have sunk to the earth, 
 but that the arms of Fitzwalter received her, with a 
 clasp that seemed almost indissoluble. 
 
 Her efforts to rally back her fading spirits and de- 
 clining strength were instantaneously successful. She 
 resumed her seat, affected to laugh away her weak- 
 ness, ascribed it to exhaustion and surprise ; and then 
 having abruptly observed that General Fitzwalter 
 could not yet have received the letter she had dis- 
 patched to him, she turned to her attendants, desired 
 her maid to wait in the adjoining room, and dismissed 
 Padreen Gar and the old woman till they should be 
 called for. All this was done rapidly but collectedly, 
 and was observed by Fitzwalter with silent amaze- 
 ment ; for the feverish hectic that burnt in a red spot 
 on one of her cheeks convinced him that the excuse 
 she had made for her non-appearance at the Castle of 
 fDunore was not without foundation. He took her* 
 hand with emotion ; and as he applied his fingers to 
 its throbbing pulse, she gayly observed, while she 
 struggled to release it, “ Oh, you are not to believe a 
 word it tells you. I have no leisure to be ill now ; 
 nor shall I have time to die, these twenty years; then, 
 indeed, having retired from the world, with the first 
 wrinkle, and moped through a few years of age and

 ugliness, I may some day or other be around here 
 dead of the sullens, like an old bird in its cage.” 
 
 “ But you are ill,” he replied, anxiously: “your 
 hand burns, your complexion varies. Where is there 
 a physician ? Have you not sent for assistance ?” 
 
 “ What ?” she said laughing, “ my equivoque of the 
 typhus fever succeeded with you, as well as the rest? 
 But in that case, if I am indeed imagined ill, where 
 are all my ‘ friends fast sworn,’ my admirers, my Or- 
 landos, my Solymans ! Ha ! not even Vamie d'hon- 
 neur ! my dear Lady Dunore ! Then have I touched t 
 the highest point of all my greatness, 
 
 ‘ And from the full meridian of my glory 
 I haste now to my setting 
 
 so sit down, General Fitzwalter, and tell me how it 
 comes, that 1 left and abandoned by my velvet friends,’ 
 you, who never ranged yourself among their number, 
 have deserted the festive hall of pleasure, to seek the 
 supposed infectious air of these ruined towers ?” 
 
 “ You suffer and are here,” he replied eagerly, and 
 taking a hand, which she now struggled not to with- 
 draw — 
 
 “ You did not then, of course, receive the letter 
 which I have just dispatched to you from your guar- 
 dian angel, from Florence Macarthy ?” 
 
 • Fitzwalter let fall her hand, and after a moment’s 
 pause, replied, “Yes: but that is not the question 
 now. Will you permit me to go to Dunore for such 
 medical advice as I can procure ? or, if you prefer 
 sending your mysterious agent, Owny, whom I left 
 in your hall, and who has been employed in the ser- 
 vice of a life much less valuable than your own 
 
 “ No, no,” she interrupted, “ I am not ill. I do not

 deceive yon. I am harassed, anxious, a little ex- 
 hausted, and burning more with indignation than 
 fever. With your life, the life of any human being 
 at stake ; with the happiness, the existence of Flor- 
 ence Macarthy in my hands — is her name, then, so 
 abhorrent to your ears that you turn thus in disgust 
 away ?” 
 
 “ You have not chosen your moment wisely ; but I 
 am ready to fulfil my engagement to that lady,'’ in- 
 terrupted Fitzwalter, vehemently, and starting from 
 his chair. “ I will marry her, protect her, and while 
 I live, live with her. What more does she require, 
 or do you demand, Lady Clancare ?” 
 
 He paused, and fixed his stern eyes on a counte- 
 nance marked by the profoundest agitation. 
 
 “ I require !— I have no right to require anything. 
 I speak in her behalf, not in my own. Oh ! you know 
 not,’’ she continued, with a supplicating earnestness, 
 “ the devotion with which she has pursued you — si- 
 lently, unobtrusively pursued you. You know not 
 what zeal she has displayed, what ingenuity she has 
 exerted, to keep you within her view : to behold you, 
 to listen to you, to study you, to obtain you.” 
 
 “ Well,” said Fitzwalter, throwing himself back in 
 his chair, u she has succeeded — I am hers. I acknow- 
 ledge her worth ; in time I trust I shall feel it,” — and 
 he sighed profoundly. 
 
 u Her worth ”’ replied Lady Clancare ; “ ’tis of her 
 love I speak, and of all the romantic energy which 
 has accompanied it. It was her determination, when 
 she heard of your captivity, to return to South Ame- 
 rica, to endeavor to effect your escape, or to share 
 your dungeon ; for the woman is unworthy the sacred

 name of wife who is not prepared to follow the hus- 
 band of her choice and her affections to slavery, to 
 death ; oh ! more than all, to follow, to cling to him 
 even in shame, in ignominy. Nay, hear me out, and 
 look not thus on me. The report of your escape had 
 reached her when she was on the point of embarking 
 from England, to share, or offer to share, your des- 
 tiny. Then she lost sight of you until you presented 
 yourself to her eyes in Ireland, breathing the same 
 air, inhabiting the same room, exchanging glances, 
 yet still instinctively shrinking from her. Ila ! you 
 start. It will not lessen your surprise to learn that 
 Florence Macarthy was the rejected, the formidable 
 Mrs. Magillicuddy, something disguised, indeed, and 
 changed. You laugh incredulously. But love would 
 have recognized its object, even under that conceal- 
 ment. Young, well-looking, and unprotected, she 
 has often sought safety during her inevitable wander- 
 ings in the assumption of age and ugliness. Her 
 flexibility of voice, and mobility of countenance and 
 gesture, her powers of imitation, and acquaintance 
 with the character she assumed, favored her dis- 
 guise. 
 
 “ But your intercourse stopped not here. It was 
 she who contrived tp play upon the vanity and cre- 
 dulity of Lord Adelm, whom she had once seen in 
 Spain, whom she had afterwards seen in England, 
 though unnoticed by one so self-occupied and self-in- 
 volved. It was she who summoned him from Portu- 
 gal — at once avenging a friend she had dearly loved, 
 whom he had sacrificed, and making him an instru- 
 ment in her own schemes. Hers was the irrepressi- 
 ble sigh, tlae malignant laugh in the ruins of Holy-

 cross. It was she who placed you in the Fitzadelm 
 chaise, under the guidance of her agent, the liabragh, 
 had you carried to Lis-na-sleugh, where her know- 
 ledge of the Spanish language put her in possession 
 of your views and intentions. Thus she anticipated 
 you at Court Fitzadelm, imprisoned you, to afford 
 herself time for escape ; and provided you a lodging 
 at O’Leary’s by an equivoque of which he was the 
 dupe. From that moment you became my charge. 
 The proximity of your residence favored the trust I 
 embraced. Acquainted with your departure for 
 Cork, your intended return to Dunore, and with the 
 arrest which waited you there, I was enabled to for- 
 ward the views of Florence Macarthy by witnessing 
 your first appearance in the Castle of Dunore, to ef- 
 fect which, as much as to surprise the favor of Lady 
 Dunore, I suffered myself to be taken prisoner by Mr. 
 Costello, and even paid him for his trouble. It was I 
 who kept your friend Lord Adelm in play, by drop- 
 ping the handkerchief, whose initials first discovered 
 to you the residence of Florence Macarthy in Ire- 
 land, and which again brought on a negotiation by 
 means scarcely calculated on. I see you are amazed, 
 confounded, stunned, because the omnipotence which 
 belongs to the affections of a devoted woman is un- 
 known to your sex ; still less can you judge of its dis- 
 interestedness, of its power to abnegate self, to con- 
 found its identity with the object beloved. It is you, 
 you alone, Florence Macarthy prizes. It is for your- 
 self you are estimated ; and now, ignorant of all con ■ 
 cerning you, save the part you recently played in 
 America, beholding you in this remote place, wrapped 
 in mystery, suspected, accused, your life in danger,

 whatever may be your innocence or fate, that fate 
 she is ready to share with you.” 
 
 “ I cannot, dare not hear you on,” interrupted Fitz- 
 walter, in a burst of passion amounting to agony. 
 “ Why should I deceive her, you, myself? ‘Tis not 
 on Florence Macarthy my thoughts are bent, admira- 
 ble and wonderful as you paint her. ’Tis on you my 
 existence at this moment depends; my soul, my 
 senses, my life are yours. ’Tis on your eloquence I 
 hang, on your countenance I gaze, on your eyes I 
 look. I confound you with her, and become un- 
 worthy of both. Were you this devoted creature 
 whose cause you plead — spoke you, looked you thus 
 for yourself, the struggle would be at once decided. 
 Florence Macarthy should not be deceived, nor I. In 
 a word, Lady Clancare, I love you to madness, to 
 folly, to dishonor; you, only you, against my bet- 
 ter reason, my happiness and sense of rights Now, 
 then, knowing my state of feeling, speak on if you 
 will; but remember I do not answer for myself. 
 Every word you utter, every sigh you breathe, every 
 glance you emanate in another’s cause, confirms my 
 crime, and devotes me to yourself. Were you the 
 creature you paint another, were you capable of this 
 
 devotion, this zeal, and for me ” 
 
 “ I am capable of it,” interrupted Lady Clancare, 
 breathlessly, and clasping her hands in passionate 
 emotion, while she half averted her face to conceal 
 its expression. “ Could I thus describe, if I had not 
 felt? In pleading the cause of Florence Macarthy, 
 see you not that I but delineated my own feelings, 
 my own strong, tender, and indestructible emotions. 
 You say you love me, and I dare not doubt it. You

 deny not your danger ; I am ready to share it ; this 
 is no moment for details; let it suffice to know that 
 she who thus throws herself on you is — ” she paused, 
 turned away her head, while Fitzwalter encircled her 
 half retreating form with his arms, and hung wildly 
 over, “ is — Florence Macarthy !” 
 
 His arms lost their power of supporting her, and 
 he sunk motionless upon the chair, from which she 
 had just arisen ; while lady Clancare after a moment’s 
 struggle, turning full round, fixed her eyes on him 
 with that expression of triumph with which she had 
 first received him where she now stood, and gently 
 putting her hand on his shoulder said, “ Now, infidel, 
 I have you on the hip.” 
 
 The story of Florence Macarthy, Countess of Clan- 
 care, the daughter of Colonel Macarthy-More, whose 
 life had been sacrificed in the South American cause 
 had already been gradually detailed, and little was 
 left to reveal. The story of her kinswoman, Florence 
 Macarthy Reagh, a Spanish nun, resident in the Con- 
 vent of Our Lady of the Annunciation, as partly re- 
 lated by O’Leary, had given rise to that qui pro quo 
 which had enabled Lady Clancare to follow up her 
 innocent schemes on the heart of him she considered 
 as her husband, while apparently acting as the agent 
 of another. Florence Macarthy Reagh was the young 
 boarder of Nuestra Senora de las Angustias, to whom 
 the eccentric Lord Fitzadelm had addressed his love 
 “ Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, 
 
 And never a true one,” 
 
 and who had since expiated her credulity by years of 
 religious sacrifice. Misled by the embroidered hand-

 kerchief, and by O’Leary’s description of its owner, 
 Lord Adelm had flown to her convent, and, in the 
 person of the mistress he had abandoned, sought the ! 
 invisible torment who had so long eluded him. He 
 arrived at the convent the day preceding that on 
 which his supposed sylph was* to take the veil ; and 
 the certainty of not obtaining her, increased his ideal > 
 and romantic passion to the desperate height of pro- 
 posing, unknown, unseen, to marry her. The answer 
 to this proposition revealed the name and story of 
 the person he addressed, and inclosed a drawing of 
 a cenotaph, on which was inscribed 
 
 “ Sic me Phoebus amat.” 
 
 For the rest, he was informed that his proposal should 
 be forwarded to Mrs. Mary Magillicuddy, the person 
 whose invisible but ardent attentions had induced 
 him to make it. 
 
 Florence Macarthy Reagh, though much of the 
 saint, was more of the woman; and in spite of her- 
 self, secretly rejoiced in the innocent vengeance pro- 
 cured her by the playful agency of her cousin, who, * 
 like the rest of her sex, made common cause, and 
 conceived an injury done to one woman a slight to all. 
 
 The town clock of Dunore had struck eleven as , 
 General Fitzwalter, dogged by Jemmy Bryan, reached 
 his tower of Monaster-ny-Oriel ; and O’Leary, who 
 had been watching his return, expressed his amaze- 
 ment at his doing so, on foot, in so dreary a night, - 
 and informed him, with a mysterious air, that things 
 were getting wind, and that Lord Adelm was just 
 arrived at Monaster-ny-Oriel a few moments before,

 O’Sullivan was also, as he said, to his utter amaze- 
 ment, returned to his lodgment in the tower, and 
 was now solus cum solo with the young lord.

 The following morning, an hour after sunrise, the 
 ruined chapel of Monaster-ny-Oriel exhibited a singu- 
 lar and unusual scene : for before the high altar, at 
 whose feet reposed the ashes of the great chief, 
 Macarthy-More, the young descendant and inheritor 
 of his title and name gave her hand to the represen- 
 tative of his hereditary enemies. The ceremony was 
 performed by the Reverend Denis O’Sullivan, titular 
 Dean of Dunore, assisted by the parish priest. The 
 Protestant rector, who was to repeat the rites, ac- 
 cording to the forms of the Protestant Church (the 
 parties being of different persuasions), also attended 
 at Lady Clancare’s particular request, to represent 
 her grandfather, to whom he had been a fast firm 
 friend, and to give her away. The only persons pre- 
 sent upon the occasion were O’Leary, who, between 
 every response, muttered some part of Friar Con’s 
 prophecy; and Lady Clancare’s maid, who was her 
 foster-sister. Lord Adelm, who had passed the night 
 in a conference with General Fitzwalter, to which 
 Mr. O’Sullivan was latterly admitted, had left 
 O’Leary’s before daylight, informed of the event

 which was about to take place, but declining being 
 present, from feelings originating in his actual state 
 of mind, the mortification he had recently undergone, 
 *and some well-grounded suspicions of the share Lady 
 Clancare had contributed to it. 
 
 The celebration of the wedding of the Bhan Tierna 
 in the chapel of Monaster-ny-Oriel, some vague re- 
 ports that the distinguished stranger on whom she 
 was bestowing her hand was the real and long-lost 
 Marquis of Dunore, had circulated with incredible 
 celerity, and the old Fitzadelm chaise, with four 
 horses in attendance at the gates of the cemetery, 
 the white cockade mounted in the Rabragh’s hat, 
 who rode proudly on the coach-box, a similar distinc- 
 tion in the caubeea of Padreen Gar, who had forcibly 
 dismounted the ragged postilion, and thrown his huge 
 limbs over the back of the leader, and a chaise and 
 pair in attendance for the countess’s maid and O’Leary, 
 all served to confirm the hints 
 
 “ Loud rumor spoke.” 
 
 By the time, therefore, that the bridal party issued 
 from amidst the gray ruins of the abbey, a multitude 
 of persons, with the whole population of Clotnotty- 
 joy, had assembled round the gates, and shouts of 
 joyous emotion, mingled with the cry of the Macar- 
 thies and Fitzadelms, rent the air. 
 
 Lady Clancare, as she ascended the carriage, ad- 
 dressed a few words to those nearest to her : she 
 said she was about to leave them for a short time, but 
 she trusted it was only to return, with the power, as 
 well as the will she had always felt, to be of use to 
 them ; she recommended sobriety, industry, and 
 peaceable conduct ; and amidst fresh shouts of appro-

 bation and joy was placed in the carriage by the Ca- 
 tholic Dean and Protestant Rector. 
 
 The cavalcade was now taking the road to Cork, 
 still followed by the multitude, when a party of mili- 
 tary, led on by several officers of the civil power, 
 commanded the drivers to stop; and General Fitz- 
 walter was arrested in the name and on behalf of his 
 majesty the king. The arrest was instantly observed 
 by the peasantry, who prepared to resist it with their 
 usual uncalculating warmth, while Padreen Gar, still 
 mounted on the foremost horse, rose his gaunt figure 
 from the stirrups, and cast round a significant look, 
 which operated like electricity. 
 
 In a moment the 1 scattered multitude, contracted 
 into a close phalanx, rushed with one impulsion 
 through the military party, and environed the chaise : 
 stones and turf-sods, suddenly torn up, flails and 
 scythes brandished in the air, and countenances fixed, 
 stern, resolute, and ferocious, declared the event of 
 an intended rescue. In a momentary pause, Fitz- 
 walter (sternly, as one accustomed to command), Mr. 
 O'Sullivan (mildly, as one accustomed to conciliate), 
 endeavored to address the mob, and induce them to 
 return quietly to their work or their homes ; both 
 were only answered by shrill wild shouts, which 
 convinced them of the inefficiency of their inter- 
 ference. 
 
 The military loaded their pieces, but behaved with 
 great moderation, till urged by the interference of 
 the civil officers, who ordered them to disperse the 
 mob, vi et armis , when a general engagement was 
 about to take place ; but the voice and interference 
 of Lady Clancare produced an effect, as unexpected

 as singular. She addressed them in Irish — it was 
 evidently neither in command nor supplication. 
 Whatever she said produced bursts of laughter and 
 applause; every eye, flashing humor and derision, 
 was turned on the constables and their satellites. 
 A new impulse seemed to be given to the susceptible 
 feelings of the auditory she addressed. Rage was 
 turned to contempt; anticipated triumph shone in 
 every eye. They drew back, suffered the military to 
 close round the carriage, dropped their missiles, and 
 followed in regular order the track of the carriages, 
 as they now proceeded to the Castle of Dun ore. 
 
 “ There are two and but two short roads,” said 
 Lady Clancare, smiling, “ to Irish feelings- — pathos or 
 humor ; you may weep or laugh them out of any- 
 thing.” 
 
 Notwithstanding the earliness of the hour, every 
 window, every loophole in the Castle of Dunore was 
 crowded, when the bridal carriage and its singular 
 cavalcade wound up its gloomy court ; and when the 
 party (evidently expected) alighted in the hall, and 
 were received and conducted by the grooms of the 
 chamber to the saloon, Lord Adelm stood at the 
 door. He appeared pale, and much worn in his ap- 
 pearance ; but he came anxiously forward, and ob- 
 served in a low voice to Fitz waiter, “ It is unneces- 
 sary to say I am unprepared for this. I knew nothing 
 of it. I have had a few minutes’ conference with my 
 mother. Reports of your story have reached her 
 through the Crawlcys, distorted, however, and vague ; 
 act now as you please, but spare the memory of my 
 father for my sake.” 
 
 Fitz waiter wrung his hand in expressive silence,

 and the whole party entered the saloon together. 
 Lady Clancare, supported by her husband’s arm, and 
 partly veiled by the Spanish mantilla, which fell from 
 her head over her whole frame, excited evident 
 amazement by her presence. 
 
 The titular Dean of Dunore followed, accompanied 
 by the Rector; and the wildly expressive counte- 
 nance of the agitated O’Leary, agitated almost to the 
 return of his former malady, and the black rough 
 head and grim visage of Padreen Gar, were seen 
 among the many curious faces which filled up the 
 door. 
 
 The saloon was already occupied by all the guests 
 of the castle, with the exception of Lord Rosbrin, 
 and some of the corps dramatique , who were either 
 wearied beyond the power of being roused at so un- 
 reasonable an hour, or had no inclination to appear 
 on a scene, in which they were not to act the princi- 
 pal part themselves. The summonses, however, of 
 Lady Dunore had been given to all, and were for the 
 most part punctually obeyed ; for Lady Dunore had 
 personally solicited the attendance of the ladies ; and 
 had dispatched Mr. Pottinger to the gentlemen, to 
 request they would be present on an occasion which 
 involved some of the dearest interests of her being. 
 
 Lady Georgiana, in a wrapper of India muslin, and 
 a drapery of Brussels lace shading her face, yawning 
 and peevish at being disturbed, when the dearest in- 
 terests of her dearest friend were concerned, reclined 
 on a sofa, on which Lord Frederick, in a robe de 
 chambre , and embroidered Turkey slippers, had taken 
 his wonted place beside her. 
 
 Mr. Heneage and Miss Crawley had descended in

 such a hurry that the one appeared without his stays, 
 and the other without her frizette, Mr. Pottinger 
 was habited in a yellow silk banyan, presented him 
 by an ex-lady lieutenant. Old Crawley, ghastly and 
 agitated, stood in a remote window, taking snuff, and 
 pulling down his wig. His son had left the castle be- 
 fore daylight, under the excuse of attending the elec- 
 tion ; and Lady Dunore, pale and flushing alternately, 
 moved about in restless agitation, till, on the entrance 
 of her son, she seized his arm, and, with a counte- 
 nance charged with irony, and with malicious, yet 
 doubtful triumph, stood observing the entrance of 
 General Fitzwalter, Lady Clancare, and their two 
 clerical friends. A pause ensued, which Lady Du- 
 nore at last interrupted, and, dropping her son’s arm, 
 she came forward, and addressing Lady Clancare with 
 a sort of half-ironical, half-hysterical laugh, she said : 
 “ If there be any truth in the report which has just 
 reached us that your ladyship has this morning be- 
 stowed your fair hand on ■, the gentleman whom 
 
 you now accompany, may I hope I am among the 
 first to congratulate you on the event, and to wish 
 you all the joy it is likely eventually to produce ?” 
 
 Lady Clancare, who stood the image of her own 
 first appearance in the hall of Dunore, the same shy, 
 sly expression of countenance, and bashful embarrass- 
 ment of air, replied to this ironical congratulation by 
 a low respectful courtesy, as one who took this 
 mock civility tout de bon , and was grateful for it. 
 
 Provoked at this unlooked-for interpretation Lady 
 Dunore, wholly overcome by her ungovernable tem- 
 per, went on with increasing acrimony : “ Had I, 
 madam, known the extent and cast of your ladyship’s

 theatrical abilities, I should have undoubtedly induced 
 you to undertake the part of Estifania, and we should 
 have had no difficulty, it now appears, in providing a 
 copper captain.” She laughed convulsively; and 
 then, yielding gradually to the violent impetuosity of 
 her temper, provoked by the modest, self-satisfied 
 air of Lady Clancare, she added, in a loud, shrill 
 voice, “ Mr. Crawley, why don’t you come forward V” 
 
 Crawley, with an air of timid perplexity, obeyed. 
 
 “ I turn over those two adventurers, those con- 
 spirators, to you, and to the laws they have violated ; 
 and I now thus publicly acknowledge my imprudence 
 in receiving them under my roof, and beg forgiveness 
 of the friends into whose society I obtruded them. 
 Lady Georgiana, Miss Crawley, we will, if you please, 
 now retire. Mr. Crawley, the officers of justice may 
 do their duty. Fitzadelm, give me your arm.” 
 
 “No, madam,” said Lord Fitzadelm, firmly, and 
 leading her back forcibly to her seat, “ you must not 
 go. Neither shall I, until the defamation you have 
 indulged in is either substantiated or disproved ; until 
 my friend, General Fitzwalter, is afforded (and in the 
 presence of these, before whom he has been so grossly 
 insulted) an opportunity of clearing himself of the as- 
 persions with which you have blasted his gallant 
 charac er.” 
 
 “ Your friend ! your friend !” repeated Lady Du- 
 nore, bursting into a fit of hysterical tears. “Are 
 your friends, then, to be always my enemies ? Am 
 I always to find an adversary in my son ; or is it only 
 to thwart, oppose, and distract me, that you now in- 
 volve yourself in the guilt of an impostor and a mur- 
 derer, by publicly acknowledging him as your friend

 A general murmur of amazement and consternation 
 arose. Lord Fitzadelm, with the air of one whose 
 feelings seemed to find their own level in the extra- 
 ordinary and unprecedented part he was now called 
 on to play, turned to General Fitzwalter, and said : 
 “ Now, then, is your moment — I hold myself answer- 
 able for the truth of all you shall assert.” 
 
 Fitzwalter gently released himself from Lady Clan- 
 care’s arm, while Lord Frederick, in good-natured 
 consideration of the anxiety and emotion painted in 
 her countenance, led her to a chair, and took his place 
 beside her. A silence of a moment ensued, and 
 Fitzwalter, advancing with his wonted disengaged 
 and elevated air towards Lady Dunore, placed him- 
 self before her, and, leaning his hand on the back of 
 a chair, addressed her with his usual rapid energy of 
 utterance : 
 
 “ Making a journey on horseback, madam, a short 
 time back, on business of emergency, I was over- 
 taken in the Kil worth mountains by a storm, which 
 induced me to take shelter in a miserable hut. I 
 found it occupied by men, whose countenances and 
 appearance were of that wild resolute cast which in 
 such scenes induces suspicion. The poverty of the 
 mistress of this hut, and of her naked children, led 
 me to an act of perhaps imprudent liberality at such 
 a moment. I meant to have given her a guinea. I 
 gave her by mistake a golden coin. Proceeding on 
 my journey I fell in with a small military party; they 
 st opt and questioned me. While thus engaged the 
 men I had left, accompanied by a hundred others, 
 well mounted and rudely armed, overtook the sol- 
 diers, who were employed in the service of the re-

 venue, or, in the language of the country, still- 
 hunting. The conflict was desperate. I endeavored 
 to interfere, failed, and rode on. 
 
 “The papers have since announced the death of 
 one of the military party, the murderer remained for 
 a time unknown, and, after the expiration of some 
 weeks, it appears that I stand accused of this mur- 
 der, of joining the party who opposed the military 
 for the purposes of canvassing popularity, and ob- 
 taining false witnesses to prove, or credulous persons 
 to believe, that I am the son of the elder Baron of 
 Fitzadelm, whose death was supposed to have oc- 
 curred three-and-twenty years back. This, I believe, 
 Mr. Crawley, is the spirit of your indictment.” 
 
 “ ’Pon my credit, sir, I can’t take upon me to say 
 just in a moment, but believes it is,” returned old 
 Crawley. 
 
 “ And now,” continued Fitzwalter, “ having been 
 brought forward for the purpose of being exposed to 
 shame, obloquy and ridicule— a refinement upon the 
 severity of the law, a propitiatory sacrifice to the 
 distinguished persons on whose indignant nobility a 
 murderer and a conspirator has been unwillingly ob- 
 truded — may I beg to know from you, Mr. Crawley 
 (who seem the acting and active agent in this prose- 
 cution), where am I now to proceed ?” 
 
 Old Crawley, gradually edging himself out of Ge- 
 neral Fitzwalter’s way, as he approached him, sidled 
 towards one of the officers of justice, who stood at 
 the door, and, twitching him by the sleeve, whisper- 
 ed him a few words in his ear ; the man respectfully 
 approached his prisoner and bowed. 
 
 “ I suppose,” said Fitzwalter, “ Lady Clancare, as

 whose husband I have the honor to announce my- 
 self. may be allowed to accompany me. Is it not so, 
 Mr. Crawley?” 
 
 “ Give you my honor, sir, I don’t know ; if it*s in 
 the warrant, and Mr. Lynch has no objection,” re- 
 plied Crawley, gradually taking shelter behind Lady 
 Dunore’s chair, and directing many significant looks 
 to the constable, while Miss Crawley whispered 
 Lady Dunore, 
 
 “ Sure such a pair were never seen.” 
 
 A pause of a moment ensued; every countenance 
 was marked either by curiosity, amazement, or anx- 
 iety, when Mr. O’Sullivan advanced into the room, 
 and was presented to the marchioness by the rector 
 as the Catholic Dean of Dunore, and Superior of the 
 Friary of St. John’s, — as a gentleman to whom, in 
 the course of his professional duties, a wicked and 
 black conspiracy had discovered itself, which he was 
 desirous of revealing, before the gentleman (who 
 stood there accused of rdurder) should be dismissed 
 from her ladyship’s presence. 
 
 Lady Dunore’s countenance brightened into 
 triumph. She cast a look of reproach and indig- 
 nation at her son; old Crawley, on the contrary, 
 turned deadly pale, and sunk on a seat beside his 
 sister, whose whispers and sneers were all directed 
 at Lady Clancare, though addressed tp Lady 
 Dunore. 
 
 “ Pray sit down, Mr. Dean,” exclaimed Lady Du- 
 nore, u I- am happy to make your acquaintance. 
 Georgy, love, move a little, and make room for the 
 dean. Pray speak, I am all attention.” 
 
 Mr. O'Sullivan, declining the honor of the seat in-

 tended him, briefly entered on the business which had 
 brought him to the country, at some personal incon- 
 venience ; and read from a paper, which w as after- 
 wards handed about, the dying declaration of a man 
 of the name of Teague Connor. This person, two 
 days before, had been wounded in a riot, and had 
 sought to obtain remission of his crimes, under the 
 influence of a deathbed remorse, by confessing his 
 recent conspiracy against the life of an innocent man, 
 a stranger, of whom he knew nothing, but that he 
 had seen him give money to a poor woman in a ca- 
 bin. To the crime he had confessed, he had been in- 
 stigated by the arts of the notorious Jemmy Bryan, 
 who purchased his acquiescence by the sum of fifty 
 pounds, and the protection of a great gentleman in 
 the country. 
 
 “The name of this gentleman,” continued Mr. 
 O’Sullivan, “ is in my possession ; and this declaration 
 is signed by three magistrates, who were present 
 when it was made, and who were persons of the 
 highest respectability and consideration. The un- 
 fortunate man who made it still lives ; and the woman 
 who received the golden coin from General Fitzwal- 
 ter has deposed that she sold it, a few days back, for 
 forty shillings, to the said Mr. Jemmy Bryan, who 
 has escaped the vigilance of the most active research ; 
 and except Mr. Crawley can give us some assistance 
 in the pursuit, may finally elude the grasp of jus- 
 tice.” 
 
 The triumph which had flashed from Lady Du- 
 nore’s eyes now gave way to a look of deep mortifi- 
 cation and disappointment ; while the appeal of Mr. 
 O’Sullivan turned every eye on old Crawley, who.

 during the singular denouement, had nearly crept to 
 the door: there he was stopped by Lord Frederick, 
 who, springing after him, and catching hirn by the 
 arm, led him back into the room. 
 
 “Stay, my Ching-foo,” he cried: “it is now very 
 evident we cannot get on without you, my mirror of 
 magistrates. We cannot yet dispense with your pre- 
 sence,” 
 
 “ Give you my honor, was only just stepping out 
 for a little thieves’ vinegar, in respect of the hate,” 
 replied old Crawley, as he took his seat, muttering, 
 as he passed his sister, in a tone of agony — “ and Con 
 to desert me in this dilemia , and think only of him- 
 self and his election !” 
 
 “ I have only to add,” continued Mr. O’Sullivan, 
 “ that it is my firm belief that this conspiracy against 
 the character and life of a brave and high-spirited 
 gentleman has been contrived for the sole purpose 
 of preventing his making claims to a title and pro- 
 perty, of which he has been long deprived by the 
 most iniquitous proceedings ; and I am also ready to 
 declare upon oath, in a court of justice, that I believe 
 the person who now has the title and name of Gene- 
 ral Fitzwalter to be Walter de Montenay Fitzadelm, 
 son and heir to the late Baron Walter Fitzwalter, and 
 that he is the true Marquis of Dunore.” 
 
 “ And I declare,” exclaimed old Crawley, worked 
 up by the exigency of the moment, while universal 
 emotion and amazement were pictured in every coun- 
 tenance, “ I declare that the gentleman, if it’s gentle- 
 man you call him, Mr. O’Sullivan, is Micky Laffan, a 
 bit of a by-blow of my Lord Fitzadelm, by one Judy 
 Laffan ; and if I don’t prove it, and many respectable

 witnesses along with me, I’ll just give my head for & 
 Cronobane halfpenny.” 
 
 “ How can that be ?” exclaimed a voice from the 
 door, “ and I, Micky Laffan, here to the fore.” 
 
 The gaunt figure of Padreen Gar strided forward, 
 and he continued : 
 
 “ And you thought, Mr. Crawley, I’d never come 
 back from transportation ; but I tould you I would, 
 sir, when you laste expected me ; and am here, you 
 see, to make good my word.” As he spoke he wiped 
 off the yellow stain that covered his face; and re- 
 moving the black hairs which concealed a handsome 
 auburn head, he asked, with his wonted air of reso- 
 lute intrepidity, “ do you know me now, Mr. Craw- 
 ley, sir ? Isn’t that the coolin’ of the family all the 
 world over ?” and he run his coarse fingers through 
 locks curled and burnished as Lord Adelm’s own : 
 “ and hopes I have too much of a gentleman in me, 
 Mr. Crawley, and too much of the blood of my father 
 in my veins, to do the unhandsome thing, or save 
 myself from trouble, by bringing ruination on the 
 head of an innocent man and a fine gentleman ; and 
 you may sind me back to Botany Bay now, if you 
 plaze, Mr. Crawley, for another ruction at Ballydab, 
 as yez did before ; but defies the world to say I ever 
 injured man or baste, barring a tithe proctor, or a bit 
 of an exciseman, or cropping a taste off Jemmy Bry- 
 an’s odd ear, just for fun, and carries my mark with 
 him to this day ; and if you don’t believe what I say, 
 there’s the certificate of my birth, and there’s the 
 gentleman, God bless him, that signed it, and was 
 minister at Fitzadelm church the day I was born.” 
 
 Padreen Gar presented a piece of dirty paper to

 tlie rector, who acknowledged the signature, and re- 
 collected the baptism of an illegitimate son of Lord 
 Walter Fitzadelm, at the period of the date, whom, 
 like many others of the offspring of that Lord’s illicit 
 loves, he had abandoned to the want and misery 
 which eventually led to a life of lawlessness and des- 
 peration. 
 
 Old Crawley sunk back in his chair, and either was 
 unable or unwilling to make any further effort. Lady 
 Dunore was motionless and silent from fear, doubt, 
 and consternation; her eyes, almost starting from 
 their inflamed sockets, wandered alternately from the 
 face of her son to Fitzwalter and Padreen Gar ; and, 
 differing as they all did in personal appearance, she 
 beheld, or fancied she could trace a resemblance, such 
 as is often seen in members of the same family, how- 
 ever vague or indefinite. 
 
 Fitzwalter turned his eyes on Lord Adelm, as if, 
 before he himself occupied attention, he wished to 
 give him an opportunity of playing a part, distin- 
 guished in proportion to its singularity and disinter- 
 estedness. Lord Adelm, though languid, and occa- 
 sionally abstracted, as one self-involved and distress- 
 ingly preoccupied, understood the appeal made to all 
 his better feelings, and came forward to reply to it. 
 
 “ It may,” he said, addressing his mother, “ it may 
 tend to put a speedy termination to a scene, naturally 
 calculated to distress and agitate you, madam, if 
 without further discussions, at a moment when they 
 are scarcely available, I, who have been so long sup- 
 posed the presumptive heir of the Dunore estates and 
 titles, come forward to assert my solemn belief in the 
 actual existence of my uncle’s only son, De Montenay

 Fitzadelm : further, it is my belief, that the cele- 
 brated and distinguished man, who now stands before 
 me, is that person ; and I am proud to confess that I 
 have been possessed of the secret of his existence, 
 and of the efforts he has been making to establish his 
 just claims, since he first arrived in this country — 
 claims which it would be as impolitic, as vain, to re- 
 sist. The perilous confidence his noble and generous 
 nature thus placed in me has been the purchase of my 
 everlasting esteem and gratitude. I will not say I 
 am happy, that is not in human nature ; but I am 
 proud to welcome the long injured Marquis of Du- 
 17 ore to the possessions of his ancestors.” 
 
 He held out his hand to Fitzwalter, and the em- 
 brace of the distinguished cousins w r as a signal of the 
 prompt feelings of O’Leary and Padreen Gar. Their 
 cry of long live Walter de Montenay Fitzadelm, Mar- 
 quis of Dunore, and Gal-Keadh-Aboe, was echoed by 
 persons who had forced their way into the hall, and 
 re-echoed by the multitude who occupied the court 
 without. 
 
 Lady Dunore, now agitated “ up to her bent,” 
 wrung her hands in convulsive emotion, exclaiming, 
 that Lord Adelm sought only to oppose and distract 
 her, calling on Mr. Crawley to come forward, and en- 
 treating her friends to stand by her to secure the 
 conspirators, and to discredit a tale, in which there 
 was not, there could not be, a shadow of truth. 
 
 Every eye was turned on the hero of the scene, 
 who waited evidently for the first burst of Lady Du- 
 nore’s passion to exhaust itself before he addressed 
 her. He then said — “ That a story so extraordinary, 
 so strongly opposed to your ladyship’s maternal in-

 terests and ambition, should startle your belief, is na- 
 tural and excusable ; of its truth, however, there is 
 one witness in this room, whose testimony you can- 
 not doubt ; I mean Mr. Crawley.” 
 
 Old Crawley, faint, ghastly, the victim of his con- 
 stitutional timidity, and of facts which were bearing 
 all before them, shrunk backhand seemed almost to 
 diminish to the eye, as every feature, every limb, 
 yielded to gradual contraction. General Fitzwalter, 
 however, advanced, drew him forward, and led him 
 a few minutes on one side. Whatever had been the 
 subject of their conference, when old Crawley turned 
 round (though still agitated and trembling), the color 
 had returned to his livid cheek ; and when he w T as led 
 forward to his patroness, who was weeping on his 
 sister’s shoulder (Lady Georgiana being too much 
 amused to lend her friend any assistance), he en- 
 deavored to address her. 
 
 “ Lady Emily Fitzadelm,” he began ; but the w T ild 
 start of the person he thus addressed, the flash of in- 
 dignation which sparkled in her haughty eyes, again 
 annihilated his returning courage; and uttering an 
 inarticulate — “ The Lord save us !’’ he hastily re- 
 treated. 
 
 “Mr. Crawley, madam,” said the Marquis of Du- 
 nore, “ would have sought your ladyship's forgive- 
 ness, for having so long concealed an event in which 
 you are so deeply interested. He would plead in ex- 
 cuse that zeal for you and your children, which 
 originated his acquiescence in a crime which it is 
 now h:s intention to expiate by a full and complete 
 discovery. His testimony, however, may be dis- 
 pensed with; the evidences in my favor are suffi-

 ciently numerous and strong to leave me independent 
 of his assistance. His liberty, perhaps his life, was 
 in my power — they are so no more. I have pledged 
 my honor for their safety, on certain conditions. His 
 reputation, his ill-acquired property, I cannot save. 
 I have now little to add. It will depend upon the 
 prudence and discretion of your ladyship’s counsel- 
 lors, whether in acting as the representative of your 
 suffering son, Robert Fitzadelm, commonly called 
 Marquis of Dunore, you shall bring our mutual 
 claims before a court, when it is for the honor of 
 our family that they should be referred to private de- 
 cision. 
 
 “ For what purpose, and at whose instigation, I 
 was in my boyhood torn from my country and my 
 birthright, and was sold to slavery, Mr. Crawley can 
 best tell you ; for the rest, my story may be briefly 
 related. 
 
 u The generous person into whose hands I .fell, 
 rescued me from the horrors of a condition which 
 still exists among the professors of Christianity, to 
 the shame of humanity. The precocity of intellect, 
 which had been nourished by the lessons of my good 
 and learned fosterer and preceptor, O’Leary, told 
 powerfully in my favor with him whose property I 
 became. I was soon made the companion and in- 
 structor of his only son, saved the boy’s life in a sur- 
 prise attempted by some native Indians, who sur- 
 rounded us in a distant sporting journey ; received 
 my manumission as a recompense ; grew uncon- 
 sciously on the father’s affections ; became the child 
 of his adoption, on the premature death of his only 
 son, and succeeded to his property on his demise.

 “ The cause of liberty was my natural vocation ; 
 and I hastened to the South American continent, to 
 join the standard, then slowly beginning to unfurl in 
 the land of oppression. My own story lay rankling 
 in secret at the bottom of my heart; and I had 
 almost learnt to abhor its name and title, which had 
 been the cause of my being reduced below the state 
 of man. When I arrived in England, however, with 
 Don hfarino 5 in my inquiries after my own family, I 
 found there'only existed an empty title, without pro- 
 perty, rank, or consideration; and a representative 
 whom my reappearance would blast with eternal in- 
 famy. There was nothing to be gained by a dis- 
 covery, but the destruction of those nearest to me by 
 blood. I returned to South America without re- 
 claiming a name I almost blushed to own, that I 
 might make one I should glory in wearing. 
 
 “ In justice to myself, I must observe, that the pro- 
 tector of my infancy, the instructor of my youth, 
 was never forgotten — my dear foster-father O'Leary.” 
 He paused, and a smile of mingled emotion and 
 beneficence threw its radiance over his splendid coun- 
 tenance. O’Leary hustled forward, and pressing the 
 tears from his swdmming eyelids, he stood with a 
 look of proud triumph beside him, swinging his hat, 
 and humming away his emotion. 
 
 “ Of the persons of respectability in my father’s 
 service, I could only remember the son of our land 
 steward, Darby Crawley, an attorney in the neigh- 
 borhood of Court Fitzadelm. To this person I wrote, 
 requesting him to forward an enclosed letter to Ter- 
 ence O’Leary, whose wife had been in the service 
 of the Baroness Fitzadelm, containing five hundred

 pounds ; but in case of his death to return it to my 
 banker in London. In my letter to O’Leary, I en- 
 trusted the secret of my existence, and my intention 
 of coming forward to claim my right and title, on 
 the death of my uncle.” 
 
 “ The murthering pirate !” interrupted O’Leary, 
 shaking his head at old Crawley, who sat behind 
 the chair of his trembling and now agitated sister. 
 “ And never gave a scrubal of it, as I tould your lord- 
 ship before, but had me flogged in the rebellion for a 
 Latin note he found in my pocket — the ignoramus !” 
 
 “ The event of my captivity in the Caraccas,” con- 
 tinued Lord Punore, “ is already before the public. 
 One incident arose from this event, which it is curious 
 to mention, as bearing forcibly on the circumstances 
 of the moment. The keeper of my dungeon w-as a 
 Spaniard, who spoke a little English. He had occa- 
 sionally addressed me in that language, and eyed me 
 with curiosity which indicated an interest beyond 
 that of our present relation — it was the interest of re- 
 cognition; and inquiries, mutually made and answer- 
 ed, discovered in the person of the keeper of my 
 dungeon a sailor, one of the crew" who had assisted in 
 kidnapping me in my boyhood from the Irish coast. 
 
 “ This man had suffered much in the interval which 
 had elapsed ; he had been taken by Barbary pirates — 
 sold to slavery, and, in the vicissitudes of his life, had 
 entered into the service of Spain, been wounded, dis- 
 abled, and made one of the keepers of a royal prison 
 in Spanish America. He had considered his suffer- 
 ings as retributions for the crimes he had assisted in 
 committing on the Irish shores ; and, in the hope that 
 lie was now about to be reconciled with heaven, he

 effected my escape from prison, accompanied me in 
 my flight, and is at present my mate, and on board 
 my own vessel, which lies., in harbor near Cork. In 
 confirmation of these facts, he can produce a letter, 
 dropped on the deck by one of the disguised persons 
 who had brought me out to the vessel, which he had 
 preserved in the hope of one day expiating his crime 
 by being of use to me. The signature of this letter I 
 have shown to Lord Fitzadelm. Its address is to Mr. 
 Crawley, from Court Fitzadelm, twenty-three years 
 back ; and the postmark is a town in the neighbor- 
 hood. Witnesses, no less efficient than this let- 
 ter, are — a groom of my father's who carried me in 
 the chaise, which now awaits at the door of this cas- 
 tle, and who has been reduced to beggary, under the 
 Irish epithet of the Baccah ; Terence Oge O’Leary, 
 my foster-father; the Rev. Denis O'Sullivan, my mo- 
 ther’s kinsman and confessor, to whom she bequeathed 
 the certificate of my birth, and that of her own mar- 
 riage (urged to this cautionary proceeding by the in- 
 trigues of which she died the broken-hearted victim). 
 The miniatures of both my parents in their youth are 
 in his possession, to both of which I bear a strong re- 
 semblance ; — and the Reverend Rector of Dunore re- 
 members me in my childhood, when he was himself 
 a young man, just entered into orders, and made 
 curate of the parish of Court Fitzadelm. I have no- 
 thing more to add, but that my story, strange and 
 improbable as it may appear, belongs to the history 
 of a long disorganized country, where, under the in- 
 fluence of political misrule, the moral relations of so- 
 ciety too often sit loosely, and where the demoraliza- 
 tion of the people is a necessary consequence of the

 code of those who rule by national debasement and 
 disunion.-’ 
 
 After a brief silence, preserved by the amazement 
 of some, and the still eager curiosity of others, he 
 added, in a voice full of conciliation and respect, and 
 more especially addressing himself to the weeping 
 and exhausted Lady Dunore, “ This is not a moment 
 to press upon your ladyship’s credence the facts of a 
 story it can neither be your interest nor inclination 
 to admit. But I would at least induce you to believe 
 that the mother of Lord Adelm Fitzadelm must al- 
 ways be to me an object of respect, of interest, and 
 consideration ; and that, whether you persist in refus- 
 ing, or yield to the claims I have now briefly stated, 
 you will, at least, I trust, remain mistress of this cas- 
 tle, so long as it may be your convenience or pleasure 
 to continue in Ireland, 
 
 “And now, Mr. Crawley,” he added with his 
 radiant smile, “ if you insist on the execution of your 
 warrant, I must obey, and accompany your officers 
 of justice to Dublin. I confess, however, I had 
 planned a journey of a very different description.” 
 He colored deeply, and threw" his eyes on Lady Clan- 
 care, who, downcast and blushing, was deserted in 
 this moment of prosperous triumph by that gaiety 
 and elasticity .of spirit, which in less fortunate hours 
 had borne her above the adverse circumstances of her 
 forlorn destiny. The bashfulness of a bride, fresh 
 from the altar, and the powerful emotions incidental 
 to her peculiar position, as she now stood, the mis- 
 tress of the superb mansion, where she had first ap- 
 peared a prisoner, where she had lately stood ac- 
 cused of conspiracy and imposture, left her confused,

 silent, and shrinking from the glances which the 
 slight allusion of the Marquis of Dunore to their re- 
 spective situations had drawn to her person. A few 
 words having passed between the agitated Crawley 
 and Lord Fitzadelm, the latter, addressing his cousin, 
 observed aloud, that Mr. Crawley had referred every- 
 thing to him for the present. 
 
 “ Then, in that case,” observed Lord Dunore, step- 
 ping back, and drawing the arm of the new and 
 bridal marchioness through his, “ we shall pursue our 
 route, according to our original intention.” 
 
 Lady Clancare, now letting go his arm, advanced 
 timidly to Lady Dunore, and took her hand with that 
 fondling and playful manner which had once such 
 charms for her capricious friend. 
 
 “ No,” said Lady Dunore, snatching it hastily from 
 her, and in a tone of angry indignation; whatever 
 may happen, I shall always consider your conduct as 
 false and deceptive.” 
 
 “ How !” said Lady Clancare, all her wonted spirit 
 rallying to her eyes and countenance. “ False! Was 
 it false to confide to you the sole important secret of 
 my life? Was it deceptive to confess to you the 
 motives which led me to your castle, to seek and to 
 accept your hospitality ? If I have deceived you, 
 madam, it was by the frank relation of facts, calcu- 
 lated indeed by their improbability to win on your 
 attention, but yet confided to you at some risk ; be- 
 cause, though I may have availed myself of some 
 mysterious truths, I disdained falsehood even for the 
 purpose of effecting my dearest interests — and now,” 
 she added, with a sudden burst of gaiety flashing 
 over her whole countenance, and animating every

 gesture, “ I would fain, like one of my own heroines, 
 wind up the denouement of my story with some 
 touch of humor or pathos — some appeal to the feel- 
 ings I address, which should enable me to retire with 
 applause ; but hitherto adversity has been my muse, 
 and now,” placing her hand in Lord Dunore’s, “ she 
 deserts me. 
 
 “What remains, therefore, to be said of myself, 
 must be deferred to calmer moments, when (as en- 
 nuyee, as other great personages with the ‘ toujours 
 Perdrix 1 ) I shall seek to diversify the calm of my dull 
 prosperity by a recurrence to the vicissitudes of my 
 early life ; then seated by my Irish turf fire, with my 
 own amusement for my object, and my husband for 
 my critical reviewer, I shall take the liberty of put- 
 ting myself in my own book, and shall record the 
 events of this last month of my life under the title of —

 CONCLUSION. 
 
 The eccentric and visionary, but high-minded Lord 
 Adelm Fitzadelm, had just remained in Ireland long 
 enough to learn that his law agent, Conway Crawley, 
 had been elected member in his stead for Glanna- 
 crime ; and the papers soon after announced his de- 
 parture for the North Pole. 
 
 Meantime, his mother, backed by powerful friends, 
 and urged by interested counsellors, refused, on her 
 return to England, to acknowledge the claims made 
 by the gallant guerilla chief to the title and property 
 in possession of her insane son. A suit was com- 
 menced, which ended in her defeat, and only served 
 to expose the infamy of her late husband to “ the 
 garish eye of day.” The trial, however, had occu- 
 pied, amused, and agitated her ; and the overthrow of 
 her hopes furnished her new sources of real affliction 
 and complaint, in place of the ideal sorrows she had 
 loved to create and to deplore. 
 
 As Miss Crawley had prudently separated herself 
 from her brother Darby, with the desertion of his 
 success and fortunes, and had accompanied Lady Du-

 nore to England, she availed herself of the depres- 
 sion ot mind to which that lady, for a time, resigned 
 her variable feelings ; and, to her infinite triumph, she 
 had the happiness of seeing rouge Almacks, and 
 “ Georgy, love,” sacrificed to round-eared caps, reli- 
 gious conversaziones, and the society of the elect and 
 hungry in the Lord, who eat their way to their 
 patronesses’ conversion with true gastronomic, as 
 well as polemic zeal ; while Miss Crawley, the direct- 
 ress of her conscience and her house, gradually as- 
 sumed a power over both, to which the unregulated 
 imagination of Lady Dunore, easily worked on by 
 terror and mysticism, made no resistance. 
 
 The leases and mortgages, rendered unavailable by 
 the unexpected reappearance of the real Marquis of 
 Dunore, with the loss of his agency, nearly reduced 
 old Crawley to a state of ruin, which an investigation 
 of the commissioners of inquiry into his official emo- 
 luments finally completed. His military son had 
 been ordered abroad. His eldest son, under an accu- 
 mulation of gambling debts, occupied an apartment 
 in a prison over which he had once presided ; and old 
 Crawley, in his extreme distress, was reduced to ap- 
 plying for relief to his favorite son, Conway, who 
 had, however, on the first turn of his father’s fortunes, 
 shaken him off, on the plea of his immoral conduct 
 and lost character. 
 
 Conway Townsend Crawley, Esq., member for 
 Glannacrime, had found an early opportunity of at- 
 tracting the eyes of persons in power, by serving in 
 a cause in which they were interested, and had pur- 
 chased a situation of trust and emolument at the ex- 
 pense of every manly and every gentlemanlike feel-

 mg. Pushing his way into high society by the same 
 intrepid effrontery with which he had pushed his way 
 through life to fortune, he happened one day to be 
 seated at the head of his sumptuous table, entertain- 
 ing a select party of official grandees, when Mr. 
 Darby Crawley from Ireland was announced; and 
 when, to his horror and consternation, his vulgar, 
 blundering, but unfortunate father, entered the room, 
 and, throwing his arms around him, exclaimed : 
 
 “ Con, honey, sure you won’t turn your back on 
 your poor ould father, like, like the rest of the world ? 
 - — he that made a counsellor and a member of parlia- 
 ment of you, and that warned you against poethry, 
 and pathritism, and gianius; and owes to him what 
 you are at this minute, if you were twenty times as 
 great.” 
 
 The ridicule of this scene, prolonged by the good- 
 nature of his guests and friends, was ineffagable ; and 
 from that moment Conway Crawley resolved on get- 
 ting rid of a relative who blended a disgraceful vul- 
 garity and lost character with an effrontery which, 
 like his own, was unconquerable. 
 
 In a few weeks, therefore, Mr. Crawley, through 
 the interest of his son, being still a loyal, though al- 
 most a lost man, was appointed consul to his Britan- 
 nic Majesty at a Turkish port. Meantime, consigned 
 by that son to the back stairs and housekeeper’s room 
 of his house in London, he felt the indignity with pa- 
 rental pride ; but his natural cheeriness of tempera- 
 ment prevailed over his misfortune, and while he sat 
 with the priestess of conserves enjoying a “ sup of 
 hot,” his head full of turbanned Turks and the ele- 
 phant in Blue Beard, on which he expected shortly to

 ride, with some acrimonious reference to the political 
 power and unnatural conduct of his son, he occasion- 
 ally was heard to sing forth— 
 
 “ ’Tis a very fine thing to he father-in-law 
 To a very magnificent three-tail’d bashaw.” 
 
 His son, meantime, becoming a servant of all work 
 in his political vocation and remunerated accordingly, 
 in his various capacities, literary, official, and diploma- 
 tic, — used, not respected, tolerated, not esteemed, — 
 
 “ With pay, and scorn content, 
 
 Bows and votes on in court and parliament.’* 
 
 On the successful termination of the great Fitz- 
 adelm cause, which had for some months occupied 
 the public attention, the Marquis and Marchioness of 
 Dunore took possession of their ancient castle and 
 vast possessions in Ireland, and fixed there their chief 
 residence. Convinced by a close and attentive obser- 
 vation that the land of their birth was hourly sinking 
 in the scale of nations, under the oppression of petty, 
 delegated authority, and by the neglect and absence 
 of its natural protectors, they acted, with their accus- 
 tomed energy and perseverance, upon the dictates of 
 experience; and they illustrated, by their example, 
 the truth of a maxim, now more* generally felt and 
 admitted, that 
 
 IRELAND CAN BEST BE SERVED IN IRELAND.

 Note ( 1 ) Page 7 . — This may seem harsh language applied to 
 the “ gallant Raleigh,” who had rendered himself so illustrious 
 in many instances, but it is fully justified by his conduct during 
 his residence in Ireland. 
 
 (2) Page 39. — Of the inextinguishable fire heretofore kept by 
 the nuns of St. Bridget at Kildare, thus speaks Giraldus Cam- 
 brensis. At Kildare, famous for St. Bridget, are many miracles 
 worthy to be remembered, among which is St. Bridget’s fire, 
 which they call inextinguishable, not that it cannot be extin- 
 guished, but because the nuns and holy women, by a continual 
 supply of materials, have preserved it alive for so many years 
 since the time of that virgin ; and though so great a quantity of 
 wood has been consumed in it, yet no ashes remain. From 
 hence that nunnery is commonly called the fire-house.

 This abbey was founded in honor of the Holy Cross, for Cister- 
 cians, by Donald O’Brien, King of Limerick, about the year 1169, 
 or as others, in 1181. The possessions were confirmed by John, 
 Lord of Ireland and Earl of Moreton, afterwards King of Eng- 
 land. This abbey was afterwards, in a general chapter, sub- 
 jected by the Abbot of Clarevaux to the Abbey of Furness, in 
 England.

 The term is applied from the circumstance of the spirits which 
 are sold in these private pot-houses being unlicensed, and con- 
 sequently concealed.

 names were added, either from some action, some quality of the 
 mind, color or mark of the body, or from chance, or ironically. 
 So Neal, King of Ireland, was called Vigialac, because he had 
 taken nine hostages from the lesser kings, and had held them for 
 some time in fetters. King Brian was called Boruma, because he

 had recovered from the people of Leinster a certain annual tri- 
 bute so called. Csenfela was called the wise. 
 
 (*5) Page 56. — This Irish Marmite formerly, and even within 
 these twenty years, was open to any hand its plentiful contents 
 might tempt. Now, however, the potato has risen in value with 
 the increase of wretchedness, and of that one meal a day is 
 often with difficulty procured. In the summer of 1817, the 
 author being in the country, within twelve miles of Dublin, on a 
 visit at the seat of a person of rank, frequently observed that 
 when the twelve o’clock bell rung to send the laborers home to 
 dinner, they lay down in the dry ditches. On inquiring into the 
 cause of a circumstance so unusual, she was informed, both by 
 the peasants and their overseers, that being unable to procure 
 more than one meal of potatoes (taken only with salt and water), 
 they preferred having that meal at night. Even this wretched 
 supper is extremely scanty. 
 
 (6) Page 94. — The ancient Irish used wicker boats covered 
 with ox hide, called corraghs, upon the open sea. Upon lakes 
 and rivers they used another kind of boat, called cotta , made of 
 a hollo.w tree. Both these boats are still in general use in 
 Ireland, under the name of corraghs and cots, but are chiefly to 
 be found on the rivers in remote counties, and on the south and 
 west sea coast.

 from the spade, and hired at a salary of £5 or £6 a year. He 
 is ever the ready instrument of oppression ; and, consequently, 
 the object of popular vengeance, and devoted to death, with the

 (10) Page 180. — The “ Fringes” was a procession of the trades 
 and corporations, performed in Ireland on Corpus Christi day, 
 even within the author’s recollection. King Solomon, Queen 
 Sheba, with Vulcan, Venus, and Cupid, were leading personages 
 upon this occasion. The ceremony was the remains of an old 
 Roman Catholic superstition. Something in the same way is 
 still celebrated in Shrewsbury, or at least was a very few years 
 back.

 Kilkenny, assemble whatever Ireland still retains of rank, fashion, 
 talent, and taste. There party loses its asperity, sect its dis- 
 tinction, and prejudice its bitterness. By-laws and military laws 
 are there forgotten, and the laws of this amiable institution, like 
 those of Nature, are governed by harmony only.

 country should sympathize with the oppressed wherever they 
 exist. Many Irish names are to be found among the gallant 
 advocates of liberty in South America. *

 recited is by no means to be depended on, yet it suggested to 
 their presidents the necessity of stone inclosures, or classes ; 
 these, in the East, were called mandrae. The word originally 
 imported a sheepfold, and was applied to those monastic build- 
 ings wherein the archimandrite presided over his disciples, as 
 he shepherd superintended his flock in the fold. There are 
 many of these mandrae dispersed over this kingdom, hitherto 
 unnoticed.

 finnes, canfinnes, confinnie — “the heads of clans.” We had our 
 Clanbreasil, Clancarty, Clanaboy, Clancolman, Clanfergal, and 
 many more. In most cases the tierna’s surname was that of his 
 clan.
