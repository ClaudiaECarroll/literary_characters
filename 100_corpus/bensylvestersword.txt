BEN SYLVESTER'S WORD.
CHAPTER L
THE SHEPHERD'S CEOWN.
Baronsbridge churchyard had one side
towards a long lane shaded by hedgerow
elms, that cast a pleasant shade as the sun
went down,- and made the lane a cool and
quiet walk after the business of the day.
Mr. Elliot, the school-master, a young,
pale, thoughtful man of five or six and
twenty, was slowly strolling down the lane,
with a book in his hand, feeling the still-
ness very refreshing after six hours of din
in the hot school-room, thinking over all
the idle ways and hasty words which he
had been obliged to rebuke, and question-

ing with himself whether he had done
what was best for each boy, and how far
the school showed any improvement under
his teaching.
"HI could bring the boys to have any
regard for truth, I should hope," said he
to himself; "but they are all alike. Even
such as would scruple at a downright false-
hood are so careless or onesided in their
statements, that they are not to be depend-
ed upon. Never do I try to sift an accu-
sation but there arises a swarm of lies, half-
truths and exaggerations; and the parents
are as willing to make false excuses as are
the children. I have not met with one
scholar to whom I can trust as sincere or
accurate; every one of them will shuffle
and equivocate for his own advantage.
What is to be done? These are boys who
have received the Gift of Whom it was
promised, 'He shall guide you into all
truth,' and assuredly we cannot be guided
into perfect Truth, unless our own en-

deavour be to act and speak with all truth
and sincerity. I speak in vain to these
boys of the terrors denounced against lying
lips; none of them seem as yet to prevail
against the momentary cowardly terror of
disgrace, or punishment, or, may be, of
the laughter of the rest. If I could find one
lad who loved the truth, I should have
some hope!"
His thoughts were broken into by the
sound of a scuffle on the other side of the
churchyard wall, and a rough, loud voice,
exclaiming, "Will you, then?"
"Fighting in the churchyard !" thought
he. "It must be those Sylvesters, or some
of that set," and he hurried on towards the
stile, while another voice cried out, strug-
gling and panting, "I'll not say nothing
about you."
"That won't do."
Mr. Elliot here leapt over the stile, and
saw a big lad of about seventeen fiercely
shaking a boy of twelve.

"Have done there, Sylvester," he called
out, coining so suddenly on them, that they
had no time to escape, but stood apart,
sullen and ashamed.
"They Syl'sters," or «that gipsy lot," as
the parish called them, not from gipsy
blood, but from their wild habits and dark
complexions, were the two youngest sons
of a widow, of whom it was commonly said,
that"Betty Sylvester could not tackle them
big boys." They were lads full of frolic
and adventure, and with their natural dis-
like to obedience and labour unchecked at
home, they had always been very trouble-
some and disagreeable to every one steady
or respectable. The only one who was a
credit had become so since he had enlisted,
another had ran away, and was believed to
be working on the railway; and these two,
after nearly teasing to death the poor old
school-mistress before Mr. Elliot's time,
while they were little, seemed to be going
the way of their brothers. Whenever

there was an uproar in the village, a Syl-
vester voice was the loudest; whenever the
girls were pelted or hooted into school, a
Sylvester led the fray; if there were a
cricket match or donkey race within five
miles, there the Sylvesters would be, what-
ever work they deserted; and it was taken
for granted in the parish that no mischief
could be done without a "Syl'ster" at the
bottom of it.
They never had regular work. Farmer
Martin, who employed their mother, could
not keep them on, though they no wand then
had a chance job with him or some one else
in a press of work; and of late things had
seemed to have a worse turn, since they
had taken up with Jacob Long, a man who
called himself a rat-catcher, but who was
a noted poacher, and had often been in
gaol. To catch two Sylvesters in mischief
was the last thing to surprise the school-
master.
They were fine-looking boys, Mr. Elliot

could not help thinking, as he stood paus-
ing between them, tall, straight-limbed,
and spirited-looking. Harry, the elder of
the two, had a fresh, dark-complexioned,
bold, open face, whose light-hearted merri-
ment would have been very pleasant, if it
had been without a sort of impudent jaunty
air, whicli was assisted by his cap being
set on with the peak over his ear—always
the sign of recklessness in a village lad;
and Benjamin, the younger, had a pair of
brown eyes that could look either very in-
telligent or very determined, as well as
very mischievous.
Mr. Elliot had only been ten months at
Baronsbridge, and had never had anything
to do with Harry; but Ben generally came
to the Sunday-school, and sometimes in the
week, and a great plague he had been both
there and at church, till Mr. Elliot had
shown he was not a man to be trifled with,
and latterly those brown eyes had looked
up at him, or at the clergyman, Mr. Con-
roy, as if they were taking in something.

"What's all this?" said Mr. Elliot.
"How come you to be making a row
here?"
"I did it," was Ben's answer, standing
boldly up.
"What—?" but at the same moment he
beheld the answer in a great starred crack
in the chancel window, and a large round
stone lying under it.
"Never heed him, Ben, t'aint nothing
to he. Come on," said the elder boy, re-
covering his tone of defiance, and turning
away.
"You'll not go, Ben," said Mr. Elliot,
kindly. "I heard part, so you may as well
tell the rest, and if you have had a misfor-
tune, perhaps I can help you."
Ben began civilly, "Thank ye, Sir," but
Harry, who had got away some steps, burst
out with a loud rude laugh, "Ho! ho!
school-master's got him! Quite cowed
him, ha! ha!"
"For my part," said Mr. Elliot, drily,

"I think those that are cowed are those
that run away."
Ben's eyes, flashed out merrily at this,
and he smiled.
"I overheard no more than I could help,"
continued Mr. Elliot, "but I .thought you
were wishing that the accident should be
mentioned."
"Ay, Sir," said Ben, " I was for going
to tell Mr. Conroy."
"That's right! But how did it happen?"
"I wanted to hit a jackdaw that was
sitting atop of the roof."
"Was your brother helping you to throw
at the daws?"
"Ay, but 'twas I threw that stone."
"And he wanted to hinder you from
confessing what you had done?"
"Yes, Sir."
"I am very glad you took the right
side," said Mr. Elliot, from the bottom of
his heart. "What made you do so?"
Ben gave him a pleasant look, and an-

swered, "Once you said, Sir, that the only
way to be free of a lie, is to begin with the
truth. And I did not know how I could
have the face to go to church if Mr. Con-
roy did not know it."
"You could not go about with a sense
of double-dealing. Well, Sylvester, I shall
learn to trust your word now. And see
here, shall I come with you to the parson-
age, and I'll answer for it Mr. Conroy will
not be hard on you."
"Thank you, Sir.
They walked up the paved path that led
towards the back door of the parsonage.
The door was opened by the housekeeper,
in all her evening trimness. "Good after-
noon, Mr. Elliot. None of your boys in
mischief, I hope?"
"Why yes, and no, Mrs. Susannah," he
answered good-humouredly; "but can I
see Mr. Conroy?"
"Just in time, Mr. Elliot: his horse is at
the door, but I'll go and tell him."

She called them the next moment into
the little matted hall, where Mr. Conroy,
who got through a great deal of business
by being always very quick, was putting
on his great-coat while waiting for them.
Of course the first impression was that
Ben Sylvester had been captured by Mr.
Elliot in the midst of mischief; but when
the school-master explained exactly how
the matter had been, Mr. Conroy did not
look nearly so much displeased.
"It is a bad business flinging at those
daws, which you have so often been told
not to do, and breaking the church win-
dows," he said, " but still I am glad we have
an honest boy among us. What do you
say, Mr. Elliot? I should like to let him
off, but we have said so much about throw-
ing stones in the churchyard, that I don't
know that we can fairly do so. One pane
starred you say. Well, Sylvester, you and
your brother bring me eight-pence by the
end of the month, that's the cost, and we'll

say no more about it, except that I shall
think better of you henceforth. Good
night to you."
"Good night, Sir, and thank you," said
both Ben and Mr. Elliot; and Mr. Conroy's
horse's hoofs were soon clattering down the
lane.
"There, my boy," said the master,
"that's well over. You'll be much the
happier for not having it on your mind."
"Yes, Sir, thank you."
"And I am the happier," added Mr.
Elliot, smiling, "for one of my boys having
freely spoken the truth. Good night."
Mr. Elliot watched the boy into the field
that led towards his mother's cottage.
Then he went towards the broken win-
dow, and just beneath it picked up the
stone.
It was one of those round stones not un-
common in chalky places, with the under-
side flat, the upper rather pointed, and with
a pattern of double rays of dots or holes

spreading from the centre on every side.
When Mr. Conroy's little nephew found
one, he called it a geological specimen of
a fossil echinus; but Mrs. Susannah had
nearly thrown it away, and when he ex-
claimed at her, she only said, "Well, to be
sure, to make such a work about an old
shepherd's crown!"
Mr. Elliot held more with the schoolboy
than with the housekeeper, and seldom saw
one of these curious sea animals turned to
stone and bedded in the earth, without
looking on it as one of the proofs of the
mysteries of creation; but it was not for
that reason that he stooped to pick up this
shepherd's crown, looked at it as a friend,
and gave it a place on the mantel-piece in
his little sitting-room.
"There," said he, " that round stone is
the greatest encouragement I have had
yet. It will be a remembrance of the first
time I have seen a boy of mine strive and
suffer for truth's sake; and one of the last

I should have expected to do so too. Our
eyes are not the best judges. Perhaps he
might have done it all the same, if David
Elliot had never come near the place; but
whether or no, it will give me hope when-
ever I look at that stone. There is One
who can make the seed grow where we
least look for it!"
CHAPTER H.
"that gipsy lot."
"Hollo, Ben, have you had enough of
it?" cried Harry, who was sitting on the
stile before his mother's door smoking a
pipe. "I hope the parson gave you a thor-
ough good preaching."
"Not a bit," said Ben; "ho let me off
very easy. We are to pay eight-pence at
the end of the month, and he won't say no
more about it."

ben Sylvester's word.
"Won't he indeed?" said Harry, laugh-
ing scornfully; "and pray how is he going
to get the eight-pence?"
"Won't yon help me, Harry? you know
you began, and I shan't have nothing till
the wheat is ripe."
"You may do it all yourself, if you like
being had up to the parson. It was for
your pleasure, not mine."
"If I only knew how to get it!"
"You should have thought of that be-
fore."
"I had rather pay the eight-pence if I
had it, than be so mean as not to have told,
and get some one else into a mess."
"I'll tell you what, Ben, if you go on
this way, they'll make a regular Molly of
you. They've taken all the spirit out of
you already, and if I don't lick the non-
sense out before I've done, my name's not
Harry SyPster."
"I won't have my Ben licked," cried a
little girl of ten years old, rushing out of

the cottage, and hugging him. "Come in
to supper, Ben; never mind him."
She held up her little fist merrily at
Harry, and as she was the youngest, the
only girl, the favourite, and the saying
was, that "Fanny could never abide
words," she made peace in a minute.
She was a bright child, with a gipsy
look about her black hair, and great eyes;
and she stood well with every one. She
had, without knowing it, two consciences,
one for home, and one for school, the first
much easier than the second, and her fu-
ture life depended on whether her better
conscience would conquer her slack one,
or her lax habits undermine her stricter
ones.
"Widow Sylvester, if not out charing at
Farmer Martin's, always had washing by
the window, and a teapot on the table by
the fire. She was. a battered-looking
woman, her black hair turning grizzled,
and her cap, her face, and her gown all

one pale drab colour together. Poor thing!
she had a rough, drinking husband, and a
heavy family; she had worked hard for
them all, and fancied that, and being fairly
honest, was her whole duty. She had no
notion either of a cheerful home or of sound
training; she only toiled to feed them, and
her motherly fondness chiefly showed itself
in defending them against every one who
spoke of their being to blame. Indeed, so
much had been laid to their door, that her
only refuge seemed to be in hardening her-
self against believing one word of it, or
caring if she did. She never found fault
but when she was personally annoyed with
them, and then she could make up for all
that she otherwise let them escape.
Poverty is a terrible thing when it is en-
dured so as to miss all its blessings. The
young ones might not feel it press hard,
for they had health and hardihood, their
bodies throve in the wild freedom of their
life, and their spirits were light and joyous;

but their mother, poor woman, had chosen
the lot of a bond-slave, not of a submissive
contented child, and the bondage was very-
heavy. They would find the same in their
turn, unless they in time embraced the
true freedom.
"Bless me, Ben, have mercy on the loaf!"
said his mother in a high-pitched, worn
voice, as he cut off a huge hunch for him-
self. "No more till Saturday, 1 promise
you! "Well, what tricks have you been
after now?"
"Shying at the daws. I've been and
cracked a church window," said Ben, with
his mouth full.
"Well, to be sure, what an unlucky boy
you are. Never was a lot like mine for
mischief," and her voice rose thinner and
higher, while Fanny clasped her brown
fingers, and said in dismay, "Cracked a
church window! Oh! me! Ben!"
"Nobody saw you, to be sure," continued
Mrs. Sylvester.

"Nobody would have never known noth-
ing about it," said Harry, who had come
to the door, and was leaning against the
post, puffing his tobacco into the room,
"if he had not been such a fool as to make
such a row about telling, that school-mas-
ter came in, and pulled him up before the
parson."
"He didn't, Harry!" cried Ben. "I
went of my own accord!"
Harry laughed, and made a face.
"What did they do to you, Ben?" anx-
iously asked Fanny, coming close to his
side. "They didn't give you the stick?"
"No such thing," said Ben, laughing,
"they were both very kind spoken. Mr.
Conroy would have let me off, but he said
it would not be fair on the rest, after all
he has said about the flinging stones in the
churchyard, so I am to pay eight-pence."
Poor Mrs. Sylvester could not bear
to hear of paying away the money that it
was so hard to earn; and almost crying,

21
she began to scold Ben, and declare that
hers were the nndutifullest, wastefullest lads
as ever were born.; she was not going to
give him eight-pence, she could not get it,
not she, and she went into a long story
about rent, and shoes, and bread, in the
midst of which her three children all quiet-
ly walked away, for this kind of manner
had not taught them to be respectful or
sympathizing; and she had not found out
that she had no listener except the old cat,
when the two boys were making Fanny
laugh by swinging her on the gate of Ba-
rony Park, as they called the great wood
that spread all up the side of the hill to
Baron's waste—that wood where Jacob
Long had last winter taught Harry to
catch so many pheasants.
The Sylvesters were honest, except in the
matter of game, but unsteadiness had put
them so much out of honest company, that
the elder boys had all taken up with Long,
who was admired by them as a daring

poacher, and they only called it bad luck
that he had been more than once in gaol
for actual pilferings.
Though he did not by any means know
where the eight-pence was to come from,
Ben found himself in some way more at
rest after that confession.
Perhaps it was one of those turns that
give colour to a life, the first stroke on the
right side in the great battle-field. He
saw that Mr. Conroy and Mr. Elliot relied
on his word, and this was his first step in
believing that all the world was not against
him, and that it was worth while to take
pains, Sylvester though he was, and he
liked to gain a look of approval from their
eyes.
Before the end of the month he had a
hope of earning the money. On the bor-
ders of the waste a couple had long ago
come as squatters, and had managed, by
quiet encroachments, to inclose a little
field and garden, on which, and on the

common, they kept a pony, a cow or two,
some pigs, ducks, geese, and poultry; and
they drove a small trade with the Barons-
bridge cottagers and the town of Aldring-
ham. They were not very noted for hon-
esty or scrupulousness, but their traffic was
a great convenience, and as they were close
and saving, they were thought to have
made a good deal of money.
The old man was now dead, and" his wife
was beginning to fail, so that she required
a boy to help in the care of her animals.
She gave very small pay, and bore so poor
a character, that none of the village people
who could do better for their children
would let them hire themselves out to her;
but Betty Sylvester's children had done
worse things than that for a livelihood,
and as it was only in a great press of work
that one of "they Syl'sters" had any
chance of being taken on by a respectable
farmer, Ben was not sorry when old Mrs.
Walcot called to him over her gate, to ask

if he were willing to tend her cow and
pony at two-pence a day.
The very first Saturday he carried the
money to Mr. Conroy. Perhaps the
'clergyman had not expected it to come so
punctually, for he looked pleased and sur-
prised, saying, "That's a good boy! I
think you are improving, Ben. Tou may
turn out a good steady fellow at last, like
your brother, the soldier."
Ben quite blushed with pleasure. Had
he ever been called a good boy before?
Certainly not in that sense, though his
mother sometimes said "there's a good
lad," when she wanted him to leave off
some great piece of mischief, and Jacob
Long had hallooed out "that's a good one,"
when he jumped right over the widest
water-carriage in the meadows.
Keeping Mrs. "Walcot's cow and pony
was a life that he did not dislike at all. It
suited his wild habits to go straying after
them over the common, basking about in

the sun, and lying down amongst the
heather, or creeping up the shady lanes
and cutting the long grass for them out of
the high banks, and storing up bundles of
hog-weed to bring home for the pig. He
was tender to animals of all kinds, and
soon made great friends with the creatures;
and Mrs. "Walcot said she liked him better
than e'er a boy she had had, because he
never ill-used the cattle, and she could
always believe what he said. But though
she professed to like him, she never let
him into her house. No one had ever
been into that house, and this made every
one very curious about it, and there were
all sorts of stories going about the parish
as to the wonderful things she had there,
and the stores of half-crowns and of bank-
notes laid up in every tea-pot.
Ben once peeped in at the window, but
he could see nothing but a sanded floor, a
clock, and a dresser, such as he might have
seen in any other kitchen, and while he

was staring after some glitter of the half-
crowns, his mistress came behind him at
unawares, and boxed his ears for an idle,
inquisitive, good-for-nothing lad.
His mother and Fanny were terribly
disappointed at his want of success, and
began telling more surprising stories than
ever about bundles of sovereigns poked
away in the thatch; and Jacob Long, who
was smoking his pipe by Mrs. Sylvester's
fire, advised him to slip in some evening
while the old lady was milking her cow,
look well round, and, may be, carry off a
note or two, she would be never the wiser.
"Don't you say such things to the lads,
Jacob," said their mother, as Ben and
Fanny both looked shocked, but Harry
added, "Bless me, mother, Jacob's only
in joke!"
"Of course," growled Jacob; "only 'tis
a shame good money should lie rotting and
doing nobody no good."
Fanny touched Ben's hand. "Come
out, Benny," she said; "come down the

lane with me. I don't like being in when
that Jacob is there. It makes me creep to
hear his bad words. I'm sure he says
worse than ever our Harry does! You've
pretty nigh left them off, Ben, since you
took to saying your prayers regular."
""Why," said Ben, "when I thought of
it, it didn't seem true to-Mr. Elliot to say
'em out of his hearing, when I wouldn't in..
Besides, it would have made you creep,
indeed, to hear what Mr. Conroy told us
one day they meant. No, no, I couldn't
go on to say my prayers, if I did that."
"I couldn't go to school now without
my prayers," said Fanny, "though it did
feel queer to begin."
"I did it because Mr. Elliot made me
promise," said Ben.
"O don't go back, Ben," said Fanny;
"'tis nicer out here."
"Ah! you are a girl," said Ben, verg-
ing to the door to listen whether Long
were telling any of his stories, but Fan-
ny kept him to tell her about his dear

old Jack, Mrs. "Walcot's pony, and of
the hopes that his mistress would buy
a new pig at the fair. This was much
more interesting to her than Long's his-
tories of wonderful catches of fish, or poach-
ings of game, or the races at Winstone.
Ben used to listen to these with his mouth
open. Long could tell a story well, and
was really a rare shot, good at cricket,
clever at finding game, and in thoroughly
understanding all sorts of sports, and, in
spite of his character, all the lads round
about looked up to him excessively, and
were highy pleased to be noticed by him.
People a little wiser were always sorry to
see such an intimacy begin, for it generally
ended in the young men taking to drink-
ing, and then to other evil courses, till it
came to their being had up before the
magistrates. Mrs. Sylvester, however,
used to tell Mr. Conroy, when he gave her
good advice, that she liked to be at peace

liked so well to have some one to talk with,
that she made him welcome whenever
Harry brought him home.
CHAPTEK III.
THE SPORTING HANDKERCHIEF.
The summer came, and all the world of
Baronsbridge had their heads full of the
fair at Aldringham-hill.
Old Mrs. "Walcot had to buy a pig, and
Ben, to his extreme delight, was to go with
her to help to bring it-home. There never
had been a pig in his own family, and
how much he thought of it cannot be told.
As to Harry, he would never miss a holi-
day, and made many promises of treating
his brother and sister. In preparation, one
evening he walked to Aldringham, and
brought home two splendid neck-handker-
chiefs, one bright blue, with grey pictures

of the Queen, Prince Albert, Louis Napo-
leon, and the Sultan, at the corners, and
London, Paris, Constantinople, and Sebas-
topol, along the sides; the other deep crim-
son, covered with buff spots as big as crown-
pieces, with little men boxing on each.
"Hollo, Benjie, which will you have to
gallant Mrs. "Walcot to the fair in? They
are to be had at Mr. Cottington's; and he's
got two streamers of them down each side
of his door, and folks buying them so fast,
that to-morrow there won't be one to be
had for love or money."
""What! do you mean to give me one,
Harry?"
"Don't I? why if you go like that, in
your old fustians and black tie, they'll be
asking which is you and which is the pig!"
Ben decidedly chose the handkerchief
with Her Majesty's portrait.
"And look here, little one," said Harry.
"You hem mine nicely round for me, and
Pll give you a silver three-pence to spend
in a fairing."

Fanny clapped her hands, and promised.
"I han't got no silver three-pennies,"
said Ben, pretending to be disconsolate.
"I must go without."
Fanny rolled up her pinafore to flog him
for talking nonsense.
""Well done, Harry, thou be'est flush of
money," said his mother.
"jTve had a run of luck," said Harry,
who was too often to be found at the skit-
tle-ground behind the Blue Boar.
"Well, I'm glad Ben's got a present,"
said Mrs. Sylvester, "he is a right good
boy, and brings home all he gets."
Ben was the only one of her sons who
had ever done so, since they had been too
strong for her to take it, but he had not
quite in vain learnt that he ought to suc-
cour his mother. Harry paid for lodging
and washing, but found his own meals, and
into what bad company this led him she
did not ask.
Fanny's hemming did not go on so pros-

perously as she had hoped. Ben was
sitting at the edge of the old gravel-pit,
chucking stones into the water, and won-
dering whether the pig would be black or
spotted, and whether he could mend the
hole in the old sty, when he heard a great
screaming of little girls, and Fanny's voice
full in the midst.
He ran up the little mound, and saw
Fanny evidently making an attack upon
her great friend, Jane Hawker, who was
defending her little brother from her. Of
course, whatever appearances might be,
Ben took it for granted that his sister was
misused, and charged down the slope, call-
ing out, "What are you doing to Fanny?"
"I ain't doing nothing. She shan't
beat my Jem!" cried Jane. "No, you
shan't, none of you! I'll call mother!"
"Beating a baby like that! For shame,
Fanny!" said Ben.
"He has run off with Harry's handker-
chief. He is a bad boy: he won't tell
where it is !" sobbed Fanny.


## p. 33 (#41) ##############################################

THE SPORTING HANDKERCHIEF. 33
"He won't tell if you are so cross with
him. He does not know no better. He'll
tell Janie, won't he ?" said Jane, who had
grown less violent as Ben seemed disposed
to defend her brother.
The little monkey, who was two years
old, just the age for mischief, had taken a
quiet moment for stealing away with
Fanny's work, while the two girls, with
their mouths wide open, were listening to
a history, from Alice Benbow, of the two
elephants, the six white horses, four pie-
balds, and two cream-coloured ponies that
had passed by to the fair.
What he had done with it, neither could
guess, and the two girls' tongues started
again; one declaring the other should have
minded her work; the other, that her com-
panion should have minded her brother.
"Hollo! girls!" cried Ben, stopping
his ears, " let me know when you've done,
and then I'll try to find it for you."
That made them rather ashamed of the
quarrel, and they began in good earnest

to search for the lost handkerchief. It was
found at last, by little Jem going and
poking, as if he knew nothing about it,
into a rabbit-hole by a furze bush, and
thence they dragged out the unlucky hand-
kerchief, all crumpled and soiled, and,
worse, with a great rent in the edge. Poor
Fanny burst out crying again; and if Ben
had not caught tight hold of her, with
another whispered "For shame!" she
might have cuffed little Jem again ; but Ben
kept the peace between the maidens, and
all three held a council over the damage.
Jane declared that she could patch it
up so that no one should see the rent; that
her mother would give it a turn in the
wash-tub, and she would iron it; and they
would make such a good job of it, that
Harry should never guess that anything
had gone wrong.
Fanny was not quite so hopeful, but they
trotted away together, and Ben was left to
the company of the cow, and to wateh the

swallows skimming after flies, and to try to
guess whether they fiew low enough to
threaten rain. By-and-by they came back
across the heath, looking very proud and
pleased, and ordering him to find out the
torn place, if he could. He found it much
sooner than they wished, and indeed it was
not difficult. They told him it was all be-
cause he knew it before, and hoped he
would agree with them that no man or boy
would ever guess at it, if he had not been
told.
"No man, indeed! D'ye think men are
all such geese as yourselves, not to find out
such a cobble as that? No, no, Fan, best
tell Harry how it was at once, and if he is
angry, why then he must have mine in-
stead."
Fanny was much afraid for her three-
pence; she would have liked to make
sure of it before owning what had happen-
ed; but Ben made her ashamed of such a
notion, and she yielded when she saw that

there was no help for it, and that Ben
would think her mean and shabby if she
did not freely tell.
Harry was not at all ill-natured about it
—he was far too good-humoured and fond
of his sister for that—nor would he take
Ben's offer of changing handkerchiefs; but
it turned out that any way she would not
have got the three-pence, for he lost at the
skittle-ground again that yery evening.
He promised fairings to make up for it,
but he was too selfish to choose to go to
the fair without money in his pocket, so he
kept out of her way all Saturday evening
after his wages were paid, and all Sunday.
He did not get up till long after she and
Ben were gone to school and church; he
lay basking in the sun on the common all
the forenoon, and went with Jacob Long
and a party of idle lads to a cricket-match
in the next village. Little did he guess
that this was the last Sunday that would
be left at his own disposal.
Ben's handkerchief, meantime, figured

grandly, the Queen and Prince Albert
sticking out under his chin, and the Em-
peror and Sultan tucked away at the back
of his neck, and on it went betimes the
next morning for the fair, to help his mis-
tress to choose a pig! Ben had never felt
so great a man in all his life.
He ran off, tended the cow, fed the poul-
try, cleaned out the sty, and made it a
charming abode to welcome the new arri-
val, and wanted to harness the pony to the
little old green cart long before Mrs. Wal-
cot put her head out, and said, " What a
work the lad is making! Can't ye be
quiet? I ain't going this hour, I tell you."
Another hour and she was going, seated
in her cart, with Ben walking at the pony's
head.
"Now, I'll tell you what, lad," she be-
gan presently, "I'll not have you running
off after any lark of your own in the fair.
You go to bring home my pig, and I'll see
you bring him straight home."
4


## p. 38 (#46) ##############################################

Ben thought her cross, but his head was
full of the pig, and that important beast
secured, what could he wish, but to con-
duct him home to his lodging with all due
honour? He did not regret that other
pleasures were forbidden, only that his
mistress should think he could desert a
new pig to run after them.
He had no money either, so he could not
have seen the horsemanship, nor the dog
that told fortunes, nor have bought one
gingerbread-cake for Fanny, if he had had
ever so much freedom. The old woman
watched him lest he should slip away, and
drove away from the gayest side of the
fair, along the backs of the booths; but
she needed not, for Ben felt as business-like
as she did. I doubt whether the squire's
bailiff felt a bit more like a person with a
great charge upon him.
So they came to the pigs, and Ben at-
tended with all his eyes and ears while she
pinched and felt the squeaking creatures,

and asked questions and haggled about the
price, and he felt baulked and vexed as
each pig was passed over as too dear, and
at last so proud and delighted when a nice
little comfortable black fellow was pitched
upon, with sleek sides, and a twinkle in his
eye, a curly tail, and feet that, shone like
newly-blacked boots.
They got him into their cart, with plenty
of squealing, or, as they called it, "holla-
ing," and brought him safely back, only
hearing one tremendous uproar in the dis-
tance as they turned down the hill; and
Ben's whole evening was spent afterwards
in making the pig welcome, gathering all
the herbs he thought he would like, and
watching to see whether he took kindly to
his new house.
On going home, he found his mother in
some care. Fanny had gone with some of
her companions, and come home tired and
dull,having stood about, and done nothing,
and found not half amusement enough to

make up for the blame that they knew was
in preparation for them at school for stay-
ing away without leave.
They had, besides, brought word that
there had been a great fray. Some men
had been drinking, and had quarrelled, a
policeman had been knocked down, and his
pocket picked, and there was suspicion
that Jacob Long had done it. The police
had been to his hut, but without finding
him; and as it was always probable that
where he was, there Harry would be, Mrs.
Sylvester much wished to see Harry come
safely in, that she might know him to be
in no scrape.
But the evening went on, and he came
not. It was no great wonder, for he was
often out late, and the children did not
share her anxiety. Ben did nothing but
describe to Fanny the beauties of "our
pig," as he called it, and promised to show
it to her, if she could only come with him
very early in the morning, before Mrs.

Walcot was astir, for there was nothing the
old woman allowed so little as any children
coming dragging about her place.
CHAPTER IV.
THE MOENING AFTEE THE FAIE.
Ben's dreams were of the new pig. It was
a hot sultry night, and the up-stairs win-
dow either would not open, or had never
been tried, and perhaps the close air made
him restless, for he was always fancying
that the pig was not easy in his new sty,
and that he must go and see after him.
The last time he awoke, the light of
morning was beginning to stream greyly in,
and he felt as if he must get up and satisfy
himself that the pig had not "hucked"
out the hole that he had so cleverly mended
with bushes, and then he could finish' his
rest out some time by day, if he were

sleepy. He longed .after the cool air, and
the sight of the treasure. He got up, and
the sound wakened Fanny, who claimed
his promise of showing her the pig before
Mrs. "Walcot could be about, and rising so
quietly as not to disturb her mother, put
on her clothes, and came to him in the
kitchen as he was saying his prayers.
""What, do you say the collect too?"
said Fanny, when he had done.
"Ay, Mr. Conroy said as how we
ought," said Ben, " and I like the collects,
some of them, only this has such long
words. There's adversities."
"I don't think adversities a hard word,"
said Fanny, " and it only means troubles,
only I don't think we have troubles and
dangers big enough to pray about."
Poor little Fanny! how long would she
think so?
""lis such a pretty one," she continued,
"as we have to learn this week, about
'such good things as pass man's under-

standing'—that is, we can't think how
good they be."
"Ay," said Ben, "like them in the end
of the Testament. That is fine reading,
and Mr. Conroy said sunrise might mind
one of it. There's a fine red sunrise going
to be presently."
"Yes; oh, that's pretty! look at the red
edge of that cloud."
"We shall see it better from the waste.
I can't stop now, I must see to my pig,"
said Ben, jumping over the stile into the
narrow path up the wood.
How cool and dark it was in the wood,
the grass dank and heavy with dew hang-
ing across the path, and the birds only
here and there twittering as if not yet
awake. The children felt it chill, and
hurried up in haste to get out upon the
waste, in sight of the sky.
Fanny was the first, and pushed out in
haste through the gap by the side of the
stile.

"Why, Ben," she cried, "whoever is
that at Mrs. Walcot's?"
Sure enough Ben saw two figures near
the house door.
"My pig! my pig! they'll steal my
pig !" was his cry. "I'll hollo at them."
"O don't go! don't go!" cried Fanny,
catching hold of his round frock. ,
"I must see to our pig," exclaimed Ben.
"Run you as fast as you can to the vil-
lage, halloo out to the policeman and
every one that they are stealing Mrs. Wal-
cot's pig—hie—begone!"
Ben set off at full speed to guard the
pig, hallooing as he went, to fray the
thieves away. Fanny stood for a moment;
she would rather have followed him, but
getting frightened, she rushed off the op-
posite way towards the houses, screaming
at the top of her voice, enough to waken
all the sleepers in the place.
The sound of a grunt and a squeak add-
ed wings to Ben's speed, and he bounced

over the gate of the little yard immediately
upon two men, who were coming through
the wicket that led to it from the back door
of the cottage. He knew the first, and
cried " Holloo, Jacob, you shan't do noth-
ing to my pig."
He had no time for more; he heard *
something of an oath, but at the same mo-
ment a terrible blow made red flashes dart
before his eyes. He fell to the ground,
and knew nothing till he found an aching
pain in his head, something soft under him,
and sounds around, which gradually be-
came clearer to him, as Fanny sobbing and
a buzz of voices comforting her. Then
came such a smart on the bruised temple
that it seemed to restore his senses; he
unclosed his eyes, and saw a hand putting
something to his forehead, and they said he
was coming to himself. He was lying
dressed, except for his round frock, on a
bed in a strange room, where were Fanny,
Mr. Elliot, and the old woman who " did
for " the school-master.


## p. 46 (#54) ##############################################

"Don't cry, Fan," he tried to say, but
his words came strangely slow, and turned
into, " Jacob Long, what are you at?"
"Oh, Ben, you are better now," and she
sprang to his side.
He tried to sit up, and asked what was
the matter, but it only made him dreadfully
sick; and Mr. Elliot gently laid him down
again, and told him not to speak till the
doctor came. He was frightened at seeing
his round frock thrown aside, covered with
blood; but he did not seem to be able to
speak or think, but only murmured some-
thing of " mother," and they told him she
was coming.
In a minute or two more she had pushed
the door open, calling out, "What have
they been doing with my boy? Poor
little lad! here's mother. The bloody-
minded villains, couldn't they be content
with killing the poor old lady?"
"Killing the old lady!" cried Ben,
sitting bolt upright, with white face and
staring eyes. "Jacob Long, was it?"


## p. 47 (#55) ##############################################

THE MORNING AFTER THE FAIR. 47
"Ay, killing her dead. Doctor Spear-
man can't do nothing for her. I seen her
myself, beat about the head shameful.
Ah! my boy—'Ben—my lad—look at
mother."
For the words had been like the robber's
blow. Ben had dropped back on the pil-
low like one shot dead.
When he returned to anything like his
senses, he was conscious of much pain and
sickness, and very uncomfortable things
being gently done to his head by Mr. Spear-
man, Mr. Elliot, the old woman, and Mrs.
Susannah. He guessed now that he was
in Mr. Elliot's own bed-room, and per-
ceived a strange stillness in those attending
on him, while an unusual buzz of voices
came through the open window. He
wanted to thank them, and to ask what
'was the frightful thing his mother had said,
but he could not get his tongue to tell
what he meant; they looked at each other
with alarmed faces, and Mrs. Susannah

began to soothe him, and call him "my
dear," and he knew he must have been
talking nonsense, and believed it had been
'about the pig, or Jacob Long; but it was
all confusion, he shut his eyes, and by-and-
by waked from a sleep. No one was there
but the school-master, who was standing
gazing from the window, whence came
more of the hum. He looked very sorrow-
ful, and Ben watched him for some mo-
ments dreamily before recollecting himself,
and then the pain in his head helped to re-
mind him of all. He put up his hand and
moved, and Mr. Elliot came to him in a
moment, telling him that he had had a nice
sleep, and was better.
"Yes, thank you, Sir," said Ben, raising
himself, "but where's mother? What did
they say about poor old Missus?"
"Keep quiet a little longer, Ben," said
the master. "You shall have some tea;
you had better not talk."
"Only tell me, please, Sir, what they've


## p. 49 (#57) ##############################################

THE MORNING AFTER THE FAIR. 49
been doing to poor old. Missus? Did
mother say they had been and killed her?"
"Indeed they have," said Mr. Elliot,
taking him by both hands and laying him
down again. "You were not able to save
her, my brave boy."
"I thought to save the pig," said Ben;
"I never thought on her. "Who could go
for to do such a thing? I'd never, have
thought it of Jacob."
Mr. Elliot heaved a very long, deep sigh,
and did not answer. Ben could not think
why he still held his hand, and seemed so
sorry for him. Could he think him very
ill? Rather frightened, by way of experi-
ment, Ben raised himself on his elbow, and
said, "Thank ye, Sir, I'm better now; I
could go home."
"Lie still and have some tea first," 6aid
his master, moving away, between sadness
and embarrassment.
"Aint it near school time ?" said Ben,
puzzled by the way the sunbeams came in.

"We have no school to-day; it is past
two o'clock," said Mr. Elliot, and these
words seemed to confound Ben's notions
more than all. It was all too odd and too
dreadful for his present powers of mind;
and so his throbbing head returned to the
pillow, and he kept quiet till the tea was
brought to his thirsty lips.
As he was finishing, Mr. Conroy knock-
ed, and came in, and Ben believed that he
had been there before. He, too, looked
very mournful, and his manner of desiring
Ben not to move, was not like his usual
brisk short way, but so gentle and soft, it
was almost hike respect. He said a few
words to Mr. Elliot, which sounded like
"They will want him soon. Does he
know?"
And Mr. Elliot shook his head, at which
Ben became very uneasy; and as Mr.
Conroy turned towards him, again asked
for his mother and Fanny.
"I saw them at the Blue Boar, where

the coroner is making out what he can of
this sad business," said the clergyman, sit-
ting down beside Ben, who felt rather hurt
at his mother having left him. "You
have been acting like a faithful servant,
my boy, which is one comfort. Do you
think you shall be able to answer the gen-
tlemen a few questions?"
"O yes, Sir," said Ben.
"Kbt yet, keep still for the present.
Mr. Spearman will come to call you in
time. Did you not say something of Jacob
Long?" he added, after a pause.
"Sir, must I go and tell them it was
Jacob Long!" exclaimed Ben, trembling
all over. "Harry is always after him, and
he and poor father were comrades, and—"
then, as the remembrance of all came back,
"and he'd never have gone and done such
a thing as that."
"My poor boy," said the clergyman,
"you will have nothing to do but to an-
swer simply and truly. You did see Jacob


## p. 52 (#60) ##############################################

52 ben Sylvester's word.
Long, did you not, at the poor woman's
house?"
"Yes, Sir, but it was not he as hit me."
"You do not know who it was who was
with him?"
"No, Sir."
The clergyman tried to look searchingly
at Ben, then turned away his eyes, as if he
could not bear it.
"Is Jacob took up, Sir 2 " Ben ventured
to say.
"He is—" then, as there was a sound of
opening the door below, Mr. Oonroy seemed
obliged to speak. "He was taken in the
'Jolly Yeoman,' at Aldringham, and, Ben,
I grieve to tell you that your brother was
with him, and that the police have him in
custody on the suspicion." ,
This time Ben leapt quite up on his feet.
"Harry !" he cried, while the colour came
back to his face, "it was not Harry! Har-
ry would never go for to do such a wicked,
cruel thing. How can they say it! I'll

go and tell Mr. Conroy this minute that
it was not Harry."
"Yery well," said the gentleman, "I am
glad yon are so certain. You had better
recollect yourself, that you may be able to
prove that this wretched man was not
Harry."
Mr. Conroy could say no more, for the
surgeon was coming in to judge whether
the boy were fit to undergo an examina-
tion before the jury. Ben, whose whole
soul was set on freeing his brother from this
horrible charge, declared himself quite
well, and fully able. Mr. Spearman felt
his pulse, and looked a little doubtful; but
he made no opposition, and Ben would
have set forth in haste to the Blue Boar,
which was just opposite, had not Mr. Con-
roy held him back a moment.
"My boy," said he, "remember that,
however you may wish to clear your
brother, you cannot transgress that most
solemn pledge to God Himself, that you

will speak only the simple truth. You call
ou God Himself to be the Judge of your
words."
Ben's heart seemed to beat slower. Did
not Mr. Conroy believe him? "Would no
one? O Harry! Harry!
A few steps brought back his dizziness,
and when he came into the open air, the
passage across the street seemed to him all
eyes and people) a whole multitude, as if
the entire village of Baronsbridge and the
town of Aldringham were there staring at
him together, and like the winds the mur-
mur rushed on his ear, "Poor boy!"
In truth he looked ghastly, with the ter-
rible bruise on his temple, with even his
lips whitened from the sickness, as well as
from his nose having bled violently at first;
and his face became still paler, when, as he
entered the Blue Boar, he felt rather than
saw Harry and Jacob standing in charge
of a policeman. Harry perceiving his lit-
tle brother's condition, instantly started

forward, then turning sharply round on his
fellow-prisoner, exclaimed, "Did you do
that?" Jacob made a sullen denial with
his head, and Ben heard no more, for he
was conducted into the large room of the
inn, which was stifling with heat, and
crowded with people—twelve of the neigh-
bours as jurymen, many spectators, among
them his poor mother, with Fanny cling-
ing to her, and the coroner at the top of the
long table. He could not stand, and a
chair was set for him, while Mr. Conroy
made his way to the coroner, who was be-
ginning to say, "This'is the boy, Benjamin
Sylvester?" when the clergyman said some-
thing in a low voice to him.
"Ay, very well, he docs not look as if
he was himself indeed," he answered.
"We'll not swear him. Come, my boy,
we'll soon have done with you, if you will
tell us how you got that bad knock on the
head."
"O please, Sir, don't say nothing about
that," said Ben.

beginning to tremble, and feel all his
thoughts flutter at the perception that
those people were setting down every
word he said, and that Harry's life depend-
ed on them.
"Which way did you go?"
"Up Barony Park," he faltered.
"Where were you going?"
"To Mrs. Walcot's—" He was near
crying now.
"What took you there so early?"
"To see after the pig."
Such a strange feeling came over him,
that he was sure that if he did not speak
now, he never should, and he burst out,
without waiting to be questioned, "And
there they were, Jacob and the other, but
it was not Harry, Sir, it was not Harry—"

"Coming over the stile."
"Describe them. "What were they like?"
Ben tried to recollect, but his powers
seemed to go away. Those staring eyes
swam round and danced before him; he
made a last effort at saying "It was not
Harry," but put his hands before his eyes,
and only just heard the coroner saying,
"Poor fellow! Well, gentlemen of the
jury, the evidence is sufficient without
him," before the doctor and school-master
carried him off again.
He revived in the cooler air of Mr. El-
liot's house, but only to give way to a vio-
lent fit of crying because he had done
nothing to clear Harry. He wanted to go *
back again and speak for him, and Mr. El-
liot had great difficulty in making him un-
derstand that there would be further op-
portunities, and that, were he able to say
ever so much, his brother would probably
still have to stand his trial. He could not
stop crying, and declaring how tender-

hearted Harry was, and then crying for
poor mother, and then for his poor old mis-
tress; and then all on a sudden he went
into a great fit of anxiety for the cow and
pony, and cocks and hens, nobody would
let them out, they would all be starved.
He was so vehement about it,' that Mr. El-
liot thought him astray again, but Mr.
Conroy kindly promised to go and speak
to the police, who were in charge of the
sad spot, and to see that none of the poor
animals suffered by neglect.
Ben did not wonder now that his mother
was too much taken up with Harry's fate
to be able to come to him. He lay on a
'little couch in Mr. Elliot's sitting-room
down stairs, and was too much spent to do
anything but tremble, when word was
brought in that the verdict had been re-
turned of wilful murder against Jacob Long
and Henry Sylvester, and that they were
being taken to Sir John Heneage's for com-
mittal to Winston gaol.

THE MORNING AFTEB THE FAIE. 59
Poor widow Sylvester, fancying some-
thing could be done by speaking to Sir
John for her son, or at any rate wishing to
be near him as long as possible, was going
np to the park with him, and she took
Fanny with her, after she had exchanged
a few words with Mr. Elliot, who was anx-
ious to keep Ben quietly with him that
night, as he certainly could not at present
walk back, and as Mr. Spearman said that
a bad illness might be brought on if he
were much agitated, or kept in such noise
and confusion as were sure to prevail at
home.
Ben was so much better, when all the
bustle in the street had drifted off, and he
had been kept very still for more than an
hour, that he was able to sit up and enjoy
his tea with Mr. Elliot; and then he, beg-
ged to know exactly how it had been, and
why poor Harry should have been chosen
out to be suspected.
Mr. Elliot had not seen all the proceed-

ings, but he told Ben what he had gath-
ered.
When Fanny's cries had called the vil-
lage that morning, there had been a rush
to poor old Mrs. Walcot's. Ben had been
picked up insensible in the yard, the back-
door was found broken open, and the
down-stairs room in great confusion, as if
there had been a search for her money.
Above stairs she lay at the door of her bed-
room, murdered by terrific blows on the
skull; it was thought that the robbers had
tried at first to tie her hands and to gag
her, but that she had struggled so hard in
defence of her property, that they had end-
ed by making their crime murder. How
little had Ben or she thought when she or-
dered him away, and said he made such a
work that the pig could not rest, that her
next words would be spoken in the death
struggle! Nay, a very little more force,
and what would have Ben's youth and
health availed him? Mr. Spearman quite

thought from the appearance of the blow,
that it had been given with intent to kill,
and that he had had a narrow escape.
Surely there never was a moment when we
do not need to watch; and. as the history
of that strange day thrilled back again
over the lad, how could he help remem-
bering the morning's prayer, to be defend-
ed in all dangers and adversities. He had
been defended; he wondered whether he
could venture to beg Mr. Elliot to tell him
how to thank God, and how to ask for Har-
ry's safety.
But how could they suspect Harry, poor
kind-hearted Harry, who was so kind to
mother and Fanny, and had thrashed Tom
Bateman only for beating his dog—Harry,
who would not steal so much as an egg for
all the world.
Mr. Elliot could only tell him that Jacob
and Harry had been together at the fair
yesterday, both drinking and fighting, and
when the police had interfered, they had

assaulted them, but had got clear off, as it
now appeared, to a public-house, where all
the worst characters used to meet. There
both had been found this morning, evi-
dently trafficking with the landlord, a re-
ceiver of stolen goods, to dispose of an old
watch and other things that were believed
to have belonged to old Mr. Walcot.
"Yes, Harry would be with Jacob,"
said Ben; "he would never know what he
had done. But why can't the man at the
lodging-house say that poor Harry slept
there all night?"
"Unfortunately, he swears they both did,
and he is such a character, that no one can
believe him on oath. It is a terrible effect
of keeping bad company, that your brother
has fallen into this trouble; but cheer up,
Ben, if he is innocent, depend on it Heaven
will bring the truth to light."
"If they will believe me 1 If I could
but have seen the man to say what he was
like!"
"Look here, Ben," said his master, "don't

rack that poor broken head to-night, but
to-morrow try and get a clear remembrance
of what you did see. Then make up your
mind to tell the straightforward truth,
neither more nor less, and trust it all to
the justice of Him who knows the truth.
Now, I won't have you talk a bit more to-
night, you shall go to bed; I shall read
you my chapter of the Bible, and then we'll
say a prayer for your poor brother, and a
bit of thanksgiving for your safety."
Just what Ben felt to be most comfort-
ing, though he would have been too shy
to ask to be helped.
That day had taught Baronsbridge the
meaning of the petition against murder and
sudden death. It may be that such things
are permitted, by God's good Providence,
to happen from time to time, that we may
be taught that we are safe by His care
hedging us round about, and that we should
put more trust in prayer for His keeping
than in locks, and bolts, and bars, and
watchers by night.

64: BEN SYLVESTEE'S W0ED.
There are some who have lain down to
sleep unarmed in the midst of cannibal
savages, and have risen up safe, for the
Lord sustained them. There are some who
have gone to rest in their own beds, guard-
ed and locked in, with their treasure around
them, and wakened only to perish by vio-
lence. "Except the Lord keep the city,
the watchman waketh but in vain."
But let there be no judging of such as
meet with such a fate. To some, no doubt,
it is a blessed opening of eternal life; and
let us bear in mind what was said of those
on whom the tower of Siloara fell.
CHAPTEE V.
THE BEOODING CLOUD.
""What skulls country boys have!" said
Mr. Elliot to himself. "This boy, whom I
was expecting to see in a high fever, here

he is, as sound as if nothing had happened;
and as to the devastation he makes in my
loaf—not that I grudge it to him, poor fel-
low, nor think he does not feel, but to think
of such an appetite after all he went through
yesterday!"
After a few hours of restlessness in the
early part of the night, sleep had come as
a friend to Ben, and he had wakened late
in the morning, with a huge swelling and
some pain, over his eye, but otherwise with
all yesterday's ailments repaired. There
was that, however, which could not be re-
paired, and which the poor boy would fain
have thought a dream, but it would come
out before his mind ever more distinctly,
that his poor old mistress lay murdered,
and that Harry was in prison.
He looked out of the window, and it
seemed a wonder that the sunshine should
play on the elm-trees, and the furze look
golden on the heath, and little children's
voices sound as merry as usual when every-

thing was so different with himself—when
Harry was shut up from all, and, above all,
when on that waste so dreadful a deed had
been done. When he was dressed, he
wanted to go home at once, but Mr. Elliot
made him wait to have his breakfast; and
whilst he was eating it so heartily, for he
was very hungry, Mrs. Sylvester herself
came to see for him, with Fanny.
Poor Betty Sylvester looked very hag-
gard and wretched, and said that she had
not slept a wink all night for thinking of
her poor boy. She was sure it was a wick-
ed shame that he should be took off that
way, he that would not hurt a fly, and nev-
er stole nothing, it was all the spite of that
policeman—the policemen always had a
spite against her sons, every one of them,
and all the village was against them, and
now they would swear away her poor Har-
ry's life, that was as innocent as a dove.
Mr. Elliot was as sorry as man could be
for her, and tried to comfort her and soften

THE BROODING CLOUD. 67
her a little, by showing her that all the
world was not her boy's enemy; but she
took defence of the authorities as an attack
on Harry, and was so angry that she quite
forgot all that he had been doing for Ben,
and began quite to scold and storm, so that
he could hardly have borne it if he had not
looked on it as one of the poor woman's
ways of giving vent to her distress. As it
was, he was obliged to give her a hint that
his boys were coming to school, and this
she took as another offence, and bounced
out of the house, saying that she was a
poor lone widow, and everybody turned
against her because her son was in trouble.
Ben had stood by all the time with his
eyes on the ground, too shy and awkward
to do anything to check it, but very miser-
able that it should go on. He could only
look up at Mr. Elliot when it was over, and
say " Thank you, Sir; thank you. Mother
is in such a way, she don't know what she
is saying."

"Poor thing—yes, I see," said Mr. El-
liot, kindly. "You keep quiet to-day, my
boy, and I'll see you soon again."
"Thank you, Sir," and Een went away,
hastening after his mother, who was going
home the long way by the lane and church-
yard, for Fanny was afraid to go near the
scene of yesterday's event, willing to avoid
the looks of the boys who were gathering
round the school. They were quieter and
more subdued than usual, for there seemed
an awe and a hush in the air of Barons-
bridge that day; but Ben felt as if he were
marked and cut off from every one.
"O mother, how could you," he said, as
he came up with her, "when Mr. Elliot
treated me so kind?"
"Well, my lad, 111 be bound that he'll
never heed. He'll not cast up to me what
I say when my poor boy is in such trouble."
She began to cry again, and they talked
about Harry, and Ben heard what he much
wanted to know, how they had parted

with him after Sir John Heneage had
made out the committal.
It seemed that poor Harry had held out
pretty bravely till the last moment came,
when he had to take leave of his mother
and Fanny, and then he had cried like a
child, and hugged Fanny up in his arms
as if he would never let her go, and made
her promise to write to him, (she was the
only one who could write at all,) and tell
him how Ben was; and he had sent his
love to Ben, and bade him never believe
that he could have lifted a hand against
the poor old lady, far less looked on while
that villain gave him such a knock.
Ben buret out crying then, when he
heard this message, and how much Harry
had taken his hurt to heart.
Jacob Long had managed to speak a few
words to Betty Sylvester. Prison was no
new thing to him, and he was quite on his
guard, and knew how to combat suspicion
and make a defence. He was a lone man,

belonging to no one but some cousins, who
had long since given him up as a disgrace,
and he had no one to feel or care for but
himself, so that he was quite cool and col-
lected.
"Cheer up, Mrs. iSylvester," he had
said. "Never fear; I'll bring Harry off
clear, I'll promise you*. We're both in the
same boat, and I've bothered the lawyers
before now. There's honest Irish Tim will
swear us both an alibi, for we both slept
at his house, d'ye see, keeping close after
that there row with the police. Only you
must stop your youngster's mouth; there's
no harm done yet, for he was so dazed,
that they could not put him on oath, nor
take his evidence, and if he was knocked
down at once, he had no time to know one
man from another; so tell him I was not
there at all, and that he must put that fan-
cy out of his head, or I'll never bring his
brother off. One of us can't be saved
without the other."


## p. 71 (#79) ##############################################

THE BROODING CLOUD.' 71
In truth Jacob had persuaded Betty to
believe him as incapable of the crime as
her own son, and she was so much in the
belief of his innocence, that she made Ben
think the same, and remember how little
time he had had for observing any one. A
man who had so often smoked his pipe at
their own fire, and who had shown him so
much good-nature—the mind started back
from thinking him guilty of so black a
crime. It was easier to think his own eyes
mistaken.
Mrs. Sylvester went on to add further
particulars of the inquest. She had been
over the house, and had all sorts of horrible
things to tell, in which she seemed to take
a sort of dreadful interest, as if they drew
her off from her troubles. "The poor old
woman's mouth was tied up," she said,
"as if they had tried first to gag her; and,
would you believe it, 'twas with one of the
very red boxing handkerchiefs such as our
Harry bought for the fair."


## p. 72 (#80) ##############################################

72 ben sylvester's word.
Ben started, and exclaimed, " Oh! that
will go against poor Harry!"
"No such thing," said his mother angrily.
"All the idle chaps in the country were
buying them, as I told them when they
held the thing up, and asked if any one
could 'dentify it. Pretty thing, wanting a
mother to hang her own son!"
"I could have told our Harry's handker-
chief among a hundred," said Fanny, "be-
cause of the tear in it, but mother held
me, and would not let me speak or look
close."
"A fine business if you had, child," said
her mother, " so mind what you are about
when it comes to the trial, both of you.
Bless me, my poor Harry, what would his
poor father have said if he had known it
would come to this!"
"If one looked, one might say for cer-
tain it was not Harry's," said Ben.
"You can say that as well without look-
ing too sharp," said his mother. "No, no,

73
I wouldn't be for asking neither of you to
go again an oath, but it is no use knowing
more nor you do know, special with folks
as takes one up so sharp."
Ben held his tongue, and they came
home.
It was very dreary all day. People who
are not religious when they are in no par-
ticular trouble, know not whither to turn
for peace or support when the time of sor-
row comes; and poor Mrs. Sylvester could
do nothing but bewail and lament herself,
much as she had done when Stephen went
for a soldier, sometimes crying over Har-
ry's danger and disgrace, sometimes over
what was to become of them all: she
should lose Mrs. Martin's washing, Ben
had lost his place, and they should all come
to the Union. Or she changed from pity-
ing Jacob as ill-used and falsely persecuted,
to abusing him as the ruin of her son. If
she were quieted a little when they were
alone, a neighbour coming in would set it

all off again, and Ben, with his aching
head, sat on a stool on the empty hearth,
feeling as if he could not bear it, and yet
without spirit to get up or move out of the
way; and what cut him to the heart was,
that he could see that, though they pitied
his mother, they thought one as bad as
the other, till he grew quite angry in him-
self.
Mr. Conroy came in, and was very kind
and gentle af first. He wanted to teach
her how to turn her trouble to good; he
talked to her about the lesson that this
peril might be to Harry, and how blessings
might come out of evil; but when he
found that she would only abuse every-
thing and everybody, he told her plainly
that was not the way to take the affliction
that God sent to her, and that rather than
speak ill of others, she ought to think
whether she had not led to this misfortune
by never restraining her sons from bad
habits and bad company.


## p. 75 (#83) ##############################################

THE BBOODING CLOUD. 75
She could not fly out with him, but she
cried passionately, and talked of how she
had worked, and toiled, and slaved.
"Yes, Mrs. Sylvester, you may have
been a good mother to their bodies, but
what have you done for their souls?"
Mr. Conroy had not intended to blame
her before her children, nor on this day of
sorrow, but she had forced him into doing
so; and not to seem harsh, he turned to
Ben and Fanny, and told them that they
must set themselves to be a comfort to her.
He told Fanny that he hoped that she
would not stay away from school, for the
girls would all be kind to her, and he
asked kindly after Ben's head, and told his
mother that he thought him a brave, faith-
ful boy; and then Ben, who felt that they
were doing him more credit than he de-
served, bluntly came out with his explana-
tion, that he only thought of the pig, and
had no notion of danger.
"That's right, Ben," said Mr. Conroy,


## p. 76 (#84) ##############################################

76 ben Sylvester's word.
"stick to the exact truth. Depend on it
that will be by far the best hope for your
brother. Good day."
Mrs. Sylvester said that all gentlefolks
hung together, and the parson was hard;
but his visit had cheered up Ben a good
deal, and made him feel alive enough to
avoid a woman who was coming in, a"nd
wander off into the copse. By-and-by, he
found himself, by force of habit, at the
stile before the waste, where Fanny had
first seen the two ruffians. He stood lean-
ing and looking over, and it all came up be-
fore his mind as it had never done before
—he seemed to see the men over again—
he could not doubt for one instant that it
had been Jacob Long's shaggy eyebrows,
round shoulders, and dragging walk—but
of the other his glance had been so momen-
tary, that all he could tell, besides the ab-
solute certainty that he had never seen him
before, was that he was a younger, darker,

slighter man, which, alas! would sound like
a description of Harry.
And that handkerchief! He wished his
mother would have looked to make sure;
it frightened him that she should be so
afraid to see it closely, and yet there were
many like it, and he never for one moment
c«ld suspect that the person who had
struck him could be Harry.
He found himself losing his way in a
maze of difficulty, and he laid his head
down on the stile, and shut his eyes. Pres-
ently, something heavy trod close to him,
and touched him. It was poor old Jack,
the pony. Ben put his arms on his rough
neck, and petted him, and cried as he
thought of the drive home but two days
ago, and the poor pig of which he had
thought so much. Mrs. Walcot's niece
had taken possession of the creatures, and
Ben felt that she would not bear that any
one named Sylvester should come near;

so he could only pull bunches of sweet
grass out of the hedge for the wandering
horse.
His mother was better when he went in.
She had received a rough message by a la-
bourer going home, that she was to come
to work as usual at Farmer Martin's, and
this took off the present care for their
ing.
The next time Mr. Conroy saw Ben ly-
ing listlessly under a hedge, he asked him
if he were fit for work, and sent him to the
glebe hay-making, where hard work was a
great relief, and the old women were very
good-natured to him. Fanny went to
school as usual, and so did Ben on Sunday,
but it was all as if they were living under
the shadow of a great thunder-cloud. If
Fanny could forget, Ben never could.
The Sylvesters were all capital crick-
eters, and once when he was crossing the
common the boys shouted to him to take
a bat. He did so, and sent the ball flying

through the air, but as their cry of admi-
ration arose he missed Harry's cheer, he
thought of him in his bare cell, felt sick-
ened as if he had been striking him instead
of the ball, and turned away without an-
swering the good-natured lads who crowded
round him.
Winston was too far distant for any going
backwards and forwards to see the prisoner.
Fanny wrote her letter, all up and down
in wavy writing, and bad spelling, and the
contents were much more what she knew
how to say than what Ben or his mother
wanted her to say, so that Ben did not feel
at all sure that it would bring much com-
fort to poor Harry. But he heartily wished
he could have done even as much as Fan-
ny, and began to practise a's and b's on
her slate, and think about the evening
school. Mr. Conroy told them that he
heard from the chaplain of the gaol good
accounts of Harry's state of mind, that he
was humble, and semed to feel what was

said to him; but Mrs. Sylvester, poor silly
woman, did not seem to trust to what the
gentleman said, and was perhaps more
hurt than consoled by Mr. Conroy's always
telling her that good was sure to come out
of evil if made a right use of.
Let not those who have no temptation,
who live with those who regard falsehood
as a great crime, and perjury as one almost
beyond mention or possibility, look upon
poor Ben Sylvester as a lost and wicked
wretch, if he were grievously tossed about
in mind during that month before the
Winston assizes.
He had not long been striving for truth
and sincerity on his own account, and those
among whom his lot was cast treated his
candour rather as a troublesome scruple or
fancy of his own, than as a duty incumbent
on any one. They would not believe or
notice the tremendous judgments in Holy
Scripture against lying, nor imagine that
they could apply to what, as they fancied,

THE BROODING CLOUD. 81
"did no one any harm ;" or rather they
were too much taken up in the present
ever to heed the store that was laying up
in the future.
An oath had, indeed, terrors in their
eyes. As Mrs. Sylvester often said, she
would never go for to swear falsely, and
Ben never once thought of deliberately
committing such dreadful wickedness. But
there were shades. Perhaps he might be
'thought too young and ignorant to be sworn,
and in that case he fancied that he might
feel more free; and he might make some
stupid answer that would prevent them
from administering the oath. Or again,
he could work himself into a persuasion
that the time had been too short to
recognise either of the murderers, and
that it could not be wrong, nay, that it
would be right and kind by Jacob, to make
the worst of any doubt on that score. For
his word to be the death of a man, and
that man an old friend, seemed worse than

82 ben Sylvester's word.
a little prevarication—no direct falsehood.
Besides a sort of affection and strong pity
for Jacob, Ben was much afraid of making
him desert his brother. The Sylvesters had
all the utmost reliance on Jacob Long's
cunning and ingenuity. Stories of his
marvellous cleverness in baffling keepers
and disposing of game, or puzzling magis-
trates, had been often the amusement of
the fireside, and Ben had been in the way
of thinking that no scrape was too bad for
him to get out of, or to save others from; so
that he thought that Jacob, if not offended,
would be almost certain to bring Harry off
clear, as he promised, and as Mrs. Sylves-
ter, when most hopeful, declared that he
would by the help of the alibi.
And the more Ben saw the village treat
it as a certainty that both prisoners were
equally guilty, the more he distrusted his
own senses, and thought them equally in-
nocent. Suppose he were to speak simply
according to his own knowledge and belief,

83
as conscience always returned to say he
ought to do, Jacob would give up Harry,
his word would be disregarded, circumstan-
ces would be too strong, they would be
convicted, and—Ben only wished he could
be hidden a hundred feet underground, and
never see his mother again.
The schoolmaster and the clergyman
were not aware of half his temptation, for
they had never heard of Long's message,
nor did they guess at Ben's faith in him.
All they could do was to treat the boy in
a sort of kind, considerate way, that made
him feel that they fully trusted his truth.
And what they did by their prayers, who
can tell?
Saying his prayers for his brother was
the one thing Ben could do with all his
heart; but then in the midst would come
flashes that he could not ask for help and
protection for his brother, if he were going
to do what he knew to be so shameful and
displeasing to God in his behalf. No, he

could not pray for Harry till he had thrown
aside all the shallow puzzles with which he
had tried to mystify himself, and brought
himself back to the purpose of holding fast
by truth.
"Look here, Ben," said Fanny, "I did
not notice it before, but we really do pray
at church for Harry. See, it says, for all
prisoners and captives."
Fanny was so glad of the discovery, that
she showed it to her mother in her Prayer-
Book, and even begged her to come to
church; but Mrs. Sylvester said she could
go nowhere, she had no clothes, and could
not go out because of her trouble, and she
sat miserable and broken down in the
bitterness of her heart by her dismal fire-
side.
Ben's restlessness at church was over
now. He did not always understand, but
sorrow and suspense had opened to him
the meaning of many and many a sentence
and petition that had floated past on va-
cant ears.

Sometimes he thought things were read
on purpose for him. Once it was,
"Fear not them that can kill the body,
and after that have no more that they can
do; but I will forewarn you whom ye shall
fear. Fear Him that hath power to cast
body and soul into hell, yea, I say unto
you, fear Him."
Ben's flesh seemed to creep as he heard
this.
And then another time there came the
Psalm that told him "Who had seen it,
who beholdeth ungodliness and'wrong.
That Thou mayest take the matter into
Thine Hand, the poor committeth himself
unto Thee, for Thou art the Helper of the
friendless."
"Friendless, indeed," thought Ben.
"Yes, commit the matter to God. Surely
He would be a better helper thau Jacob
Long."
And on the last Sunday, Mr. Conroy's
sermon was on the text, "The Lord shall

fight for you, and ye shall hold your
peace."
He said that the way to be helped was
to abide still, and put our trust, and the
way to put our trust was to do nothing
wrong in our own behalf. The instant that
was done, we declared that we wanted to
help ourselves, not for God to help us. If
we would only stand still, though the sea
were before, and the enemy behind, yet
He would find deliverance, and the peril
we had feared we should see no more for
ever. It would come true, he said, in this
world, or in the next.
Ben did not hear much more, that little
seemed to fill up his mind, and be spoken
for him. To try to falter or hide would be
fighting for himself. There was One who
knew the truth, and was able to guard
Harry.
Mr. Elliot took a walk down Barony
Park that Sunday evening, and found Ben
lying under a tree. He sat down by him,

and told him a beautiful and true history
of a young Scottish woman who was put
to a harder test than he was likely to have
to endure, for she had to bear direct wit-
ness against her own sister, when one word
would have cleared her; but who feared her
God so much more than even death for her
sister, that she refused to say that one word
in transgression of truth.
Her sister was convicted, and sentenced,
but—Ben looked up eagerly—she did not
die. The brave Helen Walker went on
foot from Edinburgh to London, and gain-
ed her pardon from Queen Caroline.
"So you see, Ben," said Mr. Elliot, who
was likewise thinking of the sermon, "God
Almighty can save without man doing
wrong. If we only fight on His side, not
against Him, He will find a way."

CHAPTEE VI.
THE WINSTON ASSIZES.
The Winston assizes were drawing on,
and "Benjamin and Frances Sylvester"
had both been long ago bound over to ap-
pear as witnesses. Their mother had been
in many minds about going with them, but
the want of money and of clothes, and a
grand wash at Farmer Martin's, settled the
matter. Mr. Obnroy would not forward
her going, he thought her children better
without her, and if there were need, she
could be sent to see her son later.
The village policeman was a kind per-
son, and quite fit to take charge of Ben
and Fanny, and he promised to put the little
girl under safe keeping if it should be neces-
sary for her to sleep at Winston. He was
very patient in waiting with his cart in the
rain for the leave-taking, when Mrs. Syl-
vester gave them many messages for poor

Harry, but really parted from them more
cheerfully than could have been hoped,
she was so taken up with packing Fanny
up in the cart, and telling her not to get
her clothes wet through.
"Look out what you say," she ended,
"and you'll bring him back to me again."
"Ay, look out what you say," comment-
ed the policeman, as he drove off; "many
an innocent party has been convicted be-
cause his friends could not bear to trust
the plain truth, if they thought it told
against him."
They drove about five miles in the cart,
and then got upon the railway. Fanny
could not help being interested and amused
by so much that was new, and the police-
man was very kind to her.
They came to the town, and were taken
up to the court to wait their turn; and
early in the afternoon the trial came on,
and Ben, as having been the first on the
spot, was the witness first summoned.

All had been too strange and new for
Ben to have mnch opportunity of thinking
or recollecting himself, but when the call
came for Benjamin Sylvester, and the
policeman made Fanny let go his hand,
and thrust him forward, all the thoughts,
doubts, and resolutions of the last month
seemed to come over him in one wild rush,
and with a sort of prayer for safety for
Harry, came the other thought that he
could not pray, and yet call on that awful
Witness to hear aught but the full truth.
All this passed in the few moments that
he was walking up a narrow passage. He
came out into a sort of door-way. Ho
knew it was the witness-box, for there was
the judge in his red robes and great wig
opposite, and all the lawyers in wigs and
black gowns around a green table below,
and the twelve jurymen, and crowds and
crowds of people on benches raised in gal-
leries around; but Ben neither saw nor
cared how they gazed at him, for some lit-

tie way from him was another place railed
in, and there stood Jacob Long and his own
poor Harry.
Long did not look different" from usual,
hard and knowing, just like himself, and
he gave Ben a wink as much as to say,
"Mind you, and I'll manage." But Harry
looked quite altered, as if the hard, clean,
cold, lonely prison had been a heavy pun-
ishment to him already. He stood in a
downcast slouching way, without his natu-
ral spirited bearing, and his hair that used to
fly about in rough wavy tangles, was sleek-
ed close down to his head. He just glanc-
ed up for a moment when Ben came in,
but turned his eye down to the ground
again directly, and Ben shook and trembled
at the thought of what was laid on him.
A man in a desk close before the witness-
box turned towards him with the book, but
though Ben was a tall boy in Baronsbridge
school, he looked very young and little
there, and the judge made a sign to wait.

Then he looked at Ben, and the look was
gentle, though so solemn, and the voice in
which he spoke to him was both grave and
kind, and the boy had a feeling, as he
afterwards said, like being in church, so
that, though awe-struck, he was less trem-
bling and confused, especially as the ques-
tion was not dreadful.
"Your name is Benjamin Sylvester?"
"Yes, my Lord."
"How old are you?"
"Nigh upon thirteen."
"Have you been at school?"
"At the Sunday-school, my Lord."
"Have you been taught what it is to
take an oath?"
Slowly and reverently Ben said the com-
mandment—" Thou shalt not take the
Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
His Name in vain."
The judge made a sign that he was satis-

fied, and the words were then spoken to
the boy, with his hand on the four Gospels.
"The evidence you shall give, before
the court and jury sworn, between our
Sovereign Lady the Queen and the prison-
ers at the bar, shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth. So help
you God." ,
Ben needed not to have gone through
all that self-debate; he felt that after that
awful pledge, even had he wished it, he
could not have answered other than the
clear, full, simple truth to the best of his
belief.
One of the lawyers stood up to question
him. This was the counsel for the crown,
whose business it was to make out the
guilt of the prisoners. He began by ask-
ing Ben if he had known the deceased,
Harriet Walcot?
"Yes, Sir."
"You were in her employment?"

94 ben sylvester's word.
"I minded the cow, and pony, and pig,
Sir."
"Do you remember the morning of the
thirteenth of June last?"
"Yes, Sir." No fear of his not remem-
bering it.
And the lawyer drew out how he had
gone out with his sister in the early morn-
ing before the sun was up. Was it usual
with him to go to his work at half-past
three in the morning %
"No, Sir, I went to see if the new pig
was easy in his sty."
It was very strange to Ben that some of
the people seemed to smile, but those who
belonged to his own country thought noth-
ing more natural than getting up for the
sake of a pig.
The questioning went on as to when he
had first seen anything unusual, and what
he had seen. "I saw two men near the
back door," he said. "I sent my sister to
call help out of the village, and ran on
myself."


## p. 95 (#103) #############################################

THE WINSTON ASSIZES.

Then again when asked why he was not
afraid to do so, the people smiled at his
answer. "I never thought they'd hurt
me, I thought for the pig."
"Why did you not expect to be in-
jured?"
"I don't know, Sir," said Ben; "I never
thought on such a thing."
"Were you near enough to see who they
were?"
"No, not when I set off running."
Ben began to feel that shrewd hard eye
of Jacob Long upon him, but the pledge
he had taken bound his tongue beyond
any notion of faltering, and he went on
with the history of meeting the two full in
the yard.
"Whom did you meet?"
"Him," said Ben, half turning aside.
"Him there, Jacob Long."
When it was said, the worst was done.
He could stand more upright, and breathe
more freely, for his part was taken. The

next question was, "Who was with
Long?"
"I did not know him," said Ben. O
would they believe? Here were stern
searching looks bent upon him on all sides,
and the lawyer began to ask for a descrip-
tion of this man, asking about his height,
dress, and so on.
Ben said he was tall, slight, dark, and
had a fustian coat. More he did not know,
but he was sure that it was this person who
had struck him down. Again he was ask-
ed if he were sure on his oath that he did
not see the person in court? He was quite
sure, and he raised his face frankly, though
imploringly, as he repeated, "It was no
one as I ever saw before, or since."
His being struck seemed to be the end of
his story, but they would not let him go yet.
The lawyer wanted to hear whether Mrs.
Walcot was supposed to have money, and
whether it had been much spoken of, and
whether it had been mentioned before the

prisoners. This was much worse than Ben
had expected, to have to say yes to all this,
and to be asked what Long had said, and
what his brother had answered. The only
comfort was that Harry's part had been no
worse, but it was bad enough, and he felt
not only that he was destroying him, but
that Harry was hating him for it. Next
he had to reply that his brother had not
slept at home that night, and then came
the dreaded handkerchief. They gave it
to him with the side uppermost, where he
could not help seeing the well-known, ill-
mended rent. How it could ever have got
there he knew not, but that it was the
handkerchief there was no doubting, no
denying. "It is my brother Henry's," he
said, with a great sob rising up and hardly
kept down; and it seemed doubly hard and
cruel in those law-gentlemen to insist on
his going on to say how and why he
knew it was his brother's. It seemed to
be driving in the death-blow harder and

harder. They also showed him a watch
and some spoons, but these he had never
seen before, and could tell nothing about
them, for his mistress kept everything lock-
ed tip out of sight.
He hoped it was over, for this gentleman
sat down, as if he had done enough with
him, but then another rose up. He was
appointed to manage the defence of the
prisoners, and as he wanted to clear them
both, his examination was even more try-
ing to Ben, for he wanted to know how
Ben came to know Jacob Long so well,
and how long he had had to look at the
thieves, and why he should be sure of one
and not of the other, to all of which Ben
could only answer the mere truth, that he
had known Long too well to be mistaken
in him, and that he had had full time to see
that the other man was a stranger. The
lawyer seemed inclined to tease his answers
into something absurd, but the judge put
a stop to this, and Ben was sent down,

while "Frances Sylvester" was called
for. .
Ben just met poor little Fanny, and she
wanted to cling to him, and for him to go
back with her; but this was not allowed,
and his friend, the policeman, showed him
into one of the galleries by the side, where
he could see.
• "You've given your evidence like a
man," whispered the policeman, " and if it
depended on me, it would bring off your
brother, but that handkerchief has an ugly
look."
"However did it get there ?" sighed Ben.
There was no more time for speaking,
for the policeman had to go away, and his
attention was taken up by poor little Fanny
appearing in the witness-box, looking sadly
scared, and hardly able to keep herself
from crying at the sight of Harry, who
turned as much from her as he could, and
would not look at her.
They did not put her on oath, and they

all were very kind and gentle with her,
when they saw how small and childish she
was, but it was of no use. She was so ex-
ceedingly frightened at being spoken to
by the gentlemen in grey wigs and black
gowns, that at first she stood and stared,
and when she did answer, it was in a voice
that nobody could hear—her school voice,
when she did not know what she was going
to say. She had seemed to think of it so
little beforehand, that Ben had not thought
of her being so much afraid, and was sur-
prised as well as very sorry for her.
They could not make much of her; in
fact all that she was wanted for was to
confirm Ben's account of the two men,
and to identify the handkerchief, but that,
poor child, quite overcame her. She had
heard more about it than she understood;
her mother had scolded her for wanting to
own it before, and she fancied that all Har-
ry's danger was her fault in having allowed
the tear to be made. When it was shown

THE WINSTON ASSIZES. 101
to her, she burst into a great fit of cry-
ing, and held her hands before her eyes;
and when they pressed her, it came at
last to a most piteous "Mother said I
shouldn't look."
Ben felt as if he could have knocked
down the people who began to laugh, but
there were more who whispered "poor
child ;" and Fanny was led away, and in
another minute was placedbeside him,where
a fat, kind old housekeeper-looking person
made room for her, called her "poor little
dear," and gave her gooseberries and sweet
biscuits out of her basket. Ben wondered
at her for being able to eat them.
The policeman had come in by this time
to tell the terrible history of how the poor
old woman's corpse had been found, and
the ransacking of her house, and how on
Benjamin Sylvester's wandering words he
had set out in pursuit with other policemen,
and had gone to the noted haunts of Jacob
Long, the lodging-house at Aldringham,

where, coming suddenly into an inner room,
he had found the two prisoners and the
landlord, Timothy Conolly, trying to con-
ceal a silver watch, some silv.er spoons, and
some money. He bore witness to their
both having declared themselves innocent,
and the younger having believed he was
arrested for the assault on the police at the
fair. He described, as if he had specially
noted it, the exclamation that Harry had
made at the inquest on seeing how his
brother had been maltreated.
Mr. Spearman was the next witness, ex-
plaining how and why the blows must have
produced death, telling the same 6tory of
the appearance of the cottage, and describ-
ing Ben's own condition, and whether his
words were to be trusted when he first
spoke of Long.
Afterwards they called in Mr. Hawker,
who positively swore to the watch having
belonged to old Master "Walcot; and now
Ben saw that it would have been worse

than vain to shuffle about owning the hand-
kerchief, for Mrs. Hawker, having washed
it after the rent, knew it far too well to be
mistaken.
Another witness appeared in the person of
the man who bad sold the pig the day before,
and who knew he had given her change in
a French franc instead of a shilling, and
this franc was found among the money that
the prisoners seemed to have been sharing.
That was the case for the prosecution;
then came the defence. Timothy Conolly,
the master of the Jolly Yeoman, was call-
ed, and declared that both prisoners came
to his house at eight o'clock at night, and
had been sleeping there the whole night,
and were but just up in the morning when
the police came and seized them. That they
had come in by the back way, and kept
close on account of the affair with the po-
lice, and that Jacob Long, intending to
elude pursuit by going to America, had been
proposing to him to turn into money a

watch and some plate that he had lately
inherited from an old uncle. So bold and
clear was the statement of this wicked man,
that Ben began to believe it himself, well as
he knew that Long had had no such legacy;
and as to the handkerchief, that was ac-
counted for by one of the other guests hav-
ing taken Harry's by mistake; a dirty old
plaid neck-cloth was produced as having
been left in exchange, and Ben began to
breathe more freely. He had never thought
of such a chance as that.
Up rose the counsel for the crown to
cross-examine Conolly, and very sharply
he did so, trying to make him contradict
himself, and putting searching questions
about the watch, and this relation of Long's,
and as to the person who exchanged hand-
kerchiefs with Sylvester; but On neither
head did Irish Tim leave any loop-hole for
detection, and his evidence was much more
consistent as a whole than Ben's had been.
It is easy to invent consistently, but when

only a bit here and a bit there of the truth
are to be seen, they often do not seem to
agree, and coaxing them to force them into
matching is the worst thing that can be
done.
Irish Tim's man confirmed every word
that he had said with equal boldness, but
he made some blunders about the man to
whom the plaid neck-cloth had belonged,
and broke down in the cross-examination,
contradicting himself and his master, so
that at last people began to laugh—the
people who came to the trial only as a sight.
The counsel for the crown began to tell
the jury exactly how it must have happen-
ed, tracing every step of the murder exactly
as if he had seen it, from the first discus-
sion of the old woman's hoarded riches,
and making nothing of all the contrary evi-
dence, showing that Conolly and his man
were certainly perjuring themselves; and
as for the young brother's testimony, he
had had barely time to recognize either

of the individuals concerned, and the
momentary glimpse, and natural repug-
nance to imagine so near a relative
concerned in such an atrocious action, were
quite sufficient to account for his failing to
perceive his brother in so brief an interval.
Altogether, the barrister made it frightfully
plain that the crime could have been com-
mitted by no one but the two defendants,
and Fanny thought him a cruel man, and
Ben's heart sank, and he was expecting to
hear the jury say guilty, when up rose the
other lawyer, whom Ben considered as a
friend of Jacob. To Ben's mind, he made
it just as certain that neither of the pris-
oners could possibly have been near the
place—that Ben himself had been in no
condition to be sure whom he saw—that
his having been struck down with evident-
ly murderous intent, proved that the rob-
bers were neither friends nor connexions—
that the neck-tie had been changed by
accident—the watch and plate belonged to

Long—and that no charge could be brought
home to either—and he said a great deal of
Sylvester's youthfulness, which Ben-thought
wonderfully kind. Surely those twelve
bluff farmers must take pity on that coun-
try lad of only seventeen, be convinced,
and acquit them both.
But he found there was more to come.
Hie lawyers had finished, but the judge
began to sum up, going over the testimony
without being for or against the prisoners;
and giving his view, in the manner that is
meant, when we entreat that our authori-
ties may " truly and indifferently minister
justice." It was his work to sift the evi-
dence, not to take any one's part, as the
counsel were bound to do. Now first did
Ben hear that any discrimination was made
between the two prisoners. The judge
showed that the full weight of evidence
bore against Jacob Long—the watch, the
shilling, the boy's vivid impression; where-
as there was nothing except the handker

chief to implicate Sylvester, and according
to the testimony of Conolly and his man,
the exchange had been accounted for by
darkness and haste. In this they had bet-
ter agreed than on other points. Besides,
there was the boy's express declaration
that the injury had been inflicted not by
Long, but by the stranger, and it would
have horribly exaggerated the youth's de-
pravity to suppose that he would strike so
savage a blow on his own brother, and leave
him to his fate; when, as had been proved,
some time was certain to elapse before pur-
suit from the village could become immi-
nent. Finally, he said the jury had to
decide whether the handkerchief of the
younger prisoner having been found on the
mouth of the deceased, should outweigh
the testimony of Benjamin Sylvester, that
he had never before seen the person who
struck him down on the morning of the
13th of June.
The jury went away. Ben and Fanny

held each other tighter and tighter, and
people turned to look at them, but Fanny
had so often fancied the moment come,
that she did not know when it had really
arrived.
The twelve were coming back, and the
foreman was standing forth.
"My Lord, we find a verdict of Guilty
against Jacob Long. Henry Sylvester we
find Not Guilty."
Ben could neither have spoken nor
breathed. Fanny only half understood,
even when the kind fat woman, in the joy
of her heart, put her arm around her, say-
ing, in a sobbing whisper, "There! there,
my dear! I declare I'm as glad as if he
was my own son."
"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man
shall his blood be shed; for in the Image
of God made He man." Our sovereigns

him that doeth evil; and the doom must be
spoken.

Mr. Conroy knew what would come, and
in the dread hush and pause, looked to see
whether he could remove the little girl at
least from the court, but the crowd was far
too close for this, and perhaps Fanny's feel-
ings were not formed nor awake enough to
enter into all that he thought of for her.
He could not bear it, and had really gone,
unable to look on at the condemnation of
one of his own flock.
The judge had put on his black cap, and
with an earnest exhortation to the unhappy
criminal to repent, and turn to the Infinite
Love that has forgiveness and atonement
for all such as can truly turn unto Him, he
spoke forth the sentence of death, decreed
alike by the law of God and of man.
Jacob Long stood as motionless as all
through the trial. Henry Sylvester had
scarcely moved till now, but as he heard
the sentence, the tears began to run down
his face, and his chest was swelling with
sobs.

The judge addressed a few words to him.
He told him to take the warning, the awful
warning, home in time. That, young as he
was, he had full time to begin afresh, and
turn from the paths whose tendency had
been so fearfully brought before him, and
he assured him that a strong religious prin-
ciple, and utter avoidance of temptation,
was the only means of being preserved
from these ways of death. He bade him
begin a fresh course, which might turn the
suffering he had undergone to be the bless-
ing of his life.
There was a touch of kindness in the
manner, and Harry looked up for one mo-
ment, and began to say, "Thank you, my
Lord," but the attempt failed, and covering
his face with his hands, he followed Jacob
Long, who was already moving from the
dock.

CHAPTER VII.
THE PRISONER SET FREE.
There was a confused noise, an exclaim-
ing, some people were crying, others talking,
the children's heads seemed to swim round
as Ben's did the first morning, and the fat
woman pushed them about for people
to look at and shake hands with. Their
own policeman's voice was a friendly sound,
and came to their relief, as he bent over
from the door, and as only policemen can
do without a disturbance, made way for
them, lifted Fanny over the heads and
shoulders of the people, and showed Ben
how to get out over the benches, then
squeezed them through the crowd.
"Well done, my man," he said to Ben,
"I thought your evidence would bring
him off, it was so downright and straight-
forward, as I advised you."
There was no space nor mind for answer-

ing as they pressed through the people,
and came at last through doors and pas-
sages into a clean, unfurnished, white-wash-
ed room. And there stood Harry, almost
as in a dream, not turning at their entrance
. till Fanny ran up and touched him. Then
he caught her up in his arms, and she clung
round his neck, and Ben and he then
squeezed hands together; but he still look-
ed restlessly about, and only said, "Let us
go, let us go home."
The policeman told him that he had the
care of the others, that a train would pass in
an hour's time, and the like, but Harry seem-
ed hardly to hear or heed; he repeated that
they must go, they would walk home.
Then the policeman wanted to keep Fanny,
to send her home with Mrs. Hawker, and
let the brothers go together; but Fanny
could not let go Harry's hand, and begged
to be with them, and Ben said he could
make out the way, so at last he yielded,
and they set out. Harry strode on, drag-

ging his sister along without looking at her,
as if his only desire were to get out of the
town, out of the way of the eyes that had
been bent on him all day. The town clock
pealed after them five o'clock as they
mounted the hill, and Winston lay behind
them. The thorn bushes and yews began
to lengthen their shadows in the hedges,
and the wide-swelling green downs looked
still and refreshing in the evening light.
Not a word did Harry speak till the
hedge came to an end, and there was open
down on each side of the road; and there
he turned aside, behind a grassy mound,
threw off his bundle, threw back his cap,
flung himself flat upon the turf, and fairly
wept aloud.
Fanny was frightened, Ben had long
been past understanding anything that day;
but presently Harry gathered himself up.
It was all Jacob—poor Jacob had shaken
hands with him, and wished him joy of
having got off, and this had overcome

Harry more than anything, and he felt wild
to be able to do something to save his life,
but he remembered that the judge had
said there was no hope, and he cried again.
"0> Harry!" cried Fanny, in distress,
"don't take on so, I thought to have been
all so glad if you came off safe. And
poor mother wants you so."
"Mother never came in to see me."
"No, she could not," said Ben; "she
has had to work desperate hard at Farmer
Martin's, but she is in a terrible way about
you. Come on, and we'll be the first to
bring her the news."
Harry half rose, shook himself, ran his
fingers through his hair and tossed it about,
as if trying to feel like the same man again,
but he could only heave a great deep sigh
as if there were a lump of lead not to be
got rid of, and said, " I thought I'd never
ha' seen poor mother again."
Then he let Fanny repeat " come on,"
and pull him up, and they went on over

the green down by the side of the road.
Presently he said to Ben, "You've got
quite well of the crack over the head that
fellow gave you?"
"Oh I yes, quite," said Ben, putting up
his hand to where the mark was likely to
remain with him for life.
"If he had killed you outright, I wonder
if they would still have said it was me,"
said Harry.
"Who do you think it was, Harry?"
said Fanny.
Harry screwed up his face as they had
known him do in old times.
"Then you know," said Ben.
"I've a pretty good guess," said Harry;
"at least I knows what chap that there
handkerchief belonged to, that he left with
me."
"Oh! Harry, and you never said!" ex-
claimed Fanny.
"What, d'ye think I'd be so mean as to
be getting another into the trouble I was

in myself? Besides, Jacob said the only
chance for us was to stand out that we
neither of us knew nothing about it; and
if we stood by one another, we should be
sure to get off."
"Do you think Jacob did it?" said
Fanny, very low.
"I didn't till I heard Ben and all on 'em
to-day," said Harry, "but then I put it
altogether, and—"
"Then you knew nothing about it," cried
Fanny.
"How should I?" said Harry, gruffly;
"d'ye think they'd make their plots for
killing and murdering with me?"
And Harry gave his account of the up-
roar at the fair, and the assault on the
police, which made Jacob, who thought
both he and Harry had been recognized,
decide on not going home that night. Ja-
cob had long had a plan of going off to
America, and he talked more of it as they
sat drinking that night, only he said he

wanted a good round sum to take him out,
and the owner of the plaid handkerchief
joined in the talk. He was a man whom
Harry had seen before at fairs or races as
an acquaintance of Jacob Long, who came
down from London; he was looked on as
very learned in all matters of sport, and in
very truth must have been a thorough pro-
fessed thief. No doubt he had been the
prime mover in the wicked project, but
Harry had known nothing of it; he had
drunk a good deal, and had ended by sleep-
ing, he knew not exactly where, wherever
the landlord had disposed of him. He
awoke while Jacob Long and the landlord
were chaffering over the stolen goods; he
was told the story about the uncle, and be- .
fore many minutes had passed the police
were making their entrance. The prac-
tised London knave had gone off with his
share of the spoil, the country rogue and
the simple unsuspecting boy were left to
meet the danger and suspicion.

"But you'll never go there again, Har-
ry," said his little sister.
"Never," said Harry, more gravely than
his brother and sister knew he could speak.
"I did not know as such wickedness was
in them. But the judge said true. I've
been a bad boy, and please God, I'll be a
better one."
There was something very touching in
his humble tone.
"I don't think one will ever have heart
for a lark again," said Ben.
"Not without—" Harry had nearly
broken down again.
There was not much more talk after that;
their spirits were tired and oppressed,
though they would have been much sur-
prised if they had been told so; and there
was nothing that so much relieved Harry
after his long imprisonment, as to go on
walking straight homewards in the calm of
the evening air, with his little sister's hand
fast clasped in his.

Fanny found out by-and-by that she was
hungry, as they came near a village; Har-
ry still shrank from strange faces, but Ben,
who had money, his wages as a witness,
should go to a shop and bring some bread
and cheese to eat as they went on.
Ben felt as if every one would be gazing
at him, and all would be talking of the
trial for murder and acquittal; but as he
entered the shop, and stood aside till the
people could serve him, he heard them all
going on with their own concerns, hay-
time and harvest, as if nobody ever had
been tried.
He paid for his bread; and when they
came outside the village, they sat down to
eat it by the side of a little clear stream, an
old pollard willow making seats with its
roots close by an old bridge, that was
doubled by the reflection in the water
into a 'whole circle, the sky deep blue
through it, and the shorn meadows with
long, quiet shadows over them, the rooks

cawing as they flew round and round, and
their polished black sides flashing silver in
the sun.
Harry sat some time with his elbows on
his knees, while the others were eating, and
then he said, "I didn't know how I liked
all them things I"
Fanny begged him to eat, and he said
he would; but first he went down on his
hands and knees, turned back his collar,
and splashed his face down into the clear
water, where the minnows were glancing be-
low, and the water-spiders careering above.
When he drew out his head, with his. curls
all rough and dripping, it was the first time
Fanny felt it was her own old Harry, and
not somebody different.
On, on. they went—the sun went down,
the last beam faded on the high, green hills,
the sky grew darker, and one star after
another came out, but still the three plod-
ded sturdily on in the summer twilight,

Aldringham." Fanny began to grow foot-
sore and weary-legged, but she had prom-
ised to hold out all the way, so she only
took to a short trot to ease her feet; and by
and-by her brothers found out that she was
panting, and Harry—big girl as she called
herself—took her up in his arms, and march-
ed boldly on, with her arm round his neck,
and her head on his shoulder.
Darker and darker it grew. There was
no reading the sign-posts now, but there
was the less need, for Harry had been here
once before, helping to drive home some
oxen, and he knew the turns. Places grew
more like their own neighbourhood, the
shape of the hills against the sky was famil-
iar, and at last the tall row of poplars on
the edge of Baronshill stood out above
them.
They saw the lights of Aldringham, but
turned aside to cross the path-meadows;
and the cool grass was comfortable to Ben's
weary, dusty feet; and Harry put down

Fanny after her rest, and swung about his
arms to refresh himself.
They wondered what o'clock it was;
Harry guessed between ten and eleven, and
questioned whether their mother would
have given them up and gone to bed. All
along the copse they went, crackling through
the overhanging boughs, and they stood in
the lane, and saw the gleam of candle-light
in the cottage window.
Fanny set off in a run, but then stopped,
as if afraid. There seemed to have been
ears listening for them, for the door was
opened, the light streamed out, and their
mother's voice called, in a half-crying, half-
glad key, "Well! so here you be 1 I
thought you'd never have been at home
to-night;" and then she clasped hold of
Harry, "My lad, my own lad, I knew they
could not have the heart to do anything
to you,"
After all, they would have been sooner
at home, if they had been content to wait

for the train. Mrs. Hawker had been down
full an hour before with the tidings of Har-
ry's acquittal, and Mrs. Sylvester, who had
been washing and crying by fits all through
this terrible day, had ever since been watch-
ing for them, and tidying as she had had
no heart to do for the last month.
They were quiet enough about the meet-
ing: the new-comers had gone through so
much, and were so tired with their immense
walk, that they did not put out their feel-
ings much after Harry's first clinging about
his mother. She had a nice supper for
them, and set them all three down to it,
but she would not sit down herself; she
would instead hover about Harry, waiting
on them all, but him in especial, and lean-
ing over the back of his chair whenever
there was nothing else to do, repeating in
an odd tone like her old complaining voice,
shaken with something between gladness
and grief, all that she had heard from Mrs.
Hawker about the trial.

Fanny answered more than the others;
Ben only put in an explanation when he
had understood better than Fanny; and
Harry hardly said a word, but gave such a
heavy, deep sigh, that she reproached him
with not being glad to come home to poor
mother.
"Heaven knows if I am not, mother,"
he said; "but you see, it bain't all as it
was before—"
"Well, to be sure, if any one would go
for to cast it up to ye—" and Mrs. Sylves-
ter looked ready to fly at any such person,
as every one knew she could upon occasion.
"No, no," said Harry, "it ain't that.
Never mind now; there's poor little Fan
wants to go to bed bad enough, I can see,"
and he rose up, and turned to his little
bundle of linen that had been sent to him
in the prison, and took out of it a little
book. There was a colour in his brown
cheek, such as there had not been there all
day, as he put his hand on Ben's shoulder

and said, "The chaplain up at Winston
gave him to me. I don't mean to miss
saying of my prayers no more."
Fanny, in her excitement and fatigue,
had very nearly forgotten them; but Ben
felt now that all the strange, almost pain-
ful, feeling of joy that had been swelling
up within him all day, would be most re-
lieved and comforted by giving thanks to
Him who had brought the truth to light,
and given their dear brother back to
them.
And Mrs. Sylvester knelt down with
them too. That was the first time the fam-
ily had gathered in prayer together since
the father lay dying of a fever, and the last
vicar had hoped that his death-bed remorse
might leave some lasting impression on his
widow and wild sons.
And then they all went to bed. Mrs.
Sylvester slept the least, and was up the
soonest. She told Master Hawker, who
called in at five o'clock, on his way to his

work, to inquire whether they had got safe
home, that there they all were, sleeping

CHAPTER VIII.
TRUTH WILL PREVAIL.
It was still early morning, and Harry, shy
and nneasy, was bethinking him what he
could do, and where to get work, when
Mr. Conroy walked in, 60 quickly, that
he had no time to escape into the back
kitchen as he had so often done, and from
very awkwardness would have done again.
""Well, Mrs. Sylvester," said Mr. Con-
roy, "I am come to give you joy;" and
then his alert, brisk tone softening, and his
eyes glistening, he turned to the two broth-
ers, who were standing together, and sur-
prised them with a hearty grasp of the
hand to each of them.

"Thank you, Sir," said Mrs. Sylvester,
taking her hands out of the tub and wiping
her eyes; "I am sure the poor lad have
gone through a great deal. He is quite
another boy, and does not speak up a bit
like himself."
"I doubt whether it would be well to
see him without any change," said Mr.
Conroy; and Ben thought, too, that it
would have been very strange and hard-
hearted to be quite unaltered.
"What I came for," added Mr. Conroy,
"was partly to tell you what I hear was
the thing that has saved Harry; I dined
yesterday at Winston, and heard from a
person, who had spoken with some of the
jury, that what established his innocence
in their minds was this—Ben's perfect
truth. The jurymen said that his identify-
ing the handkerchief was what settled it in
their minds that he was a boy whose word
was to be trusted in the other matter."
"Bless me!" cried Mrs. Sylvester.

"when I thought that handkerchief would
be the ruination of the poor boy."
"Ay. You see the only way is to let
the truth take care of itself, or, I may bet-
ter say, let the God of Truth guard us, for
He wants no falsehood of ours. You see,
my boy, one shuffle of yours about the
neck-tie, or as to the sleeping at home,
would have made your evidence as to whom
you saw not a bit better worth than that
wretched man Conolly's."
"And every bit he said about me was
true, Sir," said Harry.
"Yes; but the falsehood was a stone
about the neck of the truth, weighing it
down, and making it worthless. Yes,
Henry Sylvester, if ever one man owed his
life to another, I believe you owe yours to
your brother's truth."
"Ah! Ben, my boy, I didn't think that

who broke the church window," said Har-
ry, with a strange sound in his voice.

"No," said Mr. Conroy, "we little know
what our least actions may be storing up
for us here, or in the world to come. One
thing more I must say, I don't believe Ben
could have been so clear and exact, even
when he intended it, and was upon oath,
if he had not got himself into training by
being particular in speaking the accurate
truth in every little matter. Those who
are not careful in that matter, make their
minds unable to see what the real fact is,
and can't speak truth even when they wish
it."
"That's true, Sir," said Harry.
"And that's true," said Betty Sylvester;
and she was going off into an account of
the dreadful story-telling of the little Bet-
tesworths, but Mr. Conroy, who did not
come for this, turned the talk away to
point to how they ought to live after so
great a warning and mercy. Betty said,
"Yes, Sir," and seemed much more im-
pressed than usual, and afterwards the

vicar signed to Harry to come outside the
door with him.
Harry used not to touch his cap to Mr.
Conroy, and if spoken to, would have an-
swered as Ahab did to Elijah, "Hast thou
found me, O mine enemy?" but it was
very different now, in his shaken, startled,
humbled state, with his heart full and his
spirits subdued.
They talked long, and the end of it was,
that Harry ran up-stairs into the bed-room,
and Mr. Conroy then called to Ben. The
boy saw tears on the vicar's eyes: "Ben,
my good boy," he said, "you have done
so well, through all this sad business, that
I only want to caution you, that having
been steady once won't keep you so, if you
don't watch. The old temptations will
come back, and you must not get slack;
and, as I have been telling Harry, by the
grace of God, I trust to see you two help-
ing and putting each other in mind, rather
than pulling each other back."


## p. 132 (#140) ############################################

132 ben Sylvester's word.
Ben thought Mr. Conroy did not know
how bad a boy he was, but he could not
say one word except, "Thank you, Sir."
He had it all out with Mr. Elliot in the
evening, and tried to tell him a great deal
more of what he had really felt. Mr. El-
liot somehow seemed more his friend- than
the other boys—that month had made him
seem older than his age.
Harry got rid of some of his awkward-
ness after he had been to church on Sun-
day, and found people treat him as if noth-
ing had happened; and, as it was the
height of harvest, both lads found plenty
of work before them; but still Harry was
uncomfortable in his change of habits, and
dreaded meeting any of his rude, old com-
panions, who might mock at him for being
cowed by his imprisonment. He kept
aloof from the other labourers, and his
mind was, where his words were not, with
the companion he had left in Winston gaol.
One evening Mr. Conroy came to the cot-

tage door, and found Fanny stumbling over
a letter from Stephen, the soldier brother.
Stephen had become quite a scholar since
his enlistment, and now he wrote so well,
that when Fanny had got beyond his hop-
ing that they were all well, as it left him
at present, she could make nothing more
of it, it was all ups and downs, just like
Mr. Elliot's own writing. They were very
much obliged when Mr. Conroy offered to
read it to them. They had never thought
of writing to him about poor Harry's
trouble, it would have been far too much
for Fanny's pen; and, besides, the regi-
ment was at .Gibraltar, and she could no
more have spelt than have spoken the
name.
However, the "Baronsbridge Murder"
had come round to him in the newspapers,
with Harry's trial and acquittal, and this
was one reason why he wrote. He was a
corporal, and had good conduct stripes on

his arm; and the discipline—just what the
Sylvester nature needed—had made him
feel more respectable, and, therefore, more
happy than he had ever been. The regi-
ment was soon to embark for the East, and
his letter was a bold-spirited one, saying
that he was going to fight for his queen
and his country, and he trusted he should
do his duty. He thought maybe Harry
would rather not 6tay at home after what
had happened, and he wished he would go
to the depot at Portsmouth, and enlist in
his regiment, in time to be sent out to join
him. He told him exactly how to manage,
and whom to ask for, and declared, "If
Harry have sprung up as tall as he prom-
ised for to be, they'll take him and wel-
come, and he will make some of our rank-
and-file look like fools." He added an
order in the letter for thirty shillings out
of his pay, partly to carry his brother to
Portsmouth, and the rest for a present to
his mother.


## p. 135 (#143) ############################################

TETJTH WILL PKEVAIL. 135
"I think I'll go," said Harry, when he
had heard the letter.
Mr. Conroy could not help thinking it by
far the best thing he could do, as giving
him an opportunity of doing his duty away
from the temptations of home, which might
be much stronger next year than this. And
though his mother was at first in dismay,
yet Stephen's doing so well, and sending
home money, was much in favour of it in
ner eyes. There was so much interest and
sympathy for the troops in the East, that
she was growing proud of a soldier son,
and she liked the notion of her boy making
the rank-and-file, whatever they might be,
look like fools.
So she consented, and Mr. Conroy began
to think about arrangements, and Ben
promised to get Mr. Elliot to teach him to
write letters as well as Stephen could.
That brought back to Mr. Conroy the rea-
son he had come to the cottage, a melan-
choly one, for it was to read to Harry a

letter from the chaplain at the gaol. Poor
Long had made a confession, declaring
Henry Sylvester's innocence of the least
knowledge of the plan of breaking into
the cottage. No murder had been intend-
ed, and Jacob had kept below stairs that
he might not be recognized, but Mrs. Wal-
cot had fought so powerfully, that she had
dragged his companion to the head of the
stairs, and shrieking out Jacob's name as
she saw him, had thus enraged and alarm-
ed them into striking her on the head till
they had killed her. He was full of con
trition, and asked pardon of Ben for the
blow, as well as of Harry for the trouble
into which he had brought him, and all the
past misleading—that misleading that might
have been even more fatal to the youth
than even conviction and execution.
The two lads were so much overcome,
that Mr. Conroy had to make their mes-
sage of forgiveness out for himself, he saw
well enough how it came from the bottom
of their hearts.

One Sunday more, when Mrs. Sylvester
went to church in a new dress bought out
of Stephen's money, and when Mr. Conroy
preached a sermon, which most of the con-
gregation thought they should never forget,
about the Good Shepherd, and His many
ways of calling His wandering sheep to
His Fold.
On Monday, Ben got leave to walk with
Harry to the Aldringham station, and
shook hands with him for the last time,
while Harry said, "Good-bye, Benjie;
"you'll take care of Mother and Fan bet-
ter than I ever did."
That fine young soldier who was so ten-
der in helping the wounded after the battle
of Inkerman, could he be the Harry Syl-
vester who was tried at Winston assizes?

fully day and night at the trenches at Se-
bastopol be the same who was idle over a
week's regular work at home; or the
steady well-disciplined soldier be he who

hated all sorts of rule? But what would
have most gratified Mr. Conroy would
have been to see the young man, on the
night of the 17th of June, 1855, come
softly into the tent, where the Holy Feast
was prepared for those who wished to par-
take of it. The preparations had been has-
tily made, and the candles were supported
in the rings attached to the bayonets, the
polished steel flashed back the light upon
the rough table, and the earnest faces of
those that knelt before it. Harry Sylvester
was not the less brave for what passed
that night, when engaged on the 18th in
that severe conflict, which has made that
glorious date also a sorrowful one.
Sergeant Stephen Sylvester had a full
share of wounds and illness in that terrible
siege of Sebastopol, and was one of those
invalided home, who had their medals from
the queen's own hands. He spent a month
at home before he could join the d6pot,
and he told such things of Harry's steadi-

ness and prosperity, that some people
thought he was romancing; but Mr. Con-
roy and Mr. Elliot believed every word,
for they had known how true and sincere
Harry's repentance had been, and had
always thought his temper one that, once
in the right way, would go on in it at once
boldly and humbly.
Home is in a better state; Fanny is grow-
ing into a trim, steady little maiden, active
and diligent, and her mother, less worried
by cares and by rude children, is beginning
to be more cheerful. Whilst Stephen was
at home, she treated him like a guest, and
eo got a habit of making things comfortable,
such as has not deserted her yet.
They get her to church pretty regularly
now, and perhaps there are gleams work-
ing through that thick mist of ignorance
and indilference under which she had lived
so many years.

Jack. He has never forfeited the general
dependence on his word, for he has never

lad he is sure to be at the Sunday-school,
and, indeed, Mr. Elliot is still his best
friend, and has brought him on in his learn-
ing as no one would once have expected.
He has taken to reading, and often comes
to change a book at the library; he has
the garden in very good order, and can
play at cricket still with as great eagerness
and better skill than most of the boys.
Life and spirit have come back to him
again, but not thoughtlessness, -and he is
going on steadily and peaceably, doing
his duty in his station in all honesty and
sincerity. What better can we wish for

THE
LIFE OF GEORGE HERBERT
BY
GEORGE L. DUYCKINCK.
Geokgb HebBert is of ail England's sacred poets th»
most sure of an enduring fame. He was a true poet
His life, too, was a very lovely one—that of a true Chris-
tian, of a scholar, a gentleman, and a faithful parish
priest. More than this, he was beloved of dear old Izaak
Walton, who wrote his life with that sweet homeliness of
style which wins all honest hearts to him. Mr. Duyckinck
has undertaken, in this pretty little volume, to set forth
Herbert's life again "with a simplicity of style and ful-
ness of detail which should in some degree meet the re-
quirements both of youthful and mature readers." He
has been very successful in a not very easy task. He has
come to the work imbued with a love of his subject, and
thoroughly understanding it; and he writes with an un-
affected earnestness and purity quite in keeping with
it. The young reader will find much valuable and inter-
esting information in the book, upon matters kindred to
or connected with its main purpose; and it is calculated
to foster a correct literary taste, no less than to beget a
healthy moral tone.—Courier and, Enquirer.

LIFE OF BISHOP CROES.
BY THE EET. JOHN N. NORTON.
NOTICES OF THE PRESS.
This Life of Bishop Croes will be found very useful,
The Christian traits of the Bishop are happily set forth,
and we find much to admire. The volume is one of de-
cided interest.
If this series of books is read by children, they will get
the best general instruction from them, and sound and
practical views of the Church. There is much in them
to stimulate the young to the practice of early piety, and
to aim for high excellence in life.—Banner of the Cross.
This volume, like its predecessors, is both interesting
and instructive.—Gospel Messenger.
The history of Bishop Croes' life, besides.being inter-
esting, as showing the good deeds of one who was ever
kind and amiable, and who performed most important
services for the Church, is doubly attractive, as evincing
the ability which a young man of energy and talent pos-
sesses to raise himself to a high position, in spite of ad-
verse circumstances. —Churchman.
The author has succeeded in placing the character of
Bishop Croes before the Church and the world in the light
of. truth, and in the living energy of his own actions.—
Episcopal Recorder.
Another interesting vol»me of this series.—Christian
Witnesi.

LIFE OF BISHOP CROES.
Mr. Norton's Life of Bishop Croes is not limited to the
matter personal to that worthy and staunch Bishop, but
gives a full and careful history of the growth of the
Church in New Jersey, through all its trials and diffi-
culties, up to the year 1832. In nearly every part of it,
indeed, the Bishop was more or less concerned, being a
Jersey man by birth and breeding, and the unbroken
association of a long life. He was a self-made man; and
the strong points of his character—strenuous patience
and unflinching tenacity of purpose—were not a little
owing to the varied but stern discipline of his own ex-
perience. His long and laborious work in New Jersey
was a good work well done.—Church Journal.
It seems hardly necessary, for the circulation of this
book, to do more than announce the author's name. He
has succeeded so admirably in his other brief sketches of
Bishops, that the Eev. Mr. Norton's name is a guarantee
for the excellence of this.—Calendar.
A very interesting volume.—Southern Churchman.
We have been delighted in reading this little book.
By Mr. Norton's aid we follow a brave youth of sixteen,
barely able to read, enrolled as a soldier in the armies of
the Revolution, taught to write by the drummer of his
company, serving his country faithfully in whatever sta-
tion placed, struggling with poverty in acquiring an
education, but rising triumphant over every obstacle, to
take his stand among the first men of his age, and to re-
suscitate and build up the Episcopal Church, and to lay
broad and deep its foundation in New Jersey. We con-
sider this one of the most successful of all Mr. Norton's
efforts, and worthy of being put into the hands of every
youth in the Church.— Western Episeopalian.

FROM THE WOODS OF CAROLINA.
Messes. Editors—Among the many beautiful presents
to gladden the hearts of our children at this happy sea-
son, I know of none having as strong a claim on an in-
habitant of this State, and especially of this city, as the
volume entitled "A Wreath from the Woods of Caro-
lina."
The design of the work and the literary matter are by
a lady of this city, whose genius, manifest to all in this
production, and evinced to her friends in several depart-
ments of the arts, not all the cares of a large family and
a responsible position have been able to repress; while
another lady of this city has furnished the colored draw-
ings from which the beautiful flowers have been engraved.
The author has presented the fruit of her labors to the
Church Book Society. It is therefore on her part an
offering of piety, as well as of taste and talent, to swell
the amount of the good and beautiful things of the season.
The Society have shown their sense of the value of the
gift by the expense and pains which they have bestowed
upon the volume. Its paper, type, and above all, exquisite
representations of the flowers, make the book a treasure
in its externals.
But, after all, the stories for the children constitute its
chief attraction and merit. The style is singularly clear
and animated ; the spirit is the spirit of love and cheerful
piety; the lessons are wise, yet admirably adapted to
children ; and the whole is suggestive of the brightness
and fragrance and freshness of the woods themselves, in
a charming morning of May.
Let all the friends of the young see that their little
favorites have among their Christian treasures "A Wreath
from the Woods of Carolina." —From the Raleigh (North
Cardinal Standard.

BOOK NOTICES.
JUVENILE BOOKS.
"Juveniles" are the most taking books just now. The
Rev. P. D. Harriman, agent of the Protestant Episcopal
Sunday School Union, has recently published some seven
or eight, which the little folks, male and female, are much
pleased with. The two largest are "Bessie Melville" and
"Sidney Grey," very neat 16mo volumes. The story of
Bessie, though simple and unpretending, is charmingly
entertaining ; Hb excellent lessons are rendered so attract-
ive that the most indolent and thoughtless can hardly
fail to profit by them. The main object of the book is to
show how prayer-book instructions may be practiced in
the ordinary transactions of life—an object which, so far
as I can pretend to judge, is successfully carried out.
"Sidney Grey" is designed chiefly for boys. It contains
incidents enough for a "sensation" novel; but they are
not treated in the sensation style. Not but those most
commonplace are invested with an interest which many a
pretentious romance-writer of the present day would en-
deavor in vain to impart to his most elaborately got up
"scenes." "Mia and Charlie" is by the same author—
a charming story, or rather series of stories, for the young.
The account which the pretty little book gives of a week's
holiday at the Bydale Rectory is lively, entertaining, and
instructive in no ordinary degree. It has caused many a
bright, happy smile since the holidays commenced; and
it is worth reading at any time. In this hurried chat I
can only mention "The Boy Missionary," "The Life of
Bishop Wainwright," "The Life of George Herbert,"
"The Life of Bishop Ravenscroft," and "The Tortoise-
Shell Comb.'' Each tiny "Life'' is embellished with a
handsome portrait.—Newark Daily Advertiser.

BOOK NOTICES.
BESSY MELVILLE;
Or, Prayer-Book Instructions Carried Out Into Life.
A SEQUEL TO "THE LITTLE EPISCOPALIAN."
BT M. A. 0.
The title of this very handsome volume gives a good
idea of its character. "Bessy's" story, though simple
and unpretending, is replete with that kind of instruction
which it is essential that all Christian children 6hould re-
ceive in one form or other; and what is more, its lessons
are rendered so attractive that the most indolent and
thoughtless of our little friends will find pleasure in
learning them. The author possesses the rare faculty of
combining the useful with the agreeable, and at the same
time writes in pure, correct English, which is more than
could he said of many pretentious novelists of the present
day. The book is well printed, and tastefully bound in
muslin.—Philadelphia Daily News.
MIA AND CHARLIE;
OB,
A WEEK'S HOLIDAY AT THE BTDALE EECTOBY,
Is another illustrated, instructive book, from the same
press. It is sufficient to say that it is worthy of both.
Indeed, it has seldom been our privilege to examine a
volume better calculated to coax children to be sensible,
religious, and good. Boys and girls will be equally
pleased with it, and we recommend it accordingly.—Phil-
adelphia Daily News.

BO )K. NOTICE8.
Sidney Grey. A Tale of School Life. By tho author
of "Mia and Charlie,"
Ib a good, entertaining, useful hook for hoys. It contains
sufficient incidents for a modern romance, but they are
not of the '' intense'' kind. On the contrary, they are
generally of ordinary character, such as are constantly
occurring around us; but those most commonplace are
Invested with a degree of interest which is in itself a
charm. "Sydney Grey," however, is no baby's book.
Indeed, there are not many adults who would not find its
teachings profitable. The style of the narrative is chaste,
lively, and graphic, the typography is excellent, and the
binding at once neat and substantial. Nor must we omit
to tell the little folks that they will also be pleased with
the illustrations in " Sydney Grey." There are no better
safeguards against Popery than books of this kind.—
Philadelphia Daily Sews.
The Boy Missionary. By Mrs. Jenny Marsh Parker.
This is another little volume which is destined to do
much good, for it is so written that it will be read with
avidity by those for whose benefit it is intended. Tho
story of Davie Hall is full of wholesome encouragement,
and can not fail to make an impression.
The Episcopal Church Book Society have also recently
published "The Life of Bishop Wainwright," "The Life
of George Herbert," "The Life of Bishop Ravenscroft,"
and '' The Tortoise-Shell Comb," all of which are well
suited for children. Each tiny '' Life'' is embellished
with a fine portrait, and ought to find a place in the
juvenile library of every Protestant family.—Philadelphia
Daily Newt.
