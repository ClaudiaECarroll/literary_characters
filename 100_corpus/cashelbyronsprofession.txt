PREFACE 
 
 NOVELS OF MY NONAGE 
 
 I NEVER think of Cashel Byron's Profession without a 
 shudder at the narrowness of my escape from becoming 
 a successful novelist at the age of twenty-six. At that 
 moment an adventurous publisher might have ruined me. 
 Fortunately for me, there were no adventurous publishers 
 at that time ; and I was forced to fight my way, instead 
 of being ingloriously bought off at the first brush. Not 
 that Cashel Byron's Profession was my very first novel. 
 It was my fourth, and was followed by yet another. I 
 recall these five remote products of my nonage as five 
 heavy brown paper parcels which were always coming back 
 to me from some publisher, and raising the very serious 
 financial question of the sixpence to be paid to Messrs 
 Carter, Paterson, and Co., the carriers, for passing them 
 on to the next publisher. Eventually, Carter, Paterson, 
 and Co. were the only gainers ; for the publishers had 
 to pay their readers' fees for nothing but a warning not 
 to publish me ; and I had to pay the sixpences for sending 
 my parcels on a bootless errand. At last I grew out of 
 novel-writing, and set to work to find out what the world 
 was really like. The result of my investigations, so far, 
 entirely confirms the observation of Goethe as to the

 amazement, the incredulity, the moral shock with which 
 the poet discovers that what he supposed to be the real 
 world does not exist, and that men and women are made 
 by their own fancies in the image of the imaginary 
 creatures in his youthful fictions, only much stupider. 
 
 Unfortunately for the immature poet, he has not in 
 his nonage the satisfaction of knowing that his guesses 
 at life are true. Bring a peasant into a drawing-room, 
 and though his good sense may lead him to behave very 
 properly, yet he will suffer torments of misgiving that 
 everything he does must be a solecism. In my earlier 
 excursions into literature I confess I felt like the peasant 
 in the drawing-room. I was, on the whole, glad to get 
 out of it. Looking back now with the eyes of experience, 
 I find that I certainly did make blunders in matters out- 
 side the scope of poetic divination. To take a very mild 
 example, I endowed the opulent heroine of this very book 
 with a park of thirty acres in extent, being then fully 
 persuaded that this was a reasonable estimate of the size 
 of the Isle of Wight or thereabouts. But it is not by the 
 solecisms of ignorance that the young man makes himself 
 most ridiculous. Far more unnatural than these were 
 my proprieties and accuracies and intelligences. I did 
 not know my England then. I was young, raw from 
 eighteenth century Ireland, modest, and anxious lest my 
 poverty and provinciality should prevent me from 
 correctly representing the intelligence, refinement, con- 
 science, and good breeding which I supposed to be as 
 natural and common in English society as in Scott's 
 novels. I actually thought that' educated people con- 
 scientiously learnt their manners and studied their opinions 
 — were really educated, in short — instead of merely picking 
 up the habits and prejudices of their set, and confidently 
 presenting the resultant absurd equipment of class solecisms 
 to the world as a perfect gentility. Consequently the

 only characters which were natural in my novels were the 
 comic characters, because the island was (and is) populated 
 exclusively by comic characters. Take them seriously in 
 fiction, and the result is the Dickens heroine or the Sarah 
 Grand hero : pathetically unattractive figments both of 
 them. Thus my imaginary persons of quality became 
 quite unlike any actual persons at large in England, being 
 superior to them in a priggish manner which would 
 nowadays rouse the humor of our younger publishers' . 
 readers very inopportunely. In 1882, however, the 
 literary &shion which distinguished the virtuous and 
 serious characters in a novel by a decorous stylishness 
 and scrupulousness of composition, as if all thqir speeches 
 had been corrected by their governesses and schoolmasters, 
 had not -yet been exploded by "the New Journalism" of 
 1888 and the advent of a host of authors who had 
 apparently never read anything, catering for a proletariat 
 newly made literate by the Education Act. The dis- 
 tinction between the naturalness of Caleb Balderstone 
 and the artificiality of Edgar and Lucy was still regarded 
 as one of the social decencies by the seniors of literature ; 
 and this probably explains the fact that the onlf in- 
 timations I received that my work had made some 
 impression, and had even been hesitatingly condemned, 
 were from the older and more august houses whose 
 readers were all grave elderly lovers of literature. And 
 the more I progressed towards my own individual style 
 and ventured upon the freeer expression of my own ideas, 
 the more I disappointed them. As to the regular novel- 
 publishing houses, whose readers were merely on the 
 scent of popularity, they gave me no quarter at all. And 
 so between the old stool of my literary conscientiousness 
 and the new stool of a view of life that did not reach 
 publishing-point in England until about ten years later, 
 when Ibsen drove it in, my novels fell to the ground.

viii Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 I was to find later on that a book is like a child : it is 
 easier to bring it into the world than to control it when 
 it is launched there. As long as I kept sending my 
 novels to the publishers, they were as safe from publicity 
 as they would have been in the fire, where I had better, 
 perhaps, have put them. But when I flung them aside as 
 failures they almost instantly began to shew signs of life. 
 
 The Socialist revival of the eighties, into which I 
 had plunged, produced the usual crop of propagandist 
 magazines, in the conduct of which payment of the printer 
 was the main problem, payment of contributors being 
 quite out of the question. The editor of such a magazine 
 can never count on a full supply of live matter to make up 
 his tale of pages. But if he can collect a stock of unread- 
 able novels, the refuse of the publishing trade, and a stock 
 of minor poems (the world is full of such trash), an 
 instalment of serial novel and a few verses will always 
 make up the magazine to any required size. And this 
 was how I found a use at last for my brown paper parcels* 
 It seemed a matter of no more consequence than stuffing 
 so many broken window-panes with them ; but it had 
 momentous consequences ; for in this way four of the 
 five got printed and published in London, and thus 
 incidentally became the common property of the citizens 
 of the United States of America. These pioneers did 
 not at first appreciate their new acquisition ; and nothing 
 particular happened except that the first novel (No. 5 ; 
 for I ladled them out to the Socialist magazine editors in 
 inverse order of composition) made me acquainted with 
 William Morris, who, to my surprise, had been reading 
 the monthly instalments with a certain relish. But that 
 only proved how much easier it is to please a great man 
 than a little one, especially when you share his politics. 
 No. 5, called an An Unsocial Socialist, was followed by 
 No. 4, Cashel Byron's Profession ; and Cashel Byron

 would not lie quiet in his serial grave, but presently rcJse 
 and walked as a book. 
 
 It happened in this way. The name of the magazine 
 was To-Day, not the present paper of that name, but 
 one of the many To-Days which are now Yesterdays. 
 It had several editors, among them Mr _Belfort Bax and 
 the late James Leigh Joynes ; but all the editors were 
 in partnership with Mr Henry Hyde Champion, who 
 printed the magazine, and consequently went on for ever, 
 whilst the others came and went. It was a fantastic 
 business, Joynes having thrown up an Eton mastership, 
 and Champion a commission in the army, at the call of 
 Socialism. But Champion's pugnacity survived his 
 abdicated adjutancy : he had an unregenerate taste for 
 pugilism, and liked Cashel Byron so much that he 
 stereotyped the pages of To-Day which it occupied, and 
 in spite of my friendly remonstrances, hurled on the 
 market a misshapen shilling edition. My friend Mr 
 William Archer reviewed it prominently ; the Saturday 
 Review, always susceptible in those days to the arts of 
 self-defence, unexpectedly declared it theTnovel of the age ; 
 Mr W. E. Henley wanted to haye it dramatized ; 
 Stevenson wrote a letter about it, of which more presently ; 
 the other papers hastily searched their waste-paper baskets 
 for it and reviewed it, mostly rather disappointedly ; and 
 the public preserved its composure and did not seem to 
 care. 
 
 That shilling edition began with a thousand copies ; 
 but it proved, immortal. I never got anything out of it ; 
 and Mr. Champion never got anything out of it ; for he 
 presently settled in Australia, and his printing presses and 
 stereo plates were dispersed. But from that time forth the 
 book was never really out of print ; and though Messrs 
 Walter Scott soon placed a revised shilling edition on the 
 market, I suspect that still, in some obscure printing

 office, those old plates of Mr Champion's from time to 
 time produce a "remainder" of the original "Modern 
 Press " edition, which is to the present what the Quarto 
 Hamlet is to the Folio. 
 
 On the passing of To-Day, I became novelist in 
 ordinary to a magazine called Our Corner, edited by Mrs 
 Annie Besant. It had the singular habit of paying for its 
 contributions, and was, I am afraid, to some extent a 
 device of Mrs. Besant's for relieving necessitous young 
 propagandists without wounding their pride by open 
 almsgiving. She was an incorrigible benefactress, and 
 probably revenged herself for my freely expressed scorn for 
 this weakness by drawing on her private account to pay 
 me for my jejune novels. At last Our Corner went the 
 way of all propagandist magazines, completing a second 
 nonage novel and its own career at the same moment. 
 This left me with only one unprinted masterpiece, my 
 Opus I, which had cost me an unconscionable quantity of 
 paper, and was called, with merciless iitness, "Immaturity." 
 Part of it had by this time been devoured by mice, though 
 even they had not been able to finish it. To this day it 
 has never escaped from its old brown paper travelling suit j 
 and I only mention it because some of its characters 
 appear, Trollope fashion, in the later novels. I do not 
 think any of them got so far as Cashel Byron's 
 Profession ; but the Mrs. Hoskyn and her guests who 
 appear in that absurd Chapter VI. are all borrowed from 
 previous works. 
 
 The unimportance of these particulars must be my 
 apology for detailing them to a world that finds something 
 romantic in what are called literary struggles. However, 
 I must most indignantly deny that I ever struggled. I 
 wrote the books : it was the publishers who struggled 
 with them, and struggled in vain. The public now takes 
 up the struggle, impelled, not by any fresh operations of

 mine, but by Literary Destiny. For there is a third act 
 to my tragedy. 
 
 Not long ago, when the memory of the brown paper 
 parcels of 1 879-1 883 had been buried under twenty years 
 of work, I learnt from the American papers that the list 
 of book sales in one of the United States was headed by 
 a certain novel called An Unsocial Socialist, by Bernard 
 Shaw. This was uninistakeably Opus 5 of the Novels 
 of My Nonage. Columbia was beginning to look after 
 her hitherto neglected acquisition. Apparently the result 
 was encouraging ; for presently the same publisher pro- 
 duced a new edition of Cashel Byron's Profession (Opus 4), 
 in criticising which the more thoughtful reviewers, un- 
 aware that the publisher was working backwards through 
 the list, pointed out the marked advance in my style, the 
 surer grip, the clearer form, the finer art, the maturer 
 view of the world, and so forth. As it was clearly unfair 
 that my own American publishers should be debarred by 
 delicacy towards me from exploiting the new field of 
 derelict fiction, I begged them to make the most of their 
 national inheritance ; and with my full approval. Opus 3, 
 called Love Among the Artists (a paraphrase of the for- 
 gotten line Love Among the Roses) followed. No doubt 
 it will pay its way : people who will read An Unsocial 
 Socialist will read anything. But the new enthusiasm 
 for Cashel Byron did not stop here. American ladies 
 were seized with a desire to go on the stage and be Lydia 
 Carew for two thrilling hours. American actors " saw 
 themselves" as Cashel. One gentleman has actually 
 appeared on the New York stage in the part. At the 
 end of this volume will be found a stage version of my 
 own ; and I defer further particulars as to Cashel Byron 
 on the stage until we come to that version. Suffice it to 
 say here that there can be no doubt now that the novels 
 so long left for dead in the forlorn-hope magazines of the

 eighties, have arisen and begun to propagate themselves 
 vigorously throughout the new world at the rate of a 
 dollar and a half pei- copy, free of all royalty to the 
 flattered author. 
 
 Blame not me, then, reader, if these exercises of a raw 
 apprentice break loose again and insist on their right to 
 live. The world, never did know chalk from cheese in 
 matters of art ; and, after all, since it is only the young 
 and the old who have time to read, the rest being too 
 busy living, my exercises may be fitter for the market 
 than my masterpieces, 
 
 THE MORALS OF PUGILISTIC FICTION 
 
 Cashel Byron's Profession is not a very venturesome 
 republication, because, as I have said, the story has never 
 been really out of print. But for some years after the 
 expiration of my agreement with Messrs Walter Scott 
 I did my best to suppress it, though by that time it had 
 become the subject of proposals from a new generation of 
 publishers. The truth is, the .preference for this par- 
 ticular novel annoyed me. In novel-writing there are 
 two trustworthy dodges for capturing the public. One is 
 to slaughter a child and pathosticate over its deathbed for 
 a whole chapter. The other is to describe either a fight 
 or a murder. There is a fight in Cashel Byron's Pro- 
 fession: that profession itself is fighting; and here lay 
 the whole schoolboy secret of the book's little vogue. I 
 had the old grievance of the author : people will admire 
 him for the feats that any fool can achieve, and bear 
 malice against him for boring them with better work. 
 Besides, my conscience was not quite easy in the matter. 
 In spite of all my pains to present the prizefighter and his 
 pursuits without any romantic glamor (for indeed the 
 true artistic material of the story is the comedy of the

Preface xiii 
 
 contrast between the realities of the ring and the common 
 romantic glorification or sentimental abhorrence of it), 
 yet our non-combatant citizens are so fond of setting 
 other people to fight that the only effect of such descrip- 
 tions as I have incidentally given of Cashel's professional 
 performances is to make people wrant to see something of 
 the sort and take steps accordingly. This tendency of the 
 book w^as repugnant to me ; and if prizefighting were a 
 sleeping dog, I should certainly let it lie, in spite of the 
 American editions. 
 
 Unfortunately the dog is awake, barking and biting 
 vigorously. Twenty years ago prizefighting was sup- 
 posed to be dead. Few living men remembered the 
 palmy days when Tom and Jerry went to Jackson's 
 rooms (where Byron — ^not Cashel, but the poet — studied 
 " the noble art ") to complete their education as Corin- 
 thians ; when Cribb fought Molyneux and was to Tom 
 Spring what Skene was to Cashel Byron ; when Kemble 
 engaged Dutch Sam to carry on the war with the O.P. 
 rioters ; when Sharpies' portraits of leading bruisers were 
 engraved on steel ; when Bell's Life was a fashionable 
 paper, and Pierce Egan's Boxiana a more expensive pub- 
 lishing enterprise than any modern Badminton volume. 
 The sport was supposed to have died of its own black- 
 guardism by the second quarter of the century ; but the 
 connoisseur who approaches the subject without moral 
 bias will, I think, agree with me that it must have lived by 
 its blackguardism and died of its intolerable tediousness ; 
 for all prizefighters are not Cashel Byrons, and in barren 
 dreariness and futility no spectacle on earth can contend 
 with that of two exhausted men trying for hours to tire 
 one another out at fisticuffs for the sake of their backers. 
 The Sayers revival in the sixties only left the ring more 
 discredited than ever, since the injuries formerly reserved 
 for the combatants began, after their culmination in the

 poisoning of Heenan, to be showered on the referee j 
 and as the referee was usually the representative of the 
 Bell's Life type of paper, which naturally organized the 
 prizefights it lived by reporting, the ring went under 
 again, this time undoubtedly through its blackguardism 
 and violence driving away its only capable organizers. 
 
 In the eighties many apparently lost causes and 
 dead enthusiasms unexpectedly revived : Imperialism, 
 Patriotism, Religion, Socialism, and many other things, 
 including prizefighting in an aggravated form, and on 
 a scale of commercial profit and publicity which soon 
 made its palmy days insignificant and ridiculous by 
 contrast. A modern American pugilist makes more by 
 a single defeat than Cribb made by all his victories. It 
 is this fact that has decided me to give up my attempt to 
 suppress Cashel Byron's Profession. Silence may be the 
 right policy on a dropped subject ; but on a burning one 
 every word that can cool the fervor of idolatry with a 
 dash of cold fact has its value. 
 
 I propose, therefore, to reissue this book with a state- 
 ment of the truth about the recent development of prize- 
 fighting as far as I have been able to ascertain it. I 
 should make this statement here and now if it were a 
 subject of general interest. But as it is really a technical 
 one, and would probably bore and even disgust those who 
 buy books from love of literature, I transfer it to the end 
 of the volume, and recommend a perusal and consideration 
 of it to law- givers, electors, members of watch com- 
 mittees. Justices of the Peace, Commissioners of Police, 
 and amateur pugilists who would rather read anything 
 about boxing than, say, Spenser's Fairy Queen. 
 
 I need not, however, postpone a comment on the vast 
 propaganda of pugnacity in modern fiction : a propaganda 
 that must be met, not by shocked silence, but by counter- 
 propaganda. And this counter-propaganda must not take

Preface xv 
 
 the usual form of "painting the horrors." Horror is 
 fascinating : the great criminal is always a popular hero. 
 People are seduced by romance because they are ignorant 
 of reality ; and this is as true of the prize ring as of 
 the battlefield. The intelligent prizefighter is not a 
 knight-errant : he is a disillusioned man of business 
 trying to make money at a certain weight and at certain 
 risks, not of bodily injury (for a bruise is soon cured), 
 but of pecuniary loss. When he is a Jew, a negro, a gypsy, 
 or a recruit from that gypsified, nomadic, poaching, 
 tinkering, tramping class which exists in all countries, 
 he differs from the phlegmatic John Bull pugilist (an 
 almost extinct species) exactly as he would differ from 
 him in any other occupation : that is, he is a more 
 imaginative liar, a more obvious poser, a more plausible 
 talker, a vainer actor, a more reckless gambler, and more 
 easily persuaded that he is beaten or even killed when 
 he has only received an unusually hard punch. The 
 unintelligent prizefighter is often the helpless tool of a 
 gang of gamblers, backers, and showmen, who set him 
 on to fight as they might set on a dog. And the 
 spectacle of a poor human animal fighting faithfully 
 for his backers, like a terrier killing rats, or a racehorse 
 doing its best to win a race for its owner, is one which 
 ought to persuade any sensible person of the folly of 
 treating the actual combatants as " the principals " in a 
 prizefight. Cockfighting was not suppressed by im- 
 prisoning the cocks ; and prizefighting will not be 
 suppressed by imprisoning the pugilists. But, intelligent 
 or unintelligent, first rate like Cashel Byron, second rate 
 like Skene, or third rate like William Paradise in this 
 story, the prizefighter is no more what the spectators 
 imagine him to be than the lady with the wand and star 
 in the pantomime is really a fairy queen. And since 
 Cashel Byron's Profession, on its prizefighting side, is 
 


## p. (#20) #################################################

xvi Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 an attempt to take the reader behind the scenes without 
 unfairly confusing professional pugilism with the black- 
 guardly environment which is no more essential to it than 
 to professional cricket, and which is now losing its hold 
 on the pugilist through the substitution of gate-money 
 at boxing exhibitions for stakes at prizefights as his 
 means of living, I think I may let it go its way with a 
 reasonable prospect of seeing it do more good than harm. 
 It may even help in the Herculean task of eliminating 
 romantic fisticuffs from English novels, and so clear them 
 from the reproach of childishness and crudity which they 
 certainly deserve in this respect. Even in the best nine- 
 teenth century novels the heroes knock the villains down. 
 Bulwer Lytton's Kenelm Chillingly was a " scientific " 
 pugilist, though his technique will hardly be recognized 
 by experts. Thackeray, who, when defeated in a parlia- 
 mentary election, publicly compared himself to Gregson 
 beaten by Gully, loved a fight almost as much as he loved 
 a fool. Even the great Dickens himself never quite got 
 away from this sort of schoolboyishness ; for though Jo 
 Gargery knocking down Orlick is much more plausible 
 than Oliver Twist punching the head of Noah Claypole, 
 still the principle is the same : virtue still insists on 
 victory, domination, and triumphant assault and battery. 
 It is true that Dombey and Son contains a pious attempt 
 to caricature a prizefighter ; but no qualified authority 
 will pretend that Dickens caught The Chicken's point 
 of view, or did justice to the social accomplishments of 
 the ring. Mr. Toots's silly admiration of the poor 
 boxer, and the manner in which the Chicken and other 
 professors of the art of self-defence used to sponge on 
 him, is perfectly true to life ; but in the real pugilistic 
 world so profitable a gull would soon have been taken 
 out of the hands of the Chicken and preyed upon by 
 much better company. It is true that if the Chicken

Preface xvii 
 
 had been an unconquerable fighter, he might have 
 maintained a gloomy eminence in spite of his dulness. 
 and disagreeable manners ; but Dickens gave away this 
 one possible excuse by allowing The Larky Boy to 
 defeat the Chicken with ignominy. That is what is 
 called poetic justice. It is really poetic criminal law; 
 arid it is almost as dishonest and vindictive as real 
 criminal lavir. In plain fact, the pugilistic profession 
 is like any other profession : common sense, good 
 manners, and a social turn count for as much in it 
 as they do elsewhere ; and as the pugilist makes a 
 good deal of money by teaching gentlemen to box, he 
 has to learn to behave himself, and often succeeds very 
 much better than the average middle-dass professional 
 man. Shakespear was much nearer the mark when 
 he made Autolycus better company, and Charles the 
 Wrestler a better-mannered man, than Ajax or Cloten. 
 If Dickens had really known the ring, he would have 
 made the Chicken either a Sayers in professional ability 
 or a Sam Weller in sociability. A successful combination 
 of personal repulsiveness with professional incompetence 
 is as impossible there as at the bar or in the faculty. 
 The episode of the Chicken, then, must be dismissed, in 
 spitd of its hero's tempting suggested remedy for Mr 
 Dombey's stiffness, as a futile atonement for the heroic 
 fisticuffs of Oliver Twist and Co. 
 
 There is an abominable vein of retaliatory violence all 
 through the literature of the nineteenth century. Whether 
 it is Macaulay describing the flogging of Titus Oates, 
 dr Dickens inventing the scene in which old Martin 
 Chuzzlewit bludgeons Pecksniff, the curious childishness 
 of the English character, its naughty relish for primitive 
 brutalities and tolerance of physical indignities, its un- 
 reasoning destructiveness when incommoded, crop up in 
 all directions. The childishness has its advantages : its

 want of foresight prevents the individual from carrying 
 weapons, as it prevents the nation from being prepared

 longed maHce-bearing ; its simpHcity and transparency 
 save it from the more ingenious and compHcated forms of 
 political corruption. In short, it has those innocences of 
 childhood which are a necessary result of its impotences. 
 But it has no true sense of human dignity. The son of 
 a Russian noble is not flogged at school, because he 
 commits suicide sooner than survive the outrage to his self- 
 respect. The son of an English noble has no more sense 
 of dignity than the master who flogs him : flogging may 
 be troublesome to the flogger and painful to the floggee ; 
 but the notion that the transaction is disgusting to the 
 public and dishonorable and disgraceful to the parties is as 
 uninteUigible and fantastic in England as it is in a nursery 
 anywhere. The moment the Englishman gets away 
 from Eton, he begins to enjoy and boast of flogging as 
 an institution. A school where boys are flogged and 
 where they settle their quarrels by fighting with their 
 fists he calls, not, as one might expect, a school of child- 
 ishness,- but a school of manliness. And he gradually 
 persuades himself that all Englishmen can use their fists, 
 which is about as true as the parallel theory that every 
 Frenchman can handle a foil and that every Italian carries 
 a stiletto. And so, though he himself has never fought a 
 pitched battle at school, and does not, pugilistically speak- 
 ing, know his right hand from his left ; though his 
 neighbors are as peaceful and as nervous as he ; though if 
 he knocked a man down or saw one of his friends do it, 
 the event would stand out in his history like a fire or a 
 murder ; yet he not only tolerates unstinted knockings- 
 down in fiction, but actually founds his conception of his 
 nation and its destiny on these imaginary outrages, and 
 at last comes to regard a plain statement of the plain feet

 that the average respectable Englishman knows rather 
 less about fighting than he does about flying, as a 
 paradoxical extravagance. 
 
 And so every popular English novel becomes a 
 gospel of pugilism. Cashel Byron's Profession, then, 
 is like any other novel in respect of its hero punch- 
 ing people's heads. Its novelty consists in the iact that 
 an attempt is made to treat the art of punching seriously, 
 and to detach it from the general elevation of moral 
 character with which the ordinary novelist persists in 
 associating it. 
 
 Here, therefore, the prizefighter is not idolized. I have 
 given Cashel Byron every advantage a prizefighter can 
 have : health and strength and pugilistic genius. But by 
 pugilistic genius I mean nothing vague, imaginary, or 
 glamorous. In all walks of life men are to be found who 
 seem to have powers of divination. For example, you 
 propound a complicated arithmetical problem : say the 
 cubing of a number containing four digits. Give me a 
 slate and half an hour's time, and I will produce a wrong 
 answer. But there are men to whom the right answer is 
 instantly obvious without any consciousness of calculation 
 on their part. Ask such a man to write a description 
 or put a somewhat complicated thought into words; 
 and he will take my slate and blunder over it in 
 search of words for half an hour, finally putting 
 down the wrong ones ; whilst for a Shakespear the 
 words are there in due style and measure as soon as 
 the consciousness of the thing to be described or the 
 formation of the thought. Now there are pugilists to 
 whom the process of aiming and estimating distance in 
 hitting, of considering the evidence as to what their 
 opponent is going to do, arriving at a conclusion, and 
 devising and carrying out effective counter - measures, 
 is as instantaneous and unconscious as the calculation of

 the born arithmetician or the verbal expression of the 
 born writer. This is not more wonderful than the very- 
 complicated and deeply considered feats of breathing and 
 circulating the blood, which everybody does continually 
 without thinking; but it is much rarer, and so has a 
 miraculous appearance. A man with this gift, and with 
 no physical infirmities to disable him, is a born prize- 
 fighter. He need have no other exceptional qualities, 
 courage least of all : indeed there are instances on record 
 of prizefighters who have only consented to persevere 
 with a winning fight when a mirror has been brought to 
 convince them that their faces were undamaged and their 
 injuries and terrors imaginary. "Stage fright" is as 
 common in the ring as elsewhere : I have myself seen 
 a painful exhibition of it from a very rough customer 
 who presently knocked out his opponent without effort, 
 by instinct. The risks of the ring are limited by rules 
 and conditions to such an extent that the experienced 
 prizefighter is much more afraid of the blackguardism of 
 the spectators than of his opponent : he takes care to 
 have a strong body of supporters in his corner, and to 
 keep carefully away from the opposite corner. Courage 
 is if anything rather scarcer, because less needed, in the 
 ring than out of it ; and there are civil occupations 
 which many successful prizefighters would fail in, or 
 fear to enter, for want of nerve. For the ring, like all 
 romantic institutions, has a natural attraction for hysterical 
 people. 
 
 When a pugilistic genius of the Cashel Byron type 
 appeared in the ring of his day, it soon became evident 
 to the betting men on whom the institution depended, 
 that it was useless to back clever boxers against him ; 
 for, as the younger Lytton said (I quote from memory) — 
 
 Talk not of genius baffled : genius is master of man. 
 
 Genius does what it must ; and Talent does what it can.

 But there is a well-known way of defeating the pugilistic 
 genius. There are hard-fisted, hard-hitting men in the 
 world, who will, with the callousness of a ship's figure- 
 head, and almost with its helplessness in defence, take all 
 the hammering that genius can give them, and, when 
 genius can hammer no more from mere exhaustion, give it 
 back its blows with interest and vanquish it. All pugilism 
 lies between these two extremes — between Cashel Byron 
 and William Paradise ; and it is because the Paradises are 
 as likely to win as the Byrons, and are by no means so 
 scarce, that the case for fist fighting, with gloves or 
 without, as a discipline in the higher athletic qualities, 
 moral and physical, imposes only on people who have no 
 practical knowledge of the subject. 
 
 STEVENSON'S EULOGIUM 
 
 On a previous page I have alluded to a letter from 
 Robert Louis Stevenson to Mr William Archer about 
 Cashel Byron's Profession. Part of that letter has been 
 given to the public in the second volume of Mr Sidney 
 Colvin's edition of Stevenson's letters (Methuen, 1900). 
 But no document concerning a living person of any con- 
 sequence (by which I mean a person with money enough 
 to take an action for libel) is ever published in England 
 unless its contents are wholly complimentary. Stevenson's 
 letters were probably all unfit for publication in this respect. 
 Certainly the one about Cashel Byron's Profession was ; and 
 Mr Sidney Colvin, out of consideration for me and for his 
 publishers and printers, politely abbreviated it. Fortu- 
 nately the original letter is still in the hands of Mr 
 Archer. I need not quote the handsome things which 
 Mr Colvin selected, as they have been extensively

 reprinted in America to help the sale of the reprints 
 there. But here is the suppressed portion, to which I 
 leave the last word, having no more to say than that the 
 book is now reprinted, not from the old Modern Press 
 edition which Stevenson read, but from the revised text 
 issued afterwards by Messrs Walter Scott, from which 
 certain " little bits of Socialism daubed in " for the edifica- 
 tion of the readers of To- Day were either painted out or 
 better harmonized with the rest. I had intended to make 
 no further revision ; and I have in fact made none of any 
 importance ; but in reading the proofs my pen positively 
 jumped to humanize a few passages in which the literary 
 professionalism with which my heroine expresses herself 
 (this professionalism is usually called "style" in England) 
 went past all bearing. I have also indulged myself by 
 varying a few sentences, and inserting one or two new 
 ones, so as to enable the American publisher to secure 
 copyright in this edition. But I have made no attempt 
 to turn an 1882 novel into a twentieth century one; and 
 the few alterations are, except for legal purposes, quite 
 negligeable. 
 
 And now for the suppressed part of Stevenson's verdict, 
 which is in the form of an analysis of the book's com- 
 position : — 
 
 " Charles Reade ..... i part 
 Henry James or some kindred author, 
 
 badly assimilated . . . i part 
 
 Disraeli (perhaps unconscious) . . ^ part 
 
 Struggling, overlaid original talent . i|- part 
 
 Blooming gaseous foUy . . . i part 
 
 " That is the equation as it stands. What it may become, 
 I dent know, nor any other man. Vixere fortes — O, let him 
 remember that — let him beware of his damned century : his 
 gifts of insane chivalry and animated narration are just those

 PROLOGUE 
 
 MoNCRiEF House, Panley Common. Scholastic estab- 
 lishment for the sons of gentlemen, etc. 
 
 Panley Common, viewed from the back windows of 
 Moncrief House, is a tract of grass, furze, and rushes,- 
 stretching away to the western horizon. 
 
 One wet spring afternoon the sky was full of broken 
 clouds ; and the common was swept by their shadows, 
 between which patches of green and yellow gorse were 
 bright in the broken sunHght. The hills to the north- 
 ward were obscured by a heavy shower, traces of which 
 were drying off the slates of the school, a square white 
 building, formerly a gentleman's country house. In 
 front of it was a well-kept lawn with a few dipt holly 
 trees : at the rear, quarter of an acre of land enclosed for 
 the use of the boys. Strollers on the common could 
 hear, at certain hours, a hubbub of voices and racing 
 footsteps within the boundary wall. Sometimes, when 
 the strollers were boys themselves, they climbed to the 
 coping, and saw on the other side a piece of common 
 trampled bare and brown, with a few square yards of

 concrete, so worn into hollows as to be unfit for its 
 original use as a ball alley. Also a long shed, a pump, 
 a dooi; defaced by innumerable incised inscriptions, the 
 back of the house in much worse repair than the front, 
 and about fifty boys in tailless jackets and broad turned- 
 down collars. Whenever the fifty boys perceived a 
 young stranger on the wall, they rushed to the spot with 
 a wild halloo ; overwhelmed him with insult and de- 
 fiance ; and dislodged him by a volley of clods, stones, 
 lumps of bread, and such other projectiles as were at 
 hand. 
 
 On this rainy spring afternoon, a brougham stood at 
 the door of Moncrief House. The coachman, enveloped 
 in a white india-rubber coat, was bestirring himself a 
 little after the recent shower. Withindoors, in the 
 drawing-room. Dr. Moncrief was conversing with a 
 stately lady aged about thirty-five, elegantly dressed, of 
 attractive manner, and beautiful at all points except her 
 complexion, which was deficient in freshness. 
 
 " No progress whatever, I am sorry to say," the doctor 
 was remarking. 
 
 " That is very disappointing," said the lady, contract- 
 ing her brows. 
 
 "It is natural that you should feel disappointed," 
 replied the doctor. "I should myself earnestly advise 
 
 you to try the effect of placing him at some other " 
 
 The doctor stopped. The lady's face had lit with a 
 wonderful smile ; and her hand was up with a bewitching 
 gesture of protest. 
 
 " Oh no, Dr. Moncrief," she said : " I am not disap- 
 pointed with you; but I am all the more angry with 
 Cashel because I know that if he makes no progress here, 
 it must be his own fault. As to taking him away, that 
 is out of the question. I should not have a moment's 
 peace if he were out of your care. I will speak to him

 very seriously about his conduct before I leave to-day. 
 You w^ill give him another trial, vi^ill you not ? " 
 
 "Certainly. With the greatest pleasure," said the 
 doctor, confusing himself by an inept attempt at gallantry. 
 " He shall stay as long as you please. But " — here the 
 doctor became grave again — "you cannot too strongly 
 urge upon him the importance of hard work at the 
 present time, which may be said to be the turning point 
 of his career as a student. He is now nearly seventeen ; 
 and he has so little inclination for study that I doubt 
 whether he could pass the examination necessary to enter 
 one of the universities. You probably wish him to take 
 a degree before he chooses a profession." 
 
 "Yes, of course," said the lady vaguely, evidently 
 assenting to the doctor's remark rather than expressing a 
 conviction of her own. "What profession would you 
 advise for him ? You know so much better than I." 
 
 " Hum ! " said Dr. Moncrief, puzzled. " That would 
 doubtless depend to some extent on his own taste " 
 
 "Not at all," said the lady, interrupting him viva- 
 ciously. "What does he know about the world, poor 
 boy ? His own taste is sure to be something ^ridiculous. 
 Very likely he would want to go on the stage, like me." 
 
 " Oh ! Then you would not encourage any tendency 
 of that sort ? " 
 
 " Most decidedly not. I hope he has no such idea." 
 
 " Not that I am aware of. He shews so little ambi- 
 tion to excel in any particular branch, that I should say 
 his choice of a profession may be best determined by his 
 parents. I am, of course, ignorant whether his relatives 
 possess influence likely to be of use to him. That is 
 often the chief point to be considered, particularly in 
 cases like your son's, where no special aptitude manifests 
 itself." 
 
 " I am the only relative he ever had, poor fellow," said

 the lady, wfth a pensive smile. Then, seeing an expres- 
 sion of astonishment on the doctor's face, she added 
 quickly, "They are all dead." 
 
 "Dear me!" 
 
 " However," she continued, " I have no doubt I can 
 make plenty of interest for him. But I suppose it is 
 difficult to get anything novp^adays without passing 
 competitive examinations. He really must work. If he 
 is lazy he ought to be punished." 
 
 The doctor looked perplexed. " The fact is," he said, 
 " your son can hardly be dealt with as a child any longer. 
 He is still quite - a boy in his habits and ideas ; but 
 physically he is rapidly springing up into a young man. 
 That reminds me of another point on which I will ask 
 you to speak earnestly to him. I must tell you that he 
 has attained some distinction among his school-fellows 
 here as an athlete. Within due bounds I do not dis- 
 courage bodily exercises : they are a r;ecognized part of 
 our system. But I am sorry to say that Cashel has not 
 escaped that tendency to violence which sometimes 
 results from the possession of unusual strength and 
 dexterity. He actually fought with one of the village 
 youths in the main street of Panley some months ago, I 
 am told, though the matter did not come to my ears 
 immediately. He was guilty of a much more serious 
 fault a little later. He and a companion of his obtained 
 leave from me to walk to Panley Abbey together ; but I 
 afterwards found that their real object was to witness a 
 prizefight that took place — illegally, of course — on the 
 common. Apart from the deception practised, I think 
 the taste they betrayed a dangerous one ; and I felt 
 bound to punish them by a severe imposition, and 
 restriction to the grounds for six weeks. I do not hold, 
 however, that everything has been done in these cases 
 when a boy has been punished. I set a high value on a

 mother's influence for softening the natural roughness of 
 boys." 
 
 " I dont think he minds what I say to him in the 
 least," said the lady, with a sympathetic air, as if she 
 pitied the doctor in a matter that chiefly concerned him. 
 "I will speak to him about it, certainly. Fighting is 
 an unbearable habit. His father's people were always 
 fighting ; and they never did any good in the world." 
 
 "If you will be so kind. There are just the three 
 points : the necessity for greater — much greater — 
 ■ application to his studies ; a word to him on the subject 
 of rough habits ; and to sound him as to his choice of a 
 career. I agree with you in not attaching much import- 
 ance to his ideas on that subject as yet. Still, even a 
 ' boyish fancy may be turned to account in rousing the 
 energies of a lad." 
 
 " Quite so," assented the lady. " I shall take care to 
 give him a lecture." 
 
 The doctor looked at her mistrustfully, thinking 
 perhaps that she herself would be the better for a lecture 
 on her duties as a mother. But he did not dare to tell 
 her so : indeed, having a prejudice that actresses were 
 deficient in natural feeling, he doubted the use of daring. 
 He also feared that the subject of her son was beginning 
 to bore her ; and, though a doctor of divinity, he was as 
 reluctant as other men to be found wanting in address 
 by a pretty woman. So he rang the bell, and bade the 
 servant send Master Cashel Byron. Presently a door 
 was heard to open below ; and a buzz of distant voices 
 became audible. The doctor fidgeted and tried to think 
 of something to say ; but his invention failed him : he 
 sat in silence whilst the inarticulate buzz rose into a 
 shouting of " By-ron ! Cash ! " the latter cry imitated 
 from the summons usually addressed to cashiers in haber- 
 dashers' shops. Finally there was a piercing yell of 
 


## p. (#34) #################################################

6 Cash el Byron's Profession 
 
 " Mam-ma-a-a-a-ah ! " apparently in explanation of the 
 demand for Byron's attendance in the drawing-room. 
 The doctor reddened. Mrs. Byron smiled. Then the 
 door below closed, shutting out the tumult ; and footsteps 
 were heard on the stairs. 
 
 " Come in," cried the doctor encouragingly. 
 
 Master Cashel Byron entered blushing ; made his way 
 awkwardly to his mother ; and kissed the critical 
 expression which was on her upturned face as she 
 examined his appearance. Being only seventeen, he had 
 not yet acquired a taste for kissing. He inexpertly gave 
 Mrs. Byron quite a shock by the collision of their teeth. 
 Conscious of the failure, he drew himself upright, and 
 tried to hide his hands, which were exceedingly dirty, in 
 the scanty folds of his jacket. He was a well-grown 
 youth, with strong neck and shoulders, and short auburn 
 hair curling in Httle rings close to his scalp. He had 
 blue eyes, and an expression of boyish good humour, 
 which, however, did not convey any assurance of good 
 temper. 
 
 " How do you do, Cashel ? " said Mrs. Byron, with 
 queenly patronage, after a prolonged look at him. 
 
 " Very well, thanks," said he, grinning and avoiding 
 her eye. 
 
 "Sit down, Byron," said the doctor. Byron suddenly 
 forgot how to sit down, and looked irresolutely from one 
 chair to another. The doctor made a brief excuse, and 
 left the room, much to the relief of his pupil. 
 
 "You have grown greatly, Cashel. And I am afraid 
 you are very awkward." Cashel colored and looked 
 gloomy. 
 
 " I do not know what to do with you," continued 
 Mrs. Byron. " Dr. Moncrief tells me that you are very 
 idle and rough." 
 
 " I am not," said Cashel sulkily. " It is bee "

Prologue 7 
 
 " There is no use in contradicting me in that fashion," 
 said Mrs. Byron, interrupting him sharply. " I am sure 
 that whatever Dr. Moncrief says is perfectly true." 
 
 " He is always talking like that," said Cashel plain- 
 tively. " I cant learn Latin and Greek ; and I dont see 
 what good they are. I work as hard as any of the rest 
 — except the regular stews perhaps. As to my being 
 rough, that is all because I was out one day with Gully 
 Molesworth ; and we saw a crowd on the common ; and 
 when we went to see what was up it was two men 
 fighting. It wasnt our fault that they came there to 
 fight." 
 
 " Yes : I have no doubt that you have fifty good 
 excuses, Cashel. But I will not allow any fighting ; and 
 you really must work harder. Do you ever think of how 
 hard / have to work to pay Dr. Moncrief one hundred 
 and twenty pounds a year for you ? " 
 
 " I work as hard as I can. Old Moncrief seems to 
 think that a fellow ought to do nothing else from 
 morning till night but write Latin verses. Tatham, that 
 the doctor thinks such a genius, does all his constering 
 from cribs. If I had a crib I could conster as well — 
 very likely better." 
 
 " You are very idle, Cashel : I am sure of that. It is 
 too provoking to throw away so much money every year 
 for nothing. Besides, you must soon be thinking of a 
 profession." 
 
 " I shall go into the army," said Cashel. " It is the 
 only profession for a gentleman." 
 
 Mrs. Byron looked at him for a moment as if amazed 
 at his presumption. But she checked herself and only 
 said, " I am afraid you will have to choose some less 
 expensive profession than that. Besides, you would have 
 to pass an examination to enable you to enter the army ; 
 and how can you do that unless you study ? "

8 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 " Oh, I shall do that all right enough when the time 
 comes." 
 
 " Dear, dear ! You are beginning to speak so coarsely, 
 Cashel. After all the pains I took with you at home ! " 
 
 " I speak the same as other people," he replied sullenly. 
 " I dont see the use of being so jolly particular over every 
 syllable. I used to have to stand no end of chafF about 
 my way of speaking. The fellows here know all about 
 you, of course." 
 
 " All about me ? " repeated Mrs. Byron, looking at 
 him curiously. 
 
 "All about your being on the stage, I mean," said 
 Cashel. " You complain of my being rough ; but I 
 should have a precious bad time of it if I didnt lick the 
 chafF out of some of them." 
 
 Mrs. Byron smiled doubtfully to herself, and remained 
 silent and thoughtful for a moment. Then she rose and 
 said, glancing at the weather, " I must go now, Cashel, 
 before another shower begins. And do, pray, try to 
 learn something, and to polish your manners a little. 
 You will have to go to Cambridge soon, you know." 
 
 " Cambridge ! " exclaimed Cashel, excited. " When, 
 mamma ? When ? " 
 
 "Oh, I dont know. Not yet. As soon as Dr. 
 Moncrief says you are fit to go." 
 
 "That will be long enough," said Cashel, much 
 dejected by this reply. "He will not turn ;^I20 a year 
 out of doors in a hurry. He kept big Inglis here until 
 he was past twenty. Look here, mamma : might I go 
 at the end of this half ? I feel sure I should do better at 
 Cambridge than here." 
 
 " Nonsense," said Mrs. Byron decidedly. " I do not 
 expect to have to take you away from Dr. Moncrief for 
 the next eighteen months at least, and not then unless 
 you work properly. Now dont grumble, Cashel : you

 annoy me exceedingly when you do. I am sorry I 
 mentioned Cambridge to you." 
 
 " I would rather go to some other school, then," said 
 Cashel ruefully. " Old Moncrief is so awfully down on me." 
 
 " You only want to leave because you are expected to 
 work here ; and that is the very reason I wish you to stay." 
 
 Cashel m^de no reply ; but his face darkened 
 ominously. 
 
 " I have a word to say to the doctor before I go," she 
 added, reseating herself. " You may return to your play 
 now. Good-bye, Cashel." And she again raised her 
 face to be kissed. 
 
 " Good-bye," said Cashel huskily, as he turned towards 
 the door, pretending that he had not noticed her action. 
 
 " Cashel ! " she said, with emphatic surprise. " Are 
 you sulky ? " 
 
 " No," he retorted angrily. " I havent said anything. 
 I suppose my manners are not good enough. I'm very 
 sorry ; but I cant help it." 
 
 " Very well," said Mrs. Byron firmly. " You can go. 
 I am not pleased with you." 
 
 Cashel walked out of the room and slammed the door. 
 At the foot of the stairs he was stopped by a boy about a 
 year younger than himself, who accosted him eagerly. 
 
 " How much did she give you ? " he whispered. 
 
 " Not a halfpenny," replied Cashel, grinding his teeth. 
 
 " Oh, I say ! " exclaimed the other, deeply disappointed. 
 " That was beastly mean." 
 
 " She's as mean as she can be," said Cashel. " It's all 
 old Monkey's fault. He has been cramming her with 
 lies about me. But she's just as bad as he is. I tell 
 you. Gully, I hate my mother." 
 
 « Oh, come ! " said Gully, shocked. "That's a little 
 too strong, old chap. But she certainly ought to have 
 stood something."

 " I dont know what you intend to do, Gully ; but I 
 mean to bolt. If she thinks I am going to stick here for 
 the next two years, she is jolly much mistaken. 
 
 " It would be an awful lark to bolt," said Gully with 
 a chuckle. "But," he added seriously, "if you really 
 mean it ; by George, I'll go too ! Wilson has just given 
 me a thousand lines ; and I'll be hanged if I do them." 
 
 " Gully," said Cashel, his frown deepening and fixing 
 itself forbiddingly : " I should like to see one of those 
 chaps we saw on the common pitch into the doctor — get 
 him on the ropes, you know." 
 
 Gully's mouth watered. " Yes," he said breathlessly ; 
 "particularly the fellow they called the Fibber. Just 
 one round would be enough for the old beggar. Let s 
 come out into the playground : I shall catch it if I am 
 found here."

 , That night there was just sufficient light struggling 
 through the clouds to make Panley Common visible as a 
 black expanse, against the lightest tone of which a piece 
 of ebony would have appeared pale. Not a human being 
 was stirring within a mile of Moncrief House, the 
 chimneys of which, ghostly white on the side next the 
 moon, threw long shadows on the silver-grey slates. 
 The stillness had just been broken by the stroke of a 
 quarter-past twelve from a distant church tower, when, 
 from the obscurity of one of these chimney shadows, 
 a head emerged. It belonged to a boy, whose body 
 presently came wriggling through an open skylight. 
 When his shoulders were through, he turned himself face 
 upwards ; seized the miniature gable in which the skylight 
 was set ; drew himself completely out ; and made his way 
 stealthily down to the parapet. He was immediately 
 followed by another boy.

Prologue 1 1 
 
 The door of Moncrief House was at the left hand 
 corner of the front, and was surmounted by a tall porch, 
 the top of which was flat and could be used as a balcony. 
 A wall, of the same height as the porch, connected 
 the house front with the boundary wall, and formed 
 part of the incloaure of a fruit garden which lay at the 
 side of the house between the lawn and the playground. 
 When the two boys had crept along the parapet to a 
 point directly above the porch, they stopped ; and each 
 lowered a pair of boots to the balcony by means of fishing 
 lines. When the boots were safely landed, their owners 
 let the lines drop, and re-entered the house by another 
 skylight. A minute elapsed. Then they reappeared on 
 the top of the porch, having come out through the 
 window to which it served as a balcony. Here they 
 put on their boots, and made for the wall of the fruit 
 garden. As they crawled along it, the hindmost boy 
 whispered, 
 • "Isay, Cashy." 
 
 "Shut up, will you," replied the other under his 
 breath. " What's wrong ? " 
 
 " I should like to have one more go at old mother 
 Moncrief 's pear tree : that's all." 
 
 " There are no pears on it at this time of year, you fool." 
 
 " I know. This is the last time we shall go this road, 
 Cashy. Usent it to be a lark ? Eh ? " 
 
 " If you dont shut up, it wont be the last time ; for 
 youll be caught. Now for it." 
 
 Cashel had reached the outer wall ; and he finished 
 his sentence by dropping from the coping to the common. 
 Gully held his breath for some moments after the noise 
 made by his companion's striking the ground. Then he 
 demanded in a whisper whether all was right. 
 
 " Yes," returned Cashel impatiently. " Drop as soft 
 as you can."

 Gully obeyed ; and was so careful lest his .descent 
 should shake the earth and awake the doctor, that his 
 feet shrank from the concussion. He alighted in a 
 sitting posture, and remained there, looking up at Cashel 
 with a stunned expression. 
 
 ",Crickey!" he ejaculated presently. "That was a 
 buster." 
 
 " Get up, I tell you," said Cashel. " I never saw such 
 a jolly ass as you are. Here, up with you ! Have you 
 got your wind back ? " 
 
 " I should think so. Bet you twopence I'll be first at 
 the cross roads. I say : let's pull the bell at the front 
 gate and give an awful yell before we start. They'll 
 never catch us." 
 
 " Yes," said Cashel ironically : " I fancy I see myself 
 doing it, or you either. Now then. One, two, three, 
 and away." 
 
 They ran off together, and reached the cross roads 
 about eight minutes later : Gully completely out of 
 breath, and Cashel nearly so. Here, according to their 
 plan. Gully was to take the north road and run to 
 Scotland, where he felt sure his uncle's gamekeeper 
 would hide him. Cashel was to go to sea, so that if his 
 affairs became desperate, he could at least turn pirate, 
 and achieve eminence in that profession by adding a 
 chivalrous humanity to the ruder virtues for which it is 
 already famous. 
 
 Cashel waited until Gully had recovered from his race. 
 Then he said, 
 
 " Now, old fellow. Weve got to separate." 
 
 Gully, confronted with the lonely realities of his 
 scheme, did not like the prospect. After a moment's 
 reflection he exclaimed, 
 
 "Damme, old chap, I'll come with you. Scotland 
 may go and be hanged."

 But Cashel, being the stronger of the two, was as 
 anxious to get rid of Gully as Gully was to cling to 
 him. "No," he said, "I'm going to rough it; and 
 you wouldnt be able for that. Youre not strong enough 
 for a sea life. Why, man, those sailor fellows are as 
 hard as nails ; and even they can hardly stand it." 
 
 "Well, then, do you come with me," urged Gully. 
 " My uncle's gamekeeper wont mind. He's a jolly good 
 sort ; and we shall have no end of shooting." 
 
 "That's all very well for you. Gully; but I dont 
 know your uncle ; and I'm not going to put myself under 
 a coiflpliment to his gamekeeper. Besides, we should run 
 too much risk of being caught if we went through the 
 country together. Of course I should be only too glad 
 if we could stick to one another ; but it wouldnt do : I 
 feel certain we should be nabbed. Good-bye." 
 
 " But wait a minute," pleaded Gully. " Suppose they 
 do try to catch us : we shall have a better chance against 
 them if there are two of us." 
 
 "Stuff!" said Cashel. "That's all boyish nonsense. 
 There will be at least six policemen sent after us ; and 
 even if I did my very best, I could barely lick two if 
 they came on together. And you would hardly be able 
 for one. You just keep moving, and dont go near any 
 railway station ; and you will get to Scotland all safe 
 enough. Look here : weve wasted five minutes already. 
 Ive got my wind now ; and I must be oiF. Good-bye." 
 
 Gully disdained to press his company on Cashel any 
 further. "Good-bye," he said, mournfully shaking his 
 hand. "Success, old chap." 
 
 " Success ! " echoed Cashel, grasping Gully's hand with 
 a pang of remorse for leaving him. " I'll write to you as 
 soon as I have anything to tell you. I may be some 
 months, you know, before I get regularly settled." 
 
 He gave Gully a final squeeze ; released him ; and

 darted off along the road leading to Panley Village. 
 Gully looked after him a moment, and then ran away 
 Scotlandwards. 
 
 Panley Village is nothing but a High Street, with an 
 old-fashioned inn at one end, a modern railway station 
 and bridge at the other, and a pump and pound midway 
 between. Cashel stood for a while in the shadow under 
 the bridge before venturing along the broad moonlit 
 street. Seeing no one, he stepped out at a brisk walking 
 pace ; for he had by this time reflected that it was not 
 possible to run all the way to the Spanish main. There 
 was, however, another person stirring in the village 
 besides Cashel. This was Mr. Wilson, Dr. Moncrief's 
 professor of mathematics, who was returning from a 
 visit to the theatre. Mr. Wilson believed that theatres 
 were wicked places, to be visited by respectable men 
 only on rare occasions and by stealth. The only plays 
 he went openly to witness were those of Shakespear ; 
 and his favourite was " As you like it " : Rosalind in 
 tights having an attraction for him which he missed 
 from Lady Macbeth in petticoats. This evening he had 
 seen Rosalind impersonated by a famous actress, who had 
 come to a neighboring town on a starring tour. After 
 the performance he had returned to Panley to sup there 
 with a friend, and was now making his way back to 
 Moncrief House. He was in a frame of mind fevorable 
 for the capture of a runaway boy. An habitual delight in 
 being too clever for his pupils, fostered by frequently over- 
 reaching them in mathematics, was just now stimulated by 
 the effect of a liberal supper and the roguish consciousness 
 of having been to the play. He saw and recognized Cashel 
 as he approached the village pound. Understanding the 
 situation at once, he hid behind the pump ; waited until the 
 unsuspecting truant was passing within arm's length ; and 
 then pounced out and seized him by the collar of his jacket.

Prologue 15' 
 
 " Well, sir," he said. " What are you doing here at 
 this hour ? Eh ? " 
 
 Cashel, scared and white, looked at him, and could 
 not answer a word. 
 
 " Come along with me," said Wilson sternly. 
 
 Cashel suffered himself to be led some twenty yards. 
 Then he stopped and burst into tears. 
 
 " There is no use in my going back," he said. " I 
 have never done any good there. I cant go back." 
 
 " Indeed," said Wilson, with magisterial sarcasm. 
 " We shall try to make you do better in future." And 
 he forced the fugitive to resume his march. 
 
 Cashel, bitterly humiliated by his own tears, and 
 exasperated by a certain cold triumph which Wilson 
 evinced on witnessing them, did not go many steps 
 further without protest. 
 
 " You neednt hold me," he said angrily : " I can 
 walk without being held." The master tightened his 
 grasp and pushed his captive forward. " I wont run 
 away, sir," said Cashel more humbly, shedding fresh 
 tears. "Please let me go," he added in a suffocated 
 voice, trying to turn his face towards his captor. But 
 Wilson twisted him back again, and still urged him 
 onward. Cashel cried out passionately, "Let me go," 
 and struggled to break loose. 
 
 "Come, come, Byron," said the master, controlling 
 him with a broad strong hand : " none of your nonsense, 
 sir." 
 
 Then Cashel suddenly slipped out of his jacket ; 
 turned on Wilson ; and struck up at him savagely with 
 his right fist. The master received the blow just beside 
 the point of his chin ; and his eyes seemed to Cashel to 
 roll up and fall back into his head with the shock. He 
 drooped forward for a moment, and fell in a heap face 
 downwards, Cashel recoiled, wringing his hand to

 relieve the tingling of his knuckles, and terrified by the 
 possibility that he had committed murder. But Wilson 
 presently moved and dispelled that misgiving. Some of 
 Cashel's fury returned as he shook his fist at his prostrate 
 adversary, and, exclaiming, "Taa w^ont brag much of 
 having seen me cry," wrenched the jacket from him with 
 unnecessary violence, and darted away at full speed. 
 
 Mr. Wilson, though he was soon conscious and able 
 to rise, did not at first feel disposed to stir. He began 
 to moan, with a dazed faith that some one would eventu- 
 ally come to him vvith sympathy and assistance. But 
 the lapse of time brought nothing but increased cold and 
 pain.. It occurred to him that if the police found him 
 they might suppose him to be drunk ; also that it was 
 his duty to go to them and give the alarm. He rose, 
 and, after a struggle with dizziness and nausea, concluded 
 that his most pressing duty was to get to bed, and leave 
 Dr. Moncrief to recapture his ruiBanly pupil as best he 
 could. 
 
 At half-past one o'clock the doctor was roused by a 
 knocking at his chamber-door, outside which he found 
 his professor of mathematics, bruised, muddy, and appar- 
 ently inebriated. Some minutes were lost before Wilson 
 could get his principal's mind on the right track. Then 
 the boys were awakened and the roll called. Byron and 
 Molesworth were reported absent. No one had seen 
 them go : no one had the least suspicion of how they 
 had got out of the house. One little boy mentioned the 
 skylight ; but, observing a threatening expression on the 
 faces of a few of the bigger boys, who were fond of fruit, 
 he did not press his suggestion, and submitted to be 
 snubbed by the doctor for having made it. It was nearly 
 three o'clock before the alarm reached the village, where 
 the authorities tacitly declined to trouble themselves 
 about it until morning. The doctor, convinced that

Prologue 1 7 
 
 the lad had gone to his mother, did not believe that any 
 search was necessary, and contented himself with writing 
 a note to Mrs. Byron describing the attack on Mr. 
 Wilson, and expressing regret that no proposal having 
 for its object the readmission of Master Byron to the 
 academy could be eiitertained. 
 
 The pursuit was now directed entirely after Moles- 
 worth, as it was plain, from Mr. Wilson's narrative, that 
 he had separated from Cashel outside Panley. Informa- 
 tion was soon forthcoming. Peasants in all parts of the 
 country had seen, they said, " a lad that might be him." 
 The search lasted until five o'clock next afternoon, when 
 it was terminated by the appearance of Gully in person, 
 footsore and repentant. After parting from Cashel and 
 walking two miles, he had lost heart and turned back. 
 Halfway to the cross roads he had reproached himself 
 with cowardice, and resumed his flight. This time he 
 placed eight miles betwixt himself and Mqncrief House. 
 Then he left the road to make a short cut through a 
 plantation, and went astray. After wandering dejectedly 
 until morning, he saw a woman working in a field, and 
 asked her the shortest way to Scotland. She had never 
 heard of Scotland ; and when he asked the way to Panley, 
 she grew suspicious and threatened to set her dog at him. 
 This discouraged him so much that he was afraid to 
 speak to the other strangers whom he met. Steering by 
 the sun, he oscillated between Scotland and Panley 
 according to the fluctuation of his courage. At last he 
 yielded to hunger, fatigue, and loneliness ; devoted his 
 remaining energy to the task of getting back to school ; 
 struck the common at last ; and hastened to surrender 
 himself to the doctor, who menaced him with immediate 
 expulsion. Gully was greatly concerned at the prospect 
 of being compelled to leave the place he had just run 
 away from ; and earnestly begged the doctor to give- him 
 
 c 
 


## p. (#46) #################################################

1 8 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 another chance. His prayer was granted. After a pro- 
 longed lecture, the doctor, in consideration of the facts 
 that Gully, though corrupted by the example of a 
 desperate associate, had proved the sincerity of his re- 
 pentance by coming back of his own accord, and had 
 not been accessory to the concussion of the brain from 
 which Mr. Wilson supposed himself to be suffering, 
 accepted his promise of amendment and gave him a free 
 pardon. Gully accordingly attempted for the first time 
 in his life to play the part of the studious and sensible 
 boy ; and was so much struck by the safety, credit, and 
 self-satisfaction which it gained for him, that he kept it 
 up to the end of his schooldays. Yet he did not lose 
 the esteem of his comrades ; for he succeeded in con- 
 vincing them, by the license of his private conversation, 
 that his reformation was only a consummate imposture, 
 of which that common enemy, the principal, was the un- 
 pitied dupe. ' 
 
 Meanwhile, Mrs. Byron, not suspecting the import- 
 ance of the doctor's note, and happening to be in a hurry 
 when it arrived, laid it by unopened, intending to read it 
 at her leisure. She would have forgotten it altogether 
 but for a second note which came two days later, re- 
 questing some acknowledgment of the previous com- 
 munication. On learning the truth she immediately 
 drove to Moncrief House, and there abused the doctor 
 as he had never been abused in his life before ; after 
 which she begged his pardon, and implored him to assist 
 her to recover her darling boy. When he suggested that 
 she should offer a reward for information and capture, 
 she indignantly refused to spend a farthing on the little 
 ingrate ; wept and accused herself of having driven him 
 away by her unkindness ; stormed and accused the 
 doctor of having treated him harshly ; and finally said 
 that she would give ;^ioo to have him back, but that she

 would never speak to him again. The doctor promised 
 to undertake the search, and would have promised any- 
 thing to get rid of his visitor. A reward of ^^5 was 
 offered. But whether the fear of falling into the clutches 
 of the law for murderous assault stimulated Cashel to 
 extraordinary precaution, or whether he had contrived 
 to leave the country in the four days between his flight 
 and the offer of the reward, the doctor's efforts were 
 unsuccessful ; and he had to confess their failure to 
 Mrs. Byron. She agreeably surprised him by writing a 
 pleasant letter to the effect that it was very provoking, 
 and that she could never thank him sufficiently for all 
 the trouble he had taken. And so the matter dropped. 
 
 Ill 
 
 There was at this time in the city of Melbourne, in 
 Australia, a wooden building, above the door of which 
 was a board inscribed GYMNASIUM AND SCHOOL 
 OF ARMS. In the long narrow entry hung a framed 
 manuscript which set forth that Ned Skene, ex-champion 
 of England and the Colonies, was to be heard of within 
 by gentlemen desirous of becoming proficient in the art 
 of self-defence. Also the terms on which Mrs. Skene, 
 assisted by a competent staff of professors, would give 
 lessons in dancing, deportment, and calisthenics. 
 
 One evening a man sat smoking on a common kitchen 
 chair on the threshold of this establishment. Beside 
 him were some tin tacks and a hammer. He had just 
 nailed to the doorpost a card on which was written in a 
 woman's handwriting : " Wanted, a male attendant who 
 can keep accounts. Inquire within^'' The smoker was a 
 powerful man, with a thick neck that swelled out beneath 
 his broad flat ear-lobes. He had small eyes, and large

 teeth over which his lips were slightly parted in a smile, 
 good-humored but affectedly curming. His hair was 
 bkck and close cut, his skin indurated, and the bridge 
 of his nose smashed level with his face. The tip, how- 
 ever, was uninjured. It was squab and glossy, and, by 
 giving the whole feature an air of being on the point of 
 expanding to its original shape, produced a snubbed 
 expression which relieved the otherwise formidable aspect 
 of the man, and recommended him as probably a modest 
 and affable fellow when sober and unprovoked. He 
 seemed about fifty years of age, and was clad in a straw 
 hat and a suit of white linen. 
 
 Before he had finished his pipe, the card on the door- 
 post attracted the attention of a youth attired in a coarse 
 sailor's jersey and a pair of grey tweed trousers which he 
 had outgrown. 
 
 " Looking for a job ? " inquired the ex-champion of 
 England and the Colonies. 
 
 The youth blushed and replied, " Yes. I should like 
 to get something to do." 
 
 Mr. Skene stared at him with stern curiosity. His 
 professional pursuits had femiliarized him with the 
 manners and speech of English gentlemen ; and he 
 immediately recognized the shabby sailor lad as one of 
 that class. 
 
 " Perhaps youre a scholar," said the prizefighter, after 
 a moment's reflection. 
 
 " I have been at school ; but I didnt learn much 
 there. I think I could book-keep by double entry." 
 
 " Double entry ! What's that ? " 
 
 " It's the way merchants' books are kept. It is called 
 so because everything is entered twice over." 
 
 " Ah ! " said Skene, unfavorably impressed by the 
 system : "once is enough for me. What's your weight ? " 
 
 " I dont know," said the lad with a grin. 
 


## p. (#49) #################################################

Prologue 2 1 
 
 " Not know vour own weight ! That aint the way 
 to get on in life." 
 
 " I havent been weighed since a long time ago* in 
 England," said the other, beginning to get the better of 
 his shyness. " I was eight stone four then ; so you see 
 I am only a light weight." 
 
 " Ana what do you know about light weights ? 
 Perhaps, being so well educated, you know how to 
 fight. Eh?" 
 
 " I dont think I could fight you," said the youth, with 
 another grin. 
 
 Skene chuckled ; and the stranger, with boyish 
 communicativeness, gave him an account of a real fight 
 (meaning apparently one between professional pugilists) 
 which he had seen m England. He went on to describe 
 how he had himself knocked down a master with one 
 blow when running away from school. Skene received 
 this sceptically, and cross-examined the narrator as to the 
 manner and effect of the blow, with the result of con- 
 vincing himself that the story was true. At the end of 
 quarter of an hour, the lad had commended himself so 
 acceptably by his conversation that the champion took 
 him into the gymnasium, where he weighed him ; 
 measured him ; and finally handed him a pair of boxing 
 gloves and invited him to shew what he was made of. 
 The youth, though impressed by the prizefighter's 
 attitude with a hopeless sense of the impossibility of 
 reaching him, rushed boldly at him several times, knock- 
 ing his face on each occasion against Skene's left fist, 
 which seemed to be ubiquitous, and to have the power 
 of imparting the consistency of iron to padded leather. 
 At last the novice directed a frantic assault at the 
 champion's nose, rising on his toes in that aspiration. 
 Skene stopped the blow with a jerk of his right elbow ; 
 and the impetuous youth spun and stumbled away until

22 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 he fell supine in a corner, rapping his head smartly on 
 the floor at the same time. He rose with unabated 
 cheerfulness and offered to continue the combat ; but 
 Skene declined any further exercise just then, though he 
 was so much pleased with his novice's game that he 
 promised to give him a scientific education and make a 
 man of him. 
 
 The champion now sent for his wife, whom he revered 
 as a pre-eminently sensible and well-mannered woman. 
 The new comer could see in her only a ridiculous 
 dancing mistress; but he treated her with great defer- 
 ence, and thereby improved the high opinion which 
 Skene had already formed of him. He related to her 
 how, after running away from school, he had made his 
 way to Liverpool ; gone to the docks ; and contrived to 
 hide himself on board a ship bound for Australia. Also 
 how he had suffered severely from hunger and thirst 
 before he discovered himself; and how, notwithstanding 
 his unpopular position as stowaway, he had been fairly 
 treated as soon as he had shewn that he was willing to 
 work. And in proof that he was still willing, and had 
 profited by his maritime experience, he offered to sweep 
 the floor of the gymnasium then and there. This 
 proposal convinced the Skenes, who had listened to his 
 story like children listening to a fairy tale, that he was 
 not too much of a gentleman to do rough work ; and it 
 was presently arranged that he should thenceforth board 
 and lodge with them ; have five shillings a week for 
 pocket money ; and be man of all work, servant, gym- 
 nasium attendant, clerk, and apprentice to the ex- 
 champion of England and the Colonies. 
 
 He soon found his bargain no easy one. The gym- 
 nasium was open from nine in the morning until eleven 
 at night ; and the athletic gentlemen who came there not 
 only ordered him about without ceremony, but varied 
 


## p. (#51) #################################################

Prologue 2 3 
 
 the monotony of vainly opposing the invincible Skene, 
 by practising what he taught them on the person of his 
 apprentice, w^hom they pounded virith great relish, and 
 threw backwards, forwards, and over their shoulders as 
 though he had been but a senseless effigy provided for 
 that purpose. The champion looked on and laughed, 
 being too lazy to redeem his promise of teaching the 
 novice to defend himself. The latter, however, watched 
 the lessons he saw daily given to the others ; and 
 before the end of the month he so completely turned the 
 tables on the amateur pugilists of Melbourne that Skene 
 one day took occasion to remark that he was growing 
 uncommon clever, but that gentlemen liked to be played 
 easy with, and that he should be careful not to knock 
 them about too much. Besides these bodily exertions, 
 he had to keep account of gloves and foils sold and 
 bought, and of the fees due both to Mr. and Mrs. Skene. 
 This was the most irksome part of his duty; for he wrote 
 a large schoolboy , hand, and was not quick at figures. 
 When he at last began to assist his master in giving 
 lessons, the accounts had fallen into arrear ; and Mrs. 
 Skene had to resume her former care of them : a circum- 
 stance which gratified her husband, who regarded it as 
 a fresh triumph of her superior intelligence. Then a 
 Chinaman was engaged to do the more menial work of 
 the establishment. "Skene's Novice," as he was now 
 generally called, was elevated to the rank of assistant 
 professor to the champion, and became a person of some 
 consequence in the gymnasium. 
 
 He had been there more than nine months, and had 
 developed into an athletic young man of eighteen with a 
 keen eye for a tip, and a scale of " Thank you, sirs " 
 nicely graduated from half-a-crown to a sovereign, when 
 an important conversation took place between him and 
 his principal. It was evening ; and the only persons in

 the gymnasium were Ned Skene, who sat smoking at his 
 ease with his coat ofF, and the novice, who had just 
 come downstairs from his bedroom, where he had been 
 preparing for a visit to the theatre. 
 
 " Well, my gentleman," said Skene mockingly : 
 " youre a fancy man, you are. Gloves, too ! Theyre 
 too small for you. Dont you get hittin nobody with 
 them on, or youll mebbe sprain your wrist." 
 
 " Not much fear of that," said the novice, looking at 
 his watch. Finding that he had some minutes to spare, 
 he sat down opposite Skene. 
 
 " No," assented the champion. " When you rise to 
 be a regular professional, you wont care to spar with 
 nobody without youre well paid for it." 
 
 " I may say I am in the profession already. You dont 
 call me an amateur, do you ? " 
 
 " Oh no," said Skene : " not so bad as that. But 
 mind you, my boy, I dont call no man a fighting man 
 what aint been in the ring. Youre a sparrer, and a 
 clever, pretty sparrer ; but sparring aint the real thing- 
 Some day, please God, we'll make up a little match for 
 you, and shew what you can do without the gloves." 
 
 " I would just as soon have the gloves ofF as on," said 
 the novice, a little sulkily. 
 
 " That's because you have a heart as big as a lion," 
 said Skene, soothingly. But the novice, accustomed to 
 hear his master pay the same compliment to his patrons 
 whenever they were seized with fits of boasting (which 
 usually happened when they got worsted), looked obdurate 
 and said nothing. 
 
 " Sam Ducket of Milltown was here to-day while you 
 was out giving Captain Noble his lesson," continued 
 Skene, watching his apprentice's face. " Now Sam is a 
 real fighting man, if you like." 
 
 " I dont think much of him. He's a liar, for one thing." 
 


## p. (#53) #################################################

Prologue 25 
 
 "That's a failing of the profession. I dont mind 
 telling you so," said Skene mournfully. Now the novice 
 had found out this for himself already. He never, for 
 instance, believed the accounts which his master gave of 
 the accidents and conspiracies which had led to his being 
 defeated three times in the ring. However, as Skene 
 had won fifteen battles, his next remark was undeniable. 
 "Men fight none the worse for being liars. Sam Ducket 
 bet Ebony Muley in twenty minutes." 
 
 " Yes," said the novice scornfully ; " and what is 
 Ebony Muley ? A wretched old nigger nearly sixty 
 years old, who is drunk seven days in the week, and 
 would sell a fight for a glass of brandy ! Ducket ought 
 to have knocked him out of time in twenty seconds. 
 Ducket has no science." 
 
 " Not a bit," said Ned. " But he has lots of game." 
 
 " Pshaw ! That's what they always try to make out. 
 If a fellow knows how to box, they say he has science 
 but no pluck. If he doesnt know his right hand from 
 bis left, they say that he isnt clever, but that he's full of 
 game." 
 
 Skene looked with secret wonder at his pupil, whose 
 powers of observation and expression sometimes seemed 
 to him almost to rival those of Mrs. Skene. " Sam was 
 sayin something like that to-day," he remarked. "He 
 says youre only a sparrer, and that youd fall down with 
 fright if you was put into a twenty-four foot ring." 
 
 The novice flushed. " I wish I had been here when 
 Sam Ducket said that." 
 
 " Why, what could you ha' done to him ? " said 
 Skene, his small eyes twinkling. 
 
 "I'd have punched his head : that's what I could and 
 would have done to him." 
 
 " Why, man, he'd eat you." 
 
 " He might. And he might eat you too, Ned, if he

 had salt enough with you. He talks big because he 
 knows I have no money ; and he pretends he wont strip 
 for less than fifty pounds a side." 
 
 " No money ! " cried Skene. " I know them as'll 
 make up fifty pound before twelve to-morrow for any 
 man as I will answer for. There'd be a start for a young 
 man ! Why, my fust fight was for five shillings in 
 Tott'nam Fields ; and proud I was when I won it. I 
 dont want to set you on to fight a crack like , Sam 
 Ducket anyway against your inclinations ; but dont go 
 to say that money isnt to be had. Let Ned Skene pint 
 to a young man and say, 'That's the young man that 
 Ned backs ' ; and others'll come forard with the stakes 
 — aye, crowds, of em." 
 
 The novice hesitated. " Do you think I ought to, 
 Ned ? " he said. 
 
 " That aint for me to say," said Skene doggedly. " I 
 know what I would ha' said at your age. But perhaps 
 youre right to be cautious. I tell you the truth, I 
 wouldnt care to see you whipped by the like of Sam 
 Ducket." 
 
 " Will you train me if I challenge him ? " 
 
 " Will I train you ! " echoed Skene, rising with 
 enthusiasm. " Aye will I train you, and put my money 
 on you too ; and you shall knock fireworks out of him, 
 my boy, as sure as my name's Ned Skene." 
 
 " Then," cried the novice, reddening with excitement, 
 "I'll fight him^ And if I lick him, you will have to 
 hand over your belt as champion of the colonies to me." 
 
 " So I will," said Skene affectionately. " Dont. stay 
 out late ; and dont for your life touch a drop of liquor. 
 You must go into training to-morrow." 
 
 This was Cashel Byron's first professional engagement.

CHAPTER 1 
 
 WiLTSTOKEN Castle was a square building with circular 
 bastions at the corners : each bastion terminating skyward 
 in a Turkish minaret. The south-west face was the 
 front, pierced by a Moorish arch fitted with glass doors, 
 which could be secured on occasion by gates of fantastic- 
 ally hammered iron. The arch was enshrined by a 
 Palladian portico, which rose to the roof, and was sur- 
 mounted by an open pediment, in the cleft of which 
 stood a black marble figure of an Egyptian, erect, and 
 gazing steadfastly at the midday sun. On the ground 
 beneath was an Italian terrace with two great stone 
 elephants at the ends of the balustrade. The windows 
 of the upper storey were, like the entrance, Moorish ; 
 but the principal ones below were square bays, mullioned. 
 The castle was considered grand hj the illiterate ; but 
 architects, and readers of books on architecture, con- 
 demned it as a nondescript mixture of styles in the worst 
 possible taste. It stood on an eminence surrounded by 
 hilly woodland, thirty acres of which were enclosed as 
 Wiltstoken Park. Half a mile south was the little town 
 of Wiltstoken, accessible by rail from London in about 
 two hours. 
 
 Most of the inhabitants of Wiltstoken were Con- 
 servatives. They stood in awe of the Castle ; and some 
 of them would at any time have cut half a dozen of

 their oldest friends to obtain an invitation to dinner, or 
 even a bow in public, from Miss Lydia Carev^, its orphan 
 mistress. This Miss Carewr w^as a remarkable person. 
 She had inherited the Castle and park from her aunt, 
 who had considered her niece's large fortune in railways 
 and mines incomplete without land. So many other 
 legacies had Lydia received from kinsfolk who hated 
 poor relations, that she was now, in her twenty- fifth 
 year, the independent possessor of an annual income 
 equal to the year's earnings of five hundred workmen, 
 and under no external compulsion to do anything in 
 return for it. In addition to the advantage of being a 
 single woman with unusually large means, she enjoyed 
 a reputation for vast learning and exquisite culture. It 
 was said in Wiltstoken that she knew forty-eight living 
 languages and all the dead ones ; could play on every 
 known musical instrument ; was an accomplished painter ; 
 and had written poetry. All this might as well have 
 been true as far as the Wiltstokeners were concerned, 
 since she knew more than they. She had spent her life 
 travelling with her father, a man of active mind and bad 
 digestion, with an independent income, and a taste for 
 sociology, science in general, and the fine arts. On 
 these subjects he had written books, mostly about the 
 Renaissance, by which he had earned a reputation as a 
 sort of culture merchant for tourists. They involved 
 much reading, travelling, sight-seeing, and theorizing, of 
 all which, except the theorizing, his daughter had done 
 her share, and indeed, as she grew more competent, and 
 he weaker and older, more than her share. Having had 
 to combine health-hunting with culture-distillation, and 
 being very irritable and fastidious, he had schooled 
 her in self-control and endurance by harder lessons 
 than those which had made her acquainted with the 
 works of Greek and German philosophers long before

 she understood the English into which she translated 
 them. 
 
 When Lydia was in her twenty-first year, her father's 
 health &iled seriously. He became more dependent on 
 her ; and she anticipated that he would also become 
 more exacting in his demands on her time. But one 
 day, at Naples, she had arranged to go riding with a 
 newly arrived and rather pleasant English party. Shortly 
 before the appointed hour, he asked her to make a 
 translation of a long extract from Lessing. Lydia, 
 in whom self- questionings as to the justness of her 
 father's yoke had for some time been stirring, paused 
 thoughtfully for perhaps two seconds before she con- 
 sented. Carew said nothing ; but he presently inter- 
 cepted a servant who was bearing an apology to the 
 English party ; read the note ; and went back to his 
 daughter, who was already busy at Lessing. 
 
 "Lydia," he said, with a certain hesitation which she 
 would have ascribed to shyness had that been at all 
 credible of her father when addressing her : " I wish you 
 never to postpone your business to literary trifling." 
 
 She looked at him with the vague fear that accom- 
 panies a new and doubtful experience ; and he, dissatisfied 
 with his way of putting the case, added, " It is of greater 
 importance that you should enjoy yourself for an hour 
 than that my book should be advanced. Far greater ! " 
 
 Lydia, after some consideration, put down her pen 
 and said, " I shall not enjoy riding if there is anything 
 else left undone." 
 
 " I shall not enjoy your writing if your excursion is 
 given up for it," he said. " I prefer your going." 
 
 Lydia obeyed silently. An odd thought struck her 
 that she might end the matter gracefully by kissing him. 
 But they were unaccustomed to make demonstrations of 
 this kind ; so nothing came of the impulse. She spent

 the day on horseback ; reconsidered her late rebellious 
 thoughts ; and made the translation in the evening. 
 
 Thenceforth, Lydia had a growing sense of the power 
 she had unwittingly been acquiring during her long 
 subordination. Timidly at first, and more boldly as she 
 became used to dispense with the parental leading strings, 
 she began to follow her own bent in selecting subjects 
 for study, and even to defend certain recent develop- 
 ments in music and painting against her father's con- 
 servatism. He approved of this independent mental 
 activity on her part, and repeatedly warned her not to 
 pin her faith more on him than on any other critic. 
 She once told him that one of her incentives to dis- 
 agree with him was the pleasure it gave her to find out 
 ultimately that he was right. He replied gravely, 
 
 " That pleases me, Lydia, because I believe you. But 
 such things are better left unsaid. They seem to belong 
 to the art of pleasing, which you will perhaps soon be 
 tempted to practise, because it seems to all young people 
 easy, well-paid, amiable, and a mark of good breeding. 
 In truth it is vulgar, cowardly, egotistical, and insincere : 
 a virtue in a shopman : a vice in a free woman. It is 
 better to leave genuine praise unspoken than to expose 
 yourself to the suspicion of flattery." 
 
 Shortly after this, at his desire, she spent a season in 
 London, and went into English polite society, which 
 she found to be in Jthe main a temple for the worship 
 of riches and a market for the sale of virgins. Having 
 become familiar with both the cult and the trade else- 
 where, she found nothing to interest her except the 
 English manner of conducting them ; and the novelty 
 of this soon wore ofF. She was also incommoded by her 
 involuntary power of inspiring affection in her own sex. 
 Impulsive girls she could keep in awe ; but old women, 
 notably two aunts who had never paid her any attention

 during her childhood, now persecuted her with slavish 
 fondness, and tempted her by mingled entreaties and 
 bribes to desert her father and live with them for the 
 remainder of their lives. Her reserve fanned their long- 
 ing to have her for a pet ; and, to escape them, she 
 returned to the continent with her father, and ceased 
 to hold any correspondence with London. Her aunts 
 declared themselves deeply hurt ; and Lydia was held to 
 have treated them very injudiciously ; but when they 
 died, and their wills became public, it was found that 
 they had vied with one another in enriching her. 
 
 When she was twenty-five years old, the first startling 
 event of her life took place. This was the death of her 
 father at Avignon. No endearments passed between 
 them even on that occasion. She was sitting opposite 
 to him at the fireside one evening, reading aloud, when 
 he suddenly said, " My heart has stopped, Lydia. Good- 
 bye ! " and immediately died. She had some difficulty 
 in quelling the tumult that arose when the bell was 
 answered. The whole household felt bound to be over- 
 whelmed, and took it rather ill that she seemed neither 
 grateful to them nor disposed to imitate their behaviour. 
 
 Carew's relatives agreed that he had made a most 
 unbecoming will. It was a brief document, dated five 
 years before his death, and was to the effect that he 
 bequeathed to his dear daughter Lydia all he possessed! 
 He had, however, left her certain private instructions. 
 One of these, which excited great indignation in his 
 family, was that his body should be conveyed to Milan, 
 and there cremated. Having disposed of her father's 
 remains as he had directed, she came to set her affairs 
 in order in England, where she inspired much hopeless 
 passion in the toilers in Lincoln's Inn Fields and Chancery 
 Lane, and disconcerted her solicitors by evincing a 
 capacity for business hardly compatible with the docility

 they expected from a rich and unprotected young lady. 
 When all was arranged, and she was once more able to 
 enjoy a settled tranquillity, she returned to Avignon, and 
 there discharged her last duty to her father. This was 
 to open a letter she had found in his desk, inscribed by 
 his hand, "For Lydia. To be read by her at leisure 
 when I and my affairs shall be finally disposed of." The 
 letter ran thus : — 
 
 " My Dear Lydia, 
 
 "I belong to the great company of dis- 
 appointed men. But for you, I should now write 
 myself down a failure like the rest. It is only a few 
 years since it first struck me that although I had failed 
 in many vain ambitions with which (having failed) I 
 need not trouble you now, I had been of some use as a 
 father. Upon this it came into my mind that you could 
 draw no other conclusion from the course of our life 
 together than that I have, with entire selfishness, used 
 you throughout as my mere amanuensis and . clerk, and 
 that you are under no more obligation to me for your 
 attainments thar^ slave is to his master for the strength 
 which enforced *kbor has given to his muscles. Lest 
 I should leave you suffering from so mischievous and 
 oppressive an influence as a sense of injustice, I now 
 justify myself to you. 
 
 " I have never asked you whether you remember your 
 mother. Had you at any time broached the subject, 
 I should have spoken quite freely to you on it ; but as 
 some wise instinct led you to avoid it, I was content to 
 let it rest until circumstances such as the present should 
 render further reserve unnecessary. If any regret at 
 having known so little of the woman who gave you 
 birth troubles you, shake it oiF without remorse. She 
 was an egotist who could keep neither husband, child,

 servant, nor friend, under the same roof with her. I 
 speak dispassionately. All my bitter personal feeling 
 against her is as dead whilst I write as it will be when 
 you read. I have even come to regard tenderly certain 
 of her characteristics which you inherit ; so that I can 
 confidently say that I never, since the perishing of the 
 infetuation in which I married, felt more kindly towards 
 her than I do now. I made the best, and she the worst, 
 of our union for six years ; and then we parted. I 
 permitted her to give what account of the separation she 
 pleased, and made her a much more liberal allowance 
 than she had any right to expect. By these means I 
 induced her to leave me in undisturbed possession of 
 you, whom I had already, as a measure of precaution, 
 carried off to Belgium. The reason why we never 
 visited England during her lifetime was that she could, 
 and probably would, have made my previous conduct 
 and my hostility to popular religion an excuse for wrest- 
 ing you from me. I need say no more of her, and am 
 sorry it was necessary to mention her at all. 
 
 " I will now tell you what induced me to secure you 
 for myself. It was not natural affectioifff I did not love 
 you then ; and I knew that you wousld Ae a serious 
 'encumbrance to me. But having brought you into the 
 world, and then broken through my engagements with 
 your mother, I felt bound to see that you' should not 
 suffer for my mistake. Gladly would I have persuaded 
 myself that she was (as the gossips said) the fittest person 
 to have charge of you ; but I knew better, and made up 
 my mind to discharge my responsibility as well as I could. 
 In course of time you became useful to me ; and, as you 
 know, I made use of you without scruple, but never 
 without regard to your own advantage. I always kept 
 a secretary to do whatever I considered mere copyist's 
 work. Much as you did for me, I think I may say with 
 
 D

 truth that I never imposed a task of no educational value 
 on you. I fear you found the hours you spent over my 
 money aiFairs very irksome ; but I need not apologize for 
 that now : you must already know^ by experience how 
 necessary a knowledge of business is to the possessor of a 
 large fortune. 
 
 " I did not think, when I undertook your education, 
 that I was laying the foundation of any comfort for my- 
 self. For a long time you were only a good girl, and 
 what ignorant people called a prodigy of learning. In 
 your circumstances a commonplace child might have been 
 both. I subsequently came to contemplate your existence 
 with a pleasure which I never derived from the con- 
 templation of my own. I have not succeeded, and shall 
 not succeed in expressing the affection I feel for you, or 
 the triumph with which I find that what I undertook as 
 a distasteful and thankless duty has rescued my life and 
 labor from waste. My literary travail, much as it has 
 occupied us both, I now value only for the share it has 
 had in educating you ; and you will be guilty of no dis- 
 loyalty to me when you come to see that though I sifted 
 as much sand as most men, I found no gold. I ask you 
 to remember then that I did my duty to you long before 
 it became pleasurable or even hopeful. And, when you 
 are older and have learned from your mother's friends how 
 I failed in my duty to her, you will perhaps give me some 
 credit for having conciliated the world for your sake by 
 abandoning habits and acquaintances which, whatever 
 others may have thought of them, did much whilst they 
 lasted to make life endurable to me. 
 
 " Although your future will not concern me, I often 
 find myself thinking of it. I fear you will soon find 
 that the world has not yet provided a place and a sphere 
 of action for well-instructed women. In my younger 
 days, when the companionship of my fellows was a

Chap. I Cashel Byron's Profession 35 
 
 necessity to me, I tried to set aside my culture ; relax my 
 principles ; and acquire common tastes, in order to fit 
 myself for the society of the only men within my reach ; 
 for, if I had to live among bears, I had rather be a bear 
 than a man. The effort made me more miserable than 
 any other mistake I have ever made. It was lonely to be 
 myself; but not to be myself was death in life. Take 
 warning, Lydia: do not be tempted to accommodate 
 yourself to the world by moral suicide. 
 
 " Some day, I expect and hope, you will marry. You 
 will then have an opportunity of making an irremediable 
 mistake, against the possibility of which no advice of 
 mine or subtlety of yours can guard you. I think you 
 will not easily find a man able to satisfy in you that 
 desire to be relieved of the responsibility of thinking out 
 and ordering our course of life that makes us each long 
 for a guide whom we can thoroughly trust. If you fail, 
 remember that your father, after suffering a bitter and 
 complete disappointment in his wife, yet came to regard 
 his marriage as the only fruitful event in his career. Let 
 me remind you also, since you are so rich, that you need 
 not, in jealousy of your own income, limit your choice of 
 a husband to those already too rich to marry for money. 
 No vulgar adventurer, I hope, will be able to recommend 
 himself to you ; and better men will be at least as much 
 frightened as attracted by your wealth. The only class 
 against which I need warn you is that to which I myself 
 am supposed to belong. Never think that a man must 
 prove a suitable and satisfying friend for you merely 
 because he has read much criticism ; that he must feel 
 the influences of Art as you do, because he knows and 
 adopts the classification of names and schools with which 
 you are familiar ; or that because he agrees with your 
 favourite authors he must necessarily interpret their words 
 to himself as you understand them. Beware pf men who

36 Cashiel Byron's Profession Chap.l 
 
 have read more than they have worked, or who love to 
 read better than to work. Do not forget that where the 
 man is always at home, the woman is never happy. 
 Beware of painters, poets, musicians, and artists of all 
 sorts, except very great artists ; beware even of them as 
 husbands and fathers. Self-satisfied workmen who have 
 learnt their business well, whether they be chancellors of 
 the exchequer or farmers, I recommend to you as, on the 
 whole, the most tolerable class of men I have met. 
 
 " I shall make no further attempt to advise you. As 
 fast as my counsels rise to my mind follow reflections 
 that convince me of their futility. 
 
 " You may perhaps wonder why I never said to you 
 what I have written down here. I have tried to do so 
 and failed. If I understand myself aright, I have written 
 these lines mainly to relieve a craving to express my 
 affection for you. The awkwardness which an over- 
 civilized man experiences in admitting that he is some- 
 thing more than an educated stone prevented me from 
 confusing you by demonstrations of a kind I had never 
 accustomed you to. Besides, I wish this assurance of my 
 love — my last word — to reach you when no further 
 commonplaces to blur the impressiveness of its simple 
 truth are possible. 
 
 " I know I have said too much ; and I feel that I 
 have not said enough. But the writing of this letter has 
 been a difficult task. Practised as I am with my pen, I 
 have never, even in my earliest efforts, composed with 
 such labor and sense of inadequacy " 
 
 Here the manuscript broke off. The letter had never 
 been finished.

CHAPTER II 
 
 In the month of May, seven years after the flight of the 
 two boys from Moncrief House, a lady sat in an island 
 of shadow made by a cedar tree in the midst of a glitter- 
 ing green lawn. She did womanly to avoid the sun ; for 
 her complexion was as delicately tinted as mother-of- 
 pearl. She was a small, graceful woman with sensitive 
 lips and nostrils, green eyes with quiet unarched brows, 
 and ruddy gold hair, now shaded by a large untrimmed 
 straw hat. Her dress of Indian muslin, with half sleeves 
 ending in wide ruffles at the elbows, hardly covered her 
 shoulders, where it was supplemented by a fleecy white 
 scarf which made a nest of soft woollen lace for her 
 throat. She was reading a little ivory-bound volume — 
 a miniature edition of the second part of Goethe's 
 "Faust." 
 
 As the afternoon wore on and the light mellowed, the 
 lady dropped her book and began to think and dream, 
 unconscious of a prosaic black object crossing the lawn 
 towards her. This was a young gentleman in a frock 
 coat. He was dark, and had a long, grave face, with a 
 reserved expression, but not ill-looking. 
 
 " Going so soon, Lucian ? " said the lady, looking up 
 as he came into the shadow. 
 
 Lucian looked at her wistfully. His name, as she 
 uttered it, always stirred him vaguely. He was fond of

 finding reasons for things, and had long ago decided that 
 this inward stir was due to her fine pronunciation. His 
 other intimates called him Looshn. 
 
 " Yes," he said. " I have arranged everything, and 
 have come to give an account of my stewardship, and to 
 say good-bye." 
 
 He placed a garden chair near her and sat down. She 
 laid her hands one on the other in her lap, and composed 
 herself to listen. 
 
 " First," he said, " as to the Warren Lodge. It is let 
 for a month only ; so you can allow Mrs. Goff to have 
 it rent free in July if you wish to. I hope you will not 
 act so unwisely." 
 
 She smiled, and said, " Who are the present tenants ? 
 I hear that they object to the dairymaids and men cross- 
 ing the elm vista." 
 
 "We must not complain of that. It was expressly 
 stipulated when they took the lodge that the vista should 
 be kept private for them. I had no idea at that time 
 that you were coming to the castle, or I should of course 
 have declined such a condition." 
 
 "But we do keep it private for them : strangers are 
 not admitted. Our people pass and repass once a day on 
 their way to and from the dairy : that is all." 
 
 " It seems churlish, Lydia ; but this is a special case — 
 a young gentleman who has come to recruit his health. 
 He needs daily exercise in the open air ; but he cannot 
 bear observation: indeed I have not seen him myself; 
 and he has only a single attendant with him. Under 
 these circumstances, I agreed that they should have the 
 sole use of the elm vista. In fact they are paying more 
 rent than would be reasonable without this privilege." 
 
 " I hope the young gentleman is not mad." 
 
 " I satisfied myself, before I let the lodge to him, that 
 he would be a proper tenant," said Lucian, with reproach-

Chap. II Cashel Byron's Profession 39 
 
 ful gravity. " He was strongly recommended to me by 
 Lord Worthington, who spoke quite warmly of him. As 
 it happens, I expressed to him the suspicion you have just 
 suggested. Worthington vouched for the tenant's sanity 
 as well as for his solvency, and offered to take the lodge 
 in his own name and be personally responsible for the 
 good behavior of the invalid. You need have no fear : it 
 is only some young fellow who has upset his nerves by 
 hard reading. Probably some college friend of Worth- 
 ington's." 
 
 "Perhaps so. But I should expect a college friend 
 of Lord Worthington's to be a hard rider or drinker 
 rather than a hard reader." 
 
 "You may be quite at ease, Lydia. I took Lord 
 Worthington at his word so far as to make the letting to 
 him." 
 
 " I am quite satisfied, Lucian ; and I am greatly 
 obliged to you. I will give orders that no one is to go 
 to the dairy by way of the warren." 
 
 "The next point," resumed Lucian, "is more im- 
 portant, as it concerns you personally. Miss GofF is 
 willing to accept your offer. And a most unsuitable 
 companion she will be for you ! " 
 
 "Why, Lucian?" 
 
 "On all accounts. She is younger than you, and 
 therefore cannot chaperone you. She has received only 
 an ordinary education ; and her experience of society is 
 derived from local subscription balls. And as she is not 
 unattractive, and is considered a beauty in Wiltstoken, 
 she is self-willed, and will probably take your patronage 
 in bad part." 
 
 " Is she more self-willed than I ? " 
 
 " You are not self-willed, Lydia ; except that you are 
 deaf to advice." 
 
 "You mean that I seldom follow it. And so you

 think I had better employ a professional companion — a 
 decayed gentlewoman — than save this young girl from 
 going out as a governess and beginning to decay at 
 twenty-three ? " 
 
 " The business of getting a suitable companion, and 
 the duty of relieving poor people, are two different things, 
 Lydia." 
 
 « True, Lucian. When will Miss Goff call ? " 
 
 " This evening. Mind : nothing is settled as yet. If 
 you think better of it on seeing her, you have only to 
 treat her as an ordinary visitor, and the subject will drop. 
 For my own part, I prefer her sister ; but she will not 
 leave Mrs. GofF, who has not yet recovered from the 
 shock of her husband's death." 
 
 Lydia looked reflectively at the little volume in her 
 hand, and seemed to think out the question of Miss 
 GofF. When she looked up again it was evidently settled j 
 but she said nothing. 
 
 " Well ? " said Lucian presently, embarrassed by her 
 silence. 
 
 " Well ? " said Lydia, not at all embarrassed. 
 
 " You have not said anything." 
 
 " I have nothing to say." 
 
 " Then," said Lucian shortly, giving way to a sense 
 of injury, " I had better go." 
 
 " Not at all," said Lydia. " I am enjoying your 
 company in the Wiltstoken way. When two of our 
 laborers here are friends, how do they shew it ? They 
 lean on the same gate for hours together every Sunday 
 morning without exchanging a word. Surely thats 
 better than the nervous horror of silence and self-con- 
 sciousness called society in our unfortunate circle." 
 
 " You have such extraordinary ideas, Lydia ! An 
 agricultural laborer is silent just as a dog is silent." 
 
 " Dogs are very good company," said Lydia.

 To this he found nothing to say. The only relation 
 to a woman in which he felt happy was one of intellectual 
 condescension and explanation. Lydia never questioned 
 his explanations ; but as she did not draw the same moral 
 from them, he seldom felt that they had been successful. 
 As to maintaining a silence with her on the agricultural 
 laborers' lines, that was beyond his utmost power of 
 self-possession. He had to plead his train and say good- 
 bye. 
 
 She gave him her hand ; and a dull glow came into 
 his gray jaws as he took it. Then he buttoned his coat 
 and walked gravely away. As he went, she watched the 
 sun flashing from his glossy hat, and drowning in his 
 respectable coat. She sighed, and took up Goethe again. 
 
 But after a little while she tired of sitting still, and 
 rose and wandered through the park for nearly an hour, 
 trying to find the places where she had played in her 
 childhood during a visit to her late aunt. She recognized 
 a great toppling Druid's altar that had formerly reminded 
 her of Mount Sinai threatening to fall on the head of 
 Christian in " The Pilgrim's Progress." Further on she 
 saw and avoided a swamp in which she had once earned a 
 scolding from her nurse by filling her stockings with 
 mud. Then she found herself in a long avenue of green 
 turf, running east and west, and apparently endless. 
 This seemed the most delightful of all her possessions ; 
 and she had begun to plan a pavilion to build near it, 
 when she suddenly recollected that this must be the elm 
 vista of which the privacy was so stringently insisted 
 upon by her invalid tenant at the Warren Lodge. She 
 fled into the wood at once, and, when she was safe there, 
 laughed at the oddity of being a trespasser in her own 
 domain. A wide detour was needed to avoid intruding 
 again : consequently, after walking a little time, she lost 
 herself The trees seemed never-ending : she began to

 think she must possess a forest as well as a park. At last 
 she saw an opening. Hastening towards it, she came 
 again into the sunlight, and stopped, dazzled by an 
 apparition which she at first took to be a beautiful statue, 
 but presently recognized, with a strange glow of delight, 
 as a living man. 
 
 To so mistake a gentleman exercising himself in the 
 open air on a nineteenth century afternoon would, under 
 ordinary circumstances, imply incredible ignorance either 
 of men or statues. But the circumstances in Miss Carew's 
 case were not ordinary ; for the man was clad in a jersey 
 and knee breeches of white material ; and his bare arms 
 shone like those of a gladiator. His broad pectoral 
 muscles, in their white covering, were like slabs of 
 marble. Even his hair, short, crisp, and curly, seemed 
 like burnished bronze in the evening light. It came into 
 Lydia's mind that she had disturbed an antique god in 
 his sylvan haunt. The fancy was only momentary ; for 
 her next glance fell on a third person, a groom-like man, 
 impossible to associate with classic divinity, contemplat- 
 ing his companion much as a groom might contemplate 
 an exceptionally fine horse. He was the first to see 
 Lydia ; and his expression as he did so plainly shewed 
 that he regarded her as a most unwelcome intruder. The 
 statue-man, following his sinister look, saw her too, but 
 with different feelings ; for his lips parted ; his color 
 rose ; and he stared at her with undisguised admiration 
 and wonder. Lydia's first impulse was to turn and fly ; 
 her next, to apologize for her presence. Finally she 
 went away quietly through the trees. 
 
 The moment she was out of their sight, she increased 
 her pace almost to a run. The day was warm for rapid 
 movement ; and she soon stopped and listened. There 
 were the usual woodland sounds : leaves rustling, grass- 
 hoppers chirping, and birds singing ; but not a human

 voice or footstep. She began to think that the god-Hke 
 figure was only the Hermes of Praxiteles, suggested to 
 her by Goethe's classical Sabbat, and changed by a day- 
 dream into the semblance of a living reality. The groom 
 must have been one of those incongruities characteristic 
 of dreams — probably a reminiscence of Lucian's state- 
 ment that the tenant of the Warren Lodge had a single 
 male attendant. It was impossible that this glorious 
 vision of manly strength and beauty could be sub- 
 stantially a student broken down by excessive study. 
 That irrational glow of delight too was one of the 
 absurdities of dreamland : otherwise she should have been 
 ashamed of it. 
 
 Lydia made her way back to the Castle in some alarm 
 as to the state of her nerves, but dwelling on her vision 
 with a pleasure that she would not have ventured to 
 indulge had it concerned a creature of flesh and blood. 
 Once or twice it recurred to her so vividly that she asked 
 herself whether it could have been real. But a little 
 reasoning convinced her that it must have been an 
 hallucination. 
 
 " If you please, madam," said one of her staff of 
 domestics, a native of Wiltstoken, who stood in deep 
 awe of the lady of the Castle, "Miss Goff is waiting for 
 you in the drawing-room." 
 
 The drawing-room of the Castle was a circular apart- 
 ment, with a dome-shaped ceiling broken into gilt 
 ornaments resembling thick bamboos, which projected 
 vertically downward like stalagmites. The heavy 
 chandeliers were loaded with flattened brass balls, 
 magnified facsimiles of which crowned the uprights of 
 the low, broad, massively - framed chairs, covered in 
 leather stamped with Japanese dragon designs in copper- 
 coloured metal. Near the fireplace was a bronze bell 
 of Chinese shape, mounted like a mortar on a black

 wooden carriage for use as a coal-scuttle. The wall 
 was decorated with large gold crescents on a ground of 
 light blue. 
 
 In this barbaric rotunda Miss Carew found awaiting 
 her a young lady of twenty-three, with a well-developed, 
 resilient figure, and a clear complexion, porcelain surfaced, 
 and with a fine red in the cheeks. The lofty pose of her 
 head expressed the habitual sense of her own consequence 
 given her by the admiration of the youth of the neighbor- 
 hood, which was also, perhaps, the cause of the neatness 
 of her inexpensive black dress and of her irreproachable 
 gloves, boots, and hat. She had been waiting to introduce 
 herself to the lady of the Castle for ten minutes in a state 
 of nervousness that culminated as Lydia entered. 
 
 "How do you do. Miss Goff? Have I kept you 
 waiting ? I was out." 
 
 "Not at all," said Miss GofF, with a confused im- 
 pression that red hair was aristocratic, and dark brown 
 (the color of her own) vulgar. She had risen to shake 
 hands, and now, after hesitating a moment to consider 
 what etiquette required her to do next, resumed her seat. 
 Miss Carew sat down too, and gazed thoughtfully at her 
 visitor, who held herself rigidly erect, and, striving to 
 mask her nervousness, unintentionally looked disdainful. 
 
 " Miss GofF," said Lydia, after a silence that made her 
 speech impressive : " will you come to me on a long visit ? 
 In this lonely place, I am greatly in want of a friend and 
 companion of my own age and position. I think you 
 must be equally so." 
 
 Alice Goff^ was very young, and very determined to 
 accept no credit that she did not deserve. She proceeded 
 to set Miss Carew right as to her social position, not 
 considering that the lady of the Castle probably under- 
 stood it better than she did herself, and indeed thinking 
 it quite natural that she should be mistaken.

 " You are very kind," she replied stiffiy ; " but our 
 positions are quite different, Miss Carew. The fact is 
 that I cannot afford to live an idle life. We ai-e very 
 poor ; and my mother is partly dependent on my 
 exertions." 
 
 " I think you will be able to exert yourself to good 
 purpose if you come to me," said Lydia, unimpressed. 
 " It is true that I shall give you very expensive habits ; 
 but I will also enable you to support them." 
 
 " I do not wish to contract expensive habits," said 
 Alice, reproachfully. "I shall have to content myself 
 with frugal ones throughout my life." 
 
 " Not necessarily. Tell me frankly : how had you 
 proposed to exert yourself ? As a teacher, was it not ? " 
 Alice flushed, but assented. 
 
 " You are not at all fitted for it ; and you will end by 
 marrying. As a teacher you could not marry well. As 
 an idle lady, with expensive habits, you will marry very 
 well indeed. It is quite an art to know how to be rich — 
 an indispensable art, if you mean to marry a rich man." 
 
 " I have no intention of marrying," said Alice loftily. 
 She thought it time to check this cool aristocrat. " If I 
 come at all, I shall come without any ulterior object." 
 
 "That is just what I had hoped. Come without 
 conditions or second thought of any kind." 
 
 "But " began Alice, and stopped, bewildered by 
 
 the pace at which the negotiation was proceeding. She 
 murmured a few words, and waited for Lydia to proceed. 
 But Lydia had said her say, and evidently expected a 
 reply, though she seemed assured of having her own way, 
 whatever Alice's views might be. 
 
 "I do not quite understand. Miss Carew. What 
 duties ? — what would you expect of me ? " 
 
 " A great deal," said Lydia gravely. " Much more 
 than I should from a mere professional companion." 
 


## p. (#74) #################################################

46 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. II 
 
 " But I shall be a professional companion," protested 
 Alice. 
 
 "Whose?" 
 
 Alice flushed again, angrily this time. " I did not 
 mean to say " 
 
 " You do not mean to say that you will have nothing 
 to do with me," said Lydia, stopping her quietly. 
 "Why are you so scrupulous, Miss GofF? You will 
 be close to your home, and can return to it at any 
 moment if you become dissatisfied with your position 
 here." 
 
 Fearful that she had disgraced herself by bad manners ; 
 loth to be taken possession of as if her wishes were of no 
 consequence when a rich lady's whim was to be gratified ; 
 suspicious — since she had often heard gossiping tales of 
 the dishonesty of people in high positions — lest she should 
 be cheated out of the substantial salary she had come 
 resolved to demand ; and withal unable to defend herself 
 against Miss Carew, Alice caught at the first excuse that 
 occurred to her. 
 
 " I should like a little time to consider," she said. 
 
 " Time to accustom yourself to me, is it not ? You 
 can have as long as you plea " 
 
 "Oh, I can let you know to-morrow," interrupted 
 Alice, officiously. 
 
 " Thank you. I will send a note to Mrs. Goff to say 
 that she need not expect you back until to-morrow." 
 
 " But I did not mean I am not prepared to stay," 
 
 remonstrated AHce, feeling more and more entangled in 
 Lydia's snare. 
 
 "We shall take a walk after dinner, then, and call at 
 your house, where you can make your preparations. But 
 I think I can lend you all you will require." 
 
 Alice dared make no further objection. "I am 
 afraid," she stammered, "you will think me horribly

 rude ; but I am so useless, and you are so sure to be 
 disappointed, that — that " 
 
 " You are not rude, Miss Goff ; but I find you very 
 shy. You want to run away and hide from new faces 
 and new surroundings." 
 
 Alice, who was self-possessed and even overbearing in 
 Wiltstoken society, felt that she was misunderstood, but 
 did not know how to vindicate herself. 
 
 Lydia resumed. " I have formed my habits in the 
 course of my travels, and so live without ceremony. We 
 dine early — at six." 
 
 Alice had dined at two, but did not feel bound to 
 confess it. 
 
 "Let me shew you your room," said Lydia, rising. 
 " This is a curious drawing-room," she added, glancing 
 around. "I have never used it before." She looked 
 about her again with some interest, as if the apartment 
 belonged to some one else ; and then led the way to a 
 room on the first floor, furnished as a lady's bed-chamber. 
 " If you disHke this," she said, " or cannot arrange it to 
 suit you, there are others, of which you can have your 
 choice. Come to my boudoir when you are ready." 
 
 " Where is that ? " said Alice anxiously. 
 
 " It is — You had better ring for some one to shew 
 you. I will send you my maid." 
 
 Alice, even more afraid of the maid than of the 
 mistress, declined hastily. " I am accustomed to 
 attend to myself. Miss Carew," she added, with proud 
 humility. 
 
 " You will find it more convenient to call me Lydia," 
 said Miss Carew. " Otherwise you will be supposed to 
 refer to my grand-aunt, a very old lady." She then left 
 the room. 
 
 Alice was fond of thinking that she had a womanly 
 taste and touch in making a room pretty She was

 accustomed to survey with pride her mother's drawing- 
 room, which she had garnished with cheap cretonnes, 
 Japanese paper fans, and nic-nacs in ornamental pottery. 
 She felt now that if she slept once in the bed before her, 
 she could never be content in her mother's house again. 
 All that she had read and believed of the beauty of cheap 
 and simple ornament, and the vulgarity of costliness, 
 recurred to her as a paraphrase of the " Sour grapes " of 
 the fox in the fable. She pictured to herself with a 
 shudder the effect of a sixpenny Chinese umbrella in that 
 fireplace, a cretonne valance to that bed, or chintz 
 curtains to those windows. There was in the room a 
 series of mirrors consisting of a great glass in which she 
 could see herself at full length, another framed in the 
 carved oaken dressing table, and smaller ones of various 
 shapes fixed to jointed arms that turned every way. To 
 use them for the first time was like having eyes in the 
 back of one's head. She had never seen herself from all 
 points of view before. As she gazed, she strove not to 
 be ashamed of her dress ; but even her face and figure, 
 which usually afforded her unqualified delight, seemed 
 robust and middle-class in Miss Carew's mirrors. 
 
 " After all," she said, seating herself on a chair that was 
 even more luxurious to rest in than to look at ; " putting 
 the lace out of the question — and my old lace that 
 belongs to mamma is quite as valuable — her whole dress 
 cannot have cost ,much more than mine. At any rate, it 
 is not worth much more, whatever she may have chosen 
 to pay for it." 
 
 But Alice was clever enough to envy Miss Carew her 
 manners more than her dress. She would not admit to 
 herself that she was not thoroughly a lady ; but she felt 
 that Lydia, in the eye of a stranger, would answer that 
 description better than she. Still, as far as she had 
 observed. Miss Carew was exceedingly cool in her prq-

 ceedings, and did not take any pains to please those with 
 whom she conversed. Alice had often made compacts of 
 friendship with young ladies, and had invited them to 
 call her by her Christian name ; but on such occasions 
 she had always called them " dear " or " darling," and, 
 whilst the friendship lasted, which was often longer than 
 , a month, had never met them without exchanging an 
 embrace and a hearty kiss. 
 
 " And nothing," she said, springing from the chair as 
 she thought of this, and speaking very resolutely, " shall 
 tempt me to believe that there is anything vulgar in 
 sincere affection. I shall be on my guard against this 
 woman." 
 
 Having settled that matter for the present, she went 
 on with her examination of the room, and was more and 
 more attracted by it as she proceeded. For, thanks to 
 her, eminence as a local beauty, she had not that fear of 
 beautiful and rich things which renders abject people in- 
 capable of associating costliness with comfort. Had the 
 counterpane of the bed been her own, she would un- 
 hesitatingly have converted it into a ball dress. There 
 were toilet appliances of which she had never felt the 
 need, and could only guess the use. She looked with 
 despair into the two large closets, thinking how poor a 
 show her three dresses, her ulster, and her few old 
 jackets would make there. There was also a dressing- 
 room with a marble bath that made cleanliness a luxury 
 instead of, as it seemed at home, one of the sternest of 
 the virtues. Everything was appropriately elegant ; but 
 nothing had been placed in the rooms for the sake of 
 ornament alone. Miss Carew, judged by her domestic 
 arrangements, was a utilitarian before everything. There 
 was a very handsome chimneypiece ; but as there was 
 nothing on the mantelshelf, Alice made a faint effort to 
 believe that it was inferior in point of taste to that in her

 own bedroom, which was covered with blue cloth, bordered 
 by a fringe and a row of brass-headed nails, and laden 
 with photographs in plush frames. 
 
 The striking of the hour reminded her that she had 
 forgotten to prepare for dinner. She hastily took off her 
 hat ; washed her hands ; spent another minute among 
 the mirrors ; and was summoning courage to ring the 
 bell, when a doubt occurred to her. Ought she to put 
 on her gloves before going down or not ? This kept her 
 in perplexity for many seconds. At last she resolved to 
 put her gloves in her pocket, and be guided as to their 
 further disposal by the example of her hostess. Not 
 daring to hesitate any longer, she rang the bell, and was 
 presently joined by a French lady of polished manners — 
 Miss Carew's' maid — who conducted her to the boudoir, 
 an hexagonal apartment that, Alice thought, a sultana 
 might have envied. Lydia was there, reading. Alice 
 noted with relief that she had not changed her dress, and 
 was ungloved. 
 
 Miss Goff did not enjoy the dinner. There was a 
 butler who seemed to have nothing to do but stand at 
 a buffet and watch her. There was also a swift, noiseless 
 footman who presented himself at her elbow at intervals, 
 and compelled her to choose on the instant between un- 
 familiar things to eat and drink. She envied these men 
 their knowledge of society, and shrank from their 
 criticism. Once, after taking a piece of asparagus in 
 her hand, she was deeply mortified to see her hostess 
 consume the vegetable with the aid of a knife and fork ; 
 but the footman's back was turned to her just then ; and 
 the butler, oppressed by the heat of the weather, was in 
 a state of abstraction bordering on slumber. On the 
 whole, by dint of imitating Miss Carew, who did not 
 plague her with any hostess-like vigilance, she came off 
 without discredit to her breeding.

 . Lydia, on her part, acknowledged no obligation to 
 entertain her guest by chatting, and enjoyed her thoughts 
 and her dinner in silence. Alice began to be fascinated 
 by her, and to wonder what she was thinking about. 
 She fencied that the footman was not quite free from the 
 same influence. Even the butler might have been 
 meditating himself to sleep on the subject. Alice felt 
 tempted to offer her a penny for her thoughts ; but she 
 dared not be so familiar as yet. Had the offer been made 
 and accepted, butler, footman, and guest would have been 
 plunged into equal confusion by the explanation, which 
 would have run thus : 
 
 " I had a vision of the Hermes of Praxiteles in a sylvan 
 haunt to-day ; and I am thinking of that "

CHAPTER III 
 
 Next day Alice accepted Miss Carew's invitation. 
 Lydia, who seemed to regard all conclusions as foregone 
 when she had once signified her approval of them, took 
 the acceptance as a matter of course. Alice thereupon 
 thought fit to remind her that there were other persons 
 CO be considered. She said, 
 
 " I should not have hesitated yesterday but for my 
 mother. It seems so heartless to leave her." 
 
 " You have a sister at home, have you not ? " 
 
 "'Yes. But she is not very strong ; and my mother 
 requires a great deal of attention." Alice paused, and 
 added in a lower voice, " She has never recovered from 
 the shock of my fether's death." 
 
 " Your father is then not long dead ? " said Lydia in 
 her usual tone. 
 
 "Only two years," said Alice coldly. "I hardly 
 know how to tell my mother that I am going to desert 
 her." 
 
 " Go and tell her to-day, Alice. You need not be 
 afraid of hurting her. Grief of two years' standing is 
 only a bad habit." 
 
 Alice started, outraged. Her mother's grief was 
 sacred to her j and yet it was by her experience of her 
 mother that she recognized the truth of Lydia's remark, 
 and felt that it was unanswerable. She frowned ; but 
 


## p. (#81) #################################################

Chap. Ill Cashel Byron's Profession 53 
 
 the frown was lost : Miss Carew was not looking at her. 
 Then she rose and went to the door, where she stopped 
 to say, 
 
 " You do not know our family circumstances. I will 
 go now and try to prevail on my mother to let me stay 
 with you." 
 
 "Please come back in good time for dinner," said 
 Lydia, unmoved. " I will introduce you to my cousin 
 Lucian Webber : I have just received a telegram from 
 him. He is coming down with Lord Worthington. I 
 do not know whether Lord Worthington will come to 
 dinner or not. He has an invalid friend at the Warren 
 Lodge ; and Lucian does not make it clear whether he is 
 coming to visit him or me. However, it is of no conse- 
 quence : Lord Worthington is only a young sportsman. 
 Lucian is a clever man, and will be a well-known one some 
 day. He is secretary to a Cabinet Minister, and is very 
 busy ; but we shall probably see him often whilst the 
 Whitsuntide holidays last. Excuse my keeping you 
 waiting at the door to hear that long history. Adieu ! " 
 She waved her hand ; and Alice suddenly felt that 
 it might be possible to become very fond of Miss 
 Carew. 
 
 She spent an unhappy afternoon with her mother. It 
 had been Mrs. GoiF's fortune to marry a man of whom 
 she was afraid, and who made himself very disagreeable 
 whenever his house or his children were neglected in the 
 least particular. Making a virtue of necessity, she had 
 come to be regarded in Wiltstoken as a model wife and 
 mother. At last, when a drag ran over Mr. GofF and 
 killed him, she was left almost penniless, with two 
 daughters on her hands. In this extremity, she took 
 refuge in grief, and did nothing. Her daughters settled 
 their father's affairs as best they could ; moved into a 
 cheap house ; and procured a strange tenant for that in

 which they had lived during many years. Janet, the 
 elder sister, a student by disposition, employed herself as 
 a teacher of the latest feshions in female education, 
 rumors of which had already reached Wiltstoken. 
 Alice was unable to teach mathematics and moral 
 science ; but she formed a dancing class, and gave lessons 
 in singing and in a language which she believed to be 
 current in France, but which was not intelligible to 
 natives of that country travelling through Wiltstoken. 
 Both sisters were devoted to one another and to their 
 mother. Alice, who had enjoyed the special affection of 
 her self-indulgent father, preserved some regard for his 
 memory, though she could not help wishing that his 
 affection had been strong enough to induce him to save a 
 provision for her. She was ashamed, too, of the very 
 recollection of his habit of getting drunk at races, 
 regattas, and other national festivals, by an accident at 
 one of which he had met his death. 
 
 Alice went home from the Castle expecting to leave 
 her family divided between joy at her good fortune and 
 grief at losing her ; for her views of human nature and 
 parental feeling were as yet purely romantic. But Mrs. 
 Goff, at once becoming envious of the luxury her daughter 
 was about to enjoy, overwhelmed her with accusa- 
 tions of want of feeling, eagerness to desert her mother, 
 and vain love of pleasure. Alice, who, in spite of a 
 stubborn sense of the duty of truth telling, had often told 
 Mrs. Goff half a dozen lies in one afternoon to spare her 
 some unpleasant truth, and would have scouted as in- 
 famous any suggestion that her parent was more selfish 
 than saintly, soon burst into tears, declaring that she 
 would not return td the Castle, and that nothing would 
 have induced her to stay there the night before had she 
 thought that her doing so could give pain at home. 
 This alarmed Mrs. Goff, who knew by experience that

Chap. Ill Cashel Byron's Profession 55 
 
 it was easier to drive Alice upon rash resolves than to 
 shake her in them afterguards. Fear of incurring blame 
 in Wiltstoken for wantonly opposing her daughter's 
 interests, and of losing her share of Miss Carew's money 
 and countenance, got the better of her jealousy. She 
 lectured Alice severely for her headstrong temper, and 
 commanded her on her duty not only to her mother, but 
 also and chiefly to her God, to accept Miss Carew's offer 
 with thankfulness, and to insist upon a definite salary as 
 soon as she had, by good behavior, made her society 
 indispensable at the Castle. Alice, dutiful as she was, 
 reduced Mrs. GofF to entreaties, and even to symptoms 
 of an outburst of violent grief for the late Mr. GofF, 
 before she consented to obey her. She would wait, she 
 said, until Janet, who was absent teaching, came in, and 
 promised to forgive her for staying away the previous 
 night (Mrs. GofF had falsely represented that Janet, 
 deeply hurt, had lain awake weeping during the small 
 hours of the morning). The mother, seeing nothing for 
 it but either to get rid of Alice before Janet's return, or 
 be detected in a spiteful untruth, had to pretend that 
 Janet was spending the evening with some friends, and 
 to urge the unkindness of leaving Miss Carew lonely. 
 At last Alice washed away the traces of her tears, 
 and returned to the Castle, feeling very miserable, and 
 trying to comfort herself with the reflection that 
 her sister had been spared the scene which had just 
 passed. 
 
 Lucian Webber had not arrived when she reached the 
 Castle. Miss Carew glanced at her melancholy face as 
 she entered, but asked no questions. Presently, however, 
 she put down her book ; considered for a moment ; and 
 said, 
 
 " It is nearly three years since I have had a new dress." 
 Alice looked up with interest. " Now that I have you

 to help me to choose, I think I will be extravagant 
 enough to renew my entire wardrobe. I wish you 
 would take this opportunity to get some things' for 
 yourself. You will find that my dressmaker, Madame 
 Smith, is to be depended on for work, though she 
 is expensive and dishonest. When we are tired of 
 Wiltstoken we can go to Paris, and be millinered 
 there ; but in the meantime we can resort to Madame 
 Smith." 
 
 " I cannot afFord expensive dresses," said Alice. 
 
 " I should not ask you to get them if you could not 
 afFord them. I warned you that I should give you 
 expensive habits." 
 
 Alice hesitated. She had a healthy inclination to take 
 whatever she could get on all occasions j and she had 
 suffered too much from poverty not to be more thankful 
 for her good fortune than humiliated by Miss Carew's 
 bounty. But the thought of being driven, richly attired, 
 in one of the Castle carriages, and meeting Janet 
 trudging about her daily tasks in a cheap black serge and 
 mended gloves, made Alice feel that she deserved all her 
 mother's reproaches. However, it was obvious that a 
 refusal would be of no material benefit to Janet ; so she 
 said, 
 
 "Really I could not think of imposing on your 
 kindness in this wholesale fashion. You are too good 
 to me." 
 
 "I will write to Madame Smith this evening," said 
 Lydia. 
 
 Alice was about to renew her protest more faintly, 
 when Mr. Webber was announced. She stiffened* herself 
 to receive the visitor. Lydia's manner did not alter in 
 the least. Lucian, whose demeanour resembled Miss 
 GofF's rather than his cousin's, went through the 
 ceremony of introduction with solemnity, and was 
 


## p. (#85) #################################################

Chap. Ill Cashel Byron's Profession ^y 
 
 received with a dash of scorn ; for Alice, though secretly 
 awe-stricken, bore herself tyrannically towards men from 
 habit. 
 
 In reply to Alice, Mr. Webber thought the day cooler 
 than yesterday. In reply to Lydia, he admitted that the 
 resolution of which the Leader of the Opposition had 
 given notice was tantamount to a vote of censure on the 
 Government. He was confident that Ministers would 
 have a majority. He had no news of any importance. 
 He had made the journey down with Lord Worthington, 
 who had come to Wiltstoken to see the invalid at the 
 Warren Lodge. He had promised to return with Lucian 
 in the seven-thirty train. 
 
 When they went down to dinner, Alice, profiting by 
 her experience of the day before, faced the servants with 
 composure, and committed no solecisms. Unable to take 
 part in the conversation, as she knew nothing of politics, 
 which were the staple of Lucian's discourse, she sat 
 silent, and reconsidered an old opinion of hers that it was 
 ridiculous and ill-bred in a lady to discuss anything that 
 was in the newspapers. She was impressed by Lucian's 
 cautious and somewhat dogmatic style of conversation, 
 and concluded that he knew everything. Lydia seemed 
 interested in his information, but quite indifferent to his 
 opinions. 
 
 Towards half-past seven, Lydia proposed that they 
 should walk to the railway station, adding, as a reason for 
 going, that she wished to learn bookmaking from Lord 
 Worthington. Lucian looked grave at this j and Alice, 
 to shew that she shared his notions of propriety, looked 
 shockedo Neither demonstration had the slightest effect 
 on Lydia. She led the way to the hall j took her 
 untrimmed straw hat and her scarf from a stand there ; 
 and walked out, gloveless, into the fresh spring evening. 
 Alice, aghast at these manlike proceedings, and deprived

 of the ten minutes upon which she had counted to pin 
 on her hat and equip herself for public inspection, had to 
 rush upstairs and down again with undignified haste. 
 When she overtook them on the lawn, Lucian was 
 saying, 
 
 " Worthington is afraid of you, Lydia — needlessly, as 
 it seems." 
 
 "Why?" 
 
 "Because you know so much more than he does," 
 said Lucian, rejoiced by an invitation to explain. " But 
 perhaps you have more sympathy with his tastes than he 
 supposes." 
 
 " I may explain to you, Alice, that Lord Worthington 
 is a young gentleman whose calendar is the racing 
 calendar, and who interests himself in favorites and 
 outsiders much as Lucian does in prime ministers and 
 independent radicals. He never reads anything, and never 
 associates with people who read anything ; so his con- 
 versation is bearable. Would you like to go to Ascot, 
 Alice ? " 
 
 Alice answered, as she felt Lucian expected her to 
 answer, that she had never been to a race, and that she 
 had no desire to go to one. 
 
 " You will change your mind in time for next year's 
 meeting. A race interests every one, which is more than 
 can be said for the opera or the Academy." 
 
 " I have been at the Academy," said Alice, who had 
 been once with her father to London. 
 
 " Indeed ! " said Lydia. "Were you in the National 
 Gallery ? " 
 
 " The National Gallery ! I think not. I forget." 
 
 " Did you enjoy the pictures ? " 
 
 " Oh, very much indeed." 
 
 " You will find Ascot far more amusing." 
 
 " Let me warn you," said Lucian to Alice, " that my

 cousin's pet caprice is to aiFect a distaste for art, to which 
 she is passionately devoted ; and for literature, in which 
 she is profoundly read." 
 
 " Cousin Lucian," said Lydia : " should you ever be 
 cut ofF from your politics, and disappointed in your ambi- 
 tion, you will have an opportunity of living upon art and 
 literature. Then I shall respect your opinion of their 
 satisfactoriness as a staff of life. As yet you have only 
 tried them as a sauce." 
 
 " Discontented, as usual ? " said Lucian. 
 
 "Your one idea respecting me, as usual," replied 
 Lydia with patient impatience, as they entered the 
 station. 
 
 The train, three carriages and a van, was waiting at 
 the platform. The engine was humming subduedly ; and 
 the driver and fireman were leaning out : the latter, a 
 young man, eagerly watching two gentlemen standing 
 before the first-class carriage ; whilst the driver shared 
 his curiosity in an elderly, preoccupied manner. One of 
 the persons thus observed was a bullet-headed little man 
 of about twenty-five, in the afternoon costume of metro- 
 politan fashion. Lydia instantly recognized the other as 
 the Hermes of the day before, in spite of his straw hat, 
 canary-coloured scarf, and a suit of minute black-and- 
 white chessboard pattern, with a crimson silk handkerchief 
 overflowing the breast pocket of the coat. His hands 
 were unencumbered by stick or umbrella ; he carried 
 himself smartly, balancing himself so accurately that he 
 seemed to have no weight ; and his expression was self- 
 satisfied and good-humoured. But — ! Lydia felt that 
 there was a But somewhere about this handsome, power- 
 ful, and light-hearted young man. 
 
 "There is Lord Worthington," she said, indicating 
 the bullet-headed gentleman. " Surely that cannot be his 
 invalid friend with him ? "

 " That is the man that Hves at the Warren Lodge," 
 said Alice. " I know his appearance." 
 
 " Which is certainly not suggestive of a valetudinarian," 
 remarked Lucian, looking hard at the stranger. 
 
 They had now come close to the two, and could 
 hear Lord Worthington, as he opened the carriage 
 door to get in, saying, "Take care of yourself, like 
 a good fellow, wont you ? Remember ! if it lasts a 
 second over the fifteen minutes, I shall drop five hundred 
 pounds." 
 
 Hermes placed his arm round the shoulders of the 
 young lord, and gave him an elder-brotherly roll. Then 
 he said with correct accent and pronunciation, but with a 
 certain rough quality of voice, and louder than English 
 gentlemen usually speak : " Your money is as safe as the 
 Mint, my boy." 
 
 Evidently, Alice thought, the stranger was an intimate 
 friend of Lord Worthington. She resolved to be par- 
 ticular in her behavior before him, if introduced. 
 
 " Lord Worthington," said Lydia. 
 
 Startled, he turned and climbed hastily down from the 
 step of the carriage, saying in some confusion, " How de 
 do. Miss Carew ? Lovely country and lovely weather — 
 must agree awfully well with you. You look as if it did." 
 
 " Thank you : I dare say I do. Your friend is a 
 tenant of mine, I think." 
 
 Lord Worthington looked at her with a countenance 
 that expressed a sudden and vivid dread of detection, and 
 answered not a word. 
 
 "You are going to introduce him to me, are you 
 not." 
 
 " You give me leave to ? " he stipulated. 
 
 " Of course," said Lydia. " Is there any reason " 
 
 " Oh, not the least in the world, since you wish it," 
 he replied quickly, his eyes twinkling mischievously

 as he turned to his companion, who was standing at 
 the carriage door admiring Lydia, and being himself 
 admired by the stoker. " Mr. Cashel Byron : Miss 
 Carew." 
 
 Mr. Cashel Byron reddened a little as he raised his 
 straw hat, but, on the whole, bore himself like an eminent 
 man who was not proud. As, however, he seemed to 
 have nothing to say for himself, Lydia set Lord Worth- 
 ington talking about Ascot, and listened to him whilst 
 she looked at her new acquaintance. Now that the 
 constraint of society had banished his former expression 
 of easy good humor, there was something formidable in 
 him that gave her an unaccountable thrill of pleasure. 
 The same impression of latent danger had occurred, less 
 agreeably, to Lucian, who was affected much as he might 
 have been by the proximity of a large dog of doubtful 
 temper. Lydia thought that Mr. Byron did not, at first 
 sight, like her cousin ; for he was looking at him 
 obliquely, as though stealthily measuring him. 
 
 The group was broken up by the guard calling to 
 the passengers to take their seats. Farewells were 
 exchanged ; and Lord Worthington cried, " Take care 
 of yourself," to Cashel Byron, who replied somewhat 
 impatiently, and with an apprehensive glance at Miss 
 Carew, " AH right, all right : never you fear, sir." Then 
 the train went off; and he was left on the platform with 
 the two ladies. 
 
 "We are returning to the Park, Mr. Cashel Byron," 
 said Lydia. 
 
 " So am I," said he. " Perhaps " Here he broke 
 
 down, and looked at Alice to avoid Lydia's eye. Then 
 they went out together. 
 
 When they had walked some distance in silence : 
 Alice looking rigidly before her, recollecting with sus- 
 picion that he had just addressed Lord Worthington

 as "sir" ; whilst Lydia was observing his light step and 
 perfect balance, and trying to read his troubled face, 
 he said, 
 
 " I saw you in the park yesterday ; and I thought you 
 were a ghost. Old Mellish — my man, I mean — saw you 
 too. I knew by that that you were genuine." 
 
 " Strange ! " said Lydia. " I had the same fancy 
 about you." 
 
 " What ! You had ! " he exclaimed, looking at her. 
 Whilst thus unmindful of his steps, he stumbled, and 
 recovered himself with a stifled oath. Then he became 
 very red, and remarked, to Miss GofF, that it was a warm 
 evening. 
 
 Alice assented. " I hope," she added, " that you are 
 better." 
 
 He looked puzzled. Concluding, after consideration, 
 that she had referred to his stumble, he said, 
 
 " Thank you : I didnt hurt myself." 
 
 "Lord Worthington has been telling us about you," 
 said Lydia. He halted suddenly, evidently deeply morti- 
 fied. She hastened to add, " He mentioned that you 
 had come down here to recruit your health : that 
 is all." 
 
 Cashel's features relaxed into a curious smile ; and he 
 walked on again. But presently he became suspicious, 
 and said anxiously, " He didnt tell you anything else 
 about me, did he ? " 
 
 Alice stared at: him superciliously. Lydia replied, 
 " No. Nothing else," 
 
 "I thought you might have heard my name some 
 where," he persisted. 
 
 " Perhaps I have ; but I cannot recall in what con- 
 nexion. Why ? Do you know any friends of mine ? " 
 
 " Oh no. Only Lord Worthington." 
 
 " I conclude then that you are celebrated, and that I

 have the misfortune not to know it, Mr. Cashel Byron. 
 Is it so ? " 
 
 " Not a bit of it," he replied hastily. " There's no 
 reason why you should ever have heard of me. I am 
 much obliged to you for your kind inquiries," he con- 
 tinued, turning to Alice. " I'm quite well now, thank 
 you. The country has set me right again." 
 
 Alice, who was beginning to have her doubts of Mr. 
 Byron, smiled falsely and drew herself up a little. He 
 turned away from her, hurt by her manner, and so ill 
 able to conceal his feelings that Miss Carew, always 
 watching him, saw what he felt, and knew with delight 
 that he was turning to her for consolation. He looked' 
 at Lydia wistfully, as if trying to guess her thoughts, 
 which seemed to be with the setting sun, or in some 
 equally beautiful and mysterious region. But he could 
 see that there was no reflection of Miss GofF's scorn in 
 her face. 
 
 " And so you really took me for a ghost ? " he said. 
 
 " Yes. At first I thought you were a statue." 
 
 " A statue ! " 
 
 " You do not seem flattered by that." 
 
 " It is not flattering to be taken for a lump of stone," 
 he replied ruefully. 
 
 Here was a man whom she had mistaken for the finest 
 image of manly strength and beauty known to her j and 
 he was so void of artistic culture that he held a statue 
 to be a distasteful lump of stone. 
 
 " I believe I was trespassing then," she said ; " but I 
 did so unintentionally. I had gone astray ; for I am 
 comparatively a stranger here, and cannot find my way 
 about my park yet." 
 
 "It didnt matter a bit," said Cashel inipetuously. 
 " Come as often as you want. Mellish fancies that ir 
 any one gets a glimpse of me he wont get any odds.

 You see he would like people to think " Here 
 
 Cashel, recollecting himself, broke ofF, and added in con- 
 fusion, " Mellish is mad : thats about where it is." 
 
 Alice glanced significantly at Lydia. She had already 
 suggested that madness was the real reason for the seclu- 
 sion of the tenants at the Warren Lodge. Cashel saw 
 the glance, and intercepted it by turning to her, and 
 saying, with an attempt at conversational ease, 
 
 " How do you young ladies amuse yourselves in the 
 country ? Do you play billiards ever ? " 
 
 "No," said Alice indignantly. The question, she 
 thought, implied that she was capable of spending her 
 evenings on the first floor of a public-house. To her 
 surprise, Lydia remarked, 
 
 " I play — a little. I do not care sufficiently for the 
 game to make myself proficient. You were equipped for 
 lawn-tennis, I think, when I saw you yesterday. Miss 
 GofF is a celebrated lawn-tennis player. She vanquished 
 the Australian champion last year." 
 
 It seemed that Byron, after all, was something of a 
 courtier ; for he displayed great astonishment at this feat. 
 " The Australian champion ! " he repeated. " And who 
 
 may he Oh ! you mean the lawn-tennis champion. 
 
 To be sure. Well, Miss Goff, I congratulate you. It 
 is not every ammichoor [amateur] that can brag of having 
 shewn a professional champion to a back seat." 
 
 Alice, outraged by the imputation of bragging, and 
 certain that slang was vulgar, whatever billiards might be, 
 bore herself still more loftily, and resolved to snub him 
 explicitly if he addressed her again. But he did not ; 
 for they came just then to a narrow iron gate in the wall 
 of the park, at which Lydia stopped. 
 
 "Let me open it for you," said Cashel. She gave 
 him the key ; and he seized one of the bars of the gate 
 with his left hand, and stooped as though he wanted to 
 


## p. (#93) #################################################

Chap. Ill Cashel Byron's Profession 65 
 
 look into the keyhole. Yet he opened it smartly 
 enough. 
 
 Alice was about to pass in with a cool bow when she 
 saw Miss Carew offer Cashel her hand. Whatever Lydia 
 did was done so that it seemed the right thing to do. 
 He took the hand timidly, and gave it a little shake, not 
 daring to meet her eyes. Alice put out her glove stiffly. 
 Cashel immediately stepped forward with his right foot 
 and enveloped her fingers with the hardest clump of 
 knuckles she had ever felt. Glancing down at this 
 remarkable fist, she saw that it was discoloured almost 
 to blackness. Then she went in through the gate, 
 followed by Lydia, who turned to close it behind her. 
 As she pushed, Cashel, standing outside, grasped a bar 
 and pulled. She at once relinquished to him the shutting 
 of the gate, and smiled her thanks as she turned away ; 
 but in that moment he plucked up courage to look at her. 
 The sensation of being so looked at was quite novel, and 
 very curious. She was even a little out of countenance, 
 but not so much so as Cashel, who nevertheless could not 
 take his eyes away. 
 
 "Do you think," said Alice, as they crossed the 
 orchard, " that that man is a gentleman ? " 
 
 " How can I possibly tell ? We hardly know him." 
 
 " But what do you think ? There is always a certain 
 something about a gentleman that one recognizes by 
 instinct." 
 
 " Is there ? I have never observed it." 
 
 " Have you not ? " said Alice, surprised, and beginning 
 uneasily to fear that her superior perception of gentility 
 was in some way the eflFect of her social inferiority to Miss 
 Carew. " I thought one could always tell." 
 
 " Perhaps so," said Lydia. " For my own part I have 
 found the same varieties of address in every class. Some 
 people, no matter what the style of their particular

 set may be, have a native distinction and grace of 
 manner — " 
 
 "That is wrhat I mean," said Alice. 
 
 " —but you find that as often among actors, gipsies, 
 and peasants, as among ladies and gentlemen. One can 
 make a fair guess with most people, but not w^ith this 
 Mr. Cashel Byron. Are you curious about him ? " 
 
 " I ! " exclaimed Alice superbly. " Not in the least." 
 
 "I am. He interests me. I seldom see anything 
 novel in humanity ; and he is a very singular man." 
 
 "I meant," said Alice, crestfallen, "that I take no 
 special interest in him." 
 
 Lydia, not being concerned as to the exact degree of 
 Alice's interest, merely nodded, and continued, " He 
 may, as you suppose, be a man of humble origin, who 
 has seen something of society ; or he may be a gentleman 
 unaccustomed to society. I feel no conviction either 
 way." 
 
 " But he speaks very roughly ; and his slang is dis- 
 gusting. His hands are hard and quite black. Did you 
 not notice them ? " 
 
 " I noticed it all ; and I think that if he were a man 
 of low condition he would be careful not to use slang. 
 Self-made persons are usually precise in their language : 
 they rarely break the formulated laws of society, whereas 
 he breaks every one of them. His pronunciation of some 
 words is so distinct that an idea crossed me once that he 
 might be an actor. But then it is not uniformly distinct. 
 I am sure that he has some object or occupation in life : 
 he has not the air of an idler. Yet I have thought of all 
 the ordinary professions ; and he does not fit one of them. 
 That is perhaps what makes him interesting. He is un- 
 accountable." 
 
 " He must have some position. He was very familiar 
 with Lord Worthington."

 "Lord Worthington is a sportsman, and is familiar 
 with all sorts of people." 
 
 " Yes ; but surely he would not let a jockey, or any- 
 body of that class, put his arm round his neck, as we saw 
 Mr. Byron do." . 
 
 " Perhaps not," said Lydia thoughtfully. " Still," she 
 added, clearing her brow and laughing, " I dont believe 
 he is an invalid student." 
 
 "I will tell you what he is," said Alice suddenly. 
 " He is companion and keeper to the man with whom 
 he lives. Do you recollect his saying 'Mellish is 
 mad ' ? " ' 
 
 "That is possible," said Lydia. "At all events we 
 have got somebody to talk about ; and that is an important 
 home-comfort in the country." 
 
 Just then they reached the Castle. Lydia lingered for 
 a moment on the terrace. The tall Tudor chimneys of 
 the Warren Lodge stood Up against the long crimson cloud 
 into which the sun was sinking. She smiled as if some 
 quaint idea had occurred to her ; raised her eyes for a 
 moment to the black marble Egyptian gazing with 
 unwavering eyes into the sky ; and followed Alice 
 indoors. 
 
 Later on, when it was quite dark, Cashel sat in a 
 spacious kitchen at the lodge, thinking. His companion, 
 who had laid his coat aside, was at the fire, smoking, and 
 watching a saucepan that simmered there. He broke the 
 silence by remarking, after a glance at the clock, " Time 
 to go to roost." 
 
 " Time to go to the devil," said Cashel. "I am going 
 out." 
 
 " Yes, and get a chill. Not if I know it, you dont." 
 
 " Well, go to bed yourself ; and then you wont know 
 it. I want to take a Walk round the place." 
 
 " If you put your foot outside that door to-night. Lord

 Worthington will lose his five hundred pounds. You 
 cant lick any one in fifteen minutes if you train on night 
 air. Get licked yourself, more likely." 
 
 " Will you lay two to one that I dont sleep on the 
 grass and knock the Flying Dutchman out of time in the 
 first round afterwards ? " 
 
 " Come," said Mellish coaxingly : " have some com- 
 mon sense. I'm advising you for your good." 
 
 "Suppose I dont want to be advised for my good. 
 Eh ? Hand me over that lemon. You neednt start a 
 speech : I'm not going to eat it." 
 
 " Blest if he aint rubbin is ands with it ! " exclaimed 
 MeUish, after watching him for some moments. " Why, 
 you bloomin fool, lemon wont arden your ands. Aint 
 I took enough trouble with them ? " 
 
 "I want to whiten them," said Cashel, impatiently 
 throwing the lemon under the grate ; " but it's no use. 
 I cant go about with my fists like this. I'll go up to 
 London to-morrow and buy a pair of gloves." 
 
 " What ! Real gloves ? Wearin gloves ? " 
 
 " You thundering old lunatic," said Cashel, rising and 
 putting on his hat : " is it likely that I want a pair of 
 mufflers ? Perhaps you think you could teach me some- 
 thing with them. Ha ! ha ! By the bye — now mind 
 this, Mellish — dont let it out down here that I'm a fighting 
 man. Do you hear ? " 
 
 " Me let it out ! " cried Mellish indignantly. " Is 
 it likely ? Now, I asts you, Cashel Byron, is it 
 likely ? " 
 
 "Likely or not, dont do it," said Cashel. "You 
 might get talking with some of the chaps about the 
 Castle stables. They are free with their liquor when 
 they can get sporting news for it." 
 
 Mellish looked at him reproachfully ; and Cashel 
 turned towards the door. The movement reminded

 the trainer of his professional duties. He renewed his 
 remonstrances as to the folly of venturing into the night 
 air, citing many examples of pugilists who had suffered 
 defeat through neglecting the counsel of their trainers. 
 Cashel expressed his disbelief in these anecdotes in brief 
 and personal terms ; and at last Mellish had to content 
 himself with proposing to limit the duration of the walk 
 to half an hour. 
 
 " Perhaps I shall come back in half an hour," said 
 Cashel. "And perhaps I shant." 
 
 " Well, look here," said Mellish. " Dont let us two 
 pals quarrel about a minute or so. I feel the want of a 
 walk myself ; and I'll come with you." 
 
 " I'm damned if you shall," said Cashel. " Here : let 
 me out ; and shut up. I'm not going further than the 
 park. I have no intention of making a night of it in the 
 village, which is what you are afraid of. I know you, 
 you old dodger. If you dont get out of my way, I'll 
 seat you on the fire." 
 
 "But dooty, Cashel, dooty," pleaded Mellish per- 
 suasively. " Every man oughter do his dooty. Consider 
 your dooty to your backers." 
 
 "Are you going to get out of my way; or must I put 
 you out of it ? " said Cashel, reddening ominously. 
 
 Mellish went back to his chair ; bowed his head on 
 his hands ; and wept. " I'd sooner be a dog nor a trainer," 
 he sobbed. " Oh ! the cussedness o bein shut up for 
 weeks with a fightin man ! For the fust two days theyre 
 as sweet as treacle ; and then their contrairyness comes 
 out. Their tempers is pufEct ell." 
 
 Cashel, additionally enraged by a sting of remorse, 
 went out and slammed the door. He made straight 
 towards the Castle, and watched its windows for nearly 
 half an hour, keeping in constant motion so as to avert a 
 chill. At last a bell struck the hour from one of the

 minarets. To Cashel, accustomed to the coarse jangHng 
 of ordinary Enghsh bells in too low belfries, the sound 
 seemed to belong to fairyland. He went slowly back to 
 the Warren Lodge, and found his trainer standing at the 
 open door, smoking, and anxiously awaiting his return. 
 Cashel rebuffed his conciliatory advances with a haughty 
 reserve more dignified but much less acceptable to Mr. 
 Mellish than his former profane familiarity, and went 
 thoughtfully to bed.

CHAPTER IV 
 
 Miss Carew sat on the bank of a great pool in the park, 
 throwing pebbles two by two into the water, and intently- 
 watching the intersection of the circles they made on its 
 calm surface. Alice, who had rashly begun her com- 
 panionship by a parade of all her accomplishments, was 
 sketching the Castle. The woodland rose round them 
 like the sides of an amphitheatre ; but the trees did 
 not extend to the water's edge : there was an ample 
 margin of bright greensward and a narrow belt of gravel, 
 from which Lydia was picking her pebbles. 
 
 Hearing a footstep, she looked back, and saw Cashel 
 Byron standing behind Alice, apparently much interested 
 in her drawing. He was dressed as she had last seen 
 him, except that he wore gorgeous primrose gloves and 
 an Egyptian. red scarf. Alice turned, and surveyed him 
 with haughty surprise ; but he stood at ease with an 
 inept swagger ; and she, after glancing at Lydia to 
 reassure herself that she was not alone, bade him good 
 morning, and resumed her work. 
 
 " Queer place," he remarked, after a pause, alluding 
 to the Castle. " Chinese looking, isnt it ? " 
 
 " It is considered a very fine building," said Alice. 
 
 " Oh, hang what it is considered ! " said Cashel, 
 " What is it ? That is the point to look to." 
 
 " It is a matter of taste," said Alice, very coldly.

 "Mr. Cashel Byron." 
 
 Cashel started and hastened to the bank. " How d'ye 
 do, Miss Carew," he said. "I didnt see you until 
 you called me." She looked at him quietly ; and he 
 quailed, convicted of a foolish falsehood. "There is 
 a splendid view of the Castle from here," he continued, 
 to change the subject. "Miss GofF and I have just 
 been talking about it." 
 
 " Yes. Do you admire it ? " 
 
 " Very much indeed. It is a beautiful place. Every 
 one must acknowledge that." 
 
 " It is considered kind to praise my house to me, and 
 to ridicule it to other people. You do not say, ' Hang 
 what it is considered,' now." 
 
 Cashel, with an unaccustomed sense of getting the 
 worst of an encounter, almost lost heart to reply. Then 
 he brightened, and said, "I can tell you how that is. As 
 far as being a place to sketch, or for another person to 
 look at, it is Chinese enough. But somehow your living 
 in it makes a difference. That is what I meant ; upon 
 my soul it is." 
 
 Lydia smiled ; but he, looking down at her, did not 
 see the smile because of her coronet of red hair, which 
 seemed to flame in the sunlight. The obstruction was 
 unsatisfactory to him : he wanted to see her face. He 
 hesitated, and then sat down on the ground beside her 
 cautiously, as if getting into a very hot bath. 
 
 "I hope you wont mind my sitting here," he said 
 tilnidly. " It seems rude to talk down at you from a 
 height." 
 
 She shook her head and threw two more stones into 
 the pool. He could think of nothing further to say ; 
 and as she did not speak, but gravely watched the circles 
 in the water, he began to stare at them too ; and they 
 sat in silence for some minutes, steadfastly regarding the

 waves : she as if there were matter for infinite thought in 
 them : he as though the spectacle wholly confounded him. 
 At last she said, 
 
 " Have you ever realized what a vibration is ? " 
 
 " No," said Cashel, after a blank look at her. 
 
 " I am delighted to hear you confess that. We have 
 reduced everything nowadays to vibration. Light — 
 sound — sensation — ^all are either vibrations or interference 
 of vibrations. There," she said, throwing another pair 
 of pebbles in, and pointing to the two sets of widening 
 rings as they overlapped one another : " the twinkling 
 of a star, and the pulsation in a chord of music, are that. 
 But I cannot picture the thing in my own mind. I 
 wonder whether the hundreds of writers of text-books on 
 physics, who talk so glibly of vibrations, realize them 
 any better than I do." 
 
 " Not a bit of it. Not one of them. Not half so 
 well," said Cashel cheerfully, replying to as much of her 
 speech as he understood. 
 
 " Perhaps the subject does not interest you," she said, 
 turning to him. 
 
 " On the contrary : I like it of all things," said he 
 boldly. 
 
 " I can hardly say as much for my own interest in it. 
 I am told that you are a student, Mr. Cashel Byron. 
 What are your favourite studies ? — or rather, since that 
 is generally a hard question to answer, what are your 
 pursuits ? " 
 
 Alice listened. 
 
 Cashel looked doggedly at Lydia, his color slowly 
 deepening. " I am a professor," he said. 
 
 " A professor of what ? I know I should ask of 
 where ; but that would only elicit the name of a college, 
 which would convey no real information to me." 
 
 " I am a professor of science," said Cashel in a low

 voice, looking down at his left fist, which he was 
 balancing in the air before him, and stealthily hitting 
 his bent knee as if it were another person's face. 
 
 " Physical or moral science ? " persisted Lydia. 
 
 " Physical science," said Cashel. " But there's more 
 moral science in it than people think." 
 
 "Yes," said Lydia seriously. "Though I have no 
 real knowledge of physics, I can appreciate the truth of 
 that. Perhaps all the science that is not at bottom 
 physical science, is only formal nescience. I have read 
 much of physics, and have often been tempted to make 
 the experiments with my own hands — to furnish a 
 laboratory — to wield the scalpel even. For to master 
 science thoroughly, I suppose one must take one's gloves 
 oiF. Is that your opinion ? " 
 
 Cashel looked hard at her. "You never spoke a 
 truer word," he said. " But you can become a very 
 respectable amateur by working with the gloves." 
 
 " / never should. The many who beUeve they are 
 the wiser for reading accounts of experiments, deceive 
 themselves. It is as impossible to learn science from 
 hearsay as to gain wisdom from proverbs. Ah, it is so 
 easy to follow a line of argument, and so difficult to 
 grasp the facts that underlie it ! Our popular lecturers 
 on physics present us with chains of deductions so highly 
 polished that it is a luxury to let them slip from end to 
 end through our fingers. But they leave nothing behind 
 but a vague memory of the sensation they afforded." 
 
 "I wish I could talk like that," said Cashel: " — like 
 a book, I mean." 
 
 " Heaven forbid ! " said Lydia. " I beg your pardon 
 for it. Will you give me some lessons if I set to work 
 in earnest at science ? " 
 
 "Well," said Cashel with a covert grin, "I would 
 rather you came to me than to another professor ; but I

 dont think it would suit you. I should like to try my 
 hand on your friend there. She's stronger and straighter 
 than nine out of ten men." 
 
 " You set a high value on physical qualifications, then. 
 So do I." 
 
 " Only from a practical point of view, mind you," said 
 Cashel earnestly. " It isnt right to be always looking at 
 men and women as you look at horses. If you want 
 to back them in a race or in a fight, thats one thing ; 
 but if you want a friend or a sweetheart, thats another." 
 
 "Quite so," said Lydia, smiling. "You do not wish 
 to commit yourself to any warmer feeling towards Miss 
 GofF than a critical appreciation of her form and 
 condition." 
 
 " Just that," said Cashel, satisfied. " Tou understand 
 me, Miss Carew. There are some people that you 
 might talk to all day, and theyd be no wiser at the end 
 of it than they were at the beginning. Youre not one 
 of that sort." 
 
 " I wonder do we ever succeed really in communi- 
 cating our thoughts to one another. A thought must 
 take a new shape to fit itself into a strange mind. You, 
 Mr. Professor, must have acquired special experience of 
 the incommunicability of ideas in the course of your 
 lectures and lessons." 
 
 Cashel looked uneasily at the water, and said in a 
 lower voice, " Of course you may call me just whatever 
 you like ; but — if it's all the same to you — I wish you 
 wouldnt call me Professor." 
 
 "I have lived so much in countries where people 
 expect to be addressed by even the most trivial titles on 
 all occasions, that I may claim to be excused for having 
 offended on that point. Thank you for telling me. 
 But I am to blame for discussing science with you. 
 Lord Worthington told us that you had come down here

 expressly to escape from it — to recruit yourself after an 
 excess of work." 
 
 " It doesnt matter," said Cashel. 
 
 "I have not done harm enough to be greatly con- 
 cerned ; but I will not offend again. To change the 
 subject, let us look at Miss GofF's sketch." 
 
 Miss Carew had hardly uttered this suggestion, when 
 Cashel, in a business-like manner, and without the 
 slightest air of gallantry, expertly lifted her and placed 
 her on her feet. This unexpected attention gave her a 
 shock, followed by a thrill that was not disagreeable. 
 She turned to him with a faint mantling in her cheeks. 
 
 " Thank you," she said ; " but pray do not do that 
 again. It is a little humiliating to be lifted like a child. 
 You are very strong." 
 
 "There is not much strength needed to lift such a 
 feather-weight as you. Seven stone two, I should judge 
 you to be about. But there's a great art in doing these 
 things properly. I have often had to carry off a man of 
 fourteen stone, resting him all the time as if he was in 
 bed." 
 
 " Ah," said Lydia : " I see you have had some hospital 
 practice. I have often admired the skill with which 
 trained nurses handle their patients." 
 
 Cashel, without a word, followed her to where Alice sat. 
 
 " It is very foolish of me, I know," said Alice pre- 
 sently ; " but I never can draw when any one is looking 
 at me." 
 
 "You fancy that everybody is thinking about how 
 youre doing it," said Cashel, encouragingly. "Thats 
 always the way with amateurs. But the truth is that 
 not a soul except yourself is a bit concerned about it. 
 Ex-cuse me," he added, taking up the drawing, and 
 proceeding to examine it leisurely. 
 
 " Please give me my sketch, Mr. Byron," she said, her

 cheeks red with anger. Puzzled, he turned to Lydia for 
 an explanation, whilst Alice seized the sketch and packed 
 it in her portfolio. 
 
 " It is getting rather warm," said Lydia. " Shall we 
 return to the castle ? " 
 
 " I think we had better," said Alice, trembling with 
 resentment as she walked away quickly, leaving Lydia 
 alone with Cashel, who exclaimed, 
 
 " What in thunder have I done ? " 
 
 "You have made an inconsiderate remark with 
 unmistakeable sincerity." 
 
 "I only tried to cheer her up. She must have 
 mistaken what I said." 
 
 " I think not. Do you believe that young ladies like 
 to be told that there is no occasion for them to be 
 ridiculously self-conscious ? " 
 
 " I say that ! I'll take my oath I never said anything 
 of the sort." 
 
 "You worded it differently. But you assured her 
 that she need not object to have her drawing overlooked, 
 as it is of no importance to any one." 
 
 " Well, if she takes offence at that, she must be a born 
 fool. Some people cant bear to be told anything. But 
 they soon get all that thin-skinned nonsense knocked out 
 of them." 
 
 " Have you any sisters, Mr. Cashel Byron ? " 
 
 " No. Why ? " 
 
 " Or a mother ? " 
 
 " I have a mother ; but I havent seen her for years ; 
 and I dont much care if I never see her. It was through 
 her that I came to be what I am." 
 
 " Are you then dissatisfied with your profession ? " 
 
 " No : I dont mean that. I am always saying stupid 
 things." 
 
 " Yes. That comes of your ignorance of a sex accus-

 tomed to have its silliness respected. You will find it 
 hard to keep on good terms with my friend without 
 learning a little more of womanly ways." 
 
 " As to her, I wont give in that I'm wrong unless I 
 am wrong. The truth's the truth." 
 
 " Not even to please Miss GofF? " 
 
 "Not even to please you. Youd only think the 
 worse of me afterwards." 
 
 " Quite true, and quite right," said Lydia cordially. 
 " Good-bye, Mr. Cashel Byron. I must go back to Miss 
 Goff." 
 
 " I suppose you will take her part if she keeps a down 
 on me for what I said to her." 
 
 " What is a down ? A grudge ? " 
 
 " Yes. Something of that sort." 
 
 *' Colonial, is it not ? " pursued Lydia, with the air of 
 a philologist. 
 
 " Yes, I believe I picked it up in the colonies." Then 
 he added sullenly, "I suppose I shouldnt use slang in 
 speaking to you. I beg your pardon." 
 
 " Not at all. I like finding out about things, especially 
 about words. And I want to find out about you. You 
 were not born in Australia, were you ? " 
 
 " Good Lord ! no. But are you out with me because I 
 annoyed Miss GofF?" 
 
 " Not in the least. I sympathize with her annoyance 
 at the manner, if not the matter, of your rebuke : that is 
 all." 
 
 "I cant, for the life of me, see what there was in 
 what I said to raise such a fuss about. I wish you would 
 give me a nudge whenever you see me making a fool of 
 myself. I will shut up at once and ask no questions." 
 
 "So that it will be understood that my nudge means 
 ' Shut up, Mr. Cashel Byron : you are making a fool of 
 yourself ? "

 "Just so. You understand me. I told you that 
 before, didnt I ? " 
 
 "I am afraid," said Lydia, her face bright with 
 laughter, "that I cannet take charge of your manners 
 until we are a little better acquainted." 
 
 He seemed disappointed. Then his face clouded ; 
 and he began, " If you regard it as a liberty " 
 
 " Of course I regard it as a liberty," she said, neatly 
 interrupting him. " My own conduct gives me quite 
 enough to take care of. Do you know that for so very 
 strong a man and learned a professor, you seem to have 
 very little sense ? " 
 
 " By Jingo ! " exclaimed Cashel, with sudden excite- 
 ment, " I dbnt care what you say to me. You have a 
 way of giving things a turn that makes it a pleasure to 
 be shut up by you ; and if I were a gentleman as I 
 Qught to be, instead of a poor devil of a professional pug, 
 
 I would " He recollected himself, and turned quite 
 
 pale. There was a pause. 
 
 " Let me remind you," said Lydia composedly, though 
 she too had changed color at the beginning of his out- 
 burst, " that we are both wanted elsewhere at present : 
 I by Miss Goff ; and you by your servant, who has been 
 hovering about us and looking at you anxiously for some 
 minutes." 
 
 Cashel turned fiercely, and saw Mellish standing a 
 little way off, sulkily watching them. Lydia took the 
 opportunity, and left the place. As she retreated, she 
 could hear that they were at high words together ; 
 but she could not distinguish what they were saying. 
 This was fortunate ; for their language was abominable. 
 
 She found Alice in the library, seated bolt upright in 
 a chair that would have tempted a good-humored person 
 to recline. Lydia sat down in silence. Alice, looking 
 at her, discovered that she was in a fit of noiseless

 laughter. The eiFect, in contrast to her habitual self- 
 possession, was so strange that Alice almost forgot to be 
 ofFended. 
 
 " I am glad to see that it is not hard to amuse you," 
 she said. 
 
 Lydia waited to recover herself thoroughly, and then 
 replied, " I have not laughed so three times in my life. 
 Now, Alice, put aside your resentment of our neighbor's 
 impudence for the moment ; and tell me what you think 
 of him." 
 
 " I have not thought about him at all, I assure you," 
 said Alice disdainfully. 
 
 " Then think about him for a moment to oblige me ; 
 and let me know the result." 
 
 " Really, you have had much more opportunity of 
 judging than I. / have hardly spoken to him." 
 
 Lydia rose patiently and went to the bookcase. "You 
 have a cousin at one of the universities, have you not ? " 
 she said, seeking along the shelf for a volume. 
 
 " Yes," replied Alice, speaking very sweetly to atone, 
 for her want of amiability on the previous subject. 
 
 "Then perhaps you know something of university 
 slang ? " 
 
 " I never allow him to talk slang to me," said Alice 
 quickly. 
 
 "You may dictate modes of expression to a single 
 man, perhaps, but not to a whole university," said Lydia, 
 with a quiet scorn that brought unexpected tears to 
 Alice's eyes. " Do you know what a pug is ? " 
 
 " A pug ! " said Alice vacantly. " No : I have heard 
 of a bulldog — a proctor's bulldog, but never of a 
 pug." 
 
 " I must try my slang dictionary," said Lydia, taking 
 down a book. "Here it is. 'Pug — a fighting man's 
 idea of the contracted word to be produced from pugilist.' 
 


## p. (#109) ################################################

Chap. IV Cashel Byron's Profession 8 1 
 
 What an extraordinary definition ! A fighting man's 
 idea of a contraction ! Why should a man have a 
 special idea of a contraction when he is fighting ; or 
 why should he think of such a thing at all under such 
 circumstances ? Perhaps fighting man is slang too. 
 No : it is not given here. Either I mistook the word, 
 or it has some signification unknown to the compiler of 
 my dictionary." 
 
 "It seems quite plain to me," said Alice. "Pug 
 means pugilist." 
 
 " But pugilism is boxing : it is not a profession. I 
 suppose all men are more or less pugilists. I want a 
 sense of the word in which it denotes a calling or occu- 
 pation of some kind. I fancy it means a demonstrator 
 of anatomy. However, it does not matter." 
 
 " Where did you meet with it ? " 
 
 " Mr. Byron used it just now." 
 
 " Do you really like that man ? " said Alice, returning 
 to the subject more humbly than she had quitted it. 
 
 "So far, I do not dislike him. He puzzles me. If 
 the roughness of his manner is an affectation, I have 
 never seen one so successful before." 
 
 " Perhaps he does not know any better. His coarse- 
 ness did not strike me as being affected at all." 
 
 " I should agree with you but for one or two remarks 
 that fell from him. They shewed an insight into the 
 real nature of scientific knowledge, and an instinctive 
 sense of the truths underlying words, which I have 
 never met with except in men of considerable culture 
 and experience. I suspect that his manner is deliberately 
 assumed in protest against the selfish vanity which is the 
 common source of social polish. It is partly natural, 
 no doubt. He seems too impatient to choose his words 
 heedfully. Do you ever go to the theatre ? " 
 
 " No," said Alice, taken aback by this apparent

 irrelevance. "My father disapproved of it. But I was 
 there once. I saw The Lady of Lyons." 
 
 " There is a famous actress, Adelaide Gisborne " 
 
 " It was she whom I saw as the Lady of Lyons, She 
 acted it beautifully." 
 
 " Did Mr. Byron remind you of her ? " 
 
 Alice stared incredulously at Lydia. " I dont believe 
 there can be two people in the world less like one 
 another," she said. 
 
 " Nor do I," said Lydia, meditatively, dropping into 
 the literary manner which Cashel admired. "But I 
 think their dissimilarity must owe its emphasis to some 
 lurking likeness. Otherwise how could he have reminded 
 me of her ? " A long silence ensued, during which Alice, 
 conscious of some unusual stir in her patroness, watched 
 her furtively and wondered what would happen next. 
 
 "Alice." 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 "My mind is running on trifles — a sure symptom of 
 failing mental health. My visit to Wiltstoken is only one 
 of several attempts I have made to live idly since my 
 father's death. They have all failed. Work is one of 
 the necessaries of life to me. I will go up to London 
 to-morrow." 
 
 Alice's heart sank; for this seemed equivalent to a 
 dismissal. But her face expressed nothing but polite 
 indifference. 
 
 " We shall have time to run through all the follies of 
 the season before June, when I hope to return here and 
 set to work at a book I have planned. I must collect 
 materials for it in London. If I leave town before the 
 season is over, and you are unwilling to come away with 
 me, I can easily find some one who will take care of you 
 as long as you please to stay. I wish it were June 
 already ! "

Chap. IV Cashel Byron's Profession 83 
 
 Alice preferred Lydia's womanly impatience to her 
 fetalistic calm. It relieved her sense of inferiority, 
 which familiarity had increased rather than diminished. 
 She did not yet dare to suspect her patroness of any- 
 thing so vulgarly human as a sexual interest in Cashel ; 
 but she was beginning to persuade herself with some 
 success that the propriety of Lydia's manners was at 
 least questionable. That morning Miss Carew had 
 not scrupled to ask a man what his profession was ; and 
 this, at least, Alice congratulated herself on being too 
 well bred to do. She had quite lost her awe of the 
 servants ; and had begun to address them with an 
 unconscious haughtiness and a conscious politeness 
 that were making the word upstart frequent in the 
 servants' hall. Bashville, the footman, had risked his 
 popularity there by opining that Miss GofF was a fine 
 young woman. 
 
 Bashville was in his twenty-fourth year, and stood five 
 feet ten in his stockings. At The Green Man in 
 the village all the rustic pretence of indifference to his 
 metropolitan prestige had melted before his fluent oratory 
 and his keenness in political debate. In the stables he 
 was deferred to as an authority on sporting af&irs, and 
 an expert wrestler in the Cornish feshion. The women 
 servants regarded him with undissembled admiration. 
 They vied with one another in inventing expressions of 
 delight when he recited before them, which, as he had 
 a good memory and was fond of poetry, he often did. 
 They were proud to go out walking with him. But his 
 attentions never gave rise to jealousy ; for it was an open 
 secret in the servants' hall that he loved his mistress. 
 He had never said anything to that effect ; and no one 
 dared allude to it in his presence, much less rally him on 
 hig weakness ; but his passion was well known for all 
 that ; and it seemed by no means so hopeless to the

 younger members of the domestic staff as it did to the 
 cook, the butler, and Bashville himself. Miss Carew, 
 who knew the value of good servants, appreciated her 
 footman's smartness, and paid him accordingly ; but she 
 had no suspicion that she was waited on by a versatile 
 young student of poetry and public affairs, distinguished 
 for his gallantry, his personal prowess, his eloquence, 
 and his influence in local politics. 
 
 It was Bashville who now entered the library with 
 a salver, which he proffered to Alice, saying, "The 
 gentleman is waiting in the round drawing-room. Miss." 
 
 Alice took the gentleman's card, and read, "Mr. 
 Wallace Parker." 
 
 " Oh ! " she said, with vexation, glancing at Bashville 
 as if to divine his impression of the visitor. "My 
 cousin — the one we were speaking of just now — has 
 come to see me." 
 
 " How fortunate ! " said Lydia. " He will tell me 
 the meaning of pug. Ask him to lunch with us." 
 
 " You would not care for him," said Alice. " He is 
 not much used to society. I suppose I had better go 
 and see him." 
 
 Miss Carew did not reply, being plainly at a loss to 
 understand how there could be any doubt about the 
 matter. Alice went to the round drawing-room, where 
 she found Mr. Parker examining a trophy of Indian 
 armor, and presenting a back view of a short gentleman 
 in a spruce blue frock-coat. A new hat and pair of 
 gloves were also visible as he stood looking upward with 
 his hands behind him. When he turned to greet Alice, 
 he displayed a face expressive of resolute self-esteem, 
 with eyes whose watery brightness, together with the 
 bareness of his temples, from which the hair was worn 
 away, suggested late hours and either very studious 
 or very dissipated habits. He advanced confidently ;

 pressed Alice's hand warmly for several seconds ; and 
 placed a chair for her, without noticing the marked 
 coldness with which she received his attentions. 
 
 " I am not angry, Alice," he said, when he had seated 
 himself opposite to her ; " but I was surprised to learn 
 from Aunt Emily that you had come to live here without 
 consulting me. I " 
 
 " Consult you ! " she exclaimed, scornfully interrupt- 
 ing him. " I never heard of such a thing ! Why should 
 I consult you as to my movements ? " 
 
 "Well, I should not have used the word consult, 
 particularly to such an independent little lady as sweet 
 Alice Goff. Still, I think you might at least have gone 
 through the form of acquainting me with the step you 
 were taking. The relations that exist between us give 
 me a right to your confidence." 
 
 " What relations, pray ? " 
 
 " What relations ! " he repeated, with reproachful 
 emphasis. 
 
 " Yes. What relations ? " 
 
 He rose, and addressed her with tender solemnity. 
 " Alice," he began : " I have proposed to you six 
 times " 
 
 " And have I accepted you once ? " 
 
 " Hear me to the end, Alice. I know that you have 
 never explicitly accepted me ; but it has always been 
 understood that my needy circumstances were the only 
 
 obstacle to our happiness. We Dont interrupt 
 
 me, Alice : you little know whats coming. That 
 obstacle no longer exists. I have been made second 
 master at Sunbury College, with £25'^ ^ y^^*"? ^ house, 
 coals, and gas. In the course of time, I shall undoubtedly 
 succeed to the head mastership — a splendid position, 
 worth £1600 a year. You are now free from the 
 troubles that have pressed so hard upon you since your

 father's death ; and you can quit at once-^now — instantly, 
 your dependent position here." 
 
 " Thank you : I am very comfortable here. I am 
 staying on a visit with Miss Carew." 
 
 Silence ensued ; and he sat down slowly. Then she 
 added, " I am exceedingly glad that you have got some- 
 thing good at last. It must be a great relief to your 
 poor mother." 
 
 " I fancied, Alice — though it may have been only 
 fancy — I fancied that your mother was colder than usual 
 in her manner this morning. I hope the luxuries of 
 this palatial mansion are powerless to corrupt your heart. 
 I cannot lead you to a castle and place crowds of liveried 
 servants at your beck and call ; but I can make you 
 mistress of an honorable English- home, independent 
 of the bounty of strangers. You can never be more 
 than a lady, Alice." 
 
 " It is very good of you to lecture me, I am sure." 
 
 " You might be serious with me," he said, rising in 
 ill humor, and walking a little way down the room. 
 *' I think the offer of a man's hand ought to be received 
 with respect." 
 
 " Oh ! I did not quite understand. I thought we 
 agreed that you are not to make me that offer every time 
 we meet." 
 
 " It was equally understood that the subject was only 
 deferred until I should be in a position to resume it 
 without binding you to a long engagement. That time 
 has come now ; and I expect a favorable answer at last. 
 I am entitled to one, considering how patiently I have 
 waited for it." 
 
 " For my part, Wallace, I must say I do not think 
 it wise for you to think of marrying with only ;^35o 
 a year." 
 
 " With a house : remember that ; and coals, and gas !

 You are becoming very prudent now that you live with 
 Miss Whatshername here. I fear you no longer love 
 me, Alice." 
 
 " I never said I loved you at any time." 
 
 " Pshaw ! You never said so, perhaps ; but vou 
 always gave me to understand " 
 
 " I did nothing of the sort, Wallace ; and I wont have 
 you say so." 
 
 " In short," he retorted bitterly, " you think you will 
 pick up some swell here who will be a better bargain 
 than I am." 
 
 " Wallace ! How dare you ? " 
 
 " You hurt my feelings, Alice ; and I speak out. I 
 know how to behave myself quite as well as those who 
 have the entree here ; but when my entire happiness is at 
 stake I do not stand on punctilio. Therefore I insist on a 
 straightforward answer to my fair, honorable proposal." 
 
 " Wallace," said Alice, with dignity : " I will not be 
 forced into giving an answer against my will. I regard 
 you as a cousin." 
 
 "I do not wish to be regarded as a cousin. Have I 
 ever regarded you as a cousin ? " 
 
 " And do you suppose, Wallace, that I should permit 
 you to call me by my Christian name, and be as familiar 
 as we have always been together, if you were not my 
 cousin ? If so, you must have a very strange opinion of 
 me. 
 
 " I did not think that luxury could so corrupt " 
 
 "You said that before," said Alice pettishly. "Do 
 not keep repeating the same thing over and over : you 
 know it is one of your bad habits. Will you stay to 
 lunch ? Miss Carew told me to ask you." 
 
 " Indeed ! Miss Carew is very kind. Please inform 
 her that I am deeply honored, and that I feel quite 
 disturbed at being unable to accept her patronage."

 Alice poised her head disdainfully. "No doubt it 
 amuses you to make yourself ridiculous," she said ; " but 
 I must say I do not see any occasion for it." 
 
 " I am sorry that my behavior is not suiBciently good 
 for you. You never found- any cause to complain of it 
 w^hen our surroundings wrere less aristocratic. I am 
 quite ashamed of taking so much of your valuable time'. 
 Good morning." 
 
 " Good morning. But I do not see why you are in 
 such a rage." 
 
 " I am not in a rage. I am only grieved to find that 
 you are corrupted by luxury. I thought your principles 
 were higher. Good morning, Miss Goff. I shall not 
 have the pleasure of seeing you again in this very choice 
 mansion." 
 
 " Are you really going, Wallace ? " said Alice, rising. 
 
 « Yes. Why should I stay ? " 
 
 She rang the bell, greatly disconcerting him ; for he 
 had expected her to detain him and make advances for a 
 reconciliation. Before they could exchange more words, 
 Bashville entered. 
 
 " Good-bye," said Alice politely. 
 
 " Good-bye," he replied, through his teeth. He walked 
 loftily out, passing Bashville with marked scorn. 
 
 He had left the house, and was descending the terrace 
 steps, when he was overtaken by the footman, who said 
 civilly, 
 
 "Beg your pardon, sir. Youve forgotten this, I 
 think." And he handed him a walking stick. 
 
 Parker's first idea was that his stick had attracted the 
 man's attention by the poor figure it made in the castle 
 hall, and that Bashville was requesting him, with covert 
 superciliousness, to remove his property. On second 
 thoughts his self-esteem rejected this suspicion as too 
 humiliating ; but he resolved to shew Bashville that he 
 


## p. (#117) ################################################

Chap.l-v Cashel Byron's Profession 89 
 
 had a gentleman to deal with. So he took the stick, 
 and, instead of thanking Bashville, handed him five 
 shillings. 
 
 Bashville smiled and shook his head. " Oh no, sir," 
 he said : " thank you all the same. Those are not my 
 view^s." 
 
 "The more fool you," said Parker, pocketing the 
 coins, and turning aviray. 
 
 Bashville's countenance changed. " Come come, sir," 
 he said, follow^ing Parker to the foot of the steps : " fair 
 words deserve fair words. I am no more a fool than you 
 are. A gentleman should know his place as well as a 
 servant." 
 
 " Oh, go to the devil," muttered Packer, turning very 
 red, and hurrying away. 
 
 " If you werent my mistress's guest," said Bashville, 
 looking menacingly after him, "I'd send you to bed for 
 a week for sending me to the devil."

CHAPTER V 
 
 Miss Carew unhesitatingly carried out her intention of 
 going to London, where she took a house in Regent's 
 Park, to the disappointment of Alice, who had hoped to 
 live in Mayfeir, or at least in South Kensington. But 
 Lydia set great store by the high northerly ground and 
 open air of the Park ; and Alice found almost perfect 
 happiness in driving through London in a fine carriage 
 and fine clothes. She liked that better than concerts of 
 classical music, which she did not particularly rehsh, or 
 even than the opera, to which they went often. The 
 theatres pleased her more, though the amusements there 
 were tamer than she had expected. " Society " was 
 delightful to her because it was real London society. 
 She acquired a mania for dancing ; went out every night ; 
 and seemed to herself far more distinguished and attractive 
 than she had ever been in Wiltstoken, where she had 
 nevertheless held a sufficiently favol-able opinion of her 
 own manners and person. 
 
 Lydia did not share all these dissipations. She easily 
 procured invitations and chaperones for Alice, who 
 wondered why so intelligent a woman would take the 
 trouble to sit out a stupid concert, and then go home, 
 just as the real pleasure of the evening was beginning. 
 One Saturday morning, at breakfast, Lydia said, 
 " Have you ever been to the Crystal Palace ? "

 "No," said Alice, with some scorn, which she 
 repented when Lydia rejoined sedately, 
 
 "I think I will go down there to-day and wander 
 about the gardens for a while. There is to be a concert 
 in the afternoon, at which Madame Szczympli^a, whose 
 playing you do not admire, will appear. Will you come 
 with me ? " 
 
 " Of course," said Alice, resolutely dutiful. 
 
 " Of choice : not of course," said Lydia. " Are you 
 engaged for to-morrow evening ? " 
 
 "Sunday? Oh no. Besides, I consider all my 
 engagements subject to your convenience." 
 
 There was a pause, long enough for this assurance to 
 fall perfectly flat. Alice bit her lip. Then Lydia said, 
 " Do you know Mrs. Hoskyn ? " 
 
 "Mrs. Hoskyn who gives Sunday evenings? Shall 
 we go there ? " said Alice eagerly. " People often ask 
 me whether I have been at one of them. But I dont 
 know her — though I have seen her. Is she nice ? " 
 
 " She is a young woman who has read a great deal ot 
 art criticism, and been deeply impressed by it. She has 
 made her house famous by bringing there all the clever 
 people she meets, and making them so comfortable that 
 they take care to go again. But she has not, fortunately 
 for her, allowed her craze for art to get the better of her 
 common sense. She has married a prosperous man of 
 business, who probably never read anything but a news- 
 paper since be left school ; and I doubt if there is a 
 happier pair in England." 
 
 "I presume she had sense enough to know that she 
 could not afford to choose," said Alice complacently. 
 "She is very ugly." 
 
 " Do you think so ? She has many admirers, and 
 was, I am told, engaged to Mr. Herbert, the artist, before 
 she met Mr. Hoskyn. We shall meet Mr. Herbert there

 to-morrow, and a number of celebrated persons besides : 
 his wife Madame Szczympli^a the pianiste, Owen Jack 
 the composer, Conolly the inventor, and others. The 
 occasion will be a special one, as Herr Abendgasse, a 
 remarkable German socialist-of-the-chair and art critic, is 
 to deliver a lecture on ' The True in Art.' Be careful, 
 in speaking of him in society, to refer to him as a 
 sociologist, and not a socialist. Are you particularly 
 anxious to hear him lecture ? " 
 
 " No doubt it will be very interesting," said Alice. 
 " I should not like to miss the opportunity of going to 
 Mrs. Hoskyn's. People so often ask me whether I have 
 been there, and whether I know this, that, and the other 
 celebrated person, that I feel rather out of it in my rustic 
 ignorance." 
 
 " Because," pursued Lydia, " I had intended not to go 
 until after the lecture. Herr Abendgasse is enthusiastic 
 and eloquent, but not original. I prefer to get his ideas 
 direct from their inventors ; so unless you are specially 
 interested " 
 
 " Not at all. If he is a socialist I had much rather 
 not listen to him, particularly on Sunday evening." 
 
 It was arranged accordingly that they should go to 
 Mrs. Hoskyn's after the lecture. Meanwhile they went 
 to Sydenham, where Alice went through the Crystal 
 Palace with provincial curiosity, and Lydia explained the 
 place encyclopaedically. In the afternoon there was 
 a concert, at which a band played several long pieces 
 of music, which Lydia seemed to enjoy, though she 
 occasionally found fault with the performers. Alice, 
 able to detect neither the faults in the execution nor the 
 beauty of the music, did as she saw the others do — 
 pretended to be pleased, and applauded decorously. 
 Madame Szczympli^a, whom she expected to meet at 
 Mrs. Hoskyn's, appeared, and played a fantasia for piano-

Chap.v Cashel Byron's Profession 93 
 
 forte and orchestra by the famous Jack, another of Mrs. 
 Hoskyn's circle. There was in the program an analysis 
 of this composition, from which Alice learnt that by 
 attentively listening to the adagio she could hear the 
 angels singing therein. She listened as attentively as 
 she could, but heard no angels, and was astonished when, 
 at the conclusion of the fantasia, the audience applauded 
 Madame Szczympli^a as if she had made them hear the 
 music of the spheres. Even Lydia seemed moved, and 
 said, 
 
 " Strange, that she is only a woman like the rest of us, 
 with just the same narrow bounds to her existence, and 
 just the same prosaic cares — that she will go by train to 
 Victoria, and thence home in a common vehicle, instead 
 of embarking in a great shell, and being drawn by swans 
 to some enchanted island. Her playing reminds me of 
 myself as I was when I believed in fairyland, and indeed 
 knew little about any other land." 
 
 "They say," said Alice, "that her husband is very 
 jealous, and that she leads him a terrible life." 
 
 '^ They say anything that brings gifted people to the 
 level of their own experience. Doubtless they are right. 
 I have not met Mr. Herbert ; but I have seen his 
 pictures, which suggest that he reads everything and sees 
 nothing ; for they all represent scenes described in some 
 poem. If one-could only find an educated man who had 
 never read a book, what a delightful companion he 
 would be ! " 
 
 When the concert was over, they did not return 
 directly to town, as Lydia wished to walk awhile in the 
 gardens. In consequence, when they left Sydenham 
 they got into a Waterloo train, and so had to change at 
 Clapham Junction. It was a fine summer evening ; and 
 Alice, though she thought that it became ladies to hide 
 themselves fi-om the public in waiting-rooms at railway

 stations, did not attempt to dissuade Lydia from walking 
 to and fro at an unfrequented end of the platform, which 
 ended in a bank covered with flowers. 
 
 " To my mind," said Lydia, " Clapham Junction is 
 one of the prettiest places about London." 
 
 " Indeed ! " said Alice, a little maliciously. " I 
 thought that all artistic people looked on junctions and 
 railway lines as blots on the landscape." 
 
 " Some of them do," said Lydia ; " but they are not 
 the artists of our generation ; and those who take up 
 their cry are no better than parrots. If every holiday 
 recollection of my youth — every escape from town to 
 country — be associated with the railway, I must feel 
 tbwards it otherwise than my father did, upon whose 
 middle age it came as a monstrous iron innovation. The 
 locomotive is one of the wonders of modern childhood. 
 Children crowd upon a bridge to see the train pass 
 beneath. Little boys strut along the streets pufl[ing and 
 whistling in imitation of the engine. All that romance, 
 silly as it looks, becomes sacred in after life. Besides, 
 when it is not underground in a foul London tunnel, 
 a train is a beautiful thing. Its pure white fleece of 
 steam harmonizes with every variety of landscape. And 
 its sound ! Have you ever stood on a sea coast skirted 
 by a railway, and listened as the train came into hearing 
 in the far distance ? At first it can hardly be dis- 
 tinguished from the noise of the sea ; then you recognize 
 it by its variation : one moment smothered in a deep 
 cutting, and the next sent echoing from some hillside. 
 Sometimes it runs smoothly for many minutes, and then 
 breaks suddenly into a rhythmic clatter, always changing 
 in distance and intensity. When it comes near, you 
 should get into a tunnel, and stand there whilst it passes. 
 I did that once ; and it was like the last page of an over- 
 ture by Beethoven, thunderingly impetuous. I cannot

Chap.V Cashel Byron's Profession 95 
 
 conceive how any person can hope to disparage a train 
 by comparing it with a stage coach ; and I know some- 
 thing of stage coaches, or, at least, of diligences. Their 
 eiFect on the men employed about them ought to decide 
 the superiority of steam without further argument. I 
 never saw an engine driver who did not seem an excep- 
 tionally intelligent mechanic ; whilst the very writers 
 and artists who have preserved the memory of the 
 coaching days for us do not appear to have taken coach- 
 men seriously, or to have regarded them as responsible 
 and civilized men. Abuse of the railway from a pastoral 
 point of view is obsolete. There are millions of grown 
 persons in England to whom the far sound of the train is 
 as pleasantly suggestive as the piping of a blackbird. 
 And then — is not that Lord Worthington getting out of 
 the train ? Yes, that one, at the third platform from 
 
 this. He " She stopped. Alice looked, but could 
 
 see neither Lord Worthington nor the cause of a subtle 
 but perceptible change in Lydia, who said quickly, 
 
 " He is probably coming to our train. Come to the 
 waiting-room." She walked swiftly along the platform as 
 she spoke. Alice hurried after her ; and they had but 
 just got into the room, the door of which was close to 
 the staircase which gave access to the platform, when a 
 coarse din of men's voices told them that a noisy party 
 was ascending the steps. Presently a man emerged reel- 
 ing, and at once began to execute a drunken dance, and 
 to sing as well as his condition and musical faculty 
 allowed. Lydia stood near the window of the room, and 
 watched in silence. Alice, following her example, recog- 
 nized the drunken dancer as Mellish. He was followed 
 by three men, gaily attired and highly elated, but com- 
 paratively sober. After them came Cashel Byron, showily 
 dressed in a velveteen coat and tightly fitting ft.wn- 
 coloured pantaloons that displayed the muscles of his legs.

 He also seemed quite sober j but he was dishevelled ; and 
 his left eye blinked frequently, the adjacent brow and 
 cheek being much yellower than his natural complexion, 
 which appeared to advantage on the right side of his face. 
 Walking steadily to Mellish, who was now asking each 
 of the bystanders in turn to come and drink at his 
 expense, he seized him by the collar, and sternly bade him 
 cease making a fool of himself. Mellish tried to embrace 
 him. 
 
 " My own boy," he exclaimed affectionately. " He's 
 my little nonpareil. Cashel Byron agin the world at 
 catch weight. Bob Mellish's money " 
 
 " You sot," said Cashel, rolling him about until he was 
 giddy as well as drunk, and then forcing him to sit down 
 on a bench : " one would think you never saw a mill or 
 won a bet in your life before." 
 
 " Steady, Byron," said one of the others. " Here's his 
 lordship." Lord Worthington was coming up the stairs, 
 apparently the most excited of the party. 
 
 " Fine man ! " he cried, patting Cashel on the shoulder. 
 " Splendid man ! You have won a monkey for me to-day j 
 and you shall have your share of it, old boy." 
 
 "I trained him," said Mellish, staggering forward 
 again. " I trained him. You know me, my lord. You 
 know Bob Mellish. A word with your lordship in 
 c — confidence. You jes ask who knows how to make 
 
 the beef go and the muscle come. You ask 1 ask 
 
 your lorship's par'n. What'll your lorship take ? " 
 
 " Take care, for Heaven's sake ! " exclaimed Lord 
 Worthington, clutching at him as he reeled backwards 
 towards the line. " Dont you see the train ? " 
 
 " / know," said Mellish gravely. " I am all right : no 
 
 man more so. I am Bob Mellish. You ask " 
 
 " Here. Come out of this," said one of the party, a 
 powerful man with a scarred face and crushed nose,

 grasping Mellish and thrusting him into the train. 
 " You want a beefsteak on that ogle of yours, where you 
 napped the Dutchman's auctioneer, Byron. It's got 
 more yellow paint on it than yll like to shew in church 
 to-morrow." 
 
 At this they all gave a roar of laughter, and took an 
 empty first-class compartment by storm. Lydia and Alice 
 had hardly time to take their places in the train before it 
 started. 
 
 "Really I must say," said Alice, "that if those were 
 Mr. Cashel Byron's and Lord Worthington's associates, 
 their tastes are very peculiar." 
 
 "Yes," said Lydia, almost grimly. "I am a fair 
 linguist ; but I did not understand a single sentence of 
 their conversation, though I heard it all distinctly." 
 
 " They were not gentlemen," said Alice. " You say 
 that no one can tell by a person's appearance whether he 
 is a gentleman or not ; but surely you cannot think that 
 those men are Lord Worthington's equals." 
 
 " I do not," said Lydia. " They are ruffians ; and 
 CashelByron is the most unmistakeable ruffian of them all." 
 
 Alice, awestruck, did not venture to speak again until 
 they left the train at Victoria. There was a crowd 
 outside the carriage in which Cashel had travelled. Alice 
 -hastened past ; but Lydia asked a guard whether anything 
 was the matter. He replied that a drunken man, alighting 
 from the train, had fallen down upon the rails, so that, 
 had the carriage been in motion, he would have been 
 killed. Lydia thanked the guard, and, as she turned from 
 him, found Bashville standing before her, touching his 
 hat. She had given him no instructions to attend. How- 
 ever, she accepted his presence as a matter of course, and 
 inquired whether the carriage was there. 
 
 " No, madam," replied Bashville. " The coachman 
 had no orders." 
 


## p. (#126) ################################################

98 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.V 
 
 " Quite right. A hansom, if you please." When he 
 was gone, she said to Alice, " Did you tell Bashville to 
 meet us ? " 
 
 " Oh dear no ! I should not think of doing such a 
 thing." 
 
 " Strange ! However, he knows his duties better than 
 I do ; so I have no doubt that he has acted properly. He 
 has been waiting all the afternoon, I suppose, poor fellow." 
 
 "He has nothing else to do," said Alice carelessly. 
 " Here he is. He has picked out a new hansom for us 
 too." 
 
 Meanwhile, Mellish had been dragged from beneath 
 the train, and seated on the knee of one of his com- 
 ' panions. He was in a stupor, and had a large lump on 
 his brow. His eye was almost closed. The man with 
 the crushed nose now shewed himself an expert surgeon. 
 Whilst Cashel supported the patient on the knee of 
 another man, and the rest of the party kept ofF the crowd 
 by mingled persuasion and violence, he produced a lancet 
 and summarily reduced the swelling by lancing it. He 
 then dressed the puncture neatly with appliances for that 
 purpose which he carried about him, and shouted in 
 Mellish's ear to rouse him. But the trainer only groaned, 
 and let his head drop inert on his breast. More shouting 
 was resorted to, but in vain. Cashel impatiently ex- 
 pressed an opinion that Mellish was shamming, and 
 declared that he would not stand there to be fooled with 
 all the evening. 
 
 " If he was my pal 'stead o yours," said the man with 
 the broken nose, " I'd wake him up fast enough." 
 
 " I'll save you the trouble," said Cashel, coolly stooping 
 and seizing between his teeth the cartilage of the trainer's 
 ear. 
 
 " That's the way to do it," said the other approvingly, 
 as Mellish screamed and started to his feet, "Now then. 
 


## p. (#127) ################################################

Chap.v Cashel Byron's Profession 99 
 
 On with you." He took Mellish's right arm ; Cashel 
 took the left ; and they brought him away between them 
 without paying the least heed to his tears, his protestations 
 that he was hurt, his plea that he was an old man, or his 
 bitter demand as to where Cashel would have been at that 
 moment without his care. 
 
 Lord Worthington had taken advantage of this accident 
 to slip away from his travelling companions, and drive 
 alone to his lodgings in Jermyn Street. He was still 
 greatly excited ; and when his valet, an old retainer with 
 whom he was on familiar terms, brought him a letter that 
 had arrived during his absence, he asked him four times 
 whether any one had called, and four times interrupted 
 him by scraps of information about the splendid day he 
 had had and the luck he was in. 
 
 " I betted five hundred even that it would be over in 
 quarter of an hour ; and then I betted Byron two hundred 
 and fifty to one that it wouldnt. Thats the way to do 
 it : eh, Bedford ? Catch Cashel letting two hundred and 
 fifty slip through his fingers ! By George though, he's 
 an artful card. At the end of fourteen minutes I thought 
 my five hundred was corpsed. The Dutchman was full 
 of fight ; and Cashel suddenly turned weak and tried to 
 back out of the rally. You should have seen the gleam 
 in the Dutchman's eye when he rushed in after him. He 
 made cock-sure of finishing him straight off." 
 
 " Indeed, my lord. Dear me ! " 
 
 " I should think so : I was taken in by it myself. It 
 was only done to draw the poor devil. By George, 
 Bedford, you should have seen the way Cashel put in his 
 right. But you couldnt have seen it : it was too quick. 
 The Dutchman was asleep on the grass before he knew 
 he'd been hit. Byron had collected fifteen pounds for 
 him before he came to. His jaw must feel devilish queer 
 after it. By Jove, Bedford, Cashel is a perfect wonder.

 I'd back him for every penny I possess against any man 
 alive. He makes you feel proud of being an English- 
 man." 
 
 Bedford looked on with submissive wonder as his 
 master, transfigured with enthusiasm, went hastily to and 
 fro through the room, occasionally clenching his fist and 
 smiting an imaginary Dutchman. The valet at last 
 ventured to remind him that he had forgotten the letter. 
 
 " Oh, hang the letter ! " said Lord Worthington. 
 " It's Mrs. Hoskyn's writing — an invitation, or some 
 such rot. Here : let's see' it." 
 
 Campden Hill Road. Saturday. 
 My dear Lord IVorthington 
 
 I have not forgotten my promise, to obtain fir you a 
 near view of the famous Mrs. Herbert — Madame Simplicita, 
 as you call her. She will be with us to-morrow evening ; and 
 we shall be very happy to see you then, if you care to come. 
 At nine o^clock, Herr Abendgasse, a celebrated German Art 
 critic and a great friend of mine, will read us a paper on 
 " The True in Art " ; but I will not pay you the compliment 
 of pretending to believe that that interests you ; so you may 
 come at ten or half-past, by which hour all the serious 
 business of the evening will be over. 
 
 "Well, there is nothing like cheek," said Lord 
 Worthington, breaking off in his perusal. "These 
 women think that because I enjoy life in a rational way, 
 I dont know the back of a picture from the front, or the 
 inside of a book from the cover. I shall go at nine 
 sharp." 
 
 / suppose none of your acquaintances take an interest in 
 Art. Could you not bring me a celebrity or two ! I am 
 very anxious to have as good an audience as possible for Herr 
 Abendgasse. However, as it is, he will have no reason to

 complain, as I flatter myself that I have already secured a 
 very distinguished assembly. Still, if you can add a secona 
 illustrious name to my list, by all means do so. 
 
 "Very good, Mrs. Hoskyn," said Lord Worthingt9n, 
 looking cunningly at the bewildered Bedford. "You 
 shall have a celebrity — a. real one — ^none of your mouldy 
 old Germans — if I can only get him to come. If any of 
 her people dont like him, they can tell him so. Eh, 
 Bedford?"

CHAPTER VI 
 
 Next evening, Lydia and Alice reached' Mrs. Hoskyn's 
 house in Campden Hill Road a few minutes before ten 
 o'clock. They found Lord Worthington in the front 
 garden, smoking and chatting with Mr. Hoskyn. 
 He threw away his cigar, and returned to the house 
 with the two ladies, who observed that he was some- 
 what flushed with wine. They went into a parlor 
 to take ofF their wraps, leaving him at the foot of the 
 stairs. Presently they heard some one come down and 
 address him excitedly. 
 
 "Worthington. Worthington. He has begun making 
 a speech before the whole room. He got up the moment 
 old Abendgasse sat down. Why the deuce did you start 
 champagne at dinner ? " 
 
 " Sh-sh-sh ! You dont say so ! Come with me ; and 
 let's try to getihim away quietly." 
 
 " Did you hear that ? " said Alice. " Something must 
 have happened." 
 
 " I hope so," said Lydia. " Ordinarily, the fault in 
 these receptions is that nothing happens. Do not 
 announce us, if you please," she added, to the servant, as 
 they ascended the stairs. " Since we have come late, let 
 us spare the feelings of Herr Abendgasse by going in as 
 quietly as possible." 
 
 They had no difficulty in entering unnoticed ; for

Chap. VI Cashel Byron's Profession 103 
 
 Mrs. Hoskyn considered obscurity beautiful ; and her 
 rooms were but dimly lighted by two curious lanterns of 
 pink glass, within which were vaporous flames. In the 
 middle of the larger apartment was a small table covered 
 with garnet-colored plush, bearing a reading desk and 
 two candles in silver candlesticks, the light from which, 
 brighter than the lanterns, cast strong double shadows 
 from the groups of standing figures. The surrounding 
 space was crowded with chairs, occupied chiefly by ladies. 
 Behind them, along the wall, stood a row of men, among 
 whom was Lucian Webber. All were staring at Cashel 
 Byron, who was making a speech to some bearded and 
 spectacled gentleman at the table. Lydia, who had 
 never before seen him either in evening dress or quite at 
 his ease, was astonished at his bearing. His eyes were 
 sparkling ; his confidence overbore the company ; and 
 his rough voice created the silence it broke. He was in 
 . high good humor, and marked his periods by the swing 
 of his extended left arm, whilst he held his right hand 
 close to his body and occasionally pointed his remarks by 
 slyly wagging its forefinger. 
 
 " executive power," he was saying, as Lydia 
 
 entered. "Thats a very good expression, gentlemen, 
 and one that I can tell you a lot about. We have been 
 told that if we want to civilize our neighbors, we must 
 do it mainly by the example of our own lives, by each 
 becoming a living illustration of the highest culture we 
 know. But what I ask is, how is anybody to know that 
 youre an illustration of culture ? You cant go about 
 like a sandwich man with a label on your back to tell all 
 the fine notions you have in your head ; and you may be 
 sure no person will consider your mere appearance prefer- 
 able to his own. You want an executive power : thats 
 what you want. Suppose you walked along the street 
 and saw a man beating a woman, and setting a bad

I04 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. VI 
 
 example to the roughs. Well, you would be bound to 
 set a good example to them j and, if youre men, youd 
 like to save the woman ; but you couldnt do it by 
 merely living ; for that would be setting the bad example 
 of passing on and leaving the poor creature to be beaten. 
 What is it that you need to know, then, so as to be able 
 to act up to your ideas ? Why, you want to know how to 
 hit him, when to hit him, and where to hit him ; and 
 then you want the nerve to go in and do it. Thats 
 executive power ; and thats whats wanted worse than 
 sitting down and thinking how good you are, which is 
 what this gentleman's teaching comes to after all. 
 Dont you see ? You want executive power to set an 
 example. If you leave all that to the roughs, it's their 
 example that will spread, and not yours. And look at 
 the politics of it. I heard a man in the park one Sunday 
 say that in this country we can do nothing ; for, says he, 
 if the lords and the landlords, or any other collection of 
 nobs, were to drive us into the sea, what could we do ' 
 but go ? There's a gentleman laughing at me for saying 
 that ; but I ask him what would he do if the police or 
 the soldiers came this evening and told him to turn out 
 of his comfortable house into the Thames ? Tell em 
 he wouldnt vote for their employers at the next election, 
 perhaps ? Or, if that didnt stop them, tell em that he'd 
 ask his friends to do the same ? Thats a pretty execu- 
 tive power ! No, gentlemen. Dont let yourself be 
 deceived by people that have staked their money against 
 you. The first thing to learn is how to fight. There's no 
 use in buying books and pictures unless you know how to 
 keep them and your own head as well. If that gentle- 
 man that laughed knew how to fight, and his neighbors 
 all knew how to fight too, he wouldnt need to fear 
 police, nor soldiers, nor Russians, nor Prussians, nor any 
 of the millions of men that may be let loose on him any

 day of the week, safe though he thinks himself. But, 
 says you, lets have a division of labor. Lets not fight 
 for ourselves, but pay other men to fight for us. That 
 shews how some people, when they get hold of an idea, 
 will work it to that foolish length that it's wearisome to 
 listen to them. Fighting is the power of self-preserva- 
 tion : another man cant do it for you. You might as 
 well divide the labor of eating your dinner, and pay one 
 fellow to take the beef, another the beer, and the third 
 the potatoes. But let us put it for the sake of argument 
 that you do pay others to fight for you. Suppose some 
 one else pays them higher, and they right a cross, or turn 
 openly against you ? Youd have only yourself to blame 
 for giving the executive power to money. Therefore I 
 say that a man's first duty is to learn to fight. If he 
 cant do that, he cant set an example ; he cant stand up 
 for his own rights or his neighbors' ; he cant keep him- 
 self in bodily health ; and if he sees the weak ill-used by 
 the strong, the most he can do is to sneak away and tell 
 the nearest policeman, who most likely wont turn up 
 until the worst of the mischief is done. Coming to this 
 lady's drawing-room, and making an illustration of him- 
 self, wont make him feel like a man after that. Let me 
 be understood though, gentlemen : I dont intend that 
 you should take everything I say too exactly — too liter- 
 ally, as it were. If you see a man beating a woman, 
 I think you should interfere on principle. But dont 
 expect to be thanked by her for it ; and keep your eye 
 on her : dont let her get behind you. As for him, just 
 give him a good one and go away. Never stay to get 
 yourself into a street fight ; for it's low, and generally 
 turns out badly for all parties. However, thats only a 
 bit of practical advice. It doesnt alter the great 
 principle that you should get an executive power. 
 When you get that, youll have courage in you ; and,

 whats more, your courage will be of some use to you. 
 For though you may have courage by nature ; still, if 
 you havent executive powder as well, your courage will 
 only lead you to stand up to be beaten by men that have 
 both courage and executive po^ver ; and what good does 
 that do you ? People say that youre a game fellow ; 
 but they wont find the stakes for you unless you can 
 win them. Youd far better put your game in your 
 pocket, and throw up the sponge while you can see to 
 do it. 
 
 " Now, on this subject of game, Ive something to say 
 that will ease the professor's mind on a point that he 
 seemed anxious about. I am no musician ; but I'll just 
 shew you how a man that understands one art under- 
 stands every art. I made out from the gentleman's 
 remarks that there is a man in the musical line named 
 Wagner, who is what you might call a game sort of 
 composer ; and that the musical fancy, though they cant 
 deny that his tunes are first-rate, and that, so to speak, 
 he wins his fights, yet they try to make out that he wins 
 them in vi outlandish way, and that he has no real 
 science. Now I tell the gentleman not to mind such 
 talk. As I have just shewn you, his game wouldnt be 
 any use to him without science. He might have beaten 
 a few second-raters with a rush while he was young; 
 but he wouldnt have lasted out as he has done unless he 
 was clever as well. It's the newness of his style that 
 puzzles people ; for, mind you, every man has to grow 
 his own style out of himself; and there is no use in 
 thinking that it will be the same as the last fellow's, or 
 right for the next fellow, or that it's the style, and that 
 every other style is wrong. More rot is talked through 
 not knowing that than anything else. You will find that 
 those that run Professor Wagner down are either jealous, 
 or they are old stagers that are not used to his style, and

 think that anything new must be bad. Just wait a bit, 
 and, take my word for it, theyll turn right round and 
 swear that his style isnt new at all, and that he stole it 
 from some one they saw when they were ten years old. 
 History shews us that that is the way of such fellows in 
 all ages, as the gentleman said ; and he gave you 
 Beethoven as an example. But an example like that 
 dont go home to you, because there isnt one man in a 
 million that ever heard of Beethoven. Take a man that 
 everybody has heard of: Jack Randall ! The very same 
 things were said of him. After that, you neednt go to 
 musicians for an example. The truth is, that there are 
 people in the world with that degree of envy and malice 
 in them that they cant bear to allow a good man his 
 merits ; and when they have to admit that he can do one 
 thing, they try to make out that there's something else 
 he cant do. Come : I'll put it to you short and 
 business-like. This German gentleman, who knows all 
 about music, tells you that many pretend that this 
 Wagner has game, but no science. Well, I, though I 
 know nothing about milsic, will bet you tprenty-five 
 pounds that there's others that allow him to be full of 
 science, but say that he has no game, and that all he does 
 comes from his head, and not from his heart. I will. 
 I'll bet twenty-five pounds on it ; and let the gentleman 
 of the house be stakeholder, and the German gentleman 
 referee. Eh ? Well, I'm glad to see that there are no 
 takers. 
 
 " Now we'll go to another little point that the gentle- 
 man forgot. He recommended you to learn — to make 
 yourselves better and wiser from day to day. But he 
 didnt tell you why it is that you wont learn, in spite of 
 his advice. I suppose that, heing a foreigner, he was 
 afraid of hurting your feelings by talking too freely to 
 you. But youre not so thin-skinned as to take offence

 at a little plain speaking, I'll be bound ; so I tell you 
 straight out that the reason you wont learn is not that 
 you dont want to be clever, or that you are lazier than 
 many that have learnt a great deal ; but just because 
 youd like people to think that you know everything 
 already — because youre ashamed to be seen going to 
 school ; and you calculate that if you only hold your 
 tongue and look wise, youll get through life without 
 your ignorance being found out. But wheres the good 
 of lies and pretence ? What does it matter if you get 
 laughed at by a cheeky brat or two for your awkward 
 beginnings ? Whats the use of always thinking of how 
 youre looking, when your sense might tell you that 
 other people are thinking about their own looks and not 
 about yours ? A big boy doesnt look well on a lower 
 form, certainly ; but when he works his way up he'll be 
 glad he began. I speak to you more particularly because 
 youre Londoners ; and Londoners beat all creation for 
 thinking about themselves. However, I dont go with 
 the gentleman in everything he said. All this struggling 
 and striving to make the world better is a great mistake ; 
 not because it isnt a good thing to improve the world 
 if you know how to do it, but because striving and 
 struggling is the worst way you could set about doing 
 anything. It gives a man a bad style, and weakens him. 
 It shews that he dont believe in himself much. When 
 I heard the professor striving and struggling so earnestly 
 to set you to work reforming this, that, and the other, I 
 said to myself, ' He's got himself to persuade as well as us. 
 
 That isnt the language of conviction.' Whose " 
 
 " Really, sir," said Lucian Webber, who had made his 
 way to the table, " I think, as you have now addressed 
 us at considerable length, and as there are other persons 
 present whose opinions probably excite as much curiosity 
 as yours " He was interrupted by a " Hear, hear,"

 followed by " No, no," and " Go on," uttered in more 
 subdued tones than are customary at public meetings, 
 but with more animation than is usually displayed in 
 drawing-rooms. Cashel, who had been for a moment 
 somewhat put out, turned to Lucian and said, in a tone 
 intended to repress, but at the same time humor his 
 impatience, "Dont you be in a hurry, sir. You shall 
 have your turn presently. Perhaps I may tell you some- 
 thing you dont know before you stop." Then he turned 
 again to the company, and resumed. 
 
 "We were talking about effort when this young 
 gentleman took it upon himself to break the ring. Now, 
 nothing can be what you might call artistically done, if 
 it's done with an effort. If a thing cant be done light 
 and easy, steady and certain, let it not be done at all. 
 Sounds strange, doesnt it ? But I'll tell you a stranger 
 thing. The more effort you make, the less effect you 
 produce. A would-be artist is no artist a,t all. I learnt that 
 in my own profession (never mind what that profession is 
 just at present, as the ladies might think the worse of me 
 for it). But in all professions any work that shows signs 
 of labor, straining, yearning — as the German gentleman 
 said — or effort of any kind, is work beyond the man's 
 strength that does it, and therefore not well done. 
 Perhaps it's beyond his natural strength ; but it is more 
 likely that he was badly taught. Many teachers set 
 their pupils on to strain and stretch so that they get used 
 up, body and mind, in a few months. Depend upon it, 
 the same thing is true in other arts. I once taught a 
 fiddler that used to get a hundred guineas for playing tw;o 
 or three tunes ; and he told me that it was just the same 
 thing with the fiddle — that when you laid a tight hold on 
 your fiddle-stick, or even set your teeth hard together, 
 you could do nothing but rasp like the fellows that play 
 in bands for a few shillings a night."

 " How much more of this nonsense must we endure ? " 
 said Lucian audibly, as Cashel stopped for breath. 
 Cashel turned, and looked at him. 
 
 "By Jove," whispered Lord Worthington to his 
 companion, " that fellow had better be careful, I wish 
 he would hold his tongue." 
 
 " You think it's nonsense, do you ? " said Cashel, after 
 a pause. Then he raised one of the candles, and 
 illuminated a picture that hung on the wall. " Look at 
 that picture," he said. " You see that fellow in armor 
 — St. George and the dragon or whatever he may be ? 
 He's jumped down from his horse to fight the other 
 fellow — that one with his head in a big helmet, whose 
 horse has tumbled. The lady in the gallery is half crazy 
 with anxiety for St. George ; and well she may be. 
 There's a posture for a man to fight in ! His weight isnt 
 resting on his legs : one touch of a child's finger would 
 upset him. Look at his neck craned out in front of him, 
 and his face as flat as a full moon towards his man, as if 
 he was inviting him to shut up both his eyes with one 
 blow. You can all see that he's as weak and nervous as 
 a cat, and that he doesnt know how to fight. And why 
 does he give you that idea ? Just because he's all strain 
 and stretch ; because he isnt at his ease ; because he 
 carries the weight of his body as foolishly as one of the 
 ladies here would carry a hod of bricks ; because he isnt 
 safe, steady, and light on his pins, as he would be if he 
 could forget himself for a minute and leave his body to 
 find its proper balance of its own accord. If the painter 
 of that picture had known his business, he would never 
 have sent his man up to the scratch in such a figure and 
 condition as that. But you can see with one eye that he 
 didnt understand — I wont say the principles of fighting, 
 but the universal principles that I've told you of, that 
 ease and strength, effort and weakness, go together.

 Now ! " added Cashel, again addressing Lucian : " do 
 you still think that notion of mine nonsense ? " And he 
 smacked his lips with satisfaction ; for his criticism of 
 the picture had produced a marked sensation ; and he did 
 not know that this was due to the fact that the painter, 
 Mr. Adrian Herbert, was present. 
 
 Lucian tried to ignore the question ; but he found it 
 impossible to ignore the questioner. " Since you have 
 set the example of expressing opinions without regard to 
 considerations of common courtesy," he said shortly, " I 
 may say that your theory, if it can be called one, is a 
 contradiction in terms." 
 
 Cashel, apparently unruffled, but with more delibera- 
 tion of manner than before, looked about him as if in 
 search of a fresh illustration. His glance finally rested 
 on the lecturer's seat, a capacious crimson damask 
 armchair that stood unoccupied at some distance behind 
 Lucian. 
 
 " I see youre no judge of a picture," he said good- 
 humoredly, putting down the candle, and stepping in 
 front of Lucian, who regarded him haughtily, and did 
 not budge. " But just look at it in this way. Suppose 
 you wanted to hit me the most punishing blow you 
 possibly could. What would you do ? Why, according 
 to your own notion, youd make a great effort. ' The 
 more elFort, the more force,' youd say to yourself. ' I'll 
 smash him even if I burst myself in doing it.' And what 
 would happen then ? Youd only cut me and make me 
 angry, besides exhausting all your strength at one gasp. 
 
 Whereas, if you took it easy — like this " Here he 
 
 made a light step forward, and placed his open palm 
 gently against the breast of Lucian, who, as if the piston- 
 rod of a steam-engine had touched him, instantly reeled 
 back and dropped into the chair. 
 
 " There ! " exclaimed Cashel, beaming with self-

 satisfaction as he stepped aside and pointed at Lucian. 
 " It's like pocketing a billiard ball ! " 
 
 A chatter of surprise, amusement, and remonstrance 
 spread through the rooms ; and the company crowded 
 towards the table. Lucian rose, white with rage, and for 
 a moment entirely lost his self-control. Fortunately, the 
 effect was to paralyze him : he neither moved nor spoke, 
 and only betrayed his condition by his pallor, and the 
 hatred in his expression. Presently he felt a touch on 
 his arm, and heard his name pronounced by Lydia. 
 Her voice calmed him. He tried to look at her ; but 
 his vision was disturbed : he saw double ; the lights 
 seemed to dance before his eyes ; and Lord Worthing- 
 ton's voice, saying to Cashel, " Rather too practical, old 
 fellow," seemed to come from a remote corner of the 
 room, and yet to be whispered into his ear. He was 
 moving irresolutely in search of Lydia, when his senses 
 and his resentment were restored by a clap on the 
 shoulder. 
 
 " You wouldnt have believed that now, would you ? " 
 said 'Cashel. " Dont look startled : youve no bones 
 broken. You had your little joke with me in your own 
 way ; and I had mine in my own way. Thats only " 
 
 He stopped : his brave bearing vanished : he became 
 limp and shamefaced. Lucian, without a word, with- 
 drew with Lydia to the adjoining apartment, and left 
 him staring after her with wistful eyes and slackened 
 jaw. 
 
 In the meantime Mrs. Hoskyn, an earnest-looking 
 young woman with striking dark features and gold 
 spectacles, was looking .for Lord Worthington, who 
 betrayed a consciousness of guilt by attempting to avoid 
 her. But she cut off his retreat, and confronted him 
 with a steadfast gaze that compelled him to stared and 
 answer for himself.

 "Who is that gentleman whom you introduced to 
 me ? I have forgotten his name." 
 
 "I am really awfully sorry, Mrs. Hoskyn. It 
 was too bad of Byron. But Webber was excessively 
 nasty." 
 
 Mrs. Hoskyn, additionally annoyed by apologies which 
 she had not invited, and which put her in the ignominious 
 position of a complainant, replied coldly, " Mr. Byron. 
 Thank you : I had forgotten," and was turning away 
 when Lydia came up to introduce Alice, and to explain 
 why she had entered unannounced. Lord Worthington 
 seized the chance of improving Cashel's credit by claiming 
 Lydia's acquaintance for him. 
 
 " Did you hear our friend Byron's speech. Miss Carew? 
 Very characteristic, I thought." 
 
 _," Very," said Lydia. " I hope Mrs. Hoskyn's guests 
 are all familiar with his style. Otherwise they must find 
 him a little startling." 
 
 "Yes," said Mrs. Hoskyn, beginning to wonder 
 whether Cashel could be some well-known eccentric 
 genius. " He is very odd. I hope Mr. Webber is not 
 oiFended." 
 
 "If his tact had been equal to the other gentle- 
 man's, it would not have happened to him," said Lydia. 
 " It is really very clever of Mr. Byron to knock my 
 cousin down in the middle of a drawing-room without 
 scandalizing anybody." 
 
 " You see, Mrs. Hoskyn, the general verdict is ' serve 
 him right,' " said Lord Worthington. 
 
 " With a rider to the eff&t that both gentlemen dis- 
 played complete indifference to the comfort of their 
 hostess," said Lydia. " However, men so rarely sacrifice 
 their maimers to their minds that it would be a pity to 
 blame them. You do not encourage conventionality, 
 Mrs. Hoskyn ? " 
 


## p. (#142) ################################################

 "I encourage good manners, though certainly not 
 conventional manners." 
 
 " And you think there is a difference ? " 
 
 " I feel that there is a difference," said Mrs. Hoskyn 
 with dignity. 
 
 " So do I," said Lydia ; " but one can hardly call 
 others to account for one's own subjective ideas." 
 
 Lydia went away to another part of the room without 
 waiting for a reply. All this time, Cashel stood friend- 
 less, stared at by most of his neighbors, and spoken to 
 by none. Women looked at him coldly lest it should be 
 suspected that they were admiring him ; and men 
 regarded him stiffly according to the national custom. 
 Since his recognition of Lydia, his self-confidence had 
 given place to a misgiving that he had been making a 
 fool of himself He felt lonely and abashed : but for his 
 professional habit of maintaining a cheerful countenance 
 under adverse circumstances, he would have hid himself 
 in the darkest corner of the room. Like many eminent 
 members of his profession, he was rather prone to tears 
 when his feelings were wounded ; and his countenance was 
 falling rapidly when Lord Worthington came up to him. 
 
 " I had no idea you were such an orator, Byron," he 
 said. " You can go into the Church when you cut the 
 other trade. Eh \ " 
 
 " I wasnt brought up to the other trade," said Cashel ; 
 "and I know how to talk to ladies and gentlemen as 
 well as to what youd suppose to be my own sort. Dont 
 you be anxious about me, my lord. I know how to make 
 myself at home." 
 
 "Of course, of course," said Lord Worthington 
 soothingly. " Every one can see by your manners that 
 you are a gentleman : they recognize that even in the 
 ring. Otherwise, you see — I know you wont mind my 
 saying so— I darent have brought you here."

 Cashel shook his head, but was pleased. He thought 
 he hated flattery : had Lord Worthington told him that 
 he was the best boxer in England — which he probably 
 was — he would have despised him. But he wished to 
 believe the false compliment to his manners, and was 
 therefore perfectly convinced of its sincerity. Lord 
 Worthington perceived this, and retired, pleased with his 
 own tact, in search of Mrs. Hoskyn, to clairn her promise 
 of an introduction to Madame Szczymph^a, which Mrs. 
 Hoskyn, by way of punishing him for Cashel's mis- 
 demeanor, had privately determined not to keep. 
 
 Cashel began to think he had better go. Lydia was 
 surrounded by men who were speaking to her in German. 
 He felt his own inability to talk learnedly even in 
 English ; and he felt sure, besides, that she was angry 
 with him for upsetting her cousin, who was gravely 
 conversing with Miss GofF. Suddenly a horrible noi?e 
 caused a general start and pause. Mr. Jack, the eminent 
 composer, had opened the pianoforte, and was illustrating 
 some points in a musical composition under discussion by 
 making discordant sounds with his voice, accompanied 
 by a few chords. Cashel laughed aloud in derision as 
 he made his way towards the door through the crowd, 
 which was now pressing round the pianoforte, at which 
 Madame Szczympli^a had just come to the assistance ot 
 Jack. Near the door, and in a corner remote from the 
 instrument, he came upon Lydia and a middle-aged 
 gentleman, evidently neither a professor nor an artist. 
 
 " Abngas is a very clever man," the gentleman was 
 saying. " I am sorry I djdnt hear the lecture. But I 
 leave all that to Mary. She receives the people who enjoy 
 high art upstairs ; and I take the sensible men down to the 
 garden or the smoking-room, according to the weather." 
 
 "What do the sensible women do ? " said Lydia. 
 
 " They come late," said Mr. Hoskyn, and then laughed

 at his repartee until he became aware of the vicinity of 
 Cashel, whose health he immediately inquired after, 
 shaking his hand warmly and receiving a numbing grip 
 in return. As soon as he saw that Lydia and Cashel 
 were acquainted, he slipped away and left them to 
 entertain one another. 
 
 " I wonder how he knows me," said Cashel, heartened 
 by her gracious reception of a nervous bow. " I never 
 saw him before in my life." 
 
 " He does not know you," said Lydia, with some 
 sternness. " He is your host, and therefore concludes 
 that he ought to know you." 
 
 " Oh ! That was it, was it ? " He paused, at a loss 
 for conversation. She did not help him. At last he 
 added, " I havent seen you this long time. Miss Carew." 
 
 " It is not very long since I saw you, Mr. Cashel Byron. 
 I saw you yesterday at some distance from London." 
 
 " Oh Lord ! " exclaimed Cashel, " dont say that. 
 Youre joking, aint you ? " 
 
 " No. Joking, in that sense, does not amuse me." 
 
 Cashel looked at her in consternation. " You dont 
 
 mean to say that you went to see a — a — Where 
 
 when did you see me ? You might tell me." 
 
 " Certainly. It was at Clapham Junction, at a quarter 
 past six." 
 
 " Was any one with me ? " 
 
 " Your friend Mr. Mellish, Lord Worthington, and 
 some other persons." 
 
 "Yes. Lord Worthington was there. But where 
 were you ? " 
 
 " In a waiting-room, close to you." 
 
 " I never saw you," said Cashel, very red. " Mellish 
 drove our trap into a ditch and broke it : we had to get 
 home by train. We must have looked a queer lot. 
 Did you think I was in bad company } "

 " That was not my business, Mr. Cashel Byron." 
 
 " No," said Cashel, with sudden bitterness. " What 
 did you care what company I kept ? Youre mad with 
 me because I made your cousin look like a fool, I 
 suppose. Thats whats the matter." 
 
 Lydia, speaking in a low tone to remind him that 
 they were not alone, said, " There is nothing the matter, 
 except that you act and speak like a grown-up boy rather 
 than a man. I am not mad with you because of your attack 
 upon my cousin ; but he is very much annoyed ; and so is 
 Mrs. Hoskyn, whose guest you were bound to respect." 
 
 " I knew youd be down on me. I wouldnt have said 
 a word if I'd known you were here," said Cashel de- 
 jectedly. " Lie down and be walked over : thats what 
 you think I'm fit for. Another man would have twisted 
 his head off." 
 
 " Is it possible that you do not know that gentlemen 
 never twist one another's heads off in society, no matter 
 how great may be the provocation ? " 
 
 " I know nothing," said Cashel, with plaintive sullen- 
 ness. " Everything I do is wrong. There ! Will that 
 satisfy you .? " 
 
 " I take no pleasure in making you confess yourself in 
 the wrong ; and you cannot have a lower opinion of me 
 than to think that I do," 
 
 "Thats just where youre mistaken," said Cashel 
 obstinately. " I havent got a low opinion of you at all. 
 There's such a thing as being too clever." 
 
 " You may not know that it is a low opinion. Never- 
 theless, it is so." 
 
 " Well, have it your own way. I'm wrong again ; 
 and youre right." 
 
 " So far from being gratified by that, I had rather we 
 were both in the right and agreed. Can you understand 
 that ? "

 " I cant say I do. But I give in to it. What more 
 need you care for ? " 
 
 " Please, I had rather you understood. Let me try to 
 explain. You think I like to be cleverer than other 
 people. You are mistaken. I should like them all to 
 know whatever I know." 
 
 Cashel laughed cunningly, and shook his head. 
 "Dont you make any mistake about that," he said. 
 "You dont want anybody to be quite as clever as 
 yourself: it isnt in human nature that you should. 
 Youd like people to be just clever enough to shew you 
 off — to be worth beating. But you wouldnt like them 
 to be able to beat you. Just clever enough to know 
 how much cleverer you are : thats about the mark. 
 Eh?" 
 
 Lydia made no further effort to enlighten him. She 
 looked at him thoughtfully, and said slowly, "So this 
 perpetual fighting metaphor is the clue to your idiosyn- 
 crasy. You have attached yourself to the modern 
 doctrine of a struggle for existence, and look on life as a 
 continual combat." 
 
 "A fight ? Just so. What is life but a fight ? The 
 curs forfeit or get beaten ; the rogues sell the fight and 
 lose the confidence of their backers ; the game ones, and 
 the clever ones, win the stakes, and have to hand over the 
 lion's share of them to the moneyed loafers that have 
 stood the expenses ; and luck plays the devil with them 
 all in turn. Thats not the way they describe life in 
 books ; but thats what it is." 
 
 " Oddly put, and perhaps true. But it is not the 
 creed of the simpleton you pretended to be a moment 
 ago. You are playing with me — revealing your wisdom 
 from beneath a veil of the boyish. My compliments on 
 your excellent acting. I have no more to say." 
 
 " May I be shot if I understand you ! I'd rather be

 a horse than an actor. Come : is it because I raised a 
 laugh against your cousin that youre so spiteful ? " 
 
 Lydia looked earnestly and doubtfully at him ; and he 
 instinctively put his head back, as if it were in danger. 
 " You do not understand, then ? " she said. " I will test 
 the genuineness of your, stupidity by an appeal to your 
 obedience." 
 
 "Stupidity! Goon." 
 
 " But will you obey me, if I lay a command upon you ? " 
 
 " I will go through fire and water for you." 
 
 Lydia blushed feintly, and paused to wonder at the 
 novel sensation before she resumed. "You had better 
 not apologize to my cousin : partly because you would 
 only make matters worse : chiefly because he does not 
 deserve it. But you must make this speech to Mrs. 
 Hoskyn when you are going: 'I am very sorry "I 
 forgot myself '■ — ■ — " 
 
 " Sounds like Shakespear, doesnt it ? " observed Cashel. 
 
 " Ah ! the test has found you out : you are only 
 acting after all. But that does not alter my opinion that 
 you should apologize." 
 
 " All right. I dont know what you mean by testing 
 and acting ; and I only hope you know yourself. But 
 no matter : I'll apologize : a man like me can afford to. 
 I'll apologize to your cousin too, if you like." 
 
 " I do not like. But what has that to do with it ? I 
 suggest these things, as you must be aware, for your own 
 sake and not for mine." 
 
 " As for my own, I dont care twopence : I do it all 
 for you. I dont even ask whether there is anything 
 between you and him." 
 
 " Would you like to know ? " said Lydia deliberately, 
 after a pause of astonishment. 
 
 " Do you mean to say youU tell me ? " he exclaimed, 
 " If you do, I'll say youre as good as gold,"

 " Certainly I will tell you. There is an old friendship 
 and cousinship between us ; but we are not engaged, 
 nor at all likely to be. I tell you so because you would 
 draw the opposite and false conclusion if I avoided the 
 question." 
 
 " I am glad of it," said Cashel, unexpectedly becoming 
 very gloomy. " He isnt man enough for you. But he's 
 your equal, damn him ! " 
 
 " He is my cousin, and, I believe, my sincere friend. 
 Therefore please do not damn him." 
 
 " I know I shouldnt have said that. But I am only 
 damning my own luck." 
 
 " Which will not improve it in the least." 
 
 " I know that. You neednt have said it. I wouldnt 
 have said a thing like that to you, stupid as I am." 
 
 " Oh, you are impossible : I meant nothing. How- 
 ever, that does not matter. You are still an enigma to 
 me. Had we not better try to hear a little of Madame 
 Szczympli^a's performance ? " 
 
 "I'm a pretty plain enigma, I should think," said 
 Cashel mournfully. " I would rather have you than any 
 other woman in the world ; but youre too rich and 
 grand for me. If I cant have the satisfaction of marrying 
 you, I may as well have the satisfaction of saying I'd 
 like to." 
 
 " Hardly a fair way of approaching the subject," said 
 Lydia composedly, but with a play of color again in her 
 cheeks. "Allow me to forbid it unconditionally. I 
 must be plain with you, Mr. Cashel Byron. I do not 
 know what you are or who you are ; and I believe you 
 have tried to mystify me on both points " 
 
 "And you never shall find out either the one or 
 the other if I can help it," put in Cashel ; " so that 
 we're in a preciously bad way of coming to a good 
 understanding."

 " True," assented Lydia. " I do not make secrets ; I 
 do not keep them ; and I do not respect them. Your 
 humor clashes with my principle." 
 
 " You call it a humor ! " said Cashel angrily. 
 " Perhaps you think I'm a duke in disguise. If so, you 
 may think better of it. If you had a secret, and the 
 discovery of it would cause you to be kicked out of 
 decent society, you would keep it pretty tight. And that 
 through no fault of your own, mind you ; but through 
 downright cowardice and prejudice in other people." 
 
 "There are at least some fears and prejudices common 
 in society that I do not share," said Lydia, after a 
 moment's reflection. "Should I ever find out your 
 secret, do not too hastily conclude that you have forfeited 
 my consideration." 
 
 " You are just the last person on earth I want to be 
 found out by. But youll find out fast enough. Pshaw ! " 
 cried Cashel, with a laugh : " I'm as well known as 
 Trafalgar Square. But I cant bring myself to tell you ; 
 and I hate secrets as much as you do ; so lets drop it and 
 talk about something else." 
 
 " We have talked long enough. The music is over ; 
 and the people will return to this room presently, perhaps 
 to ask me who and what is the stranger that made them 
 such a remarkable speech." 
 
 "Just a word. Promise me that you wont ask any of 
 them that." 
 
 " Promise you ! No. I cannot promise that." 
 
 " O Lord f " said Cashel, with a groan. 
 
 " I have told you that I do not respect secrets. For 
 the present I will not ask ; but I may change my mind. 
 Meanwhile we must not hold long conversations. I 
 even hope that we shall not meet. There is only one 
 thing that I am too rich and grand for — mystification. 
 Adieu,"

 Before he could reply, she was away from him in the 
 midst of a number of gentlemen, and in conversation 
 with one of them. Cashel seemed overwhelmed. But 
 in an instant he recovered himself, and stepped jauntily 
 before Mrs. Hoskyn, who had just come into his 
 neighborhood. 
 
 "I'm going, maam," he said. "Thank you for a 
 pleasant evening. I'm very sorry I forgot myself. 
 Good-night." 
 
 Mrs. Hoskyn, naturally frank, felt some vague response 
 within herself to this address. But, though not usually 
 at a loss for words in social emergencies, she only looked 
 at him, blushing slightly, and offering her hand. He 
 took it as if it were a tiny baby's hand ; gave it a little 
 pinch J and turned to go. Mr. Adrian Herbert, the 
 painter, was directly in his way, with his back towards 
 him. 
 
 "If you please, sir," said Cashel, taking him gently by 
 the ribs, and lifting him aside as if he were a tailor's 
 dummy. The artist turned indignantly ; but Cashel 
 was passing the doorway. On the stairs he met Lucian 
 and Alice. 
 
 " Good-night, Miss GofF," he said. " It's a pleasure 
 to see the country roses in your cheeks." He lowered 
 his voice as he added, to Lucian, " Dont you worry 
 yourself over that little trick I shewed you. If any ot 
 your friends chaff you about it, tell them that it was 
 Cashel Byron did it, and ask them whether they think 
 they could have helped themselves any better than you 
 could. Dont ever let a person come within distance ot 
 you while youre standing in that silly way on both your 
 heels. Why, if a man isnt properly planted on his pins, 
 a broom -handle falling against him will upset him. 
 Thats the way of it. Good-night." 
 
 Lucian returned the salutation, mastered by a certain

 latent dangerousness in Cashel, suggestive that he might 
 resent a snub by throwing the offender over the balus- 
 trade. As for Alice, she had entertained a superstitious 
 dread of him ever since Lydia had pronounced him a 
 ruffian. Both felt relieved when the house door, closing, 
 shut him out from them.

CHAPTER VII 
 
 Society was much occupied during Alice's first season in 
 London with one of the accidents of the beginnings of 
 England's destiny in South Africa. When Destiny 
 takes nations into new places, it offers them the choice 
 of marching boldly with it and understanding it, or 
 being led like pigs to market, intensely recalcitrant, 
 scuttling in sudden panics or charging in sudden huffs, 
 and using such rests as its leader gives it, to eat, never to 
 ask Whither ? How ? or What then ? Only when 
 Destiny gives the word to stop eating and march, a 
 useless Why ? is raised, whereupon Destiny, out of 
 patience, gives the rope a jerk which fetches the poor 
 pig off his trotters. England, observant of the fact that 
 the pig's line of conduct shifted all moral responsibility 
 to his leader, and got the pig finally to his destination 
 without brain worry, adopted it without hesitation in 
 Africa, with the result that when the king of a considerable 
 people there fell, with his territories, into British hands, 
 the conquest seemed useless, troublesome, and expensive ; 
 and after repeated ' attempts to settle the country on im- 
 practicable plans suggested to the Colonial Office by a 
 popular historian who had made a trip to Africa, and by 
 generals who were tired of their primitive remedy of killing 
 the natives, it appeared that the best course was to release 
 the king and get rid of the unprofitable booty by restoring

 it to him. However, as the pig policy had enabled him 
 to win one battle against English troops, it was thought 
 advisable to take him first to London, and shew him the 
 wonders of English civilization, especially in the matter 
 of cannon and high explosives. 
 
 But when the African king arrived, his freedom from 
 English prepossessions made it difficult to amuse, or even 
 to impress him. A stranger to the idea that a handful of 
 private persons could own a country and make others pay 
 them for permission to live and work there, he was unable 
 to understand why such a prodigiously rich nation should 
 be compiosed chiefly of poor and uncomfortable persons 
 toiling incessantly to create riches, and partly of a class 
 that confiscated and dissipated the riches thus produced 
 without seeming in the least happier than the unfortunate 
 laborers at whose expense they existed. He was seized 
 with strange fears ; first for his health, since it seemed to 
 him that the air of London, filthy with smoke, engendered 
 puniness and dishonesty in those who breathed it ; and 
 eventually for his life, when he learned that kings in 
 Europe were sometimes shot at in the streets. The 
 queen of England, though accounted the safest of all, had 
 had some half dozen escapes ; and the autocrat of an 
 empire huge beyond all other European countries, whose 
 father had been torn asunder in the streets of his capital, 
 lived surrounded by soldiers who shot down every stranger 
 that approached him, even at his own summons ; so that 
 he was an object of compassion to the humblest of his 
 servants. Under these circumstances, the African king 
 was with difficulty induced to stir out of doors ; and he only 
 visited Woolwich Arsenal — the destructive resources ot 
 which were expected to silently warn him against 
 taking the Christian religion too literally — under com- 
 pulsion. At last the Colonial Office, which had charge 
 of him, was at its wit's end to devise entertainments to

 keep him in good humor until the time appointed for his 
 departure. ' 
 
 On the Tuesday following Mrs. Hoskyn's reception, 
 Lucian Webber, calling at his cousin's house in Regent's 
 Park, said, in the course of conversation, 
 
 " The Colonial OfEce has had an idea. The king, it 
 appears, is something of an athlete, and is curious to 
 witness what Londoners can do in that way. So a grand 
 assault-at-arms is to be held for him." 
 
 " What is an assault-at-arms ? " said Lydia. " I have 
 never been at one ; and the name suggests nothing but 
 an affray with bayonets." 
 
 " It is an exhibition of swordsmanship, military drill, 
 gymnastics, and so forth." 
 
 " I will go to that," said Lydia. " Will you come, 
 Alice ? " 
 
 " Is it usual for ladies to go to such exhibitions ? " 
 said Alice cautiously. 
 
 " On this occasion ladies will go for the sake of seeing 
 the king," said Lucian. " The Olympian gymnastic 
 society, which has undertaken the direction of the' civilian 
 part of the assault, expects what it calls a flower-show 
 audience." ' 
 
 " Will you come, Lucian ? " 
 
 " If I can be spared, yes. If not, I will ask Worth- 
 ington to go with you. He understands such matters 
 better than I." 
 , "Then let us have him by all means," said Lydia. 
 
 " I cannot see why you are so fond of Lord 
 Worthington," said Alice. " His manners are good ; 
 but there is nothing in him. Besides, he is so young. I 
 cannot endure his conversation. He has begun to talk 
 about Goodwood already." 
 
 "He will grow out of his excessive addiction to sport," 
 said Lucian, paternally. 
 


## p. (#155) ################################################

Chap. VII Cashel Byron's Profession 127 
 
 " Indeed ! " said Lydia. " And what will he grow 
 into ? " 
 
 " Possibly into a more reasonable man," said Lucian, 
 unabashed. 
 
 " I hope so," said Lydia ; " but I prefer a man who 
 is interested in sport to a gentleman who is interested in 
 nothing." 
 
 " Much might indubitably be said from that point of 
 view. But it is not necessary that Lord Worthington 
 should waste his energy on horse-racing. I presume you 
 do not think political life, for which his position peculiarly 
 fits him, unworthy his attention." 
 
 "Party tactics are both exciting and amusing, no 
 doubt. But are they better than horse-racing ? Jockeys 
 and horse-breakers at least know their business : members 
 of parliament do not. Is it pleasant to sit on a bench — 
 even though it be the Treasury bench — and listen to 
 amateur discussions about matters that have been settled 
 for the last hundred years to the satisfaction of everybody 
 who has seriously studied them ? " 
 
 " You do not understand the duties of a government, 
 Lydia. You never approach the subject without con- 
 firming my opinion that women are constitutionally 
 incapable of comprehending it." 
 
 " It is natural for you to think so, Lucian. The 
 House of Commpns is to you the goal of existence. To 
 me it is only an assemblage of ill-informed gentlemen 
 who have botched every business they have ever under- 
 taken, from the first committee of supply down to the 
 last land Act ; and who arrogantly assert that I am not 
 good enough to sit with them." 
 
 " Lydia," said Lucian, annoyed : " you know that I 
 respect women in their own sphere " 
 
 "Then give them another sphere, and perhaps they 
 will earn your respect in that also. I am sorry to say 
 


## p. (#156) ################################################

128 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. VII 
 
 that men, in their sphere, have not won my respect. 
 Enough of that for the present. I have to make some 
 arrangements before I go out. They are of more 
 immediate importance than the conversion of a willing 
 Conservative into a reluctant Women's Suffragist. Excuse 
 me for five minutes." 
 
 She left the room. Lucian sat down and gave his 
 attention to Alice, who had still enough of her old 
 nervousness to straighten her shoulders and look stately. 
 But he did not object to 'this : a little stiffness of manner 
 gratified his taste. 
 
 " I hope," he said, " that my cousin has not succeeded 
 in inducing you to adopt her peculiar views." 
 
 " No," said Alice. " Of course her case is quite 
 exceptional. She is so wonderfully accomplished ! In 
 general, I do not think women should have views. 
 There are certain convictions which every lady holds : 
 for instance, we know that Roman Catholicism is wrong. 
 But that can hardly be called a view : indeed it would 
 be wicked to call it so, as it is one of the highest truths. 
 What I mean is that women should not be political 
 agitators." 
 
 " I understand and quite agree with you. Lydia's is, 
 as you say, an exceptional case. She has lived much 
 abroad ; and her father was a very singular man. Even 
 the clearest heads, when removed from the direct 
 influence of English life and thought, contract extra- 
 ordinary prejudices. It is almost a pity that such 
 strength of mind and extent of knowledge should be 
 fortified by the dangerous independence which great 
 wealth confers. Advantages like these bring with them 
 certain duties to the class that has produced them — 
 duties to which Lydia is not merely indifferent, but 
 absolutely hostile." 
 
 " I never meddle with her ideas on — on these subjects.

 I am too ignorant to understand them. But Miss 
 Carew's generosity to me has been unparalleled. And 
 she does not seem to know that she is generous. I owe 
 more to her than I ever can repay." " At least," Alice 
 added to herself, " I am not ungrateful." 
 
 Miss Carew now reappeared, dressed in a long grey 
 coat and plain beaver hat, and carrying a roll of writing, 
 materials. 
 
 " I am going to the British Museum to read," said 
 she. 
 
 " To walk ! — ^alone ! " said Lucian, looking at her 
 costume. 
 
 "Yes. Prevent me from walking and you deprive 
 me of my health. Prevent me from going alone where 
 I please and when I please, and you deprive me of my 
 liberty — tear up Magna Charta, in effect. But I do not 
 insist upon being alone in this instance. If you can 
 return to your office by way of Regent's Park and 
 Gower Street without losing too much time, I shall be 
 glad of your company." 
 
 Lucian decorously suppressed his eagerness to comply 
 by looking at his watch, and pretending to consider his 
 engagements. In conclusion, he said that he should be 
 happy to accompany her. 
 
 It was a line summer afternoon ; and there were 
 many people in the park. Lucian was soon incommoded 
 by the attention his cousin attracted. In spite of the 
 black beaver, her hair shone like fire in the sun. Women 
 stared at her with unsympathetic curiosity, and turned 
 as they passed to examine her attire. Men resorted to 
 various subterfuges to get a satisfectory look without 
 rudely betraying their intention. A few stupid youths 
 gaped ; and a few impudent ones smiled. Lucian would 
 gladly have kicked them all without distinction. He 
 suggested that they should leave the path, and make a 
 
 K

 short cut across the greensward. As they emerged from 
 the shade of the trees, he had a vague impression that 
 the fineness of the weather and the beauty of the park 
 made the occasion romantic, and that the words by 
 which he hoped to make the relation between him and 
 his cousin dearer and closer would be well spoken there. 
 But he immediately began to talk, in spite of himself^ 
 about the cost of maintaining the public parks, par- 
 ticulars of which happened to be within his official 
 knowledge. Lydia, readily interested by fticts of any 
 sort, thought the subject not a bad one for a casual 
 afternoon conversation, and pursued it until they left the 
 turf and got into the Euston Road, where the bustle of 
 traffic silenced them for a while. When they escaped 
 from the din into the respectable quietude of Gower 
 Street, he suddenly said, 
 
 " It is one of the evils of great wealth in the hands of 
 
 a woman, that she can hardly feel sure " Here his 
 
 ideas fled suddenly. He stopped ; but he kept his 
 countenance so well that he had the air of having made 
 a finished speech, and being perfectly satisfied with it. 
 
 " Do you mean that she can never feel sure of the 
 justice of her title to her riches ? That used to trouble 
 me ; but it no longer does so." 
 
 " Nonsense ! " said Lucian. " I alluded to the dis- 
 interestedness of your friends." 
 
 " That does not trouble me either. Absolutely dis- 
 interested friends I do not seek, as I should only find 
 them among idiots or somnambulists. As to those whose 
 interests are base, they do not know how to conceal their 
 motives from me. For the rest, I am not so unreasonable 
 as to object to a fair account being taken of my wealth in 
 estimating the value of my friendship." 
 
 " Do you not believe in the existence of persons who 
 would like you just as well if you were poor ? " 
 


## p. (#159) ################################################

CiiBp.Vir Cashel Byron's Profession 131 
 
 " Such persons would wish mc to become poor, merely 
 to bring: me nearer to themselves j for which I should not 
 thank them. I set great store by the esteem my riches 
 command, Lucian. It is the only aet-ofF I have against 
 the envy they inspire." 
 
 "Then you would refuse to believe in the dis- 
 interestedness of any man who — who " 
 
 "Who wanted to marry mc f On the contrary: I 
 should be the last person to believe that a man could 
 prefer my money to myself. If he were independent, 
 and in a lair way to keep his |ilacc in the world without 
 my help, 1 should despise him if he hesitated to approach 
 me for fear of misconstruction. I do not think a man is 
 ever thorouehlv honest until he is superior to that fear. 
 fiut if he nacl no profession, no money, and no aim 
 except to live at my expense, then I shoulcl regard him as 
 an adventurer, and treat him as one — ^unlcss I fell in love 
 witli him." 
 
 " Unless you fell in love with him ? " 
 
 "That — assuming that such things really happen — 
 might make a difference in my feeling, but none in my 
 conduct. I would not marry an adventurer under any 
 circumstances. I could cure myself of a misdirected 
 passion, but not of a bad husband. 
 
 Lucian said nothing : he walked on with long irregular 
 steps, lowering at the pavement as if it were a difficult 
 problem, and occasionally thrusting at it with his stick. 
 At last he looked up anu said, 
 
 "Would you mind prolonging our walk a little by 
 
 Soing round Bedford Square with me f I have somc- 
 ling particular to say." 
 She turned and complied without a word ; ^nd they 
 had traversed one side of the square before he spoke 
 again. 
 
 " On second thoughts, Lydia, this is neither the time 
 


## p. (#160) ################################################

132 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.Vli 
 
 nor the place for an important communication. Excuse 
 me for having taken you out of your way for nothing." 
 
 " I do not Hke this, Lucian. Important communica- 
 tions — in this case — corrupt good manners. If your 
 intended speech is a sensible one, the present is as good 
 a time, and Bedford Square as good a place, as -you are 
 likely to find for it. If it is otherwise, confess that you 
 have decided to leave it unsaid. But do not postpone 
 it. Reticence is always an error — even on the Treasury 
 bench. It is doubly erroneous in dealing with me ; for 
 I have a constitutional antipathy to it." 
 
 " Yes," he said hurriedly ; " but give me one moment 
 — until the policeman has passed." 
 
 The policeman went leisurely by, striking the flags 
 with his heels, and slapping his palm with a white glove. 
 
 "The fact is, Lydia, that I feel great diffi- 
 culty " ^ 
 
 " What is the matter ? " said Lydia, after waiting in 
 vain for further particulars. "You have broken down 
 twice." There was a pause. Then she looked at him 
 quickly, and added, incredulously, " Are you going to 
 get married ? Is that the secret that ties your practised 
 tongue ? " 
 
 " Not unless you take part in the ceremony." 
 
 " Very gallant ; and in a vein of humor that is new 
 in my experience of you. But what have you to 
 tell me, Lucian ? Frankly, your hesitation is becoming 
 ridiculous." 
 
 " You have certainly not made matters easier for me, 
 Lydia. Perhaps you have a womanly intuition of my 
 purpose, and are intentionally discouraging me." 
 
 " Not the least. I am not good at intuitions, womanly 
 or otherwise. On my word, if you do not confess at once, 
 I will hurry away to the Museum." 
 
 " I cannot find a suitable form of expression," said

Chap. VII Cashel Byron's Profession 133 
 
 Lucian, in painful perplexity. " I am sure you will not 
 attribute any sordid motive to my — well, to my addresses, 
 though the term seems absurd. I am too well aware that 
 there is little, from the usual point of view, to tempt you 
 to unite yourself to me. Still " 
 
 A rapid change in Lydia's face shewed him that he 
 had said enough. " I had not thought of this," she 
 said, after a silence that seemed long to him. " Our 
 observations are so meaningless until we are given the 
 thread to string them on ! You must think better of 
 this, Lucian. The relation that at present exists between 
 us is the very best that our different characters will admit 
 of. Why do you desire to alter it ? " 
 
 " Because I would make it closer and more permanent. 
 I do not wish to alter it otherwise." 
 
 " You would run some risk of destroying it by the 
 method you propose," said Lydia, with composure. 
 "We could not work together. There are differences 
 of opinion between us amounting to differences of 
 principle." 
 
 "Surely you are not serious. Your opinions, or 
 notions, are not represented by any political party in 
 England ; and therefore they are practically ineffective, 
 and could not clash with mine. And such differences 
 are not personal matters." 
 
 "Such a party might be formed a week after our 
 marriage — will, I think, be formed a long time before 
 our deaths. In that case I fear that our difference of 
 opinion would become a very personal matter." 
 
 He began to walk more quickly as he replied, "It 
 is too absurd to set up what you call your opinions as 
 a serious barrier between us. You have no opinions, 
 Lydia. The impracticable crotchets you are fond of 
 airing are not recognized in England as sane political 
 convictions."

 Lydia did not retort. She waited a minute in pensive 
 silence, and then said, 
 
 "Why do you not marry Alice Goff? " 
 
 « Oh, hang Alice GofF!" 
 
 " It is so easy to come at the man beneath the veneer 
 by chipping at his feelings," said Lydia, laughing. " But 
 I w^as serious, Lucian. Alice is energetic, ambitious, and 
 stubbornly upright in questions of principle. I believe 
 she would assist you steadily at every step of your career. 
 Besides, she has physical robustness. Our student stock 
 needs an effusion of that." 
 
 " Many thanks for the suggestion ; but I do not happen 
 to want to marry Miss GofF." 
 
 " I invite you to consider it. You have not had time 
 yet to form any new plans." 
 
 " New plans ! Then you absolutely refuse me — 
 without a moment's consideration ? " 
 
 "Absolutely, Lucian. Does not your instinct warn 
 you that it would be a mistake to marry me ? " 
 
 "No, I cannot say that it does." 
 
 "Then trust to mine, which gives forth no uncertain 
 note on this question, as your favorite newspapers are 
 fond of saying." 
 
 " It is a question of feeling," he said, in a constrained 
 voice. 
 
 " Is it ? " she replied with interest. " You have sur- 
 prised me somewhat, Lucian. I have never observed any 
 of the extravagances of a lover in your conduct." 
 
 "And you have surprised me very unpleasantly, 
 Lydia. I do not think now that I ever had much hope 
 of success ; but I thought, at least, that my disillusion 
 would be gently accomplished." 
 
 " Have I been harsh ? " 
 
 " I do not complain." 
 
 "I was unlucky, Lucian; not malicious. Besides, 
 


## p. (#163) ################################################

Chap. VII Cashel Byron's Profession 135 
 
 the artifices by which friends endeavor to spare one 
 another's feelings are petty disloyalties. I am frank 
 with you. Would you have me otherwise ? " 
 
 " Of course not. I have no right to be offended." 
 
 " Not the least. Now add to that formal admission a 
 sincere assurance that you are not offended." 
 
 " I assure you I am not," said Lucian, with melancholy 
 resignation. 
 
 They had by this time reached Charlotte Street ; 
 and Lydia tacitly concluded the conference by turning 
 towards the Museum, and beginning to talk upon 
 indifferent subjects. At the corner of Russell Street he 
 got into a cab and drove away, dejectedly acknowledging 
 a smile and wave of the hand with which she tried to 
 console him. Lydia then went to the national library, 
 where she forgot Lucian. The effect of the shock of 
 his proposal was in store for her ; but as yet she did not 
 feel it ; and she worked steadily until the library was 
 closed and she had to leave. As she had been sitting for 
 some hours, and it was still light, she did not take a cab, 
 and did not even walk straight home. She had heard of 
 a bookseller in Soho who had for sale a certain scarce 
 volume which she wanted ; and it occurred to her that 
 the present was a good opportunity to go in search of 
 him. Now there was hardly a capital in Western 
 Europe that she did not know better than London. She 
 soon lost herself in a labyrinth of narrow streets of once 
 fashionable dwelling-houses, long ago turned into small 
 shops or let in tenements, and now succumbing to a slow 
 but steady invasion of large business houses. Neverthe- 
 less it was not the bustle of trade that broke the curious 
 Soho quietude. The shops did not seem to do much 
 business ; the big counting-houses kept their activity 
 within doors ; the few clerks, tradesmen, and warehouse- 
 men who were about had the air of slipping across to the

 public-houses rather than of having urgent affairs in hand. 
 But the place was alive writh children, who flocked 
 and chattered and darted about like sparrows, putting 
 their elders out of countenance and making the patiently 
 constructed haunts of commerce their playground. 
 
 Lydia noted one small boy looking wistfully through 
 the window of a sweetshop, evidently in the keenest 
 want of money. To him she proposed that he should 
 guide her back to the Broad Street of that region. He 
 embraced the offer greedily, and presently led her thither 
 by way of Lexington' Street. She thanked him, and 
 gave him the smallest coin in her purse, which happened 
 to be a shilling. He, in a transport at possessing what 
 was to him a fortune, uttered a piercing yell, and darted 
 ofF to shew the coin to a covey of small boys who had 
 just raced into view round the corner by the public- 
 house. In his haste, he dashed headlong against one of 
 the usual group outside, a powerfully built young man, 
 who cursed him fiercely. The boy retorted passionately, 
 and then, hurt by the collision, began to cry. When 
 Lydia came up, the child stood whimpering directly in 
 her path ; and she, pitying him, patted him on the head 
 and reminded him of all the money he had to spend. 
 He seemed comforted, and scraped his eyes with his 
 knuckles in silence ; but the man, who, having received 
 a rude butt in the groin, was stung by Lydia's injustice 
 in according to the aggressor the sympathy due to him- 
 self, walked threateningly up to her, and demanded, with 
 a startling oath, whether he had offered to do anything to 
 the boy. And, as he refrained from applying any epithet 
 to her, he honestly believed that in deference to Lydia's 
 sex and personal charms he had expressed himself with a 
 dashing combination of gallantry with manly heat of 
 spirit. She, not appreciating his chivalry, recoiled, and 
 stepped into the roadway in order to pass him. Indignant

 at this attempt to ignore him, he again placed himself in 
 her path, and was repeating his question with increased 
 sternness, when a jerk in the pit of his stomach caused 
 him a severe internal qualm, besides disturbing his 
 equilibrium so rudely that he narrowly escaped a fall 
 against the kerbstone. When he recovered himself he 
 saw before him a showily dressed young man, who 
 thus accosted him : 
 
 "Is that the way to talk to a lady, eh ? Isnt the 
 street wide enough for two ? Where's your manners ? " 
 
 " And who are you ; and where are you shoving your 
 elbow to ? " said the man, with a surpassing imprecation. 
 
 "Come, come," said Cashel Byron admonitorily. 
 " Youd better keep your mouth clean if you wish to 
 keep your teeth inside it. Never you mind who I am." 
 
 Lydia, foreseeing an altercation, and alarmed by the 
 threatening aspect of the man, sensibly resolved to hurry 
 away and send a policeman to Cashel's assistance. But 
 on turning she discovered that a crowd had already 
 gathered, and that she was in the novel position of a 
 spectator in the inner ring at what promised to be a 
 street fight. Her attention was recalled to the disputants 
 by a violent demonstration on the part of her late 
 assailant. Cashel seemed alarmed ; for he hastily re- 
 treated a step without regard to the toes of those behind 
 him, and exclaimed, waving the other ofF with his open 
 hand, 
 
 " Now you just let me alone. I dont want to have 
 anything to say to you. Go away from me, I tell you." 
 
 " You dont want to have nothink to say to me ! 
 Oh ! And for why ? Because you aint man enough : 
 thats why. What do you mean hy coming and shoving 
 your elbow into a man's breadbasket for, and then want- 
 ing to sneak off? Did you think I'd 'a bin frightened 
 of your velvet coat ? "

 " Very well," said Cashel pacifically : " we'll say that 
 I'm not man enough for you. So thats settled. Are 
 you satisfied ? " 
 
 But the other, greatly emboldened, declared with 
 many oaths that he would have Cashel's heart out, and 
 also, if he liked, that of Lydia, to whom he alluded in 
 coarse terms. The crowd cheered, and called upon him 
 to " go it." Cashel then said sullenly, 
 
 "Very well. But dont you try to make out after- 
 wards that I forced a quarrel on you. And now," he 
 added, with a grim change of tone that made Lydia 
 shudder, and shifted her fears to the account of his 
 antagonist, " I'll make you wish youd bit your tongue 
 out before you said what you did a moment ago. So 
 take care of yourself." 
 
 " Oh, I'll take care of myself," said the man, defiantly. 
 " Put up your hands." 
 
 Cashel surveyed his opponent's attitude with unspeak- 
 able disparagement. " YouU know when my hands 
 are up by the feel of the pavement," he said. " Better 
 keep your coat on. Youll fall softer." 
 
 The rough expressed his repudiation of this counsel 
 by beginning to strip energetically. A nameless thrill 
 passed through the crowd. Those who had bad places 
 pressed forward ; and those who formed the inner ring 
 pressed back to make room for the combatants. Lydia, 
 who occupied a coveted position close to Cashel, hoped 
 to be hustled out of the throng ; for she was beginning 
 to feel faint and ill. But a handsome butcher, who had 
 found a place by her side, held that she was entitled to 
 the post of honor in the front row, and bade her not 
 be frightened. As he spoke, the. mass of faces before 
 Lydia seemed to give a sudden lurch. To save herself 
 from falling, she slipped her arm through the butcher's ; 
 and he, much gratified, tucked her close to him, and

 held her up effectually. His support was welcome, 
 because it was needed. 
 
 Meanwhile, Cashel stood motionless, watching with 
 unrelenting contempt the movements of his adversary, 
 who rolled up his discolored shirt sleeves amid en- 
 couraging cries of " Go it, Teddy," " Give it im, Ted," 
 and other more precise suggestions. But Teddy's spirit 
 was chilled : he advanced with a presentiment that he 
 was courting destruction. He dared not rush on his 
 foe, whose eye seemed to discern his impotence. When 
 at last he ventured to strike, the blow fell short, as 
 Cashel evidently knew it would ; for he did not stir. 
 There was a laugh and a murmur of impatience in the 
 crowd. 
 
 " Are you waiting for the copper to come and separate 
 you ? " shouted the butcher. " Come out of your 
 corner and get to work, cant you ? " 
 
 This reminder that the police might baulk him of his 
 prey seemed to move Cashel. He took a step forward. 
 The excitement of the crowd rose to a climax ; and a 
 little man near Lydia cut a frenzied caper and screamed, 
 " Go it, Cashel Byron." 
 
 At these words Teddy was frankly terror-stricken. 
 His hands went down hastily ; and a pitiable green pallor 
 flitted across his cheek. " It aint fair," he exclaimed, 
 retreating as far as he could : " I give in. Cut it, master : 
 youre too clever for me." But the cruel crowd, with a 
 jeer, pushed him towards Cashel, who advanced remorse- 
 lessly. Teddy dropped on both knees. "What can a 
 man say more than that he's had enough ? " he pleaded. 
 " Be a Englishman,, master ; and dont hit a man when 
 he's down." 
 
 " Down ! " said Cashel. " How long will you stay 
 down if I choose to have you up ? " And, suiting the 
 action to the word, he seized Teddy with his left hand ;

 lifted him to his feet ; threw him in a helpless position 
 across his knee ; and poised his right fist like a hammer 
 over his upturned face. "Now," he said, "youre not 
 down. What have you to say for yourself before I 
 knock your face down your throat ? " 
 
 " Dont do it, govnor," gasped Teddy. " I didnt 
 mean no harm. How was I to know that the young 
 lady was your fancy ? " Here he struggled a little j 
 and his face took a darker hue. " Let go, master," he 
 cried, almost inarticulately. " Youre ch — choking me." 
 
 " Pray let him go," said Lydia, disengaging herself 
 from the butcher and catching Cashel's arm. 
 
 Cashel, with a start, relaxed his grasp ; and Teddy 
 rolled on the ground. He went away thrusting his 
 hands into his sleeves, and outfacing his disgrace by a 
 callous grin. Cashel, without speaking, offered Lydia 
 his arm ; and s^e, seeing that her best course was to get 
 away from that place with as few words as possible, 
 accepted it, and then turned and thanked the butcher, 
 who blushed and became speechless. The little man, 
 he whose exclamation had interrupted the combat, now 
 waved his hat, crying, 
 
 " The British Lion for ever ! Three cheers for 
 Cashel Byron." 
 
 Cashel turned upon him curtly, and said, " Dont you 
 make so free with other people's names, or perhaps you 
 may get into trouble yourself." 
 
 The little man retreated hastily ; but the crowd 
 responded with three cheers as Cashel, with Lydia on his 
 arm, withdrew through a lane of disreputable-looking 
 girls, roughs of Teddy's class, white-aproned shopmen 
 who had left their counters to see the fight, and a few 
 pale clerks, who looked with awe at the prizefighter and 
 with wonder at the refined appearance of his companion. 
 The two were followed by a double file of little raga-

Chap. VII Cash el Byron's Profession 141 
 
 muffins, who, with their eyes fixed earnestly on Cashel, 
 walked on the footways whilst he conducted Lydia down 
 the middle of the narrow street. Not one of them 
 turned a somersault or uttered a shout. Intent on their 
 hero, they pattered along, coming into collision with 
 every object that lay in their path. At last Cashel 
 stopped. They instantly stopped too. He took some 
 bronze coin from his pocket ; rattled it in his hand '; and 
 addressed them. 
 
 " Boys." Dead silence. " Do you know what I have 
 to do to keep up my strength ? " The hitherto steadfast 
 eyes wandered uneasily. " I have to eat a little boy for 
 supper every night, the last thing before going to bed. 
 Now, I havent quite made up rny mind which of you 
 would be the most to my taste ; but if one of you comes 
 a step further, I'll eat him. So away with you." And 
 he jerked the coins to a considerable distance. There 
 was a yell and a scramble ; and Cashel and Lydia 
 pursued their way unattended. 
 
 Lydia had taken advantage of the dispersion of the 
 boys to detach herself from Cashel's arm. She now 
 said, speaking to him for the first time since she had 
 interceded for Teddy, 
 
 " I am sorry to have given you so much trouble, Mr. 
 Cashel Byron. Thank you for interfering to protect me ; 
 but I was in no real danger. I would gladly have borne 
 with a few rough words for the sake of avoiding a 
 disturbance." 
 
 " There ! " cried Cashel. " I knew it. Youd a deal 
 rather I had minded my own business and not interfered. 
 Youre sorry for the poor fellow I treated so badly : aint 
 you now ? Thats a woman all over." 
 
 " I have not said one of these things." 
 
 "Well, I dont see what else you mean. It's no 
 pleasure to me to fight chance men in the streets for

142 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.vii 
 
 nothing : I dont get my living that way. And now that 
 I have done it for your sake, you as good as tell me I 
 ought to have kept myself quiet." 
 
 "Perhaps I am wrong. I hardly understand what 
 passed. You seemed to drop from the clouds." 
 
 " Aha ! You were glad when you found me at your 
 elbow, in spite of your talk. Come now : werent you 
 glad to see me ? " 
 
 " I confess it : very glad indeed. But by what 
 magic did you so suddenly subdue that man ? And was 
 it necessary to sully your hands by throttling him ? " 
 
 " It was a satisfaction to me ; and it served him right." 
 
 " Surely a very poor satisfaction ! Did you notice 
 that some one in the crowd called out your name ; and 
 that it seemed to frighten the man terribly ? " 
 
 " Indeed. Odd, wasnt it ? But you were saying that 
 you thought I dropped from the sky. Why, I had been 
 following you for five minutes before ! What do you 
 think of that ? If I may take the liberty of asking, how 
 did you come to be walking round Soho at such an hour 
 with a little boy ? " 
 
 Lydia explained. When she finished, it was nearly 
 dark. They had reached Oxford Street, where, like 
 Lucian in Regent's Park that afternoon, she became 
 conscious that her companion was an object of curiosity 
 to many of the wayfarers, especially the cabmen and 
 omnibus drivers. 
 
 " Alice will think I am lost," she said, making a signal 
 to a cabman, who made his horse plunge to obey it. 
 " Good-bye ; and many thanks. I am always at home 
 on Fridays, and shall be very happy to see you." 
 
 She handed him a card. He took it ; read it ; looked 
 at the back to see if there was anything written there ; 
 and then said dubiously, 
 
 *' I suppose there will be a lot of people." 
 


## p. (#171) ################################################

Chap. VII Cashel Byron's Profession 143 
 
 " Yes, you will meet plenty of people." 
 
 " Hm ! I wish youd let me see you home now. I 
 wont ask to go any further than the gate." 
 
 Lydia laughed. " You should be very welcome," she 
 said ; " but I am quite safe, thank you. I need not 
 trouble you." 
 
 " But suppose the cabman bullies you for double fere," 
 persisted Cashel. " I have business up in Kilburn ; and 
 your place is right in my way there. Upon my soul I 
 have," he added, suspecting that she doubted him. " I 
 go every Tuesday evening to the St. John's Wood Cestus 
 Club." 
 
 " I am hungry and in a hurry to get home," said 
 Lydia. " ' I must begone and live, or stay and die.' 
 Come if you will ; but in any case let us go at once." 
 
 She got into the cab ; and Cashel followed, making 
 some remark which she did not quite catch about its 
 being too dark for any one to recognize him. They 
 spoke little during the drive, which was soon over. 
 Bashville was standing at the open door as they came to 
 the house. When Cashel got out, the footman looked 
 at him with interest and some surprise. But when Lydia 
 alighted, he was so startled that he stood open-mouthed, 
 although he was trained to simulate insensibility to 
 everything except his own business, and to do that as 
 automatically as possible. Cashel bade Lydia good-bye, 
 and shook hands with her. As she went into the house, 
 she asked Bashville whether Miss GoiF was within. To 
 her surprise, he paid no attention to her, but stared after 
 the retreating cab. She repeated the question. 
 
 " Madam," he said, recovering himself with a start : 
 " she has asked for you four times." 
 
 Lydia, relieved of a disagreeable suspicion that her 
 usually faultless footman must be drunk, thanked him 
 and went upstairs.

CHAPTER VIII 
 
 One morning a handsome young man, elegantly dressed, 
 presented himself at Downing Street, and asked to see 
 Mr. Lucian Webber. He declined to send in a card, 
 and desired to be announced simply as " Bashville." 
 Lucian had him admitted at once ; and, when he entered, 
 condescended to him and invited him to sit down. 
 
 "I thank you, sir," said Bashville, seating himself. 
 It struck Lucian then, from a certain strung-up resolution 
 in his visitor's manner, that he had come on some 
 business of his own, and not with a message from his 
 mistress. 
 
 " I have come, sir, on my own responsibility this 
 morning. I hope you will excuse the liberty." 
 
 " Certainly. If I can do anything for you, Bashville, 
 dont be afraid to ask. But be as brief as you can. I am 
 so busy that every second I give you will probably come 
 off my night's rest. Will ten minutes be enough ? " 
 
 "More than enough, sir, thank you. I only wish to 
 ask one question. I own that I am stepping out of my 
 place to ask it ; but I'll risk that. Does Miss Carew 
 know what the Mr. Cashel Byron is that she receives 
 every Friday with her other friends ? " 
 
 " No doubt she does," said Lucian, at once becoming 
 cold in his manner, and looking severely at Bashville. 
 " What business is that of yours ? " 
 


## p. (#173) ################################################

Chap. VIII Cashel Byron's Profession 145 
 
 " Do you know what he is, sir ? " said Bashville, 
 returning Lucian's gaze steadily. Lucian. changed 
 countenance, and replaced a pen that had slipped from a 
 rack on his desk. " He is not an acquaintance of 
 mine," he said. " I only knbw him as a friend of Lord 
 Worthington's." 
 
 " Sir," said Bashville, with sudden vehemence, " he is 
 no more to Lord Worthington than the racehorse his 
 lordship bets on. I might as well set up to be a friend 
 of his lordship because I, after a manner of speaking, 
 know him. Byron is in the ring, sir. A common 
 prizefighter ! " 
 
 Lucian, recalling what had passed at Mrs. Hoskyn's, 
 believed the assertion at once. But he made a faint 
 effort to resist conviction. "Are you sure of this, 
 Bashville ? " he said. " Do you know that your state- 
 ment is a very serious one ? " 
 
 " There is no doubt at all about it, sir. Go to any 
 sporting public-house in London and ask who is the best- 
 known fighting man of the day, and theyll tell you 
 Cashel Byron. I know all about him, sir. Perhaps you 
 have heard tell of Ned Skene, who was champion, belike, 
 when you were at school." 
 
 " I believe I have heard the name." 
 
 "Just so, sir. Ned Skene picked up this Cashel 
 Byron in the streets of Melbourne, where he was a 
 common sailor boy, and trained him for the ring. You 
 may have seen his name in the papers, sir. The sporting 
 ones are full of him ; and he was mentioned in The Times 
 a month ago." 
 
 "I never read articles on such subjects. I have 
 hardly time to glance through the ones that concern me." 
 
 "Thats the way it is with everybody, sir. Miss 
 Carew never thinks of reading the sporting intelligence 
 in the papers ; and so he passes himself ofF on her for her

 equal. He's well known for his wish to be thought a 
 gentleman, sir, I assure you." 
 
 " I have noticed his manner as being odd, certainly." 
 
 " Odd, sir ! Why, a child might see through him ; 
 for he has not the sense to keep his own secret. Last 
 Friday he was in the library ; and he got looking at the 
 new biographical dictionary that Miss Carew contributed 
 the article on Spinoza to. And what do you think he 
 said, sir ? ' This is a blessed book,' he says. ' Here's 
 ten pages about Napoleon Bonaparte, and not one about 
 Jack Randall : as if one fighting man wasnt as good as 
 another ! ' I knew by the way Miss Carew took up 
 that saying, and drew him out, so to speak, on the 
 subject, that she didnt know who she had in her house ; 
 and then I determined to tell you, sir. I hope you wont 
 think that I come here behind his back out of malice 
 against him. All I want is fair play. If I passed myself 
 off on Miss Carew as a gentleman, I should deserve to 
 be exposed as a cheat ; and when he tries to take 
 advantages that dont belong to him, I think I have a 
 right to expose him." 
 
 " Ouite right, quite right," said Lucian, who cared 
 nothing for BashviUe's motives. " I suppose this Bjron 
 is a dangerous man to have any personal unpleasantness 
 with." 
 
 " He knows his business, sir. I am a better judge of 
 wrestling than half of these London professionals ; but I 
 never saw the man that could put a hug on him. Simple 
 as he is, sir, he has a genius for fighting, and has beaten 
 men of all sizes, weights, and colors. There's a new 
 man fi-om the black country, named Paradise, who says 
 he'll beat him ; but I wont believe it til I see it." 
 
 " Well," said Lucian, rising, " I am much indebted to 
 you, Bashville, for your information ; and I shall take 
 care to let Miss Carew know how you have "

 " Begging your pardon, sir," said Bashville ; " but, if 
 you please, no. I did not come to recommend myself 
 at the cost of another man ; and perhaps Miss Carew 
 might not think it any great recommendation neither." 
 Lucian looked quickly at him as if about to speak, but 
 checked himself. Bashville continued, "If he denies it, 
 you may call mc as a witness ; and I will tell him to his 
 face that he lies — and so I would if he were twice as 
 dangerous ; but, except in that way, I would ask you, 
 sir, as a favor, not to mention my name to Miss 
 Carcw." 
 
 " As you please," said fyucian, taking out his purse. 
 " Perhaps you are right. However, you shall not have 
 your trouble for nothmg." 
 
 "I couldnt rtolly, sir," said Bashville, retreating a 
 step. " You will agree with mc, I'm sure, that this is 
 not a thing that a man should take payment for. It is a 
 personal matter between me and Byron, sir." 
 
 J.uciiin, displeased that u servant should have any 
 persoiiiil feelings on any subject, much more one that 
 concerned his mistress, put back his purse without 
 comment, and said, "Will Miss Carew be at home this 
 alternoon between three and four ? " 
 
 " 1 have not heard of any arrangement to the 
 contrary, sir. I will telegraph to you if she goes out — 
 if you wish." 
 
 " It does not matter. Thank you. Good morning." 
 
 " Good morning, sir," said Bashville respectfully, as 
 he withdrew. Outside the door his manner changed. 
 H(? put on a pair of cinnamon gloves ; took up a silver- 
 mounted walking stick which he had left in the corridor ; 
 and walked from Downinji; Street into Whitehall. A 
 party of visitors from the country, standing there 
 examining the buildings, guessed that he was a junior 
 lord of the Treasury.

 He waited in vain that afternoon for Lucian to appear 
 at the house in Regent's Park. There were no callers ; 
 and he wore away the time by endeavoring, with the 
 aid of the library Miss Carew had placed at the 
 disposal of her domestics, to unravel the philosophy of 
 Spinoza. At the end of an hour, feeling satisfied that 
 he had mastered that author's views, he proceeded to 
 vary the monotony of the long summer's day by polish- 
 ing Lydia's plate. 
 
 Meanwhile, Lucian was considering how he could best 
 make Lydia not only repudiate Cashel's acquaintance, 
 but feel thoroughly ashamed of herself for having en- 
 couraged him, and wholesomely mistrustful of her own 
 judgment for the future. His secretarial duties had 
 taught him to provide himself with a few well-arranged 
 relevant fects before attempting to influence the opinions 
 of others on any subject. He knew no more of prize- 
 fighting than that it was a brutal and illegal practice, 
 akin to cockfighting, and, like it, generally supposed to 
 be obsolete. Knowing how prone Lydia was to suspect 
 any received opinion of being a prejudice, he felt that 
 he must inform himself more particularly. To Lord 
 Worthington's astonishment, he not only asked him to 
 dinner next evening, but listened with interest whilst he 
 expatiated to his heart's content on his favorite theme 
 of the ring. 
 
 As the days passed, Bashville became nervous, and 
 sometimes wondered whether Lydia had met her cousin 
 and heard from him of the interview at Downing Street. 
 He fancied that her manner towards him was changed ; 
 and he was once or twice on the point of asking the 
 most sympathetic of the housemaids whether she had 
 noticed it. On Wednesday his suspense ended. Lucian 
 came, and had a long conversation with Lydia in the 
 library. Though Bashville was too honorable to listen 
 


## p. (#177) ################################################

Chap. VIII Cashel Byron's Profession 149 
 
 at the door, he almost hoped that the sympathetic house- 
 maid would prove less scrupulous. But Miss Carew had 
 contrived to leave her servants some self-respect ; and 
 Lucian's revelation was made in complete privacy. 
 
 When he entered the library, he looked so serious that 
 she asked him whether he had neuralgia, from which he 
 occasionally suffered. He replied with some indignation 
 that he had not, and that he had a communication of im- 
 portance to make to her. 
 
 "What! Another!" 
 
 " Yes, another," he said, with a sour smile ; " but this 
 time it does not concern myself. May I warn you as to 
 the character of one of, your guests without overstepping 
 my privilege ? " 
 
 " Certainly. Do you mean Cheffsky ? If so, I am 
 perfectly aware that he is a proscribed Nihilist." 
 
 "I do not mean Monsieur Cheffsky. You under- 
 stand, I hope, that I do not approve of him, nor of your 
 strange iancy for Nihilists, Anarchists, and other doubt- 
 ful persons ; but I think that even you might draw the 
 line at a prizefighter." 
 
 Lydia lost color, and said, almost inaudibly, " Cashel 
 Byron ! " 
 
 " Then you knew ! " exclaimed Lucian, scandalized. 
 
 Lydia waited a moment to recover ; settled herself 
 quietly in her chair ; and replied calmly, " I know what 
 you tell me — nothing more. And now will you explain 
 to me exactly what a prizefighter is ? " 
 
 " He is simply what his name indicates. He is a man 
 who fights for prizes." 
 
 " So does the captain of a man-of-war. And yet society 
 does not place them in the same class — at least I do not 
 think so." 
 
 "As if there could be any doubt that society does 
 not ! There is no analogy whatever between the two

 cases. Let me endeavor to open your eyes a little, if 
 that be possible, which 1 am sometimes tempted to 
 doubt. A prizefighter is usually a man of naturally 
 ferocious disposition, who has acquired some reputation 
 among his associates as a bully ; and who, by constantly 
 quarrelling, has acquired some practice in fighting. On 
 the strength of this reputation, he can generally find 
 some gambler willing to stake a sum of money that he 
 will vanquish a pugilist of established fame in single 
 combat. Bets are made between the admirers of the 
 two men ; a prize is subscribed for, each party contri- 
 buting a share ; the combatants are trained as racehorses, 
 gamecocks, or their like are trained ; they meet, and 
 beat each other as savagely as they can until one or the 
 other is too much injured to continue the combat. This 
 takes place in the midst of a mob of such persons as 
 enjoy spectacles of the kind : that is to say, the vilest 
 blackguards a large city can afford to leave at large, and 
 many whom it can not. As the prize-money contributed 
 by each side often amounts to upwards of a thousand 
 pounds ; and as a successful pugilist commands far higher 
 terms for giving tuition in boxing than a tutor at one of 
 the universities does for coaching ; you will see that such 
 a man, whilst his youth and luck last, may have plenty 
 of money, and may even, by aping the manners of the 
 gentlemen whom he teaches, deceive careless people — 
 especially those who admire eccentricity — as to his true 
 character and position." 
 
 " What is his true position ? I mean before he 
 becomes a prizefighter." 
 
 " Well, he may be a skilled workman of some kind : a 
 journeyman butcher, skinner, tailor, or baker. Possibly 
 a discharged soldier, sailor, gentleman's servant, or what 
 not ? But he is generally a common laborer. The 
 waterside is prolific of such heroes."

Chap. VIII Cashel Byron's Profession 151 
 
 " Do they never come from a higher rank ? " 
 
 "Never even from the better classes in their own. 
 Broken-down gentlemen are not likely to succeed at 
 work that needs the strength and endurance of a bull, 
 and the cruelty of a butcher." 
 
 " But what becomes of them in the end ? They 
 cannot keep at such work all their lives." 
 
 "They do not. When through age a prizefighter is 
 found to be repeatedly beaten, no one will either bet on 
 him or subscribe to provide him with a stake. Or if he 
 is invariably successful, those, if any, who dare fight him 
 find themselves in a like predicament. In either case 
 his occupation is gone. If he has saved money, he opens 
 a sporting public-house, where he sell spirit? of the worst 
 description to his old rivals and their associates, and 
 eventually drinks himself to death or bankruptcy. If, 
 however, he has been improvident or unfortunate, he 
 begs from his former patrons and gives lessons. Finally, 
 when the patrons are tired of him and the pupils fail, he 
 relapses into the dregs of the laboring class with a 
 ruined constitution, a disfigured face, a brutalized nature, 
 and a tarnished reputation." 
 
 Lydia remained silent so long after this that Lucian's 
 magisterial severity first deepened, then wavered, and 
 finally gave way to a sense of injury ; for she seemed to 
 have forgotten him. He was about to protest against 
 this treatment, when she looked at him again, and said, 
 
 "Why did Lord Worthington introduce a man of 
 this class to me ? " 
 
 " Because you asked him to do so. Probably he 
 thought that if you chose to make such a request without 
 previous inquiry, you should not blame him if you found 
 yourself saddled with an undesirable acquaintance. 
 ' Recollect that you asked for the introduction on the 
 platform at Wiltstoken, in the presence of the man

 himself. Such a ruffian would be capable of making a 
 disturbance for much less offence than an explanation 
 and refusal would have given him." 
 
 " Lucian," said Lydia : " I asked to be introduced to, 
 my tenant, for whose respectability you had vouched by 
 letting the Warren Lodge to him." Lucian reddened. 
 "How does Lord Worthington explain Mr. Byron's 
 appearance at Mrs. Hoskyn's ? " 
 
 "It was a stupid joke. Mrs. Hoskyn had worried 
 Worthington to bring some celebrity to her house ; and 
 in revenge he took his pugilistic protege." 
 
 « Hm ! " 
 
 " I do not defend Worthington. But discretion is 
 hardly to be expected from him." 
 
 "He has discretion enough to understand a case of 
 this kind thoroughly. But let that pass. I have been 
 thinking upon what you tell me about these singular 
 people, whose existence I hardly knew of before. Now, 
 Lucian, in the course of my reading I have come iipon 
 denunciations of every race and pursuit under the sun. 
 Very respectable and well-informed men have held that 
 Jews, Irishmen, Christians, atheists, lawyers, doctors, 
 politicians, actors, artists, flesh-eaters, and spirit-drinkers, 
 are all of necessity degraded beings. Such statements 
 can be easily proved by taking a black sheep from each 
 flock, and holding him up as the type. It seems reason- 
 able to infer a man's character from the nature of his 
 occupation : still, who would act upon an opinion based 
 on that alone ? War is a cruel business ; but soldiers 
 ' are not exceptionally bloodthirsty and inhuman men. 
 I am not quite satisfied that a prizefighter is a violent 
 and dangerous man because he follows a violent and 
 dangerous profession — I suppose they call it a profession." 
 
 Lucian was about to speak ; but she interrupted him 
 by continuing,

 " And yet that is not what concerns me at present. 
 Have you found out anything about Mr. Byron 
 personally ? Is he an ordinary representative of his 
 class ? " 
 
 " No : I should rather think — and hope — that he is a 
 very extraordinary representative of it. I have traced 
 his history back to the time when he was a cabin-boy. 
 Having apparently failed to recommend himself to his 
 employers in that capacity, he became errand boy to a 
 sort of maitre cfarmes at Melbourne. Here he dis- 
 covered where his genius lay ; and he presently appeared 
 in the ring with an unfortunate young man named 
 Ducket, whose jaw he fractured. This laid the founda- 
 tion of his fame. He fought several battles with un- 
 varying success ; but at last he allowed his valor to get 
 the better of his discretion so far as to kill an English'- 
 man who fought him with desperate obstinacy for two 
 hours. I am informed that the particular blow by which 
 he felled the poor wretch for the last time is known in 
 pugilistic circles as 'Cashel's killer,' and that he has 
 attempted to repeat it in all his subsequent encounters, 
 without, however, achieving the same fatal result. The 
 failure has doubtless been a severe disappointment to him. 
 He fled from Australia, and reappeared in America, 
 where he resumed his victorious career, distinguishing 
 himself specially by throwing a gigantic opponent in 
 some dreadful fashion that these men have, and laming 
 him for life. He then " 
 
 "Thank you, Lucian," said Lydia, rathy faintly. 
 " That is quite enough. Are you quite sure it is all 
 true .? " 
 
 "My authority is Lord Worthington, and the files 
 of the sporting newspapers. Byron himself will prob- 
 ably be proud to give you the fullest confirmation of 
 the record. I should add, in justice to him, that he

 is looked upon as a model — ^to pugilists — of temperance 
 and general good conduct." 
 
 '"Do you remember my remarking a few days ago, 
 on another subject, how meaningless our observations 
 are until we are given the right thread to string them 
 on ? " 
 
 " Yes," said Lucian, disconcerted by the allusion. 
 
 " My acquaintance with this man is a case in point. 
 He has obtruded his horrible profession upon me every 
 time we have met. I have actually seen him publicly 
 cheered as a pugilist-hero ; and yet, being ofF the track, 
 and ignorant of the very existence of such a calling, I 
 have looked on and seen nothing." 
 
 Lydia then narrated her adventure in Soho, and 
 listened with the perfect patience of indifference to his 
 censure of her imprudence in walking by herself in town. 
 
 " May I ask," he added, " what you intend to do in 
 this matter ? " 
 
 " What would you have me do ? " 
 
 " Drop his acquaintance at once. Forbid him your 
 house in the most expHcit terms." 
 
 " A pleasant task ! " said Lydia ironically. " But I 
 will do it — not so much, perhaps, because he is a 
 prizefighter as because he is an impostor. Now go to 
 the writing table, and draft me a proper letter to send 
 him." 
 
 Lucian's face elongated. "I think," he said, "you 
 can do that better for yourself. It is a delicate sort of 
 thing." 
 
 "Yes. It is not so easy as you implied a moment 
 ago. Otherwise I should not require your assistance. 
 As it is " She pointed again to the table. 
 
 Lucian was not ready with an excuse. He sat down 
 reluctantly, and, after some consideration, indited the 
 following : —

Chap. VIII Cashel Byron's Profession 155 
 
 Miss Carew presents her compliments to Mr. Cashel 
 Byron^ and begs to inform him that she will not be at home 
 during the remainder of the season as heretofore. She 
 therefore regrets that she cannot have the pleasure of receiv- 
 ing him on Friday afternoon. 
 
 " I think you will find that sufficient," said Lucian. 
 
 "Probably," said Lydia, smiling as she read it. 
 " But what shall I do if he takes offence ; calls here ; 
 breaks the windows ; and beats Bashville. That is what 
 such a letter would provoke me to do." 
 
 " He dare not give any trouble. But I will warn the 
 police if you feel anxious." 
 
 " By no means. We must not shew ourselves inferior 
 to him in courage, which is, I suppose, his cardinal 
 virtue." 
 
 " If you write the note now, I will post it for you." 
 
 "No, thank you. I will send it with my other 
 letters." 
 
 Lucian tried to wait ; but she would not write whilst 
 he was there. So he left, satisfied on the whole with 
 the success of his mission. When he was gone, she 
 endorsed his draft neatly, and placed it in a drawer. 
 Then she wrote to Cashel thus : — 
 
 Dear Mr. Cashel Byron 
 
 I have just discovered your secret. 1 am sorry ; but you 
 must not come again. Farewell. Yours faithfully, 
 
 Lydia Carew. 
 
 Lydia kept this note by her until next morning, when 
 she read it through carefully. She then sent Bashville 
 to the post with it.

CHAPTER IX 
 
 Cashel's pupils sometimes requested him to hit them 
 hard — not to play with them — to accustom them to. 
 regular right-down severe hitting, and no nonsense. 
 He only pretended to comply ; for he knew that a black 
 eye or loosened tooth would be immoderately boasted of 
 if received in combat with a famous pugilist, and that 
 the sufferer's friends would make private notes to avoid 
 so rough a professor. But when Miss Carew's note 
 reached him, he made an exception to his practice in 
 this respect. A young guardsman, whose lesson began 
 shortly after the post arrived, remarked that Cashel was 
 unusually distraught, and exhorted him to wake up and 
 pitch in in earnest. Instantly a blow in the epigastrium 
 stretched him almost insensible on the floor. His 
 complexion was considerably whitened when he was 
 set on his legs again ; and he presently alleged an 
 urgent appointment, and withdrew, declaring in a shaky 
 voice that that was the sort of bout he really enjoyed. 
 
 When he was gone, Cashel walked distractedly to and 
 fro, cursing, and occasionally stopping to read the letter. 
 His restlessness only increased his agitation. The arrival 
 of a Frenchman whom he employed to give lessons in 
 fencing made the place unendurable to him. He 
 changed his attire ; went out ; called a cab ; and bade 
 the driver, with an oath, drive to Lydia's house as fest

 as the horse could go. The man made all the haste he 
 could, and was presently told impatiently that there was 
 no hurry. Accustomed to this sort of inconsistency, he 
 was not surprised when, as they approached the house, 
 he was told not to stop, but to drive slowly past. Then, 
 in obedience to further instructions, he turned and re- 
 passed the door. As he did so, a lady appeared for an 
 instant at a window. Immediately his fare, with a 
 groan of mingled rage and fear, sprang from the moving 
 vehicle ; rushed up the steps of the mansion ; and rang 
 the bell violently. Bashville, faultlessly dressed and 
 impassibly mannered, opened the door. In reply to 
 Cashel's half inarticulate inquiry, he said, 
 
 " Miss Carew is not at home." 
 
 "You lie," said Cashel, his eyes suddenly dilating. 
 " I saw her." 
 
 Bashville reddened, but replied coolly, "Miss Carew 
 cannot see you to-day." 
 
 " Go and ask her," returned Cashel sternly, advancing. 
 
 Bashville, with compressed lips, seized the door to 
 shut him out ; but Cashel forced it back against him 
 and went in, shutting the door behind him. He turned 
 from Bashville for a moment to do this ; and before he 
 could face him again he was tripped and flung down 
 upon the tesselated pavement of the hall. When 
 Bashville was given the lie, and pushed back behind 
 the door, the excitement he had been suppressing since 
 his visit to Lucian exploded. He had thrown Cashel in 
 Cornish fashion, and now desperately .awaited the upshot. 
 
 Cashel got up so rapidly that he seemed to rebound 
 from the flags. Bashville, involuntarily cowering before 
 his onslaught, just escaped his right fist, and felt as 
 though his heart had been drawn with it as it whizzed 
 past his ear. He turned and fled frantically upstairs. 
 
 Lydia was in her boudoir with Alice when Bashville 
 


## p. (#186) ################################################

158 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. IX 
 
 darted in and locked the door. Alice rose and screamed. 
 Lydia, though startled, and that less by the unusual 
 action than by the change in a familiar face which she 
 had never seen influenced by emotion before, sat still, 
 and quietly asked what was the matter. Bashville 
 checked himself for a moment. Then he spoke un- 
 intelligibly, and went to the window, which he opened. 
 Lydia divined that he was about to call for help to the 
 street. 
 
 " Bashville," she said authoritatively : " be silent ; and 
 close the window. I will go downstairs myself." 
 
 Bashville then ran to prevent her from unlocking the 
 door ; but she paid no attention to him. He did not 
 dare to oppose her forcibly. He was beginning to 
 recover from his panic, and to feel the first stings of 
 shame for having yielded to it. 
 
 " Madam," he said : " Byron is below ; and he insists 
 on seeing you. He's dangerous ; and he's too strong for 
 me. I have done my best : on my honor I have. Let 
 me call the police. Stop," he added, as she opened the 
 door. " If either of us goes, it must be me." 
 
 "I will see him in the library," said Lydia com- 
 posedly. " Tell him so ; and let him wait there for me 
 — if you can sp?ak to him without running any risk." 
 
 "Oh pray let him call the police," urged Alice. 
 " Dont attempt to go to that man." 
 
 " Nonsense ! " said Lydia good-humoredly. " I am 
 not in the least afraid. We must not fail in courage 
 when we have a prizefighter to deal with." 
 
 Bashville, white, and with difficulty preventing his 
 knees from knocking together, but not faltering for a 
 second, went devotedly downstairs and found Cashel 
 leaning upon the balustrade, panting, and looking 
 perplexedly about him as he wiped his dabbled brow. 
 Bashville halted on the third stair ; and said, 
 


## p. (#187) ################################################

Chap. IX Cashel Byron's Profession 159 
 
 " Miss Carew will see you in the library. Come this 
 way, please." 
 
 Cashel's lips moved ; but no sound came from them : 
 he followed Bashville in silence. When they entered 
 the library, Lydia was already there. Bashville withdrew 
 without a word. Then Cashel sat down, and, to her 
 consternation, bent his head on his hand, and yielded 
 to a hysterical convulsion. Before she could resolve 
 how to act, he looked up at her with his face distorted 
 and discolored, and tried to speak. 
 
 " Please dont cry," said Lydia. " I am told that you 
 wish to speak to me." 
 
 " I dont wish to speak to you ever again," said 
 Cashel hoarsely. " You told your servant to throw me 
 down the steps. Thats enough for me." 
 
 Lydia caught from him the tendency to sob which he 
 was struggling with ; but she repressed it, and answered 
 firmly, "If my servant has been guilty of the least 
 incivility to you, Mr. Cashel Byron, he has exceeded 
 his orders." 
 
 " It doesnt matter," said Cashel. " He may thank 
 his luck that he has his head on. But he doesnt matter. 
 Hold on a bit — I cant talk — I shall get — second wind^ — 
 
 and then " Cashel raised his head with a curiously 
 
 businesslike expression ; threw himself supinely against 
 the back of his chair ; and in that position deliberately 
 rested until he could trust himself to speak. At last 
 he pulled himself together, and said, "Why are you 
 going to give me up ? " 
 
 Lydia ranged her wits in battle array, and replied, 
 " Do you remember our talk at Mrs. Hoskyn's ? " 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 "You admitted then that if the nature of your 
 occupation became known to me, our acquaintance should 
 cease."

 "That was all very fine to excuse my not telling 
 you. But I find, like many another man when put to 
 the proof, that I didnt mean it. Who told you I was a 
 fighting man ? " 
 
 " I had rather not tell you that." 
 
 " Aha ! " said Cashel, with a triumph that was half 
 choked by the remnant of his hysteria. " Who is trying 
 to make a secret now, I should like to know ? " 
 
 " I do so in this instance because I am afraid to expose 
 a friend to your resentment." 
 
 " And why ? He's a man, of course : else you 
 wouldnt be afraid. You think that I'd go straight ofi^ 
 and murder him. Perhaps he told you that it would 
 come quite natural to a man like me — a ruffian like me 
 — to smash him up. That comes of being a coward. 
 People run my profession down, not because there is a 
 bad one or two in it — there's plenty of bad bishops, if 
 you come to that — but because theyre afraid of us. 
 You may make yourself easy about your friend. I am 
 accustomed to get well paid for the beatings I give; and 
 your own common sense ought, to tell you that any one 
 who is used to being paid for a job is just the last person 
 in the world to do it for nothing." 
 
 "I find the contrary to be the case with first-rate 
 artists," said Lydia. 
 
 " Thank you," retorted Cashel sarcastically. " I 
 ought to make you a bow for that." 
 
 "But," said Lydia seriously, "it seems to me that 
 your art is wholly anti- social and retrograde. And I 
 fear that you have forced this interview on me to no 
 purpose." 
 
 "I dont know whether it's anti-social or not. But I 
 think it hard that I should be put out of decent society 
 when fellows that do far worse than I are let in. Who 
 did I see here last Friday, the most honored of your

 guests ? Why, that Frenchman with the gold spectacles. 
 What do you think I was told when I asked what his 
 little game was ? Baking dogs in ovens to see how long 
 a dog could live red hot ! I'd like to catch him doing 
 it to a dog of mine. Aye ; and sticking a rat full of nails 
 to see whether pain makes a rat sweat. Why, it's just 
 sickening. Do you think I'd have shaken hands with 
 that chap ? If he hadnt been a friend of yours, I'd 
 have taught him how to make a Frenchman sweat with- 
 out sticking any nails into him. And he^s to be received 
 and made much of, while I am kicked out ! Look 
 at your relation the general, too ! What is he but a 
 fighting man, I should like to know ? Isnt it his pride 
 and boast that as long as he is paid so much a day, he'll 
 ask no questions whether a war is feir or unfair, but just 
 walk out and put thousands of men in the best way to 
 kill and be killed — keeping well behind them himself all 
 the time, mind you. Last year he was up to his chin 
 in the blood of a lot of poor blacks that were no more 
 a match for his armed men than a feather-weight would 
 be for me. Bad as I am, I wouldnt attack a feather- 
 weight, or stand by and see another heavy man do it. 
 Plenty of your friends go pigeon-shooting to Hurlingham. 
 Therms a humane and manly way of spending a Saturday 
 afternoon ! Lord Worthington, that comes to see you 
 when he likes, though he's too much of a man or too 
 little of a shot to kill pigeons, thinks nothing of fox- 
 hunting. Do you think foxes like to be hunted, or that 
 the people that hunt them have such fine feelings that 
 they can afford to call prizefighters names ? Look at 
 the men that get killed or lamed every year at steeple- 
 chasing, fox-hunting, cricket, and football ! Dozens of 
 them ! Look at the thousands killed in battle ! Did 
 you ever hear of any one being killed in the ring ? Why,^

 of fighting has been going on, there's not been six fatal 
 accidents at really respectable fights. It's safer than 
 dancing: many a woman has danced her skirt into 
 the fire and been burnt. I once fought a man who 
 had spoiled his constitution with bad living ; and he 
 exhausted himself so byjgoing on and on long after he 
 was beaten that he died of it, and nearly finished me 
 too. If youd heard the fuss that even the old hinds 
 made over it, youd have thought a blessed baby had died 
 from falling out of its cradle. A good milling does a 
 man more good than harm. Arid if all these damned 
 dog-bakers, and soldiers, and pigeon-shooters, fox-hunters, 
 and the rest of them, are made welcome here, why am I 
 shut out like a brute beast ? " 
 
 "Truly I do not know," said Lydia, puzzled ; "unless 
 it be that your profession is not usually recruited from 
 our ranks." 
 
 " I grant you that boxers arnt gentlemen, as a rule. 
 No more were painters or poets, once upon a time. But 
 what I want to know is this. Supposing a boxer has as 
 good manners as your friends, and is as well born, why 
 shouldnt he mix with them and be considered their 
 equal ? ' 
 
 "The distinction seems arbitrary, I confess. But 
 perhaps the true remedy would be to exclude the vivi- 
 sectors and soldiers, instead of admitting the prize- 
 fighters. Mr. Cashel Byron," added Lydia, changing 
 her manner : " I cannot discuss this with you. Society 
 has a prejudice against you. I share it ; and I cannot 
 overcome it. Can you find no nobler occupation than 
 these fierce and horrible encounters by which you con- 
 descend to gain a living ? " 
 
 "No," said Cashel flatly. "I cant. Thats just 
 where it is." 
 
 Lydia looked grave, and said nothing.

 "You dont see it?" said Cashel. "Well, I'll just 
 tell you all about myself, and then leave you to judge. 
 May I sit down while I talk ? " He had risen in the 
 course of his remarks on Lydia's scientific and military 
 acquaintances. 
 
 She pointed to a chair near her. Something in the 
 action brought color to his cheeks. 
 
 " I believe I was the most unfortunate devil of a boy 
 that ever walked," he began. " My mother was — and is 
 — an actress, and a tiptop crack in her profession. One 
 of the first things I remember is sitting on the floor in 
 the corner of a room where there was a big glass, and 
 she flaring away before it, attituditiizing and spouting 
 Shakespear like mad. I was afraid of her, because she 
 was very particular about my manners and appearance, 
 and would never let me go near a theatre. I know 
 nothing about my people or hers ; for she boxed my 
 ears one day for asking who my father was, and I took 
 good care not to ask her again. She was quite young 
 when I was a child : at first I thought her a sort ot 
 angel. I should have been fond of her, I think, if she 
 had let me. But she didnt, somehow ; and I had to 
 keep my affection for the servants. I had plenty of 
 variety in that way ; for she gave her whole establishment 
 the sack about once every two months, except a maid 
 that used to bully her and give me nearly all the nursing 
 I ever got. I believe it was my crying about some 
 housemaid or other who went away that first set her 
 abusing me for having low tastes — a sort of thing that 
 used to cut me to the heart, and which she kept up till 
 the very day I left her for good. We were a precious 
 pair : I sulky and obstinate ; she changeable and hot- 
 tempered. She used to begin breakfast sometimes by 
 knocking me to the other side of the room with a slap, 
 and finish it by calling me her darling boy and promising

164 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.ix 
 
 me all manner of toys and things. I soon gave up 
 trying to please her or like her, and became as disagree- 
 able a young imp as youd dsk to see. My only thought 
 was to get all I could out of her when she was in a good 
 humor, and to be sullen and stubborn when she was in a 
 tantrum. One day a boy in the street threw some mud 
 at me ; and I ran in crying, and complained to her. 
 She told me I was a little coward. I havent forgiven 
 her for that yet — perhaps because it was one of the few 
 true things she ever said to me. I was in a state of 
 perpetual aggravation ; and I often wonder I wasnt 
 soured for life at that time. At last I got to be such a 
 little fiend that when she hit me I used to guard ofF 
 her blows, and look so wicked that I think she got 
 afraid of me. Then she put me to school, telling me I 
 had no heart, and telling the master I was an ungovern- 
 able young brute. So I, like a little fool, cried at leaving 
 her ; and she, like a big one, cried back again over me, 
 ■ — just after telling the master what a bad one I was, 
 mind you — and ofF she went, leaving her darling boy and 
 blessed child howling at his good luck in getting rid of 
 her. 
 
 " I was a nice boy to let loose in a school. I could 
 speak as well as an actor, as far as pronunciation goes ; 
 but I could hardly read words of one syllable ; and 
 as to writing, I couldnt make pothooks and hangers 
 respectably. To this day, I can no more spell than old 
 Ned Skene can. What was a worse sort of ignorance 
 was that I had no idea of fair play. I thought that 
 all servants would be afraid of me ; and that all grown- 
 up people would tyrannize over me, I was afraid of 
 everybody; afraid that my cowardice would be found 
 out ; and as angry and cruel in my ill-tempers as cowards 
 always are. Now youll hardly believe this ; but what 
 saved me from going to the bad altogether was my 
 


## p. (#193) ################################################

Chap. IX Cashel Byron's Profession 165 
 
 finding out that I was a goo^ one to fight. The bigger 
 boys were like grown-up people in respect' of liking to 
 see other people fight ; and they used to set us young 
 ones at it, whether we liked it or not, regularly every 
 Saturday afternoon, with seconds, bottleholders, and 
 everything complete, except the ropes. At first, when 
 they made me fight, I shut my eyes and cried ; but for 
 all that I managed to catch the other fellow tight round 
 the waist and throw him. After that, it became a regular 
 joke to make me fight ; for I always cried. But the end 
 of it was that I learnt to keep my eyes open and hit 
 straight. I had no trouble about fighting then. Some- 
 how, I could tell by instinct when the other fellow was 
 going to hit me ; and I always hit him first. It's the 
 same with me now in the ring : I know what a man 
 is going to do before he rightly knows himself. The 
 power this gave me, civilized me. In the end it made 
 me cock of the school ; and, as cock, I couldnt be mean 
 or childish. There would be nothing like fighting for 
 licking boys into shape if every one could be cock ; but 
 every one cant ; so I suppose it does more harm than 
 good. 
 
 " I should have enjoyed school well enough if I had 
 worked at my books. But I wouldnt study ; and the 
 masters were all down on me as an idler, though I 
 shouldnt have been like that if they had known how 
 to teach: I have learnt since what teaching is. As to 
 the holidays, they were the worst part of the year to 
 me. When I was left at school I was savage at not 
 being let go home ; and when I went home, my 
 mother did nothing but find fault with my schoolboy 
 manners. I was getting too big to be cuddled as her 
 darling boy, you understand. Her treatment of me 
 was just the old game with the affectionate part left 
 out. It wasnt pleasant, after being cock of the school.

 to be made feel like a good-for-nothing little brat tied 
 to her apron strings. When she saw that I was learning 
 nothing, she sent me to another school at a place in 
 the north called Panley. I stayed there until I was 
 seventeen ; and then she came one day ; and we had 
 a row, as usual. She said she wouldnt let me leave 
 school until I was nineteen ; and so I settled that 
 question by running away the same night. I got to 
 Liverpool, where I hid in a ship bound for Australia. 
 When I was starved out, they treated me better than 
 I expected ; and I worked, hard enough to earn my 
 passage and my victuals. But when I was left ashore in 
 Melbourne, I was in a pretty pickle. I knew nobody ; 
 and I had no money. Everything that a man could live 
 by was owned by some one or other. I walked through 
 the town looking for a place where they might want a 
 boy to run errands or to clean the windows. But I 
 hadnt the cheek to go into the shops and ask. Two or 
 three times, when I was on the point of trying, I caught 
 sight of some cad of a shopman, and made up my mind 
 that I wouldnt be ordered about by him, and that since 
 I had the whole town to choose from I might as well go 
 on to the next place. At last, quite late in the afternoon, 
 I saw an advertisement stuck up on a gymnasium ; and 
 while I was reading it I got talking to old Ned Skene, 
 the owner, who was smoking at the door. He took a 
 fancy to me, and oiFered to have me there as a sort of 
 lad-of-all-work. I was only too glad to get the chance ; 
 and I closed with him at once. As time went on, I 
 became so clever with the gloves that Ned matched me 
 against a light-weight named Ducket, and bet a lot of 
 money that I would win. Well, I couldnt disappoint 
 him after his being so kind, to me — Mrs. Skene had made 
 as much of me as if I was her own son. What could I 
 do but take my bread as it came to me ? I was fit for

 nothing else. Even if I had been able to write a good 
 hand and keep accounts, I couldnt have brought myself 
 to think that quilldriving and counting other people's 
 money w^as a fit employment for a man. It's not what a 
 man would like to do that he must do in this world : it's 
 what he can do ; and the only mortal thing I could do 
 properly was to fight. There was plenty of money and 
 plenty of honor and glory to be got among my acquain- 
 tance by fighting. So I challenged Ducket, and knocked 
 him all to pieces in about ten minutes. I half killed him, 
 because I didnt know my own strength and was afraid of 
 him. I have been at the same work ever since ; for I 
 never was offered any other sort of job. I was training 
 for a fight when I was down at Wiltstoken with that old 
 fool Mellish. It came off the day you saw me at Clap- 
 ham when I had such a bad eye. Wiltstoken did for me. 
 With all my fighting, I'm no better than a baby at heart ; 
 and ever since I found out that my mother wasnt an 
 angel, I have always had a notion that a real angel would 
 turn up some day. You see, I never cared much about 
 women. ' Bad as my mother was as far as being what you 
 might call a parent went, she had something in her looks 
 and manners that gave me a better idea of what a nice 
 Woman was like than I had of most things ; and the girls 
 I met in Australia and America seemed very small 
 potatoes to me in comparison with her. Besides, of 
 course they were not ladies. I was fond of Mrs. Skene 
 because she was good to me ; and I made myself agree- 
 able, for her sake, to the girls that came to see her ; but 
 in reality I couldnt stand them. Mrs. Skene said they 
 were all setting their caps at me — women are death on a 
 crack fighter — but the more they tried it on the less I 
 liked them. It was no go : I could get on with the men 
 well enough, no matter how common they were ; but the 
 snobbishness of my breed came out with regard to the

 women. When I saw you that day at Wiltstoken walk 
 out of the trees and stand looking so quietly at me and 
 Mellish, and then go back out of sight without a word, 
 I'm blest if I didnt think you were the angel come at 
 last. Then I met you at the railway station and walked 
 with you. You put the angel out of my head quick 
 enough ; for an angel, after all, is only a shadowy, 
 childish notion — I believe it's all gammon about there 
 being any in heaven — but you gave me a better idea than 
 mamma of what a woman should be, and you came up to 
 that idea and went beyond it. I have been in love with 
 you ever since ; and if I cant have you, I dont care what 
 becomes of me. I know I am a bad lot, and have always 
 been one ; but when I saw you taking pleasure in the 
 society of fellows just as bad as myself, I didnt see why I 
 should keep away when I was dying to come. I am no 
 worse than the dog-baker, anyhow. And hang it. Miss 
 Lydia, I dont want to brag ; but there are clean ways 
 and dirty ways in prizefighting the same as in anything 
 else ; and I have tried my best to keep in the clean ways. 
 I never fought a cross or struck a foul blow in my life ; 
 and I have never been beaten, though I'm only a middle- 
 weight, and have stood up with the best fourteen stone 
 men in the Colonies, the States, or in England." 
 
 Cashel ceased. As he sat eyeing her wistfully, Lydia, 
 who had been perfectly still, said bemusedly, 
 
 " I was more prejudiced than I knew. What will you 
 think of me when I tell you that your profession does 
 not seem half so shocking now that I know you to be 
 the son of an artist, and not a journeyman butcher or a 
 laborer, as my cousin told me." 
 
 "What!" exclaimed Cashel. "That lantern-jawed 
 fellow told you I was a butcher ! " 
 
 " I did not mean to betray him ; but, as I have already 
 said, I am bad at keeping secrets, Mr. Lucian Webber

 is my cousin and friend, and has done me many services. 
 May I rest assured that he has nothing to fear from 
 you ? " 
 
 " He has no right to tell lies about me. He is sweet 
 on you too : I twigged that at Wiltstoken. I have a 
 good mind to let him know whether I am a butcher or 
 not." 
 
 " He did not say so. What he told me of you, as far 
 as it went, is exactly confirmed by what you have said 
 yourself. I happened to ask him to what class men of 
 your calling usually belonged ; and he said that they 
 were laborers, butchers, and so forth. Do you resent 
 that ? " . 
 
 " I see plainly enough that you wont let me resent it. 
 I should like to know what else he said of me. But he 
 was right enough. There are all sorts of blackguards in 
 the ring : there's no use denying it. Since it's been 
 made illegal, decent men wont go into it. All the same, 
 it's not the fighting men, but the betting men, that 
 bring discredit on it, I wish your cousin had held his 
 confounded tongue." 
 
 " I wish you had forestalled him by telling me the 
 truth." 
 
 " I wish I had, now. But whats the use of wishing ? 
 I didnt dare run the chance of losing you. See how 
 soon you forbade me the house when you did find 
 out." 
 
 " It made little difference," said Lydia gravely. 
 
 "You were always friendly to me," said Cashel 
 plaintively. 
 
 "More so than you were to me. You should not 
 have deceived me. And now I think we had better 
 part. I am glad to know your history ; and I admit 
 that you made perhaps the best choice that society 
 offered you. I do not blame you."

 " But you give me the sack. Is that it .? " 
 
 "What do you propose, Mr. Cashel Byron ? Is it to 
 visit my house in the intervals of battering and maiming 
 butchers and laborers ? " 
 
 " No, it's not," retorted Cashel. " Youre very aggra- 
 vating. I wont stay much longer in the ring now : 
 my luck is too good to last. Anyhow, T shall have to 
 retire soon, luck or no luck, because no one can match 
 me. Even now there's nobody except Bill Paradise 
 that pretends to be able for me ; and I'll settle him in 
 September if he really means business. After that, I'll 
 retire. I expect to be worth ten thousand pounds then. 
 Ten thousand pounds, I'm told, is the same as five 
 hundred a year. Well, I suppose, judging from the 
 style you keep here, that youre worth as much more, 
 besides your place in the country ; so if you will marry 
 me we shall have a thousand a year between us. I dont 
 know much of money matters ; but at any rate we can 
 live like fighting cocks on that much. Thats a straight 
 and businesslike proposal, isnt it ? " 
 
 " And if I refuse ? " said Lydia, with some sternness. 
 
 " Then you may have the ten thousand pounds to do 
 what you like with," said Cashel despairingly. " It wont 
 matter what becomes of me. I wont go to the devil for 
 you or any woman if I can help it ; and I — but where's 
 the good of saying if you refuse? I know I dont express 
 myself properly : I'm a bad hand at sentimentality ; but 
 if I had as much gab as any of those long-haired fellows 
 on Friday, I couldnt be any fonder of you, or think more 
 highly of you." 
 
 "But you are mistaken as to the amount of my 
 income." 
 
 "That doesnt matter a bit. If you have more, why, 
 the more the merrier. If you have less, or if you have 
 to give up all your property when youre married, I will

 soon make another ten thousand to supply the loss. 
 Only give me one good word, and, by George, I'll fight 
 the seven champions of Christendom, one down and 
 t'other come on, for five thousand a side each. Hang 
 the money ! " 
 
 " I am richer than you suppose," said Lydia, unmoved. 
 " I cannot tell you exactly how much I possess ; but my 
 income is about forty thousand pounds." 
 
 " Forty thousand pounds ! " ejaculated Cashel. " Holy 
 Moses ! I didnt think the Queen had as much as 
 that." 
 
 For a moment he felt nothing but mere astonishment. 
 Then, comprehending the situation, he became very red. 
 In a voice broken by mortification, he said, " I see I 
 have been making a fool of myself," and took his hat and 
 turned to go. 
 
 " It does not follow that you should go at once with- 
 out a word," said Lydia, betraying nervousness for the 
 first time during the interview. 
 
 " Oh, thats all rot," said Cashel. " I may be a fool 
 while my eyes are shut ; but I'm sensible enough when 
 theyre open. I have no business here. I wish to the 
 Lord I had stayed in Australia." 
 
 "Perhaps it would have been better," said Lydia, 
 troubled. "But since we have met, it is useless to 
 
 deplore it ; and Let me remind you of one thing. 
 
 You have pointed out to me that I have made friends of 
 men whose pursuits are no better than yours. I do not 
 wholly admit that ; but there is one respect in which 
 they are on the same footing as you. They are all, as 
 far as worldly gear is concerned, much poorer than I. 
 Most of them, I fear, are poorer — much, much poorer 
 than you are." 
 
 Cashel looked up quickly with returning hope ; but it 
 lasted only a moment. He shook his head dejectedly.

 "I am at least grateful to you," she continued, 
 " because you have sought me for my own sake, knowing 
 nothing of my wealth." 
 
 " I should think not," groaned Cashel. "Your wealth 
 may be a very fine thing for the other fellows ; and I'm 
 glad you have it, for your own sake. But it's a settler 
 for me. So good-bye." 
 
 "Good-bye," said Lydia, almost as pale as he had 
 now become, " since you will have it so." 
 
 "Since the devil will have it so," said Cashel rue- 
 fully. " It's no use wishing to have it any other way. 
 The luck is against me. I hope. Miss Carew, that 
 youll excuse me for making such an ass of myself. It's 
 all my blessed innocence : I never was taught any 
 better." 
 
 " I have no quarrel with you except on the old score 
 of hiding the truth from me ; and I forgive you that — as 
 far as the evil of it afFects me. As for your declaration 
 of attachment to me personally, I have received many 
 similar ones that have flattered me less. But there are 
 certain scruples between us. You will not court a 
 woman a hundred-fold richer than yourself; and I will 
 not entertain a prizefighter. My wealth frightens every 
 man who is not a knave ; and your profession frightens 
 every woman who is not a fury." 
 
 "Then you Just tell me this," said Cashel 
 
 eagerly. " Suppose I were a rich swell, and were not 
 a " 
 
 "No," said Lydia, peremptorily interrupting him. " I 
 will suppose nothing but what is." 
 
 Cashel relapsed into melancholy. "If you onlyhadnt 
 been kind to me ! " he said. " I think the reason I love 
 you so much is that youre the only person that is not 
 afraid of me. Other people are civil because they darent 
 be otherwise to the cock of the ring. It's a lonely thing 
 


## p. (#201) ################################################

Chap. IX Cashel Byron's Profession 173 
 
 to be a champion. You knew nothing about that ; and 
 you knew I was afraid of you ; and yet you were as good 
 as gold." 
 
 " It is also a lonely thing to be a very rich woman. 
 People are afraid of my wealth, and of what they call 
 my learning. We two have at least one experience in 
 common. Now do me a great favor by going. We 
 have nothing further to say." 
 
 " I'll go in two seconds. But I dont believe much in 
 you being lonely. Thats only fency." 
 
 "Perhaps so. Most feelings of this kind are only 
 fancies." 
 
 There was another pause. Then Cashel said, 
 
 " I dont feel half so downhearted as I did a minute 
 ago. Are you sure that youre not angry with me ? " 
 
 " Quite sure. Pray let me say good-bye." 
 
 " And may I never see you again ? Never at all ? — 
 world without end, Amen ? " 
 
 " Never as the famous prizefighter. But if a day 
 should come when Mr. Cashel Byron will be something 
 better worthy of his birth and nature, I will not forget 
 an old friend. Are you satisfied now ? " 
 
 Cashel's face began to glow, and the roots of his hair 
 to tingle. " One thing more," he said. "If you meet 
 me by chance in the street before that, will you give me 
 a look ? I dont ask for a regular bow, but just a look to 
 keep me going ? " 
 
 "I have no intention of cutting you," said Lydia 
 gravely. "But do not place yourself purposely in my 
 way." 
 
 " Honor bright, I wont. I'll content myself with 
 walking through that street in Soho occasionally. Now 
 I'm ofF : I know youre in a hurry to be rid of me. So 
 
 good-b Stop a bit, though. Perhaps when that 
 
 time you spoke of comes, you'll be married."

174 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. IX 
 
 " It is possible ; but I am not likely to marry. How 
 many more things have you to say, that you have no 
 right to say ? " 
 
 "Not one," said Cashel, with a laugh that rang 
 through the house. " I never was happier in my life, 
 though I'm crying inside all the time. I'll have a try 
 for you yet. Good-bye. No," he added, turning from 
 her proffered hand : " I darent touch it : I should eat 
 you afterwards." He made for the door, but turned on 
 the threshold to say in a loud whisper : " Mind, I'm 
 engaged to you. I dont say youre engaged to me ; but 
 it's an engagement on my side." And he ran out of the 
 room. 
 
 In the hall was Bashville, pale and determined, wait- 
 ing there to rush to the assistance of his mistress at her 
 first summons. He had a poker concealed at hand. 
 Having just heard a great laugh, and seeing Cashel come 
 downstairs in high spirits, he stood stock still, not know- 
 ing what to think. 
 
 "Well, old chap," said Cashel boisterously, slapping 
 him on the shoulder : " so youre alive yet. Is there 
 any one in the dining-room ? " 
 
 "No," said Bashville. 
 
 "There's a thick carpet there to fall soft on," said 
 Cashel, pulling Bashville into the room. " Come along. 
 Now shew me that little trick of yours again. Come ! 
 dont be afraid : I wont hit you. Down with me. Take 
 care you dont knock my head against the fire-irons." 
 
 « But "i 
 
 " But be hanged. You were spry enough at it before. 
 Come ! " 
 
 Bashville, after a moment's hesitation, seized Cashel, 
 who immediately became grave and attentive, and 
 remained imperturbably so whilst Bashville expertly 
 threw him. He sat thinking for a moment on the

Chap. IX Cashel Byron's Profession 175 
 
 hearthrug before he rose. " / see," he said then, getting 
 up. " Now do it again." 
 
 "But it makes such a row," remonstrated Bashville. 
 
 " Only once more. There'll be no row this time." 
 
 "Well, every man to his taste," said Bashville, com- 
 plying. But instead of throwing his man, he found 
 himself wedged into a collar formed by Cashel's arms, 
 the least constriction of which would have strangled him. 
 Cashel again roared with laughter as he released him. 
 
 " Thats the way, aint it ? " he said. " You cant 
 catch an old fox twice in the same trap. Do you know 
 any more falls ? " 
 
 " I do," said Bashville ; " but I really cant shew them 
 to you here. I shall get into trouble on account of the 
 noise." 
 
 "You come down to me whenever you have an 
 evening out," said Cashel, handing him a card, " to that 
 address, and shew me what you know ; and I'll see 
 what I can do with you. There's the making of a man 
 in you." 
 
 "Youre very kind," said Bashville, pocketing the 
 card with a grin. 
 
 " And now let me give you a word of advice that will 
 be of use to you as long as you live," said Cashel impress- 
 ively. "You did a damned silly thing to-day. You 
 threw a man down — a fighting man — and then stood 
 looking at him like a fool, waiting for him to get up and 
 kill you. If ever you do that again, fall on him as heavily 
 as you can the instant he's off his legs. Double your 
 elbow well under you, and see that it gets into a soft 
 place. If he grabs it and turns you, make play with the 
 back of your head. If he's altogether too big for you, 
 put your knee on his throat as if by accident. But on no 
 account stand and do nothing. It's flying in the face of 
 Providence."

 Cashel emphasized each of these counsels by an 
 impressive tap of his forefinger on one of Bashville's 
 buttons. In conclusion, he nodded ; opened the house- 
 door ; and walked away in buoyant spirits. 
 
 Lydia, standing near the library window, saw him 
 go down the long front garden, and observed how his 
 light alert step, and a certain gamesome assurance of 
 manner, marked him ofi^ from a genteelly promenading 
 middle-aged gentleman, a trudging workman, and a 
 vigorously striding youth passing without. The railings 
 that separated him from them reminded her of the admir- 
 able and dangerous creatures passing and repassing behind 
 iron bars in the park yonder. But she exulted, in her 
 quiet manner, in the thought that, dangerous as he was, 
 she had no fear of him. When his cabman had found 
 him and taken him ofF, she went to a private drawer in 
 her desk, and took out her father's last letter. She sat 
 for some time looking at it without unfolding it. 
 
 " It would be a strange thing, father," she said, as if 
 he were actually there to hear her, "if your paragon 
 should end as the wife of an illiterate prizefighter. I felt 
 a pang of despair when he replied to my forty thousand 
 pounds a year with an unanswerable good-bye. And 
 now he is engaged to me." 
 
 She locked up her father, as it were, in the drawer 
 again, and rang the bell. Bashville appeared, somewhat 
 perturbed. 
 
 "If Mr. Byron calls again, admit him if I am at 
 home." 
 
 "Yes, madam." 
 
 " Thank you." 
 
 "Begging your pardon, madam, but may I ask has 
 any complaint been made of me ? " 
 
 " None." Bashville was reluctantly withdrawing when 
 she added, " Mr. Byron gave me to understand that you

 tried to prevent his entrance by force. You exposed 
 yourself to needless risk by doing so ; and you may make 
 a rule in future that when people are importunate, and 
 will not go away when asked, they had better come 
 in until you get special instructions from me. I am 
 not finding fault : on the contrary, I approve of your 
 determination to carry out your orders ; but under 
 exceptional circumstances you may use your own 
 discretion." 
 
 " He shoved the door into my face ; and I acted on 
 the impulse of the moment, madam. I hope you will 
 forgive the liberty I took in locking the door of the 
 boudoir. He is older and heavier than I am, madam ; 
 and he has the advantage of being a professional. Else 
 I should have stood my ground." 
 
 "I am quite satisfied," said Lydia a little coldly, as 
 she left the room. 
 
 " How long you have been ! " cried Alice, almost in 
 hysterics, as Lydia entered. " Is he gone ? What were 
 those dreadful noises ? Is anything the matter ? " 
 
 " Dancing and late hours are the matter," said Lydia. 
 " The season is proving too much for you, Alice." 
 
 " It is not the season : it is the man," said Alice, with 
 a sob. 
 
 " Indeed ? I have been in conversation with the man 
 for more than half an hour ; and Bashville has been in 
 actual combat with him ; yet we are not in hysterics. 
 You have been sitting here at your ease, have you not ? " 
 
 " I am not in hysterics," said Alice indignantly. 
 
 "So much the better," said Lydia gravely, placing 
 her hand on the forehead of Alice, who subsided with a 
 snifi;,

CHAPTER X 
 
 Mrs. Byron, under her stage name of Adelaide Gisborne, 
 was now, for the second time in her career, talked, of in 
 London, where she had been for many years almost 
 forgotten. The metropolitan managers of her own 
 generation had found that her success in new parts was 
 very untertain ; that she was more capricious than the 
 most petted favorites of the public ; and that her invari- 
 able reply to a business proposal was that she detested the 
 stage, and was resolved never to set foot upon it again. 
 So they had managed to do without her for so long that 
 the younger London playgoers knew her by reputation 
 only as an old-fashioned actress who wandered through 
 the provinces palming herself ofF on the ignorant in- 
 habitants as a great artist, and boring them with 
 performances of the plays of Shakespear. It suited Mrs. 
 Byron well to travel with the nucleus of a dramatic com- 
 pany from town to town, staying a week or two in each, 
 and repeating half-a-dozen characters in which she was 
 very effective, and which she knew so well that she never 
 thought about them when she had anything else to think 
 about. Most of the provincial populations received her 
 annual visits with enthusiasm. Among them she found 
 herself more excitingly applauded before the curtain, her 
 authority more despotic behind it, her expenses smaller, 
 and her gains greater than in London, for which she

Chap. X Cashel Byron's Profession 179 
 
 accordingly cared as little as London cared for her. As 
 she grew older she made more money and spent less. 
 When she complained to Cashel of the cost of his educa- 
 tion, she was rich. Since he had relieved her of that 
 cost, she had visited America, Egypt, India, and the 
 colonies, and had grown constantly richer. From this 
 great tour she had returned to England on the day when 
 Cashel added the laurels of the Flying Dutchman to his 
 trophies ; and the next Sunday's paper had its sporting 
 column full of the prowess of Cashel Byron, and its 
 theatrical column full of the genius of Adelaide Gisborne. 
 But she never read sporting columns, though he kept an 
 eye on theatrical ones. 
 
 The managers who had formerly avoided Mrs. Byron 
 were by this time dead, bankrupt, or engaged in less 
 hazardous pursuits. One of the actor -managers who 
 succeeded them had lately restored Shakespear to popu- 
 larity as signally as Cashel had restored the prize ring. 
 Being ansdous to produce the play of King John, he 
 made the newly returned actress a tempting ofFer for the 
 part of Constance, instigating some journalist friends of 
 his at the same time to lament the decay of the grand 
 school of acting, and to invent or republish anecdotes 
 of Mrs. Siddons. 
 
 This time Mrs. Byron said nothing about detesting 
 the stage. She had really detested it once ; but by the 
 time she was rich enough to give up the theatre she had 
 worn that feeling out, and had formed a habit of acting 
 which was as irksome to shake off as any other habit. 
 She also found a certain satisfaction in making money 
 with ease and certainty ; and she had already made so 
 much that she was beginning to trifle with plans of 
 retirement, of playing in Paris, of taking a theatre in 
 London, and other whims. The chief public glory of 
 her youth had been a sudden triumph in London on the 
 


## p. (#208) ################################################

i8o Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.X 
 
 occasion of her first appearance on any stage ; and she 
 now felt a mind to repeat this and crown her career 
 where it had begun. So she accepted the manager's 
 offer, and even went the length of privately reading 
 King John from beginning to end. 
 
 It happened that one of the most curious documents 
 of the Plantagenet period was a scrap of vellum containing 
 a fragment of a chronicle of Prince Arthur, with an illu- 
 minated portrait of his mother. It had been picked up 
 for a trifling sum by the late Mr. Carew, and was now 
 in the possession of Lydia, to whom the actor-manager 
 applied for leave to inspect it. Leave being readily 
 given, he visited the house in Regent's Park, which he 
 declared to be an inexhaustible storehouse of treasure. 
 He deeply regretted, he said, that he could not shew the 
 portrait to Miss Gisborne. Lydia replied that if Miss 
 Gisborne would come and look at it, she should be very 
 welcome. Two days later, at noon, Mrs. Byron arrived 
 and found Lydia alone. Alice had gone out, feeling that 
 it was better not to meet an actress — one could never tell 
 what they might have been. 
 
 The years that had elapsed since Mrs. Byron's visit 
 to Dr. Moncrief had left no perceptible trace on her : 
 indeed she looked younger now than on that occasion, 
 because she had been at the trouble of putting on an 
 artificial complexion. Her careless refinement of manner 
 was so different from the studied dignity and anxious 
 courtesy of the actor-manager, that Lydia could hardly 
 think of them as belonging to the same profession. Her 
 voice gave a subtle charm to her most commonplace 
 remarks ; and it was as different as possible from Cashel's 
 rough tones. Yet Lydia was convinced by the first note 
 of it that she was Cashel's mother. Besides, they had 
 one another's chins. 
 
 Mrs. Byron, coming to the point without delay,

 at once asked to see the picture. Lydia brought her 
 to the library, where several portfolios were ready for 
 inspection. The precious fragment of vellum was upper- 
 most. 
 
 " Very interesting indeed," said Mrs. Byron, throwing 
 it aside after one glance at it, and turning over some 
 later prints, whilst Lydia, amused, looked on in silence. 
 " Ah," she said : " here is something that will suit me 
 exactly." 
 
 " Do you mean for Constance in King John ? " 
 
 "Yes." 
 
 " But silk was not made in Western Europe until 
 three hundred years after Constance's death. And 
 that drawing is a sketch of , Marie de Medicis by 
 Rubens." 
 
 " Never mind," said Mrs. Byron smoothly. " What 
 does a dress three hundred years out of date matter 
 when the woman inside it is seven hundred years out ? 
 What can be a greater anachronism than the death of 
 Prince Arthur three months hence on the stage of the 
 Panopticon Theatre ? I am an artist giving life to a 
 character in romance, I suppose : certainly not a grown- 
 up child playing at being somebody out of Mrs. Mark- 
 ham's History of England. I wear whatever becomes 
 me. I cannot act when I feel dowdy." 
 
 " But what will the manager say ? " 
 
 " To me ? Nothing," said Mrs. Byron ; and her 
 calm implied that he had better not. " Besides, you do 
 not suppose he is a learned person, do you ? And as 
 he will wear a suit of armor obviously made the other 
 
 day in Birmingham, why ! " Mrs. Byron shrugged 
 
 her shoulders, and did not take sufficient interest in the 
 manager's opinion to finish her sentence. 
 
 "Is this part of Lady Constance a favorite one of 
 yours ? "

 " Troublesome, my dear," said Mrs. Byron absently. 
 " The men look ridiculous in it ; and it does not draw." 
 
 " No doubt," said Lydia, watching her face. "But I 
 spoke rather of your personal feeling towards the char- 
 acter. Do you, for instance, like portraying maternal 
 tenderness on the stage ? " 
 
 "Maternal tenderness," said Mrs. Byron with sudden 
 nobleness, "is far too sacred a thing to be mimicked. 
 Have you any children ? " 
 
 " No," said Lydia demurely. " I am not married." 
 
 " You should get a baby : it will do you good, 
 physically and morally. Maternity is an education in 
 itself." 
 
 " Do you think it suits every woman ? " 
 
 " Unddubtedly. Without exception. Only think, 
 dear Miss Carew, of the infinite patience with which 
 you must tend a child — of the necessity of seeing with 
 its little eyes and with your own wise ones at the same 
 time — ^of bearing without a reproach the stabs it inno- 
 cently inflicts— of forgiving its hundred little selfish- 
 nesses — of living in continual fear of wounding its 
 exquisite sensitiveness, or rousing its bitter resentment 
 of injustice and caprice. Think of how you must watch 
 yourself; check yourself; exercise and develop every- 
 thing in you that can help to attract and retain the most 
 jealous love in the world ! Believe me, it is a priceless 
 trial to be a mother. It is a royal compensation for 
 having been born a woman." 
 
 " Nevertheless," said Lydia, " I wish I had been born 
 a man. Since you seem to have thought deeply on these 
 matters, I should like to ask you a question. Do you 
 not think that the acquirement of an art demanding 
 years of careful self-study and training — such as yours, 
 for example — is also of great educational value ? Almost 
 as good a discipline as motherhood, is it not ? "

 " Nonsense ! " said Mrs. Byron decidedly. " People 
 come into the world ready-made. I went on the stage 
 when I was eighteen, and succeeded at once. Had I 
 known anything of the world, or been four years older, I 
 should have been weak, awkward, timid, and flat : it 
 would have taken me twelve years to crawl to the front. 
 But I was young, passionate, beautiful, and indeed 
 terrible ; for I had run away from home two years 
 before, and been cruelly deceived. I learned the business 
 of the stage as easily and thoughtlessly as a child learns a 
 prayer : the rest came to me by nature. I have seen 
 others spend years in struggling with bad voices, uncouth 
 figures, and diffidence ; besides a dozen defects that 
 existed only in their imaginations. Their struggles may 
 have educated them ; but had they possessed sufficient 
 genius they would have needed neither struggle nor 
 education. Perhaps that is why geniuses are such erratic 
 people, and mediocrities so respectable. I grant you 
 that I was very limited when I first came out : I was 
 absolutely incapable of comedy. But I never took any 
 trouble about it ; and by-and-by, when I began to mature 
 a little, and see the absurdity of most of the things I had 
 been making a fuss about, comedy came to me unsought, 
 as romantic tragedy had come before. , I suppose it would 
 have come just the same if I had been laboring to 
 acquire it, except that I should have attributed its 
 arrival to my own exertions. Most of the laborious 
 people think they have made themselves what they 
 are — much as if a child should think it had made itself 
 grow." 
 
 "You are the first artist I ever met," said Lydia, 
 "who did not claim art as the most laborious of all 
 avocations. They all deny the existence of genius, and 
 attribute everything to work." 
 
 "Of course one picks up a great deal from experi-

 ence; and there is plenty of work on the stage. But 
 it is my genius which enables me to pick up things, 
 and to work on the stage instead of in a kitchen or 
 laundry." 
 
 " You must be very fond of your profession." 
 
 " I do not mind it now : I have shrunk to fit it. I 
 began because I couldnt help myself; and I go on 
 because, being an old woman, I have nothing else to 
 do. Bless me, how I hated it after the first month ! 
 I must retire soon now. People are growing weary of 
 me." 
 
 " I doubt that. I am bound to assume that you are 
 an old woman, since you say so ; but you must be aware, 
 flattery apart, that you hardly seem to have reached your 
 prime yet." 
 
 " I might be your mother, my dear. I might be a 
 grandmother. Perhaps I am." There was a plaintive 
 tone in the last sentence ; and Lydia seized the oppor- 
 tunity. 
 
 " You spoke of maternity then from experience, Miss 
 Gisborne ? " 
 
 " I have one son — a son who was sent to me in my 
 eighteenth year." 
 
 " I hope he inherits his rhother's genius and personal 
 grace." 
 
 " I am sure I dont know," said Mrs. Byron pensively. 
 "He was a perfect devil. I fear I shock you. Miss 
 Carew ; but really I did everything for him that the 
 most devoted mother could ; and yet he ran away 
 from me without making a sign of farewell. Little 
 wretch ! " 
 
 "Boys do cruel things sometimes in a spirit of 
 adventure," said Lydia, watching her visitor's face 
 narrowly. 
 
 " It was not that. It was his temper, which was un-

Chap. X Cashel Byron's Profession 185 
 
 governable. He was sulky and vindictive. It is quite 
 impossible to love a sulky child. I kept him constantly 
 near me when he was a tiny creature ; and when he 
 grew too big for that I spent oceans of money on his 
 education. All in vain ! He never shewed any feeling 
 towards me except a sense of injury that no kindness 
 could remove. And he had nothing to complain of. 
 Never was there a worse son." 
 
 Lydia remained silent and grave. Mrs. Byron looked 
 beside rather than at her. Suddenly she added, 
 
 " My poor darling Cashel " (Lydia repressed a start), 
 " what a shame to talk of you so ! You see I love him 
 in spite of his wickedness." Mrs. Byron took out her 
 pocket-handkerchief; and Lydia was for a moment 
 alarmed by the prospect of tears. But Miss Gisborne 
 only blew her nose with perfect composure, and rose to 
 take her leave. Lydia, who, apart from her interest in 
 Cashel's mother, was attracted and amused by the woman 
 herself, induced her to stay for luncheon, and presently 
 discovered from her conversation that she had read much 
 romance of the Werther sort in her youth, and had, 
 since then, employed her leisure in reading every book 
 that came in her way without regard to its quality. Her 
 acquirements were so odd, and her character so unreason- 
 able, that Lydia, whose knowledge was unusually well 
 organized, and who was eminently reasonable, concluded 
 that she was a woman of genius. For Lydia knew the 
 vanity of her own attainments, and believed herself to be 
 merely a patient and well-taught plodder. Mrs. Byron 
 happening to be pleased with the house, the luncheon, 
 and the hostess's intelligent listening, her natural charm 
 became so intensified by her good humor that even 
 Lydia was quite fascinated, and began to wonder what 
 its force might have been if some influence — that of a 
 lover, for instance — had ever made Mrs. Byron ecstatic-

 ally happy. She surprised herself at last in the act of 
 speculating whether she could ever make Cashel love 
 her as his father must, for a time at least, have loved 
 Mrs. Byron. 
 
 When the visitor wzs gone, Lydia considered wrhether 
 she was justified in keeping these two apart. It seemed 
 plain that at present Cashel was a disgrace to his mother, 
 and had better renxain hidden from her. But if he 
 should for any reason abandon his ruffianly pursuits, as 
 she had urged him to do, then she could bring about a 
 meeting between them ; and the truant's mother might 
 take better care of him in the future, besides rtiaking 
 him pecuniarily independent of prizefighting. This led 
 Lydia to ask herself what new profession Cashel could 
 adopt, and what probability there was of his getting on 
 with his mother any better than formerly. No satis- 
 factory answer was forthcoming. So she went back to 
 the likelihood of his reforming himself for her sake. On 
 this theme her imagination carried her so fas^fjom all 
 reasonable conjecture, that she was shakir'T her head at 
 her own folly when Bashville appeared and announced 
 Lord Worthington, who came into the room with Alice. 
 Lydia had not seen him since her discoveiy of the true 
 position of the tenant he had introduced tofber ; and he 
 was consequently a little afraid to meet Jier. To cover 
 his embarrassment, he began to talk qui<4kly on a number 
 of commonplace topics. But when tsome time had 
 passed, he began to show signs of fresh 'uneasiness.' He 
 looked at his watch, and said, 
 
 " I dont wish to hurry you, ladies ; but this affair 
 commences at three." 
 
 " What affair ? " said Lydi^ who was privately 
 wondering why he had cma^"^ 
 
 "The assault-at-arms. King Whatshisname's affair, 
 Webber told me he had arranged for us to go together."

Chap. X Cashel Byron's Profession 187 
 
 " Oh, you have come to take us there. I had for- 
 gotten. Did I promise to go ? " 
 
 " Webber said so. He was to have taken you him- 
 self ; but he's busy, and has done a good thing for me 
 and put me in his place. He said you particularly wanted 
 to go, hang him ! " 
 
 Lydia rose promptly and sent for her carriage. 
 " There is no hurry," she said. " We can easily drive 
 to St. James's Hall in twenty minutes." 
 
 " But we have to go to Islington, to the Agricultural 
 Hall. There will be cavalry charges, and all sorts of fun." 
 
 " Bless me ! " said Lydia. " Will there be any 
 boxing ? " 
 
 " Yes," said Lord Worthington, reddening, but un- 
 abashed. " Lots of it. It will be by gentlemen, though, 
 except perhaps one bout to show the old king our 
 professional form." 
 
 "Then excuse me whilst I go for my hat," said 
 Lydia, leaving the room. Alice had gone some time 
 before to make a complete change in her dress, as the 
 occasion was one for display of that kind. 
 
 " You look awfully fetching, Miss GoiF," Lord Wor- 
 thington said as he followed them into the carriage. 
 Alice did not deign to reply, but tossed her head 
 superbly, and secretly considered whether people would, 
 on comparison, think her overdressed or Lydia under- 
 dressed. Lord Worthington thought they both looked 
 their best, and reflected for several seconds on the 
 different styles of different women, and how what 
 would suit one would not do at all for another. It 
 seemed to him that Miss Carew's presence made him 
 philosophical. 
 
 The Agricultural Hall struck Alice at first sight as 
 an immense tan-strewn barn round which heaps of old 
 packing cases had been built into racecourse stands,

1 88 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.X 
 
 scantily decorated with red cloth and a few flags. Lord 
 Worthington had secured front seats in one of these 
 balconies. Just below were the palisades, ornamented 
 at intervals with evergreens in tubs, and pressed against 
 from without by the shilling crowd. Alice remarked that 
 it was little to the credit of the management that these 
 people should be placed so close beneath her that she 
 could hear their conversation ; but as Lydia did not seem 
 to share her disgust, she turned her attention to the 
 fashionable part of the audience. On the opposite side 
 of the arena the balconies seemed like beds of flowers 
 in bloom : blacknesses formed here and there by the 
 hats and coats of gentlemen representing the inter- 
 spaces of clay. In the midst of the flowers was a 
 gaudy dais, on which a powerfully built black gentle- 
 man sat in a raised chair, his majestic impassivity con- 
 trasting with the overt astonishment with which a row 
 of attendant chiefs grinned and gaped on either side 
 of him. 
 
 " What a pity we are not nearer the king ! " said 
 Alice. " I can hardly see the dear old fellow." 
 
 "You will find these the best seats for seeing the 
 assault. It will be all right," said Lord Worthington. 
 
 Lydia's attention was caught by something guilty in 
 his manner. Following a furtive glance of his, she saw 
 in the arena, not far from her, an enclosure about twenty 
 feet square, made with ropes and stakes. It was un- 
 occupied ; and near it were a few chairs, a basin, and 
 a sponge. 
 
 " What is that ? " she asked. 
 
 « That ! Oh, thats the ring." 
 
 " It is not a ring. It is a square." 
 
 " They call it the ring. They have succeeded in 
 squaring the circle." 
 
 A piercing bugle call rang out ; and a troop of cavalry

Chap. X Cashel Byron's Profession 189 
 
 trotted into the arena. Lydia found it pleasant enough 
 to sit lazily admiring the horses and men, and comparing 
 the members of the Olympian Club, who appeared when 
 the soldiers retired, to the marble gods of Athens, and 
 to the Bacchus or David of Michael Angelo. They 
 fell short of the Greek statues in tranquil refinement, and 
 of the Italian in heroic energy as they vaulted over 
 a wooden horse, and swung upon horizontal bars, each 
 cheapening the exploits of his forerunner by outdoing 
 them. Lord Worthington, who soon grew tired of 
 this, whispered that when all that rubbish was over, a 
 fellow would cut a sheep in two with a sword, after 
 which there would be some boxing. 
 
 " Do you mean to say," said Lydia indignantly, " that 
 they are going to turn a sheep loose and hunt it on horse- 
 back with swords ? " 
 
 Lord Worthington laughed and said yes ; but it 
 presently appeared that by a sheep was meant a lean 
 carcass of mutton. A stalwart sergeant cut it in half 
 as a climax to slicing lemons, bars of lead, and silk 
 handkerchiefs ; and the audience, accustomed to see 
 much more disgusting sights in butchers' shops, liberally 
 applauded him. 
 
 Two gentlemen of the Olympian Club now entered 
 the inclosure which Lord Worthington called the ring. 
 After shaking hands with one another as well as their 
 huge padded gloves permitted, they hugged themselves 
 with their right arms as if there were some danger of 
 their stomachs falling out if not held tightly in ; and 
 danced round one another, throwing out and retracting 
 their left fists like pawing horses. They were both, as 
 Lydia learned from the announcement of their names and 
 achievements by the master of the ceremonies, amateur 
 champions. She thought their pawing and dancing 
 ridiculous ; and when they occasionally rushed together

 and scuffled, she could distinguish nothing of the leading 
 off, stopping, ducking, countering, guarding, and getting 
 away to which Lord Worthington enthusiastically invited 
 her attention, and which elicited alternate jeers and 
 applause from the shilling audience below. When, at 
 the expiration of three minutes, the two dropped supine 
 into chairs at opposite corners of the ring as if they had 
 sustained excessive fatigue, she would have laughed out- 
 right if they had not reminded her of Cashel trying to 
 recover himself in her library. At the end of a minute, 
 some one hoarsely cried " Time ! " and they rose and 
 repeated their previous performance for three minutes 
 more. Another minute of rest followed ; and then the 
 dancing and pawing proceeded for four minutes, after 
 which the champions again shook hands and left the 
 arena. 
 
 " And is that all ? " said Lydia. 
 
 "Thats all," said Lord Worthington. "It's the 
 most innocent thing in the world, and the prettiest." 
 
 " It does not strike me as being pretty," said Lydia ; 
 " but it seems as innocent as inanity can make it." Her 
 mind misgave her that she had ignorantly and unjustly 
 reproached Cashel Byron with ferocity merely because he 
 practised this harmless exercise. 
 
 The show progressed through several phases of skilled 
 violence. Besides single combats between men armed in 
 various fashions, there were tilts, tent-peggings, drilling 
 and singlestick practice by squads of British tars, who 
 were loudly cheered, and more boxing and vaulting by 
 members of the club. Lydia's attention soon began to 
 wander from the arena. Looking down at the crowd 
 outside the palisades, she saw a small man whom she 
 vaguely remembered, though his face was turned from 
 her. In conversation with him was a powerful man 
 dressed in a yellow tweed suit and green scarf. He had 
 


## p. (#219) ################################################

Chap. X Cashel Byron's Profession 1 9 1 
 
 a coarse strong voice, and his companion a shrill mean 
 one, so that their remarks could be heard by an attentive 
 listener above the confused noise of the crowed. 
 
 " Do you admire that man ? " said Lord Worthington 
 following Lydia's gaze. ' 
 
 " No. Is he anybody in particular ? " 
 
 " He was a great man once — in the days of the giants. 
 He was champion of England. He has a special interest 
 for us as the teacher of a mutual friend of ours." 
 
 "Please name him," said Lydia, intending that the 
 mutual friend should be named. 
 
 " Ned Skene," said Lord Worthington, taking her to 
 mean the man below. " He has done so well in the 
 colonies that he has indulged himself and his family with 
 a trip to England. His arrival made quite a sensation in 
 this country : last week he had a crowded benefit, at 
 which he sparred with our mutual friend and knocked 
 him about like a baby. Our mutual friend behaved very 
 well on the occasion in letting himself be knocked about. 
 You see he could have killed old Skene if he had tried in 
 earnest." 
 
 " Is that Skene ? " said Lydia, looking at him with 
 an earnest interest that astonished and delighted Lord 
 Worthington. " Ah ! Now I recognize the man with 
 him. He is one of my tenants at the Warren Lodge — I 
 believe I am indebted to you for the introduction." 
 
 " Mellish the trainer ? " said Lord Worthington, looking 
 a little foolish. " So it is. What a lovely bay that lancer 
 has ! — the second from the far end." 
 
 But Lydia would not look at the lancer's horse. 
 " Paradise ! " she heard Skene exclaim just then with 
 scornful incredulity. " Aint it likely ? " It occurred 
 to her that if he was alluding to his own chance of 
 arriving there, it was not likely. 
 
 "Less likely things have happened," said Mellish.

 " I wont say that Cashel Byron is getting stale j but I 
 will say that his luck is too good to last ; and I know for 
 a fact that he's gone quite melancholy of late." 
 
 " Melancholy be blowed ! " said Skene. "What should 
 he go melancholy for ? " 
 
 " Oh, I know," said Mellish reticently. 
 
 "You know a lot," retorted Skene with contempt. 
 " I spose you mean the young 'oman he's always talking 
 to my missus about." 
 
 " I mean a young woman he ,aint likely to get. One 
 of the biggest swells in England — a little un with a face 
 like the inside of a oyster shell, that he met down at 
 Wiltstoken, where I trained him to fight the Flying 
 Dutchman. He went right off his training after he met 
 her — wouldnt do anything I told him. I made so cock 
 sure he'd be licked that I hedged every penny I had laid 
 on him except twenty pound I got a flat to bet agen 
 him down at the fight after I changed my mind. Curse 
 that woman ! I lost a hundred pound by her." 
 
 " And serve you right too, you old stoopid. You was 
 wrong then ; and youre wrong now, with your blessed 
 Paradise ! " 
 
 " Paradise has never been beat yet." 
 
 "No more has my boy." 
 
 "Well, we'll see." 
 
 " We'll see ! I tell you Ive seed for myself. Ive seed 
 Billy Paradise spar ; and it aint boxing : it's ruffianing : 
 thats what it is. Ruffianing ! Why, my old missus 
 has more science." 
 
 "Mebbe she has," said MeUish. "But look at the 
 men he's licked that were chock full of science. Shep- 
 stone, clever as he is, only won a fight from him by 
 claiming a foul, because Billy lost his temper and spiked 
 him. Thats the worst of Billy : he cant keep his 
 feelings in. But no fine-lady sparrer can stand afore

 that ugly rush of his. Do you think he'll care for 
 Cashel's showy long shots ? Not he : he'll just take 
 em on that mahogany nut of his, and give him back 
 one o them smashers that he knocked out Dick Weeks 
 with." 
 
 " I'll lay you any money he dont. If he does, I'll go 
 back into the ring myself, and bust his head off for it." 
 And Skene, very angry, heaped epithets on Paradise 
 until he became so excited that Mellish had to soothe 
 him by partially retracting his forebodings, and asking 
 how Cashel had been of late. 
 
 " He's not been taking care of himself as he oughter," 
 said Skene gloomily. " He's shewing the London 
 fashions to the missus and Fanny : theyre here in the 
 three-and-sixpenny seats, among the swells. Theatres 
 every night ; and walks every day to see the Queen 
 drive through the park, or the like. My Fan likes to 
 have him with her on account of his being such a 
 gentleman : she dont hardly think her own father not 
 good enough to walk down Piccadilly with. Wants me 
 to put on a black coat, and make a parson of myself. 
 The missus just idolizes him. She thinks the boy far 
 too good for the young 'oman you was speaking of, and 
 tells him that she's letting on not to care for him only to 
 raise her price, just as I used to pretend to be getting 
 beat, to set the flats betting agin me. The women 
 always made a pet of him. In Melbourne it wasnt what 
 f liked for dinner : it was always what the boy 'ud like, 
 and when it 'ud please him to have it. I'm blest if I 
 usent to have to put him up to ask for a thing when I 
 wanted it myself. And you tell me that thats the lad 
 thats going to let Billy Paradise lick him, I spose. 
 Walker!" 
 
 Lydia, with Mrs. Byron's charm fresh upon her, 
 wondered what manner of woman this Mrs. Skene 
 


## p. (#222) ################################################

194 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap.x 
 
 could be who had supplanted her in the affections of 
 her son, and yet was no more than a prizefighter's old 
 missus. Evidently she was not one to turn a young 
 man from a career in the ring. The theme of Cashel's 
 occupation and the chances of his quitting it ran away 
 with Lydia's attention. She sat with her eyes fixed on 
 the arena, without seeing the soldiers, swordsmen, or 
 athletes who were busy there. Her mind wandered 
 further and further from the place ; and the chattering 
 of the people resolved itself into a distant hum and was 
 forgotten. 
 
 Suddenly she became conscious of a dreadful looking 
 man coming towards her across the arena. His face had 
 the surface and colour of blue granite : his protruding 
 jaws and retreating forehead were like those of an ouran- 
 outang. She started from her reverie with a shiver, and, 
 recovering her hearing as well as her vision of external 
 things, heard a burst of applause from a few persons 
 below greeting this apparition. The man grinned 
 ferociously ; placed one hand on a stake of the ring ; 
 and vaulted over the ropes. Lydia remarked that, 
 excepting his hideous head and enormous hands and 
 feet, he was a well-made man, with loins and shoulders 
 that shone in the light, and gave him an air of great 
 strength and activity. 
 
 "Aint he a picture?" she heard Mellish exclaim 
 ecstatically. " There's condition for you ! " 
 
 " Ah ! " said Skene disparagingly. " But aint he the 
 gentleman ! Just look at him. It's like the Prince of 
 Wales walking down Pall Mall." 
 
 Lydia looked again, and saw Cashel Byron, exactly as 
 she had seen him for the first time in the elm vista at 
 Wiltstoken, approaching the ring, with the indifferent 
 air of a man going through some tedious public cere- 
 mony.

 " A god coming down to compete with a gladiator," 
 whispered Lord Worthington eagerly. " Isnt it, Miss 
 Carew ? Apollo and the satyr ! You must admit 
 that our mutual friend is a splendid looking fellow. 
 If he could go into society like that, by Jove, the 
 women " 
 
 " Hush," said Lydia, as if his words were intolerable. 
 Cashel did not vault over the ropes. He stepped 
 through them languidly, and, rejecting the proffered 
 assistance of a couple of officious friends, drew on a 
 boxing glove fastidiously, like an exquisite preparing for 
 a fashionable promenade. Having thus muffled his left 
 hand so as to make it useless for the same service to 
 his right, he dipped his fingers into the other glove, 
 gripped it between his teeth, and dragged it on with 
 the action of a tiger tearing its prey. Lydia shuddered 
 again. 
 
 " Bob Mellish," said Skene : " I'll lay you twenty to 
 one he stops that rush that you think so much of. 
 Come : twenty to one ! " 
 
 Mellish shook his head. Then the master of the 
 ceremonies, pointing to the men in succession, shouted, 
 " Paradise : a professor. Cashel Byron : a professor. 
 Time ! " 
 
 Cashel now looked at Paradise, of whose existence he 
 had not before seemed to be aware. The two men 
 advanced towards the centre of the ring ; shook hands 
 at arms length ; cast off each other's ^rasp suddenly ; 
 fell back a step ; and began to move warily round from 
 left to right like a pair of panthers. 
 
 " I think they might learn manners from the gentle- 
 men, and shake hands cordially," said Alice, trying to 
 appear unconcerned, but oppressed by a vague dread of 
 Cashel. 
 
 " Thats the traditional manner," said Lord Worthing-

 ton. " It's done that way to prevent one from pulling 
 the other over, and hitting him writh the disengaged 
 hand before he could get loose." 
 
 " What abominable treachery ! " exclaimed Lydia. 
 
 " It's never done, you know," said Lord Worthington 
 apologetically. " It wouldnt be any good, because you 
 cant use your left hand efFectively that way." 
 
 Lydia turned away from him, and gave all her atten- 
 tion to the boxers. Of the two. Paradise shocked her 
 least. She saw that he was nervous and conscious of a 
 screwed-up condition as to his courage ; but his sly grin 
 implied a wild sort of good humor, and seemed to promise 
 the spectators that he would shew them some fun presently. 
 Cashel watched his movements with a relentless vigilance 
 and a sidelong glance in which, to Lydia's apprehension, 
 there was something infernal. 
 
 Suddenly the eyes of Paradise lit up : he lowered his 
 head ; made a rush ; baulked himself purposely ; and 
 darted at Cashel. There was a sound like the pop of a 
 champagne cork, after which Cashel was seen undis- 
 turbed in the middle of the ring, and Paradise, flung 
 against the ropes and trying to grin at his discomfiture, 
 shewed his white teeth through a mask of blood. 
 
 " Beautiful ! " cried Skene with emotion. " Beautiful ! 
 There aint but me and my boy in the world can give the 
 upper cut like that ! I wish I could see my old missus's 
 face now ! This is nuts to her." 
 
 " Let us go away," said Alice. 
 
 " That was a very different blow to any the gentlemen 
 gave," said Lydia, without heeding her, to Lord Worth- 
 ington. " The man is bleeding horribly." 
 
 " It's only his nose," said Lord Worthington. " He's 
 used to it." 
 
 " Look at that ! " chuckled Skene. " My boy's 
 followed him up to the ropes ; and he means to keep him

 there. Let him rush now if he can. See what it is to 
 have a good judgment ! " 
 
 Mellish shook his head again despondingly. The 
 remaining minutes of the round were unhappy ones for 
 Paradise. He struck viciously at his opponent's ribs ; 
 but Cashel stepped back just out his reach, and then 
 returned with extraordinary swiftness and dealt him 
 blows from which, with the ropes behind him, he had no 
 room to retreat, and which he was too slow to stop or 
 avoid. His attempts to reach his enemy's face were 
 greatly to the disadvantage of his own ; for Cashel's 
 blows were never so tremendous as when he turned his 
 head deftly out of harm's way, and met his advancing 
 foe with a counter hit. There was no chivalry and no 
 mercy in him ; but his grace could not have been 
 surpassed by his mother. He revelled in the hardness 
 of his hitting, and gathered fresh vigor as his gloves' 
 resounded on Paradise's face or seemed to go almost 
 through his body. The better sort among the spectators 
 were disgusted by the sight ; for as Paradise bled 
 profusely, and as his blood smeared the gloves, and the 
 gloves smeared the heads and bodies of both combatants, 
 they were soon stained with it from their waists upward. 
 The managers held a whispered consultation as to 
 whether the sparring exhibition had not better be 
 stopped J but they decided to let it proceed on seeing 
 the African king, who had watched the whole entertain- 
 ment up to the present without displaying the least 
 interest, now raise his han3s and clap them with 
 delight. 
 
 " Billy dont look half pleased with hisself," observed 
 Mellish, as the two boxers sat down for the minute's 
 respite. "He looks just like he did when he spiked 
 Shepstone." 
 
 " What does spiking mean ? " said Lydia.

 "Treading on a man's foot with spiked boots," 
 replied Lord Worthington. " Dont be alarmed ; they 
 have no spikes in their shoes to-day. And dont look at 
 me like that, Miss Carew. It's not my fault that they do 
 such things. 
 
 Time was called ; and the pugilists, who had by dint 
 of sponging been made somewhat cleaner, rose with 
 mecihanical promptitude at the sound. They had hardly 
 advanced two steps, when Cashel, though his adversary 
 seemed far out of his reach, struck him on the forehead 
 with such force as to stagger him, and then jumped back 
 laughing. Paradise rushed forward ; but Cashel eluded 
 him, and fled round the ring, looking back derisively 
 over his shoulder. Paradise now dropped all pretence of 
 good humor. With reckless ferocity he dashed in ; 
 endured a startling blow without flinching ; and fought 
 savagely at close quarters. For a moment the falling of 
 their blows reminded Lydia of the rush of raindrops 
 against a pane in a sudden gust of wind. The next 
 moment Cashel was av^ay ; and Paradise, whose blood 
 was again flowing, was trying to repeat his manoeuvre, to 
 be met this time by a blow that brought him upon one 
 knee. He had scarcely risen when Cashel sprang at him 
 and drove him once more against the ropes with four 
 dazzlingly rapid blows ; but this time, with tigerish 
 coquetry, released him by again rimning away prettily in 
 the manner of a child at play. Paradise, with foam as 
 well as blood at his lips, uttered a howl, and tore off his 
 gloves. There was a shout of protest from the audience.; 
 and Cashel, warned by it, tried to get ofF his gloves in 
 turn. But Paradise was upon him before he could 
 accomplish this ; and the two men laid hold of one 
 another amid a great clamor : Lord Worthington and 
 others rising and excitedly shouting, "Against rules ! No 
 wrestling ! " followed by a roar of indignation as Paradise

 was seen to seize Cashel's shoulder in his teeth as they 
 struggled for the throw. Lydia, for the first time in her 
 life, screamed. Then she saw Cashel, his face fully as 
 fierce as his foe's, get his arm about Paradise's neck ; lift 
 him as a coal-heaver lifts a sack ; and fling him over his 
 back, heels over head, to the ground, where he instantly 
 dropped on him with his utmost weight and impetus. 
 The two were at once separated by a crowd of managers, 
 umpires, policemen and others who had rushed towards 
 the ring when Paradise had taken ofF his gloves. A dis- 
 tracting wrangle followed. Skene had climbed over the 
 palisade, and was hurling oaths, threats, and epithets at 
 Paradise, who, unable to stand without assistance, was 
 trying to lift his leaden eyelids and realize what had 
 happened to him. A dozen others, encouraging him to 
 sit up, remonstrating with him on his conduct, or trying 
 to pacify Skene, only added to the confusion. - Cashel, on 
 the other side, raged at the managers, who were remind- 
 ing him that the rules of glove exhibitions did not allow 
 wrestling and throwing. 
 
 "Rules be damned!" Lydia heard him shouting. 
 
 " He bit me ; and I'll throw him to " Then 
 
 everybody spoke at once ; arid she could only conjecture 
 where he would throw him to. He seemed to have no 
 self-control : Paradise, when he came to himself, behaved 
 better. Lord Worthington descended into the ring, and 
 tried to calm the hubbub ; but Cashel shook his hand 
 fiercely from his arm ; menaced a manager who attempted 
 to call him sternly to order ; frantically pounded his 
 wounded shoulder with his clenched fist ; and so outswore 
 and outwrangled them all that even Skene began to urge 
 that there had been enough fuss made. Then Lord 
 Worthington whispered a word more ; and Cashel 
 suddenly subsided, pale and ashamed, and sat down on a 
 chair in his corner as if to hide himself. Five minutes

 afterwards, he stept out from the crowd with Paradise, 
 and shook hands with him amid much cheering. Cashel 
 was the humbler of the two. He did not raise his eyes 
 to the balcony once ; and he seemed in a hurry to retire. 
 But he was intercepted by an officer in uniform, accom- 
 panied by a black chief, who came to conduct him to the 
 dais and present him to the African King : an honor 
 he was not permitted to decline. 
 
 The king informed him, through an interpreter, that 
 he had been unspeakably gratified by what he had just 
 witnessed, and expressed great surprise that Cashel, not- 
 withstanding his prowess, was neither in the army nor in 
 parliament. He also offered to provide him with three 
 handsome wives if he would come out to Africa in his 
 suite. Cashel was much embarrassed ; but he came off 
 with credit, thanks to the interpreter, who was accustomed 
 to invent appropriate speeches for the king on public 
 occasions, and was kind enough to invent an equally 
 appropriate one for Cashel on this. 
 
 Meanwhile, Lord Worthington returned to his place. 
 " It's all settled now," he said to Lydia. " Bjrron shut 
 up when I told him his aristocratic friends were looking 
 at him ; and Paradise has been so buUied that he is cry- 
 ing in a corner downstairs. He has apologized ; but he 
 still maintains that he can beat our mutual friend without 
 the gloves ; and his backers apparently think so too ; for 
 it is understood that they are to fight in the autumn for 
 a thousand a side." 
 
 " To fight ! Then he has no intention of giving up 
 his profession ? " 
 
 " No ! " said Lord Worthington, astonished. " Why 
 on earth should he give it up ? Paradise's money is as 
 good as in his pocket. You have seen what he can do." 
 
 " I have seen enough. Alice : I am ready to go as 
 soon as you are."

 Miss Carew returned to Wiltstoken next day. Miss 
 GolF remained in London to finish the season in charge 
 of a friendly lady who, having married off all her own 
 daughters, was willing to set to work again to marry Alice 
 sooner than remain idle.

CHAPTER XI 
 
 Alice was more at her ease during the remnant of the 
 season. Though she had been proud of her connexion 
 with Lydia, she had always felt eclipsed in her presence ; 
 and now that Lydia was gone, the pride remained and 
 the sense of inferiority was forgotten. Her freedom em- 
 boldened and improved her. She even began to consider 
 her own judgment a safer guide in the affairs of every- 
 day than the example of her patroness. Had she not 
 been right in declaring Cashel Byron an ignorant and 
 common man when Lydia, in spite of her warning, had 
 actually invited him to visit them ? And now all the 
 newspapers were confirming the opinion she had been 
 trying to impress on Lydia for months past. On the 
 evening of the assault-at-arms, the newsmen had shouted 
 through the streets, "Disgraceful scene between two 
 pugilists at Islington in the presence of the African 
 king." Next day the principal journals commented on 
 the recent attempt to revive the brutal pastime of prize- 
 fighting ; accused the authorities of conniving at it ; and 
 called on them to put it down at once with a strong hand. 
 " Unless," said a Nonconformist organ,' " this plague spot 
 be rooted out from our midst, it will no longer be possible 
 for our missionaries to pretend that England is the fount 
 of the Gospel of Peace." Alice collected these papers, 
 and forwarded them to Wiltstoken.

 On this subject one person at least shared her bias. 
 Whenever she met Lucian Webber, they talked about 
 Cashel, invariably coming to the conclusion that though 
 the oddity of his behavior had gratified liydia's un- 
 fortunate taste for eccentricity, she had never regarded 
 him with serious interest, and would not now, under any 
 circumstances, renew her intercourse with him. Lucian 
 found little solace in these conversations, and generally 
 suffered from a vague sense of meanness after them. Yet 
 next time they met he would drift into discussing Cashel 
 over again ; and he always rewarded Alice for the 
 admirable propriety of her views by dancing at least three 
 times with her when dancing was the business of the 
 evening. The dancing was still less congenial than the 
 conversation. Lucian danced stiffly and unskilfully. 
 Alice, whose muscular power and energy were superior to 
 anything of the kind that Mr. Mellish could artificially 
 produce, longed for swift motion and violent exercise. 
 Waltzing with Lucian was like carrying a stick round 
 the room in the awkward fashion in which Punch carries 
 his baton. In spite of her impression that he was a man 
 of unusually correct morals and high political importance, 
 greatly to be considered in private life because he was 
 Miss Carew's cousin, it was hard to spend quarter-hours 
 with him that were asked for by some of the best dancers 
 in her set. 
 
 She began to tire of the subject of Cashel and Lydia. 
 She began to tire of Lucian's rigidity. She began to 
 tire exceedingly of the vigilance she had to maintain 
 constantly over her own manners and principles. Some- 
 how, this vigilance defeated itself; for she one evening 
 overheard a lady of rank (who meant her to overhear) 
 speak of her as a stuck-up country girl. For a week 
 afterwards she did not utter a word or make a movement 
 in society without first considering whether it could by

 any malicious observer be considered rustic or stuck-up. 
 But the more she strove to attain perfect propriety of 
 demeanor, the more odious did she seem to herself, 
 and, she inferred, to others. She longed for Lydia's 
 secret of always doing the right thing at the right 
 moment, even when defying precedent. Sometimes she 
 blamed the dulness of the people she met. It was 
 impossible not to be stifF with them. When she chatted 
 with an entertaining man, who made her laugh and 
 forget herself for a while, she was conscious afterwards 
 of having been at her best with him. But she saw that 
 those whose manners she most coveted were pleasantly 
 at their ease even in stupid society. She began to fear 
 at last that she was naturally disqualified by her com- 
 paratively humble birth from acquiring the well bred air 
 she envied. 
 
 One day she conceived a doubt whether Lucian was 
 so safe an authority and example in matters of personal 
 deportment as shfe had hitherto believed. He could not 
 dance : his conversation was priggish : it was impossible 
 to feel at ease when speaking to him. Was it courageous 
 to stand in awe of his opinion ? Was it courageous to 
 stand in awe of anybody ? Alice closed her lips proudly 
 and began to feel defiant. Then a reminiscence, which 
 had never before failed to rouse indignation in her, made 
 her laugh. She recalled the scandalous spectacle of the 
 stiff, upright Lucian doubled up in Mrs. Hoskyn's gilded 
 armchair to illustrate the prizefighter's theory of effort 
 defeating itself. After all, what was that caressing touch 
 of Cashel's hand in comparison with the tremendous 
 rataplan he had beaten on the ribs of Paradise ? Could 
 it be true that effort defeated itself — in personal behavior, 
 for instance ? A ray of the truth that underlay Cashel's 
 grotesque experiment was flickering in her mind as she 
 asked herself that question. She thought a good deal

Chap. XI Cashel Byron's Profession 205 
 
 about it ; and one afternoon, when she looked in at four 
 at-homes in succession, she studied the behavior of the 
 other guests from a new point of view, comparing the 
 most mannered with the best mannered, and her recent 
 self with both. The result half convinced her that she 
 had been occupied during her first London season in dis- 
 playing, at great pains, a very unripe self-consciousness — 
 or, as her conscience phrased it, in making an insufferable 
 fool of herself. 
 
 Then came an invitation or two from the further 
 west — South Kensington and Bayswater ; and here she 
 struck the deeper social stratum of the great commercial 
 middle class, with its doctors, lawyers and clergy. She 
 found it all a huge caricature of herself — a society 
 ashamed of itself, afraid to be itself, suspecting other 
 people of being itself and pretending to despise them for 
 it, and so stifling and starving itself that individuals 
 with courage enough to play the piano on Sunday were 
 automatically extruded by the pressure and shot on to a 
 Bohemian debateable land where they amused themselves 
 by trifling with the fine arts. Alice recognized her own 
 class, but did not on that account spare it the ridicule 
 which, from her point of view as one of Miss Carew's 
 superior set, was due to its insipid funereal dancing, 
 its flagrantly studied manners, its ostentation, its voice 
 and accent warped by the strain of incessant pretending, 
 its habitual insolence to servants, its idolatrous deference 
 to rank, its Sabbatarianism, and a dozen other manifesta- 
 tions of what Alice, not feeling in any way concerned to 
 find the root of the matter, summed up as its vulgarity. 
 
 Shortly afterwards, she met Ltician at a dance. He 
 came late, as usual, and gravely asked whether he might 
 have the pleasure of dancing with her. This form of 
 address he never varied. To his surprise, she made 
 some difficulty about granting the favor, and eventually

 offered him " the second extra." He bowed. Just then 
 a young man came up, and, remarking that he thought 
 this was his turn, bore Ahce away. Lucian smiled 
 indulgently, thinking that though Alice's manners were 
 wonderfully good, considering her antecedents, yet she 
 occasionally betrayed a lower tone than that which he 
 sought to exemplify in his own person. 
 
 When his own turn came, and they had gone round 
 the room twice to the strains of the second extra, they 
 stopped — Alice was always willing to rest during a waltz 
 with Lucian ; and he asked her whether she had heard 
 from Lydia. 
 
 "You always ask me that," she replied. "Lydia 
 never writes except when she has something particular 
 to say, and then only a few lines." 
 
 " Precisely, But she might have had something 
 particular to say since we last met." 
 
 " She hasnt had," said Alice, provoked by an almost 
 arch smile from him. 
 
 " She will be glad to hear that I have at last succeeded 
 in recovering possession of the Warren Lodge from its 
 undesirable tenants." 
 
 "I thought they went long ago," said Alice indif- 
 ferently. 
 
 " The men have not been there for a month or more. 
 The difEculty was to get them to remove their property. 
 However, we are rid of them now. The only relic of 
 their occupation is a bible, with half the leaves torn out, 
 and the rest scrawled with records of bets, receipts for 
 sudorific and other medicines, and a mass of unintel- 
 ligible memoranda. One inscription, in faded ink, runs 
 ' To Robert Mellish, from his affectionate mother, with 
 her sincere hope that he may ever walk in the ways of 
 this book.' I am afraid that hope was not fulfilled." 
 
 " How wicked of him to tear a bible ! " said Alice

Chap. XI Cashel Byron's Profession 207 
 
 seriously. Then she laughed, and added, "I know I 
 shouldnt ; but I cant help it." 
 
 " The incident strikes me rather as being pathetic," 
 said Lucian, who liked to shew that he was not deficient 
 in sensibility. " One can picture the innocent faith of 
 the poor woman in her boy's future. If she could only 
 have foreseen ! " 
 
 " Inscriptions in books are like inscriptions on tomb- 
 stones," said Alice disparagingly. "They dont mean 
 much." 
 
 " I am glad that these men have no further excuse for 
 going to Wiltstoken. It was certainly most unfortunate 
 that Lydia should have made the acquaintance of one of 
 them." 
 
 " So you have said at least fifty times," replied Alice 
 deliberately. " I believe you are jealous of that poor 
 boxer." 
 
 Lucian became quite red. Alice trembled at her own 
 audacity, but kept a bold front. 
 
 " Really — it's too absurd," he said, betraying his con- 
 fusion by assuming a carelessness quite foreign to his 
 normal manner. "In what way could I possibly be 
 jealous. Miss Goff?" 
 
 " That is best known to yourself." 
 
 Lucian now saw that there was a change in Alice, and 
 that he had lost ground with her. His wounded vanity, 
 like a corrosive acid, suddenly obliterated his impression 
 that she was, in the main, a well conducted and meritorious 
 young woman. But in its place came another impression 
 that she was a spoiled beauty. And, as he was by no 
 means fondest of the women whose behavior accorded 
 best with his notions of propriety, the change was not 
 in all respects a change for the worse. Only he could 
 not forgive her last remark, though he tried not to let 
 her see how it stung him.

 " I am afraid I should cut a poor figure in an 
 encounter with my rival," he said, smiling. 
 
 " Call him out and shoot him," said Alice vivaciously. 
 " Very likely he does not know howr to use a pistol." 
 
 He smiled again ; but had Alice known how seriously 
 he entertained her suggestion for some moments before 
 dismissing it as impracticable, she might not have offered 
 it. Putting a bullet into Cashel struck him rather as a 
 luxury which he could not afford than as a crime. And 
 now Alice, quite satisfied that this Mr. Webber, on 
 whom she had wasted so much undeserved awe, might 
 be treated as inconsiderately as she used to treat her 
 admirers at Wiltstoken, proceeded to amuse herself by 
 torturing him a little. 
 
 " It is odd," she said, in her best imitation of Lydia's 
 reflective manner, " that a common man like that should 
 be able to make himself so very attractive to Lydia. It 
 was not because he was such a fine man ; for she does 
 not care in the least about that. I dont think she would 
 give a second look at the handsomest man in London, 
 she is so purely intellectual. And yet she used to delight 
 in talking to him." 
 
 " Oh, that is a mistake. Lydia has a certain manner 
 which leads people to believe that she is deeply interested 
 in the parson she happens to be speaking to ; but it is 
 only manner. It means nothing." 
 
 " I know that manner of hers perfectly well. But this 
 was something quite different." 
 
 Lucian shook his head reproachfully. " I cannot jest 
 on so serious a matter," he said, resolving on an attempt 
 to re-establish his dignity with Alice. " I think. Miss 
 Goff, that you perhaps hardly know how absurd your 
 supposition is. There are not many men of distinction 
 in Europe with whom, my cousin is not personally 
 acquainted. A very young girl, who had seen little of

 the world, might possibly be deceived by the exterior 
 of such a man as Byron. A woman accustomed to 
 society could make no such mistake. No doubt the 
 man's vulgarity and uncouth address amused her for a 
 moment ; but " 
 
 " But why did she ask him to come to her Friday 
 afternoons ? " 
 
 " A mere civility which she extended to him because 
 he assisted her in some difficulty she got into in the street." 
 
 " She might as well have asked a policeman to come 
 to see her. I dont believe that was it." 
 
 Lucian at that moment hated Alice. " I am sorry 
 you think such a thing possible," he said. "Shall we 
 resume our waltz ? " 
 
 Alice was not yet able to bear an implication that she 
 did not understand society sufficiently to appreciate the 
 distance between Lydia and Cashel. 
 
 " Of course I know it is impossible," she said, in her 
 old manner. " I did not mean it." 
 
 Lucian, felling to gather from this what she did mean, 
 took refuge in waltzing, in the course of which she 
 advised him to take a dozen lessons from an instructress 
 whom she recommended as specially skilful at getting 
 gentlemen into what she called the smart way of dancing. 
 This sally produced such a chill that at last, fearing lest 
 her new lights had led her too far, she changed her tone 
 and expressed her amazement at the extent and variety 
 of the work he performed in Downing Street. He 
 accepted her compliments with perfect seriousness, 
 leaving her satisfied that they had smoothed him down. 
 But she was mistaken. She knew nothing of politics or 
 official work j and he saw the worthlessness of her pre- 
 tended admiration of his share in them, although he felt 
 it right that she should revere his powers from the 
 depths of her ignorance. What stuck like a burr in his 
 
 p

21 o Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. XI 
 
 mind was that she thought him small enough to be 
 jealous of the poor boxer, and found his dancing deficient 
 in smartness. 
 
 After that dance Alice thought much about Lucian, 
 and also about the way in which society regulated 
 marriages. Before Miss Carew sent for her, she had 
 often sighed because all the nice men she knew of 
 moved in circles to which an obscure governess had no 
 chance of admission. She had met them occasionally 
 at subscription balls ; but for sustained intimacy and 
 proposals of marriage she had been dependent on the 
 native youth of Wiltstoken, whom she looked upon as 
 louts or prigs, and among whom Wallace Parker had 
 shone pre-eminent as a university man, scholar, and 
 gentleman. Now that she was a privileged beauty in 
 a set which would hardly tolerate Wallace Parker, she 
 found that the nice men were younger sons, poor and 
 extravagant, far superior to Lucian Webber as partners 
 for a waltz, but not to be thought of as partners in 
 home-keeping. Alice had experienced the troubles or 
 poverty, and had met with excellence in men only in 
 poems, which she never seriously connected with the 
 possibilities of actual life. She was quite unconscious 
 of the privation caused by living with meanly-minded 
 people : she was acutely conscious of that caused by want 
 of money. Not that she was indifferent to rectitude as 
 she understood it : nothing could have induced her to 
 marry a man, however rich, whom she thought wicked. 
 She wanted money, good character and social position ; 
 but she naturally desired youth arid good looks as well ; 
 and here it was that she found herself unsuited. For not 
 only were all the handsome, gallant, well-bred men 
 getting deeply into debt by living beyond smaller incomes 
 than that with which Wallace Parker had tempted her, 
 but many of those who had inherited both riches and

 rank were as inferior to him in appearance and address 
 as they were in scholarship. No man satisfying all her 
 requirements had yet shewn the least disposition to fall 
 in love with her. 
 
 One bright forenoon in July, Alice, attended by a 
 groom, went to the Park on horseback. The freshness 
 of morning was upon horses and riders : there were not 
 yet any jaded people lolling supine in carriages, nor 
 discontented spectators sitting in chairs to envy them. 
 Alice, who was a better horsewoman than might have 
 been expected from the little practice she had had, looked 
 well in the saddle. She had just indulged in a brisk 
 canter from the Corner to the Serpentine when she saw 
 a large white horse approaching with Wallace Parker on 
 its back. 
 
 " Ah ! " he exclaimed, expertly wheeling his steed and 
 taking ofF his hat at the same time with an intentional 
 display of gallantry and horsemanship. " How are you, 
 Alice ? " 
 
 " Goodness ! " she cried, forgetting her manners in 
 her astonishment. " What brings you here ; and where 
 on earth did you get that horse ? " 
 
 " I presume, Alice," said Parker, satisfied with the 
 impression he had made, " that I am here for much the 
 same reason as you are — to ertjoy the morning in proper 
 style. As for Rozinante, I borrowed him. Is that 
 chestnut yours ? Excuse the rudeness of the question." 
 
 " No," said Alice, coloring a little. " This seems 
 such an unlikely place to meet you." 
 
 " Oh no. I always take a turn in the season. But 
 certainly it would have been a very unlikely place for us 
 to meet a year ago." 
 
 So far, Alice felt, she was getting the worst of the 
 conversation. She changed the subject. " Have you 
 been to Wiltstoken since I last saw you ? " 
 


## p. (#240) ################################################

212 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. XI 
 
 " Yes. I go there once every week at least." 
 
 " Every week ! Janet never told me." 
 
 Parker implied by a cunning air that he thought he 
 knew the reason of that ; but he said nothing. Alice, 
 piqued, would not condescend to make inquiries. So 
 he said, 
 
 " How is Miss Thingumbob ? " 
 
 " I do not know any one of that name." 
 
 "You know very well whbm I mean. Your aristo- 
 cratic patron, Miss Carew." 
 
 Alice flushed. " You are very impertinent, Wallace," 
 she said, grasping her riding whip. " How dare you 
 call Miss Carew my patron ? " 
 
 Wallace suddenly became solemn. " I did not know 
 that you •objected to be reminded of all you owe her," 
 he said. "Janet never speaks ungratefully of her, 
 though she has done nothing for Janet." 
 
 " I have not spoken ungratefully," protested Alice, 
 almost in tears. " I feel sure you are never tired of 
 speaking ill of me to them at home." 
 
 "That shews how little you understand my real 
 character. I always make excuses for you." 
 
 " Excuses for what ? What have I done ? What do 
 you mean ? " 
 
 " Oh, I dont mean anything, if you dont. I thought 
 from your beginning to defend yourself that you felt 
 yourself to be in the wrong." 
 
 " I did not defend myself. Dont dare to say such a 
 thing again, Wallace." 
 
 "Always your obedient humble servant," he replied 
 with complacent irony. 
 
 She pretended not to hear him, and whipped up her 
 horse to a smart trot. The white steed being no trotter, 
 Parker followed at a lumbering canter. Alice, in a 
 shamefaced fear that he was making her ridiculous, soon

 checked her speed ; and the white horse subsided to a 
 walk, marking its paces by deliberate bobs of its 
 unfashionably long mane and tail. 
 
 " I have something to tell you," said Parker at last. 
 
 Alice did not deign to reply. 
 
 " I think it better to let you know at once," he con- 
 tinued. " The feet is, I intend to marry Janet." 
 
 "Janet wont," said Alice promptly. 
 
 Parker smiled conceitedly, and said, " I dont think 
 she will raise any difficulty if you give her to understand 
 that it is all over between us" 
 
 " That what is all over ? " 
 
 "Well, if you prefer it, that there never has been 
 anything between us. Janet believes that we were en- 
 gaged. So did a good many other people until you went 
 into high life." 
 
 " I cannot help what people thought." 
 
 " And they all know that I, at least, was ready to 
 perform my part of the engagement honorably." 
 
 " Wallace," she said, with a sudden change of tone : 
 " I think we had better separate. It is not right for me 
 to be riding about the park with you when I have 
 nobody belonging to me here except a manservant." 
 
 "Just as you please," he said coolly, halting. "May 
 I assure Janet that you wish her to marry me ? " 
 
 " Most certainly not. I do not wish any one to marry 
 you, much less my own sister. I am far inferior to Janet ; 
 and she deserves a much better husband than I do." 
 
 " I quite agree with you, though I dont quite see what 
 that has to do with it. As fer as I understand you, you 
 will neither marry me yourself — mind, I am quite willing 
 to fulfil my engagement still — nor let any one else have 
 me. Is that so ? " 
 
 " You may tell Janet," said Alice vigorously, her face 
 glowing, " that if we — you and I — were condemned to

 live for ever on a desert isl No : I w^ill write to 
 
 her. That will be the best way. Good morning." 
 
 Parker, hitherto unperturbed, shewed signs of alarm. 
 "I beg, Alice," he said, "that you will say nothing 
 unfair to her of me. You cannot with truth say anything 
 bad of me." 
 
 " Do you really care for Janet ? " said Alice, wavering. 
 
 " Of course," he replied indignantly. "Janet is a very 
 superior girl." 
 
 "I have always said so," said Alice, rather angry 
 because some one else had forestalled her in that 
 meritorious admission. "I will tell her the simple 
 truth — that there has never been anything between us 
 except what is between all cousins ; and that there never 
 could have been anything more on my part. I must go 
 now. I dont know what that man must think already." 
 
 " I should be sorry to lower you in his esteem," said 
 Parker maliciously. " Good-bye, Alice." Uttering the 
 last w6rds in a careless tone, he again flourished his hat 
 as he pulled up the white horse's head and sped away. 
 It was not true that he was in the habit of riding in 
 the park every season. He had learnt from Janet that 
 Alice was accustomed to ride there in the forenoon ; 
 and he had hired the white horse in order to meet her 
 on equal terms, feeling that a gentleman on horseback 
 in the road by the Serpentine could be at no social dis- 
 advantage with any lady, however exalted her associates. 
 
 As for Alice, his reminder that Miss Carew was her 
 patron rankled in her. The necessity for securing an 
 independent position seemed to press imminently upon her. 
 And as the sole way of achieving this was by marriage, 
 she almost made up her mind to marry any man, what- 
 ever his person, age, or disposition, if only he could give 
 her a place equal to that of Miss Carew in the little world 
 of which she had lately acquired the manners and customs.

CHAPTER XII 
 
 When the autumn set in, Alice was in Scotland, learning 
 to shoot ; and Lydia was at Wiltstoken, preparing her 
 father's letters and memoirs for publication. She did not 
 write at the castle. All the rooms there were either 
 domed, vaulted, gilded, galleried, three sided, six sided, 
 anything except four sided: all in some way suggestive of 
 the Arabian nights' entertainments and out of keeping 
 with the associations of her father's life. In her search 
 for a congruous room to work in, the idea of causing a 
 pavilion to be erected in the elm vista recurred to her. But 
 she had no mind to be disturbed just then by workmen ; 
 so she had the Warren Lodge cleansed and limewashed, 
 and the kitchen transformed into a comfortable library, 
 whence, as she sat facing the door at her writing table in 
 the centre of the room, she could see the elm vista 
 through one window, and through another a tract of 
 wood and meadow intersected by the high-road and by a 
 canal, beyond which the prospect ended in a distant green 
 slope used as a sheep run. The other apartments ' were 
 used by a couple of maidservants, who kept the place 
 swept and dusted, and prepared Miss Carew's lunch, 
 besides answering her bell and going on her errands to 
 the castle. Failing any of these employments, they sat 
 outside in the sun, reading novels. 
 
 When Lydia had worked in this retreat daily for two

 months, her mind became so full of the old life with 
 her father, that the interruptions of the servants became 
 so many shocks recalling her to thd present. On the 
 twelfth of August, Phcebe, one of the maids, entered and 
 said, 
 
 " If you please, Miss, Bashful is wishville to know can 
 he speak to you a moment ? " 
 
 Permission given, the footman entered. Since his 
 wrestle with Cashel he had never quite recovered his 
 former imperturbability. His manner and speech were 
 as smooth and respectful as before ; but his countenance 
 was no longer stedfast : he was on bad terms with the 
 butler because he had been reproved by him for blushing. 
 On this occasion he came to beg leave to absent himself 
 during the afternoon. He seldom asked favors of this 
 kind, and was never refused. 
 
 " There are more people • than usual in the road 
 to-day," she observed, as he thanked her. "Do you 
 know why ? " 
 
 " No, madam," said Bashville, and blushed. 
 
 " People begin to shoot on the twelfth," she said ; 
 " but I suppose it cannot have anything to do with that. 
 Is there a race, or a fair, or any such thing in the 
 neighborhood ? " 
 
 " Not that I am aware of, madam." 
 
 Lydia dipped her pen in the ink and thought no more 
 of the matter. Bashville returned to the castle, and 
 attired himself like a country gentleman of sporting tastes 
 before going out to enjoy his holiday. 
 
 The forenoon passed away quietly. There was no 
 sound in the Warren Lodge except the scratching ot 
 Lydia's pen, the ticking of her favorite skeleton clock, 
 an occasional clatter of crockery from the kitchen, and 
 the voices of the birds and maids without. As the hour 
 for lunch approached, Lydia became a little restless.

 She interrupted her work to look at the dock, and 
 brushed a speck of dust from her blotter with the feather of 
 her quill. Then she looked absently through the window 
 along the elm vista, where she had once seen, as she had 
 thought, a sylvan god. This time she saw a less romantic 
 object : a policeman. She looked again incredulously : 
 there he was still, a black-bearded helmeted man, making 
 a dark blot in the green perspective, and surveying the 
 landscape cautiously. Lydia summoned Phoebe, and bade 
 her ask the man what he wanted. 
 
 The girl soon returned out of breath, with the news 
 that there were a dozen more constables hiding among the 
 elms, and that the one she had spoken to had given no 
 account of himself, but had asked her how many gates 
 there were to the park ; whether they were always locked ; 
 and whether she had seen many people about. She felt 
 sure that a murder had been committed somewhere. 
 Lydia shrugged her shoulders, and ordered luncheon, 
 during which Phoebe gazed eagerly through the window, 
 and left her mistress to wait on herself. 
 
 " Phoebe," said Lydia, when the dishes were removed : 
 " you may go to the gate lodge, and ask them there what 
 the policemen want. But do not go any further. Stay. 
 Has Ellen gone to the castle with the things ? " 
 
 Phcebe reluctantly admitted that Ellen had. 
 
 " Well, you need not wait for her to return ; but come 
 back as quickly as you can, in case I should want 
 anybody." 
 
 " Directly, miss," said Phoebe, vanishing. 
 
 Lydia, left alone, resumed her work leisurely, occa- 
 sionally pausing to gaze at the distant woodland, and 
 note with transient curiosity a flock of sheep on the 
 slope, or a flight of birds above the tree tops. Something 
 more startling occurred presently. A man, apparently 
 half naked, and carrying a black object under his arm.

 darted through a remote glade with the swiftness of a 
 stag, and disappeared. Lydia concluded that he had 
 been disturbed whilst bathing in the canal, and had taken 
 to flight with his wardrobe under his arm. She laughed 
 at the idea ; turned to her manuscript again ; and wrote 
 on. Suddenly . there was a rustle and a swift footstep 
 without. Then the latch was violently jerked up ; and 
 Cashel Byron rushed in as far as the threshold, where he 
 halted, stupefied at the presence of Lydia and the change 
 in the appearance of the room. 
 
 He was himself remarkably changed. He was dressed 
 in a pea-jacket, which evidently did not belong to him ; 
 for it hardly reached his middle, and the sleeves were so 
 short that his forearms were half bare, shewing that he 
 wore nothing beneath this borrowed garment. He had 
 on white knee-breeches, soiled with clay and green stains 
 of bruised grass. The breeches were made with a broad 
 flap in front, under which, and passing round his waist, 
 was a scarf of crimson silk. From his knees to his 
 socks, the edges of which had fallen over his laced boots, 
 his legs were visible, naked and muscular. On his face 
 was a mask of sweat, dust, and blood, partly sponged 
 away in black-bordered streaks. Underneath his left eye 
 was a mound of blueish flesh nearly as large as a walnut. 
 The jaw below it, and the opposite cheek, were severely 
 bruised ; and his lip was cut through at one corner. He 
 had no hat ; his close-cropped hair was disordered ; and 
 his ears were as though they had been rubbed with coarse 
 sand-paper. 
 
 Lydia looked at him for some seconds, and he at her, 
 speechless. Then she tried to speak ; failed ; and sank 
 into the chair. 
 
 " I didnt know there was any one here," he said, in a 
 hoarse, panting whisper. " The police are after me. I 
 have fought for an hour, and run > over a mile ; and

Chap. XII Cashel Byron's Profession 2 1 9 
 
 I'm dead beat : I can go no further. Let me hide in 
 the back room ; and tell them you havent seen any one, 
 will you ? " 
 
 " What have you done ? " she said, conquering her 
 weakness with an effort^ and standing up. 
 
 "Nothing," he replied, groaning occasionally as he 
 recovered breath. " Business : thats all." 
 
 " Why are the police pursuing you ? Why are you in 
 such a dreadful condition ? " 
 
 Cashel seemed alarmed at this. There was a mirror 
 in the lid of a paper-case on the table. He took it up, 
 and looked at himself anxiously, but was at once relieved 
 by what he saw. " I'm all right," he said. " I'm not 
 marked. That mouse " — he pointed gaily to the lump 
 under his eye — " will run away to-morrow. I am pretty 
 tidy, considering. But it's bellows to mend with me at 
 present. Whoosh ! My heart's as big as a bullock's, 
 after that run." 
 
 "You ask me to shelter you," said Lydia sternly. 
 " What have you done ? Have you committed murder ? " 
 
 " No ! " exclaimed Cashel, trying to open his eyes 
 widely in his astonishment, but only succeeding with 
 one, as the other was gradually closing. " I tell you 
 Ive been fighting ; and it's illegal. You dont want to 
 see me in prison, do you ? Confound him ! " he added, 
 reverting to her question with sudden wrath : " a steam- 
 hammer wouldnt kill him. You might as well hit a sack 
 of nails. . And all my money, my time, my training, and 
 my day's trouble gone for nothing ! It's enough to make 
 a man cry." 
 
 " Go," said Lydia, with uncontrollable disgust. " And 
 do not let me see which way you go. How dare you 
 come to me ? " 
 
 The sponge marks on Cashel's face grew whiter; and 
 he began to pant heavily again. " Very well," he said. 
 


## p. (#248) ################################################

220 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. Xii 
 
 " I'll go. There isnt a boy in your stables would give , 
 me up like that." 
 
 As he spoke, he opened the door ; but he involuntarily 
 shut it again immediately. Lydia looked through the 
 window, and saw a crowd of men, police and others, 
 hurrying along the elm vista. Cashel cast a glance 
 round, half piteous, half desperate, like a hunted animal. 
 Lydia could not resist it. " Quick ! " she cried, opening 
 one of the inner doors. "Go in there, and keep quiet — 
 if you can." And, as he sulkily hesitated a moment, she 
 stamped vehemently. He slunk in ; and she, having 
 shut the door, resumed her place at the writing table : 
 her heart beating with a kind of excitement she had not 
 felt since, in her early childhood, she had kept guilty 
 secrets from her nurse. 
 
 There was a tramping without, and a sound of voices. 
 Then two peremptory raps at the door. 
 
 "Come in," said Lydia, more composedly than she 
 knew. But the asked permission was not waited for. 
 Before she ceased speaking, a policeman opened the door, 
 and looked quickly round the room. He was taken 
 aback by what he saw, and finally touched his helmet 
 tp signify respect for Lydia. As he opened his mouth to 
 speak, Phoebe, flushed with running, pushed past him ; put 
 her hand on the door ; and pertly asked what he wanted. 
 
 "Come away from the door, Phoebe," said Lydia. 
 " Wait here with me until I give you leave to go," she 
 added, as the girl moved towards the inner door. 
 " Now," she said, turning courteously to the policeman, 
 " what is the matter ? " 
 
 "I ask your pardon, mum," said the constable 
 agreeably. " Did you happen to see any one pass here- 
 abouts lately ? " 
 
 " Do you mean a man only partly dressed, and carry- 
 ing a black coat ? " said Lydia. 
 


## p. (#249) ################################################

Chap. XII Cashel Byron's Profession 221 
 
 "Thats him, miss," said the policeman^ greatly 
 interested. " Which way did he go ? " 
 
 "I will shew you where I saw him," said Lydia, 
 rising and going to the door, outside which she found a 
 crowd of rustics around five policemen, who held in custody 
 two men, one of whom was Mellish (without a coat), 
 and the other a hook-nosed man whose like Lydia had 
 seen often on racecourses. She pointed out the glade 
 across which she had seen Cashel run, and felt as if the 
 guilt of the deception was wrenching some fibre in her 
 heart from its natural order. But she spoke with 
 apparent self-possession ; and no shade of suspicion fell 
 on the minds of the police. 
 
 Several peasants now came forward, each professing 
 to know exactly whither Cashel had been making when 
 he crossed the glade. Whilst they were arguing, many 
 persons, resembling the hooknosed captive in general 
 appearance, sneaked into the crowd and regarded the 
 police with furtive hostility. Soon after, a second 
 detachment of police came up, with another prisoner 
 and another crowd ; Bashville among them. 
 
 " Better go in, mum," said the policeman who had 
 spoken to Lydia first. " We must keep together, being 
 so few ; and he aint fit for you to look at." 
 
 But Lydia had looked already, and had guessed that 
 the last prisoner was Paradise, although his countenance 
 was damaged beyond recognition. His costume was 
 Hke that of Cashel, except that his girdle was a blue 
 handkerchief with white spots, and his shoulders were 
 wrapped in an old horsecloth, through the folds of which 
 his naked ribs could be seen, tinged with every hue a 
 bad bruise can assume. As to his face, a crease and a 
 hole amid a cluster of lumps of raw flesh indicated the 
 presence of an eye and a mouth : the rest of his features 
 were indiscernible. He could still see a little ; for he

 moved his puiFed and lacerated hand to arrange his 
 blanket, and demanded hoarsely, and with greatly im- 
 peded articulation, whether the lady would stand a drain 
 to a poor fighting man what had done his best for his 
 backers. On this some one produced a flask ; and 
 Mellish volunteered, provided he were released for a 
 moment, to get the contents down Paradise's throat. 
 As soon as the brandy had passed his swollen lips, he 
 made a few preliminary sounds, and then shouted, 
 
 " He sent for the coppers because he couldnt stand 
 another round. I am ready to go on." 
 
 The policemen bade him hold his tongue, and closed 
 round him, hiding him from Lydia, who, without shew- 
 ing the mingled pity and loathing with which his condi- 
 tion inspired her, told them to bring him to the castle, 
 and have him attended to there. She added that the 
 whole party could obtain refreshment at the same time. 
 The sergeant, who was very tired and thirsty, wavered 
 in his resolution to continue the pursuit. Lydia, as 
 usual, treated the matter as settled. 
 
 (" I " Bashville," she said : " will you please shew them 
 the way, and see that they are satisfied." 
 
 " Some thief has stole my coat," said Mellish sullenly 
 to Bashville. "If youll lend me one, governor, and 
 these blessed policemen will be so kind as not to tear it 
 ofF hiy back, I'll send it down to you in a day or two. 
 I'm a respectable man, and have been her ladyship's 
 tenant here." 
 
 " Your pal wants it worse than you," said the sergeant. 
 " If there was an old coachman's cape or anything to 
 put over him, I would see it returned safe. I dont want 
 to bring him round the country in a blanket, like a wild 
 Injin." 
 
 " I have a cloak inside," said Bashville. " I'll get it 
 for you." And before Lydia could devize a pretext for

 stopping him, he disappeared, and she heard him entering 
 the lodge by the back door. It seemed to her that a 
 silence fell on them all, as if her deceit was already 
 discovered. Mellish, who had been waiting for an 
 opportunity to protest against the last remark of the 
 policeman, said angrily, 
 
 " Who are you calling my pal ? I hope I may be 
 struck dead for a liar if ever I set eyes on him in my 
 life before." 
 
 Lydia looked at him as a martyr might look at a 
 wretch to whom she was to be chained. He was doing 
 as she had done — lying. Then Bashville, having passed 
 through the other rooms, came into the library by the 
 inner door, with an old livery cloak on his arm. 
 
 " Put that on him," he said ; " and come along to the 
 castle with me. You can see the roads for five miles 
 round from the south tower, and recognize every man on 
 them through the big telescope. By your leave, madam, 
 I think Phoebe had better come with us to help." 
 
 " Certainly," said Lydia, looking quietly at him. 
 
 "I'll get clothes at the castle for the man that wants 
 them," he added, trying to return her gaze, but failing 
 with a blush. " Now boys. Come along." 
 
 " I thank your ladyship," said the sergeant. " We 
 have-had a hard morning of it ; and we can do no more 
 at present than drink your health." He touched his 
 helmet again ; and Lydia bowed to him. " Keep close 
 together, men," he said, as the -crowd moved off with 
 Bashville. 
 
 " Ah," sneered Mellish : " keep close together, like 
 the geese do. Things has come to a pretty pass when a 
 Englishman is run in for stopping when he sees a crowd." 
 
 " All right," said the sergeant. " I have that bundle 
 of colored handkerchiefs you were selling ; and I'll find 
 the other man before youre a day older. It's a pity, 
 


## p. (#252) ################################################

 seeing how youve behaved so well and havent resisted 
 us, that you dont happen to know where those ropes and 
 stakes are hid. I might have a good word at the sessions 
 for any one that would put me in the way of finding 
 them." 
 
 " Ropes and stakes ! Fiddlesticks and grandmothers ! 
 There werent no ropes and no stakes. It was only a 
 turn-up : that is, if there was any fighting at all. / 
 didnt see none ; but I spose you did. But then youre 
 clever ; and I'm not." 
 
 By this time the last straggler of the party had dis- 
 appeared from Lydia, who had watched their retreat from 
 the door of the Warren Lodge. When she turned to go 
 in she saw Cashel cautiously entering from the room in 
 which he had lain concealed. His excitement had passed 
 off: he looked cold and anxious, as if a reaction were 
 setting in. 
 
 " Are they^ all gone ? " he said. " That servant of 
 yours is a good sort. He has promised to bring me 
 
 some clothes. As for you, youre better than 
 
 Whats the matter ? Where are you going to ? " 
 
 Lydia had put on her hat, and was swiftly wrapping 
 herself in a shawl. Wreaths of rosy colour were chasing 
 each other through her cheeks ; and her eyes and nostrils, 
 usually so tranquil, were dilated. 
 
 " Wont you speak to me ? " he said irresolutely. 
 
 "Just this," she replied, with passion. "Let me 
 never see you again. The very foundations of my Hfe 
 are loosened : I have told a lie. I have made my 
 servant — an honorable man — my accomplice in a lie. 
 We are worse than you ; for even your wild -beast's 
 handiwork is a less evil than the bringing of a falsehood 
 into the world. This is what has come to me out of our 
 acquaintance. I have given you a hiding-place. Keep 
 it. I will never enter it again." 
 


## p. (#253) ################################################

Chap. XII Cashel Byron's Profession 225 
 
 Cashel, appalled, shrank back like a child which, 
 trying to steal sweetmeats from a high shelf, pulls the 
 whole cupboard down about its ears. He neither spoke 
 nor stirred as she left the Lodge. 
 
 At the castle she went to her boudoir, where she found 
 her maid the French lady, from whose indignant descrip- 
 tion of the proceedings below she gathered that the 
 policemen were being regaled with bread and cheese, beef 
 and beer ; and that the attendance of a surgeon had been 
 dispensed with. Paradise's wounds having been dressed 
 skilfully by Mellish. Lydia bade her send Bashville to 
 the Warren Lodge to see whether any strangers were 
 still loitering about it ; and ordered that none of the 
 female servants should return there until he came back. 
 Then she sat down, and tried not to think. But as she 
 could not help thinking, she submitted, and tried to 
 think the late catastrophe out. An idea that she had 
 disjointed the whole framework of things by creating a 
 false belief, filled her imagination. The one conviction 
 she had brought out of her reading was that the conceal- 
 ment of a truth, with its resultant false beliefs, must 
 produce mischief, even though the beginning of that 
 mischief might be as inconceivable as the end. She 
 made no distinction between the subtlest philosophical 
 sophism and the vulgarest lie. The evil of Cashel's 
 capture was measurable, the evil of any lie beyond all 
 measure. She felt none the less assured of that evil 
 because she could not foresee one bad consequence likely 
 to ensue from what she had done. Her misgivings 
 pressed heavily upon her ; for her father, a determined 
 sceptic, had left her destitute of the consolations which 
 theology has for the wrongdoer. It was plainly her 
 duty to send for the policeman and clear up the deception 
 she had practised on him. But this she could not do. 
 Her will, in spite of her reason, acted in the opposite

 direction. And in this paralysis of her moral power she 
 saw the evil of the lie beginning. She had given it 
 birth ; and Nature would not permit her to strangle the 
 monster. 
 
 At last her maid returned and informed her that the 
 canaille had gone away. When she was again alone, she 
 rose, and walked slowly to and fro through the room, 
 forgetting the lapse of time in the restless activity of 
 her mind, until she was again interrupted, this time 
 by Bashville. 
 
 "Well?" 
 
 He was daunted by her tone ; for he had never before 
 heard her speak haughtily to a servant. He did not 
 understand that he had changed subjectively, and was 
 now her accomplice. 
 
 " He's given himself up." 
 
 " What do you mean ? " she said, with sudden dismay. 
 
 " Byron, madam. I brought some clothes to the 
 Lodge for him ; but when I got there he was gone. I 
 went round to the gates in search of him, and found him 
 in the hands of the police. They told me he'd just 
 given himself up. He wouldnt give any account of him- 
 self; and he looked — well, sullen and beaten-down like." 
 
 " What will they do with him ? " she asked, turning 
 quite pale. 
 
 " A man got six weeks hard labor last month for the 
 same offence. Most likely thats what he'll get. , And 
 very little -for what he's done, as youd say if you saw him 
 doing it, madam." 
 
 " Then," said Lydia sternly, " it was to see this " — she . 
 shrank from naming it — " this fight, that you asked my 
 permission to go out ! " 
 
 "Yes, madam, it was," said Bashville, with some 
 bitterness. "I recognized Lord Worthington and plenty 
 more noblemen and gentlemen there." 
 


## p. (#255) ################################################

Chap. XII Cashel Byron's Profession 227 
 
 Lydia was about to reply sharply ; but she checked 
 herself; and her usual tranquil manner came back as 
 she said, " That is no reason why you should have been 
 there." 
 
 Bashville's color began to waver, and his voice to need 
 increased control. " It's in human nature to go to such 
 a thing once," he said ; " but once is enough, at least for 
 me. YouU excuse my mentioning it, madam ; but what 
 with Lord Worthington and the rest of Byron's backers 
 screaming oaths and abuse at thfe other man ; and the 
 opposite party doing the same to Byron — well, I may not 
 be a gentleman ; but I hope I can conduct myself like a 
 man, even when I'm losing money." 
 
 "Then do not go to such an exhibition again, 
 Bashville. I must not dictate your amusements ; but I 
 do not think you are likely to benefit yourself by copying 
 Lord Worthington's tastes." 
 
 " I copy no lord's tastes," said Bashville, reddening. 
 "You hid the man that was fighting. Miss Carew. 
 Why do you look down on the man that was only a 
 bystander ? " 
 
 Lydia's color rose too. Her first impulse was to treat 
 this outburst as rebellion against her authority, and crush 
 it. But her vigilant sense of justice withheld her. "He 
 was a fugitive who took refuge in our house, Bashville. 
 You did not betray him." 
 
 " No," said Bashville, his expression subdued to one of 
 rueful pride. " When I am beaten by a better man, I 
 have courage enough to get out of his way and take no 
 mean advantage of him." 
 
 Lydia, not understanding, looked inquiringly at him. 
 He made a gesture as if throwing something from him, 
 and continued recklessly, 
 
 "But one way I'm as good as he, and better. A 
 foptman is held more respectable than a prizefighter.

 He's told you that he's in love with you ; and if it is to 
 be my last word, I'll tell you that the ribbon round your 
 neck is more to me than your whole body and soul is to 
 ihim or his like. When he took an unfair advantage of 
 me, and pretended to be a gentleman, I told Mr. Lucian 
 of him, and shewed him up for what he was. But when 
 I found him to-day hiding in the pantry at the Lodge, I 
 took no advantage of him, though I knew well that if 
 he'd been no more to you than any other man of his 
 sort, youd never have hid him. You know best why he 
 gave himself up to the police after your seeing his day's 
 work. But I will leave him to his luck. He is the best 
 man : let the best man win. I am sorry," added Bash- 
 ville, recovering his ordinary suave manner with an 
 effort, " to inconvenience you by a short notice ; but 
 I should take it as a particular favor if I might go this 
 evening." 
 
 " You had better," said Lydia, rising quite calmly, and 
 
 keeping resolutely away from her the strange emotional 
 
 effect of being astonished, outraged, and loved at one 
 
 unlooked-for stroke. "It is not advisable that you 
 
 . should stay after what you have just " 
 
 "I knew that when I said it," interposed Bashville 
 hastily and doggedly. 
 
 " In going away you will be taking precisely the • 
 course that would be adopted by any gentleman who 
 had spoken to the same effect. I am not offended by 
 your declaration : I recognize your right to make it. If 
 you need my testimony to further your future arrange- 
 ments, I shall always be happy to say that I believe you 
 to be a man of honor." 
 
 Bashville bowed, and said in a low voice, very 
 nervously, that he had no intention of going into service 
 again, but that he should always be proud of her good 
 opinion.

 "You are fitted for better things," she said. "If you 
 embark in any enterprise requiring larger means than 
 you possess, I will be your surety. I thank you for your' 
 invariable courtesy to me in the discharge of your duties. 
 Good-bye." 
 
 She bowed to him and left the room. Awestruck, he 
 returned her salutation as best he could, and stood motion- 
 less after she disappeared : his mind advancing on tiptoe 
 to grasp what had just passed. His chief sensation was 
 one of relief. He no longer dared to fancy himself in 
 love with such a woman. Her sudden consideration 
 for him as a suitor overwhelmed him with a sense of his 
 unfitness for such a part. He saw himself as a very 
 young, very humble, and very ignorant man, whose head 
 had been turned by a, pleasant place and a kind mistress. 
 He stole away to pack his trunk, and to consider how 
 best to account to his fellow-servants for his sudden 
 departure.

CHAPTER XIII 
 
 One afternoon, Lydia, returning from her daily constitu- 
 tional walk, descried a strange woman on the castle terrace, 
 in conversation with the butler. Though it was warm 
 autumn weather, this person wore a black silk mantle 
 trimmed with fur, and heavily decorated with spurious 
 jet beads. As the female Wiltstokeners always ap- 
 proached Miss Carew in their best raiment, whether it 
 suited the season or not, she concluded that she was 
 about to be asked for a subscription to a school treat, a 
 temperance festival, or perhaps a testimonial to one of the 
 Wiltstoken curates. 
 
 When she came nearer, she saw that the stranger was 
 an elderly lady — or possibly not a lady — with crimped 
 hair, and ringlets hanging at each ear in a long-forgotten 
 feshion. 
 
 " Here is Miss Carew," said the butler shortly, as if 
 the old lady had tried his temper. " You had better talk 
 to her yourself." 
 
 At this she seemed fluttered, and made a solemn 
 curtsy. Lydia, noticing the curtsy and the curls, guessed 
 that her visitor kept a dancing academy. Yet a certain 
 contradictory hardihood in her frame and bearing sug- 
 gested that perhaps she kept a tavern. However, as her 
 face was, on the whole, an anxious and a good face, and 
 her attitude towards the lady of the castle one of embarrassed 
 


## p. (#259) ################################################

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 231 
 
 humility, Lydia acknowledged her salutation kindly, and 
 waited for her to speak. 
 
 "I hope you wont consider it a liberty," said the 
 stranger tremulously. " I'm Mrs. Skene." 
 
 Lydia became ominously grave ; and Mrs. Skene 
 reddened a little. Then she continued, as if repeating 
 a carefully prepared and rehearsed speech, "It would 
 be esteemed a favor if I might have the honor of a few 
 words in private." 
 
 Lydia looked and felt somewhat stern ; but it was not 
 in her nature to rebuff any one without strong provoca- 
 tion. She invited her visitor to enter, and led the way 
 to the circular drawing-room, the strange decorations 
 of which exactly accorded with Mrs. Skene's ideas of 
 aristocratic splendor. As a professor of deportment 
 and etiquette, the ex-champion's wife was nervous under 
 the observation of such an expert as Lydia ; but she rose 
 to the occasion and got safely seated without a mistake. 
 For, although entering a room seems a simple matter to 
 many persons, it was to Mrs. Skene an operation governed 
 by the strict laws of the art she professed — one so elaborate, 
 indeed, that few of her pupils mastered it satisfactorily in 
 less than half-a-dozen lessons. Mrs. Skene soon dis- 
 missed it from her mind. She was too old to dwell upon 
 such vanities when real anxieties were pressing upon her. 
 
 " Oh, miss," she began appealingly, " the boy ! " 
 
 Lydia knew at once who was meant. But she re- 
 peated, as if at a loss, " The boy ? " And immediately 
 accused herself of insincerity. 
 
 " Our boy, maam. Cashel." ' 
 
 " Mrs. Skene ! " said Lydia, reproachfully. 
 
 Mrs. Skene understood all that Lydia's tone implied. 
 " I know, maam," she pleaded. " I know well. But 
 what could I do but come to you ? Whatever you said 
 to him, it has gone to his heart ; and he's dying."

 " Pardon me," said Lydia promptly : " men do not 
 die of such things ; and Mr. Cashel Byron is not so 
 deficient either in robustness of body or hardness of 
 heart as to be an exception to that rule." 
 
 "Yes, miss," said Mrs. Skene sadly. "You are 
 thinking of the profession. You cant believe he has 
 any feelings because he fights. Ah, Miss, if you only 
 knew them as I do ! More tender hearted men dont 
 breathe. Cashel is like a young child, his feelings are 
 that easily touched ; and I have know^n stronger than he 
 to die of broken hearts only because they w^ere unlucky 
 in their calling. Just think what a high-spirited young 
 man must feel when a lady calls him a wild beast. That 
 was a cruel word, miss : it was indeed." 
 
 Lydia was so disconcerted by this attack that she had 
 to collect herself carefully before replying. Then she 
 said, " Are you aware, Mrs. Skene, that my knowledge 
 of Mr. Byron is very slight — that I have not seen him 
 ten times in my life ? Perhaps you do not know the 
 circumstances in which we last met. I was greatly 
 shocked by the injuries he had inflicted on another 
 man ; and I believe I spoke of them as the work 
 of a wild beast. For your sake, I am sorry I said so ; 
 for he has told me that he regards you as his mother : 
 
 but "' 
 
 " Oh no ! Far from it, miss. I ask your pardon a 
 thousand times for taking the word out of your mouth ; 
 but me and Ned is no more to him than your house- 
 keeper or governess might be to you. Thats what I'm 
 afraid you dont understand, miss. He's no relation of 
 ours. I do assure you that he's a gentleman born and 
 bred ; and when we go back to Melbourne next Christmas, 
 it will be just the same as if he had never known us." 
 
 " I hope he will not be so ungrateful as to forget you. 
 He has told me his history." 
 


## p. (#261) ################################################

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 233 
 
 " Thats more than he ever told me, miss ; so you may 
 judge how much he thinks of you." 
 
 Another pause followed this. Mrs. Skene felt that the 
 first round was over, and that she had held her own 
 with a little to spare. But Lydia soon rallied. 
 
 " Mrs. Skene," she said, penetratingly : " when you 
 came to pay me this visit, what object did you propose 
 to yourself ? What do you expect me to do ? " 
 
 " Well, maam," said Mrs. Skene, troubled, " the poor 
 lad has had crosses lately. There was the disappointment 
 about you — the first one, I mean — that had been preying 
 on his mind for a long time. Then there was that 
 exhibition spar at the Agricultural Hall, when' Paradise 
 acted so dishonorable. Cashel heard that you were 
 looking on ; and then he read the shameful way the 
 newspapers wrote of him ; and he thought youd believe 
 it all. I couldnt get that thought out of his head. I 
 said to him, over and ovel- again^ — — " 
 
 "Excuse me," said Lydia, interrupting. "We had 
 better be frank with one another. It is useless to 
 assume that he mistook my feeling on that subject. I 
 was shocked by the severity with which he treated his 
 opponent." 
 
 " But bless you, thats his business," said Mrs. Skene, 
 opening her eyes widely. " I put it to you, miss," she 
 continued, as if mildly reprobating some want of principle 
 on Lydia's part, " whether an honest man shouldnt fulfil 
 his engagements. I assure you that the pay a respectable 
 professional usually gets for a spar like that is half a guinea ; 
 and that was all Paradise got. But Cashel stood on his 
 reputation, and wouldnt take less than ten guineas ; and 
 he got it too. Now many another in his position would 
 have gone into the ring, and fooled away the time pre- 
 tending to box, and just swindling those that paid him. 
 But Cashel is as honest and highminded as a king. You

 saw for yourself the trouble he took. He couldnt have 
 spared himself less if he had been fighting for a thousand a 
 side and the belt, instead of for a paltry ten guineas. Surely 
 you dont think the worse of him for his honesty, miss ? " 
 
 " I confess," said Lydia, laughing in spite of herself, 
 " that your view of the transaction did not occur to me." 
 
 " Of course not, maam : no more it wouldnt to 
 any one, without they were accustomed to know the 
 right and wrong of the profession. Well, as I was 
 saying, miss, that was a fresh disappointment to him. 
 It worrited him more than you can imagine. Then 
 came a deal of bother about the match with Paradise. 
 First Paradise could only get five hundred pounds ; and 
 the boy wouldnt agree for less than a thousand. I think 
 it's on your account that he's been so particular about 
 the money of late ; for he was never covetious before. 
 Then Mellish was bent on its coming off down hereabouts ; 
 and the poor lad was so mortal afraid of its getting to 
 your ears that he wouldnt consent until they persuaded 
 hiih you would be in foreign parts in August. Glad I 
 was when the articles were signed at last, before he was 
 worrited into his grave. All the time he was training 
 he was longing for a sight of you ; but he went through 
 with it as steady and faithful as a man could. And he 
 trained beautiful. I saw him on the morning of the 
 fight ; and he was like a shining angel : it would have 
 done a lady's heart good to look at him. Ned went 
 about like a madman offering twenty to one on him : if 
 he had lost, we should have been ruined at this moment. 
 And then to think of the police coming just as he was 
 finishing Paradise. I cried like a child when I heard of 
 it : I dont think there was ever anything so cruel. He 
 could have finished him quarter of an hour sooner, only 
 he held back to make the market for Ned." Mrs. 
 Skene, overcome, blew her nose before proceeding.

 " Then, on the top of that, came what passed betwixt 
 you and him, and made him give himself up to the 
 police. Lord Worthington bailed him out ; but what 
 with the disgrace, and the disappointment, and his time 
 and money thrown away, and the sting of your words all 
 coming together, he was quite brokenhearted. And 
 now he mopes and frets ; and neither me nor Ned nor 
 Fan can get any good of him. They tell me that he 
 wont be sent to prison ; but if he is " — here Mrs. Skene 
 broke down and began to cry — " it will be the death of 
 him ; and God forgive those that have brought it about." 
 
 Sorrow always softened Lydia ; but tears hardened 
 her again : she had no patience with them. 
 
 " And the other man ? " she said. " Have you heard 
 anything of him ? I suppose he is in some hospital." 
 
 " In hospital ! " repeated Mrs. Skene, checking her 
 tears in alarm. " Who i. " 
 
 "Paradise," replied Lydia, pronouncing the name 
 reluctantly. 
 
 " He in hospital ! Why, bless your innocence, miss, 
 I saw him yesterday looking as well as such an ugly 
 brute could look : not a mark on him, and he bragging 
 what he would have done to Cashel if the police hadnt 
 come up ! He's a nasty low fighting man, so he is ; and 
 I'm only sorry that our boy demeaned himself to strip 
 with the like of him. I hear that Cashel made a perfect 
 picture pf him, and that you saw him. I suppose you 
 were frightened, maam, and very naturally too, not being 
 used to such .sights. I have had my Ned brought home 
 to me in ijiat state that I have poured brandy into his 
 eye, thinking it was his mouth ; and even Cashel, 
 careful as he is, has been nearly blind for three days. 
 It's not to be expected that they could have all the 
 money for nothing. Dont let it prey on your mind, 
 miss. If you married — I am only supposing it," said

 Mrs. Skene in soothing parenthesis as she saw Lydia 
 shrink from the word — " if you were married to a great 
 surgeon, as you might be without derogation to your 
 high rank, youd be ready to feint if you saw him cut off 
 a leg or an arm, as he would have to do every day for 
 his livelihood ; but youd be proud of his cleverness in 
 being able to do it. Thats how I feel with regard to 
 Ned. I tell you the truth, maam, I shouldnt like to see 
 him in the ring no more than the lady of an officer in 
 the Guards would like to see her husband in the field of 
 battle running his sword into the poor blacks or into the 
 French ; but as it's his profession, and people think so 
 highly of him for it, I make up my mind to it y and now 
 I take quite an interest in it, particularly as it does 
 nobody any harm. Not that I would have you think 
 that Ned ever took the arm or leg oiF a man : Lord 
 forbid ! or Cashel either. Oh maam, I thank you 
 kindly ; and I'm sorry you should have given yourself 
 the trouble." This referred to the entry of a servant 
 with tea. 
 
 "Still," said Lydia, when they were at leisure to 
 resume the conversation, "I do not quite understand 
 why you have come to me. Personally you are most 
 welcome ; but in what way did you expect to relieve 
 Mr. Byron's mind by visiting me ? Did he ask you to 
 come ? " 
 
 "He'd have died first. I came down of my own 
 accord, knowing what was the matter with him." 
 
 " And what then ? " 
 
 Mrs. Skene looked around to satisfy herself that they 
 were alone. Then she leaned towards Lydia, and said in 
 an emphatic whisper, 
 
 " Why not marry him, miss ? " 
 
 " Because I dont choose, Mrs. Skene," said Lydia, with 
 perfect good humor.

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 237 
 
 " But consider a little, miss. Where will you ever get 
 such another chance ? Only think what a man he is : 
 champion of the world and a gentleman as well ! The two 
 things have never happened before, and never will again. 
 I have known lots of champions ; but they were not fit 
 company for the like of you. Ned was champion when 
 I married him ; and my family thought that I lowered 
 myself in doing it, because I was a professional dancer 
 on the stage. The men in the ring are common men 
 mostly ; and so ladies are cut ofF from their society. 
 But it has been your good luck to take the fancy of one 
 thats a gentleman. What more could a lady desire ? 
 Where will you find his equal in health, strength, good 
 looks or good manners ? As to his character, I can tell 
 you about that. In Melbourne, as you may suppose, all 
 the girls and women were breaking their hearts for his 
 sake. I declare to you that I used to have two or three 
 of them in every evening merely to look at him ; and he, 
 poor innocent lad, taking no more notice of them than if 
 they were cabbages. He used to be glad to get away 
 from them by going into the saloon to box with the 
 gentlemen ; and then they used to peep at him through 
 the door and get worse than ever. But they never got a 
 wink from him. You were the first, Miss Carew j and, 
 believe me, you will be the last. If there had ever been 
 another, he couldnt have kept it from me ; because his 
 disposition is as open as a child's. And his honesty is 
 beyond everything you can imagine. I have known him 
 to be offered eight hundred pounds to lose a fight that 
 he could only get two hundred by winning, not to 
 mention his chance of getting nothing at all if he lost 
 honestly. You know — for I see you know the world, 
 maam^ — how few men would be proof against such a 
 temptation. There are men high up in their profession 
 — so high that youd as soon suspect the queen on her

 throne of selling her country's battles as them — that 
 fight cross on the sly when it's made worth their while. 
 My Ned is no low prizefighter, as is well known ; but 
 when he let himself be beat by that little Killarney 
 Primrose, and went out and bought a horse and trap next 
 day, what could I think ? There, maam : I tell you 
 that of my own husband ; and I tell you that Cashel 
 never was beat, although times out of mind it would have 
 paid him better to lose than to win, along of those wicked 
 betting men. Not an angry word have I ever had from 
 him, nor the sign of liquor have I ever seen on him, 
 except once on Ned's birthday ; and then nothing but 
 fun came out of him in his cups, when the truth comes 
 out of all men. Oh do just think how happy you ought 
 to be, miss, if you would only bring yourself to look at 
 it in the proper light. A gentleman born and bred, 
 champion of the world, sober, honest, spotless as the 
 unborn babe, able to take his own part and yours in 
 any society, and mad in love with you ! He thinks you 
 an angel from heaven — and so I am sure you are, miss, 
 in your heart. I do assure you that my Fan gets quite 
 put out because she thinks he draws comparisons to her 
 disadvantage. I dont think you can be so hard to please 
 as to refuse him, miss." 
 
 Lydia leaned back in her chair, and looked at Mrs. 
 Skene with a curious expression which soon brightened 
 into an irrepressible smile. Mrs. Skene smiled very 
 slightly in complaisance, but conveyed by her serious 
 brow that what she had said was no laughing matter. 
 
 " I must take some time to consider all that you have 
 so eloquently urged," said Lydia. "I am in earnest, 
 Mrs. Skene : you have produced a great effect upon me. 
 Now let us talk of something else for the present. Your 
 daughter is quite well, I hope." 
 
 " Thank you kindly, maam, she enjoys her health," 
 


## p. (#267) ################################################

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 239 
 
 " And you also ? " 
 
 " I am as well as can be expected," said Mrs. Skene, 
 too fond of commiseration to admit that she was in 
 perfect health. 
 
 " You must have a rare sense of security," said Lydia, 
 watching her, "being happily married to so celebrated a 
 — a professor of boxing as Mr. Skene. Is it not pleasant 
 to have a powerful protector ? " 
 
 "Ah miss, you little know," exclaimed Mrs. Skene,' 
 falling into the trap baited by her own grievances, and 
 losing sight of Cashel's interests. "The fear of his 
 getting into trouble is never ofF my mind. Ned is 
 quietness itself until he has a drop of drink in him ; and 
 then he is like the rest — ready to fight the first that 
 provokes him. And if the police get hold of him he has 
 no chance. There's no justice for a fighting man. Just 
 let it be said that he's a professional, and thats enough 
 for the magistrate : away with him to prison, and 
 goodbye to his pupils and his respectability at once. 
 Thats what I live in terror of. And as to being pro- 
 tected, I'd let myself be robbed fifty times over sooner 
 than say a word to him that might bring on a quarrel. 
 Many a time driving hoine of a night have I overpaid 
 the cabman on the sly, afraid he would grumble and 
 provoke Ned. It's the drink that does it all. Gentle- 
 men are proud to be seen speaking with him in public ; 
 and they come up one after another asking what he'll 
 have, until the next thing he knows is that he's in bed 
 with his boots on, his wrist sprained, and maybe his 
 eye black, trying to remember what he was doing the 
 night before. What I suffered the first three years of 
 our marriage none can tell. Then he took the pledge ; 
 and ever since that he's been very good : I havent seen 
 him what you could fairly call drunk, not more than 
 three times a year. It was the blessing of God, and

 a beating he got from a milkman in Wesminister, that 
 made him ashamed of himself. I kept him to it and emi- 
 grated him out of the way of his old friends. Since that, 
 there has been a blessing on him ; and weve prospered." 
 
 " Is Cashel quarrelsome ? " 
 
 The tone of this question awakened Mrs. Skene to 
 the untimeliness of her complaints. " No, no," she 
 protested. " He never drinks ; and as to fighting, if you 
 can believe such a thing, miss, I dont think he has had a 
 casual turn-up three times in his life : not oftener, at any 
 rate. All he wants is to be married ; and then he'll be 
 steady to his grave. But if he's left adrift now. Lord 
 knows what will become of him. He'll mope first — he's 
 moping at present — ; then he'll drink ; then he'll lose 
 
 his pupils, get out of condition, be beaten, and One 
 
 word from you, miss, would save him. If I might just 
 tell him " 
 
 " Nothing," said Lydia. " Absolutely nothing. The 
 only assurance I can give you is that you have softened 
 the opinion I had formed of some of his actions. But 
 that I should marry Mr. Cashel Byron is simply the 
 most improbable thing in the world. All questions of 
 personal inclination apart, the mere improbability is 
 enough in itself to appal an ordinary woman." 
 
 Mrs. Skene did not quite understand this ; but she 
 understood sufficient for her purpose. She rose to go, 
 shaking her head despondently, and saying, " I see how it 
 is, maam. You think him beneath you. Your relations 
 wouldnt like it." 
 
 " There is no doubt that my relations would be greatly 
 shocked ; and I am bound to take that into account — for 
 what it is worth." 
 
 "We should never trouble you," said Mrs. Skene, 
 lingering. " England will see the last of us in a month 
 or two." 
 


## p. (#269) ################################################

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 241 
 
 "That will make no difference to me, except that I 
 shall regret not being able to have a pleasant chat with 
 you occasionally." This was not true ; but Lydia fancied 
 that she was beginning to take a hardened delight in 
 lying. 
 
 Mrs. Skene was not to be consoled by compliments. 
 She again shook her head. " It is very kind of you to 
 give me good words, miss," she said ; " but if I might 
 have one for the boy, you could say what you liked 
 to me." 
 
 Lydia considered far before she replied. At last she 
 said, " I am sorry I spoke harshly to him, since, driven as 
 he was by circumstances, I cannot see how he could have 
 acted otherwise than he did. And I overlooked the 
 economics of his profession. In ^hort, I am not used to 
 fisticuffs ; and what I saw shocked me so much that I 
 was unreasonable. But," continued Lydia, checking 
 Mrs." Skene's rising hope with a warning finger, "how, 
 if you tell him this, will you make him understand that I 
 say so as an act of justice, and not in the least as a proffer 
 of affection ? " 
 
 " A crumb of comfort will satisfy him, miss. I'll just 
 tell him that Ive seen you, and that you meant nothing 
 by what you said the other " 
 
 " Mrs. Skene," said Lydia, interrupting her softly : 
 "tell him nothing at all as yet. I have made up my 
 mind at last. If he does not hear from me within a 
 fortnight, you may tell him what you please. Can you 
 wait so long ? " 
 
 " Of course. Whatever you wish, maam. But 
 Mellish's benefit is to be to-morrow night ; and " 
 
 " What have I to do with Mellish or his benefit ? " 
 
 Mrs. Skene, abashed, murmured apologetically that 
 she was only wishful that the boy should do himself 
 credit.

 " If he is to benefit Mellish by beating somebody, he 
 will not be behindhand. Remember: you are not to 
 mention me for a fortnight. Is that a bargain ? " 
 
 " Whatever you wish, maam," repeated Mrs. Skene, 
 hardly satisfied. But Lydia gave her no further comfort ; 
 so she begged to take her leave, expressing a hope that 
 things would turn out to the advantage of all parties. 
 Lydia insisted on her partaking of some solid refresh- 
 ment, and afterwards drove her to the railway station in 
 the pony -carriage. Just before 'they parted, Lydia, 
 suddenly recurring to their former subject, said, 
 
 " Does Mr. Byron ever think? " 
 
 " Think ! " said Mrs. Skene emphatically. " Never. 
 There isnt a more cheerful lad in existence, miss." 
 
 Then Mrs. Skene was carried away to London, 
 wondering whether it could be quite right for a young 
 lady to live in a gorgeous castle without any elder of her 
 own sex, and to speak freely and civilly to her inferiors. 
 When she got home, she said nothing of her excursion 
 to Skene, who had never been known to keep a secret 
 except as to the whereabouts of a projected fight. But 
 she sat up late with her daughter Fanny, tantalizing her 
 by accounts of the splendor of the castle, and consoling 
 her by describing Miss Carew as a slight creature with 
 red hair and no figure (Fanny having jet black hair, fine 
 arms, and being one of Cashel's most proficient pupils). 
 
 " All the same. Fan," added Mrs. Skene, as she took 
 her candlestick at two in the morning, " if it comes off", 
 Cashel will never be master in his own house." 
 
 " I can see that very plain," said Fanny ; " but if 
 respectable professional people are not good enough for 
 him, he will have only himself to thank if he gets him- 
 self looked down upon by empty-headed swells." 
 
 Meanwhile, Lydia, on her return to the castle after a 
 long drive round the country, had attempted to overcome

Chap. XIII Cashel Byron's Profession 243 
 
 an attack of restlessness by getting to work on the 
 biography of her father. With a view to preparing a 
 chapter on his taste in literature she had lately been 
 examining his favorite books for marked passages. She 
 now resumed this search, standing perched on the library 
 ladder, taking down volume after volume, and occasion- 
 ally dipping into the contents for a few pages or so. At 
 this desultory work the time passed as imperceptibly as 
 the shadows lengthened. The last book she examined 
 was a volume of poems. There were no marks in it ; 
 but it opened at a page which had evidently lain open 
 often before. The first words Lydia saw were these : 
 
 " What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through 
 Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do ! 
 Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all." 
 
 Lydia hastily stepped down from the ladder, and 
 recoiled until she reached a chair, where she sat and read 
 and re-read these lines. The failing light roused her to 
 action. She replaced the book on the shelf, and said, as 
 she went to the writing table, " If such a doubt as that 
 haunted my father, it will haunt me, unless I settle what 
 is to be my heart's business now and for ever. If it be 
 possible for a child of mine to escape this curse, it must 
 inherit its immunity from its father, and not from me — 
 from the man of impulse who never thinks, and not from 
 the rationalizing woman, who cannot help thinking. 
 Be it so."

CHAPTER XIV 
 
 Before many days had elapsed, a letter came for Cashel 
 as he sat taking tea with the Skene family. When he 
 saw the handwriting, a deep red color mounted to his 
 temples. 
 
 " Oh Lor ! " said Miss Skene, who sat next him. 
 " Lets read it." 
 
 " Go to the dickens," cried Cashel, hastily baffling her 
 as she snatched at it. 
 
 " Dont worrit him. Fan," said Mrs. Skene tenderly. 
 
 "Not for the world, poor dear," said Miss Skene, 
 putting her hand affectionately on his shoulder. " Let 
 me just peep at the name — only to see who it's from. 
 Do, Cashel dear." 
 
 " It's from nobody," said Cashel. " Here : get out. 
 If you dont let me alone, I'll make it warm for you the 
 next time you come to me for a lesson." 
 
 " Very likely," said Fanny contemptuously. " Who 
 had the best of it to-day, I should like to know ? " 
 
 " Gev him a hot un on the chin with her right as 
 ever I see," observed Skene, with hoarse mirth. 
 
 Cashel moved out of Fanny's reach to read the letter, 
 which ran thus : 
 
 Regent's Park, 
 
 Dear Mr. Cashel Byron 
 
 I am desirous that you should meet a friend of

 mine. She will be here at three o^ckck to-morrow after- 
 noon. You would oblige me greatly by calling on me at that 
 hour. yours faithfully^ Lydia Carew. 
 
 There was a long pause, during which there was no 
 sound in the room except the ticking of the clock and 
 the munching of shrimps by the ex-champion. 
 
 "Good news, I hope, Cashel," said Mrs. Skene at 
 last, tremulously. 
 
 " Blow me if I understand it," said Cashel. " Can 
 you make it out ? " And he handed the letter to his 
 adopted mother. Skene stopped eating to see his wife 
 read, a feat which was to him one of the wonders of 
 learning. 
 
 " I think the lady she mentions must be herself," said 
 Mrs. Skene, after some consideration. 
 
 " No," said Cashel, shaking his head. " She always 
 says what she means." 
 
 " Ah," said Skene cunningly ; " but she cant write it 
 though. Thats the worst of writing : no one cant never 
 tell exactly what it means. I never signed articles yet 
 that there werent some misunderstanding about ; and 
 articles is the best writing that can be had anywhere." 
 
 " Youd better go and see what it means," said Mrs. 
 Skene. 
 
 " Right," said Skene. " Go and have it out with her, 
 my boy." 
 
 " It is short, and not particularly sweet," said Fanny. 
 "She might have had the civility to put her crest at the 
 top." 
 
 " What would you give to be her ? " said Cashel 
 derisively, catching the letter as she tossed it disdainfully 
 to him. 
 
 "If I was, I'd respect myself more than to throw 
 myself at your head."

 " Hush, Fanny," said Mrs. Skene : " youre too sharp. 
 Ned : you oughtnt to encourage her by laughing." 
 
 Next day Cashel paid extra attention to his diet ; took 
 some exercise with the gloves ; had a bath and a rub 
 down ; and presented himself at Regent's Park at three 
 o'clock in excellent condition. Expecting to see Bash- 
 ville, he was surprised when the door was opened by a 
 female servant. 
 
 " Miss Carew at home ? " 
 
 " Yes, sir," said the girl, falling in love with him at 
 first sight. " Mr. Byron, sir ? " 
 
 " Thats me," said Cashel. " I say : is there any one 
 with her ? " 
 
 " Only a lady, sir." 
 
 " Oh damn ! Well, it cant be helped. Never say 
 die." 
 
 The girl led him to a door ; and when he entered 
 shut it softly without announcing him. The room was 
 a picture gallery, lighted from the roof. At the end, 
 with their backs toward him, were two ladies : Lydia, 
 and a woman whose noble carriage and elegant form 
 would have raised hopes of beauty in a man less pre- 
 occupied than Cashel. But he, after advancing some 
 distance with his eyes on Lydia, suddenly changed 
 countenance ; stopped ; and was actually turning to fly 
 when the ladies, hearing his light step, faced about and 
 rooted him to the spot. As Lydia offered him her hand, 
 her companion, who had surveyed the visitor first with 
 indifference and then with incredulous surprise, ex- 
 claimed, in a burst of delighted recognition, like a child 
 finding a long lost plaything, " My darling boy ! " 
 And going to Cashel with the grace of a swan, she 
 clasped him in her arms. In acknowledgment of which, 
 he thrust his red discomfited face over her shoulder ; 
 winked at Lydia with his tongue in his cheek ; and said.

 " This is what you may call the Voice of Nature, and 
 no mistake." 
 
 " What a splendid creature you are ! " said Mrs. 
 Byron, holding him a little away from her, the better 
 to admire him. " How handsome you are, you wretch ! " 
 
 " How d'ye do, Miss Carew," said Cashel, breaking 
 loose, and turning to Lydia. " Never mind her : it's 
 only my mother. At least," he added, as if correcting 
 himself, " shes my mamma." 
 
 " And where have you come from ? Where have you 
 been ? Do you know that I have not seen you for seven 
 years, you unnatural boy ? Think of his being my 
 son, Miss Carew ! Give me another kiss, ifty own," she 
 continued, grasping his arm affectionately. "What a 
 muscular creature you are ! " 
 
 "Kiss away as much as you like," said Cashel, 
 struggling with the old schoolboy suUenness as it returned 
 oppressively upon him. " I suppose youre well. You 
 look right enough." 
 
 " Yes," she said mockingly, beginning to despise him 
 for his inability to act up to her in this thrilling scene : 
 " I am right enough. Your language is as refined as 
 ever. And why do you get your hair cropped close like 
 that ? You must let it grow, and " 
 
 "Now look here," said Cashel, stopping her hand 
 neatly as she raised it to re-arrange his locks. " You 
 just drop it, or I'll walk out at that door and you wont 
 see me again for another seven years. You can either 
 take me as you find me, or let me alone. If you want 
 to know the reason for my wearing my hair short, you'll 
 find it in the histories of Absalom and Dan Mendoza. 
 Now are you any the wiser ? " 
 
 Mrs. Byron became a shade colder. " Indeed ! " 
 she said. "Just the same still, Cashel ? " 
 
 " Just the same, both one and other of us," he replied.

 " Before you spoke six words, I felt as if we'd parted only 
 yesterday." 
 
 " I am rather taken aback by the success of my 
 experiment," interposed Lydia. " I invited you purposely 
 to meet one another. The resemblance between you 
 led me to suspect the truth ; and my suspicion was 
 confirmed by the account Mr. Byron gave me of his 
 adventures." 
 
 Mrs. Byron's vanity was touched. " Is he like me ? " 
 she said, scanning his features. He, without heeding 
 her, said to Lydia with undisguised mortification, 
 
 " And was that why you sent for me ? " 
 
 " Are you disappointed .? " said Lydia. 
 
 " He is not in the least glad to see me," said Mrs. 
 Byron plaintively. " He has no heart." 
 
 "Now she'll go on for the next hour," said Cashel, 
 looking to Lydia, obviously because he found it much 
 pleasanter than looking at his mother. " No matter : if 
 you dont care, I dont." So fire away, mamma." 
 
 " And you thinkwe are really like one another ? " said 
 Mrs. Byron, not heeding him. " Yes : I think we are. 
 
 There is a slight " She broke ofF, and added with 
 
 sudden mistrust " Are you married, Cashel ? " 
 
 « Ha ! ha ! ha ! " shouted Cashel. « No ; but I hope 
 to be, some day." And he ventured to glance again at 
 Lydia, who was, however, attentively observing Mrs. 
 Byron. 
 
 " Well, tell me everything about yourself. What are 
 you ? Now I do hope, Cashel, that you have not gone 
 upon the stage." 
 
 " The stage ! " said Cashel contemptuously. " Do I 
 look like it ? " 
 
 " You certainly do not," said Mrs. Byron whimsically, 
 " although you have a certain odious professional air too. 
 What did you do when you ran away so scandalously

 from that stupid school in the north ? How do you earn 
 your living ? Or do you earn it ? " 
 
 " I suppose I do, seeing that I am alive. What do you 
 think I was best fit for after my bringing up ? Crossing 
 sweeping, perhaps ! When I ran away from Panley, I 
 went to sea." 
 
 " A sailor, of all things ! You dont look like one. 
 And pray, whkt rank have you attained in your profes- 
 sion ? " 
 
 " The front rank. The top of the tree," said Cashel 
 shortly. 
 
 "Mr. Byron is not at present following the profession 
 of a sailor, nor has he done so for many years," said 
 Lydia. 
 
 Cashel looked at her, half in appeal, half in remon- 
 strance. 
 
 "Something very different indeed," pursued Lydia, 
 with quiet obstinacy. " And something very startling." 
 
 " Cant you shut up," exclaimed Cashel. " I should 
 have expected more sense from you. Whats the use of 
 setting her on to make a fuss and put me in a rage. I'll 
 go away if you dont stop." 
 
 " What is the matter ? " said Mrs. Byron. " Have you 
 been doing anything disgraceful, Cashel ? " 
 
 " There she goes : I told you so. I keep a gym- 
 nasium : thats all. There's nothing disgraceful in that, 
 I hope." 
 
 " A gymnasium ! " repeated Mrs. Byron, with imperi- 
 ous disgust. " What nonsense ! You must give up 
 everything of that kind, Cashel. It is very silly, and 
 very low. You were too ridiculously proud, of course, 
 to come to me for the means of keeping yourself in a 
 proper position. I suppose I shall have to provide you 
 with " 
 
 "If I ever take a penny from you, may I "

 Cashel caught Lydia's anxious look, and checked himself. 
 He lightly retreated a step, a cunning smile flickering on 
 his lips. " No," he said : " it's just playing into your 
 hands to lose temper with you. Make me angry now if 
 you can." 
 
 "There is not the slightest reason for anger," said 
 Mrs. Byron, angry herself. "Your temper seems to 
 have become ungovernable — or rather to have remained 
 so ; for it was never remarkable for sweetness." 
 
 "No?" retorted Cashel, jeering good-humoredly. 
 " Not the slightest occasion to lose my temper ! Not 
 when I am told that I am silly and low ! Why, I think 
 you must fancy that youre talking to your little Cashel, 
 that blessed child you were so fond of. But youre not. 
 Youre talking — now for a screech. Miss Carew ! — to the 
 champion of Australia, the United States, and England ; 
 holder of three silver, belts and one gold one ; professor 
 of boxing to the nobility and gentry of St. James's ; and 
 common prizefighter to the whole globe without reference 
 to weight or color for not less than ;^S00 a side. 
 Thats Cashel Byron." 
 
 Mrs. Byron recoiled, astounded. After a pause, she 
 said " Oh, Cashel, how could you ? " Then, approaching 
 him again, " Do you mean to say that you go out and 
 fight those great rough savages ? " 
 
 " Yes, I do. You can have the gold belt to wear in 
 King John if you think itll become you." 
 
 " And that you beat them ? " 
 
 "Yes. Ask Miss Carew how Billy Paradise looked 
 after standing before me for an hour." 
 
 " You wonderful boy ! What an occupation ! And 
 have you done all this in your own name ? " 
 
 "Of course I have. I am not ashamed of it. I 
 often wondered whether you had seen my name in the 
 papers ? "

Chap. XIV Cashel Byron's Profession 251 
 
 " I never read the papers. But you must have heard 
 of my return to England. Why did you not come to 
 see me ? " 
 
 "I wasnt quite certain that you would like it," said 
 Cashel uneasily, avoiding her eye. " Hallo ! " he ex- 
 claimed, as he attempted to refresh himself by another 
 look at Lydia : " she's given us the slip." 
 
 "She is quite right to leave us alone together under 
 the circumstances. And now tell me why my precious 
 boy should doubt that his own mother wished to see 
 him." 
 
 "I dont know why he should," said Cashel, with 
 melancholy submission to her affection. " But he did." 
 
 " How insensible you are ! Did you not know that 
 you were always my cherished darling — my only son ? " 
 
 Cashel, who was now sitting beside her on an ottoman, 
 groaned, and moved restlessly, but said nothing. 
 
 " Are you glad to see me ? " 
 
 " Yes," said Cashel dismally, " I suppose I am. I 
 
 By Jingo ! " he cried, with sudden animation, " perhaps 
 you can give me a lift here. I never thought of that. 
 I say, mamma : I am in great trouble at present ; and I 
 think you can help me if you will." 
 
 Mrs. Byron looked at him satirically. But she said 
 soothingly, " Of course I will help you — as far as I am 
 able — my precious one. All I possess is yours." 
 
 Cashel ground his feet on the floor impatiently, and 
 then sprang up. After an interval, during which he 
 seemed to be swallowing some indignant protest, he 
 said, 
 
 " You may put your mind at rest, once and for all, on 
 the subject of money. I dont want anything of that 
 sort." 
 
 " I am glad you are so independent, Cashel." 
 
 "So am I."

 " Do, pray, be more amiable." 
 
 " I am amiable enough," he cried desperately, " only 
 you wont listen." 
 
 " My treasure," said Mrs. Byron remorsefully. "What 
 is the matter ? " 
 
 "Well," said Cashel, somewhat mollified, "it's this. 
 I want to marry Miss Carew : thats all." 
 
 " Tou marry Miss Carew ! " Mrs. Byron's tenderness 
 had vanished ; and her tone was shrewd and contemptu- 
 ous. " Do you know, you silly boy, that " 
 
 " I know all about it," said Cashel determinedly : 
 " what she is ; and what I am ; and the rest of it. 
 And I want to marry her ; and, whats more, I will 
 marry her, if I have to break the neck of every swell in 
 London first. So you can either help me or not, as you 
 please ; but if you wont, never call me your precious boy 
 any more. Now ! " 
 
 Mrs. Byron abdicated her dominion there and then 
 for ever. She sat with quite a mild expression for some 
 time in silence. Then she said, 
 
 " After all, I do not see why you should not. It 
 would be a very good match for you." 
 
 " Yes ; but a deuced bad one for her." 
 
 " Really I do not see that, Cashel. When your uncle 
 dies, I suppose you will succeed to the Dorsetshire 
 property." 
 
 " I the heir to a property ! Are you in earnest ? " 
 
 " Of course. Old Bingley Byron, disagreeable as he 
 is, cannot live for ever." 
 
 " Who the dickens is Bingley Byron ; and what has 
 he to do with me ? " 
 
 " Your uncle, of course. Really, Cashel, you ought 
 to think about these things. Did it never occur to you 
 that you must have relatives, like other people ? " 
 
 " You never told me anything about them. Well, I

 am blowed ! But — 'but — I mean . Supposing he is 
 
 my uncle, am I his lawful heir ? " 
 
 " Yes. Walford Byron, the only brother besides your 
 father, died years ago, whilst you were at Moncrief 's ; 
 and he had no sons. Bingley is a bachelor," 
 
 " But," said Cashel cautiously, " wont there be some 
 bother about my — at least " 
 
 " My dearest child, what are you thinking or talking 
 about ? Nothing can be clearer than your title." 
 
 " Well," said Cashel blushing, " a lot of people used to 
 make out that you werent married at all." 
 
 " What ! " exclaimed A^s. Byron indignantly. " Oh, 
 they dare not say so ! Impossible. Why did you not 
 tell me at once ? " 
 
 " I didnt think about it," said Cashel, hastily excusing 
 himself. " I was too young to care. It doesnt matter 
 now. My father is dead, inst he ? " 
 
 "He died when you were a baby. You have often 
 made me angry with you, poor little innocent, by 
 reminding me of him. Do not talk of him to me." 
 
 " Not if you dont wish. Just one thing though, 
 mamma. Was he a gentleman ? " 
 
 " Of course. What a question ! " 
 
 "Then I am as good as any of the swells that think 
 themselves her equals ? She has a cousin in a govern- 
 ment office : a fellow that gives himself out as the Home 
 Secretary, and most likely sits in a big chair in a hall and 
 cheeks the public. Am I as good as he is ? " 
 
 " You are perfectly well connected by your mother's 
 side, Cashel. The Byrons are only commoners ; but 
 even they are one of the oldest county families in 
 England." 
 
 Cashel began to show signs of excitement. " How 
 much a year are they worth ? " he demanded. 
 
 •I dont know how much they are worth now:

 your father was always in difficulties ; and so was his 
 father. But Bingley is a miser. Five thousand a year, 
 perhaps." 
 
 " Thats an independence. Thats enough. She said 
 she couldnt expect a man to be so thunderingly rich as 
 she is." 
 
 " Indeed ? Then you have discussed the question 
 with her ? " 
 
 Cashel was about to speak, when the maid entered to 
 say that Miss Carew was in the library, and begged that 
 they would come to her as soon as they were quite dis- 
 engaged. As the girl withdrew, he said eagerly, 
 
 "I wish youd go home, mamma, and let me catch her 
 in the library by herself. Tell me where you live ; and 
 I'll come in the evening and let you know all about it. 
 That is, if you have no objection." 
 
 " What objection could I possibly have, dearest one ? 
 Are you sure you are not spoiling your chance by too 
 much haste ? She has no occasion to hurry, Cashel ; 
 and she knows it." 
 
 " I am dead certain that now is my time or never. I 
 always know by instinct when to go in and finish. 
 Here's your mantle." 
 
 " In such a hurry to get rid of your poor old mother, 
 Cashel ? " 
 
 " Oh bother ! youre not old. You wont mind my 
 wanting you to go for this once, will you ? " 
 
 She smiled affectionately ; put on her mantle ; and 
 turned her cheek towards him to be kissed. The un- 
 accustomed gesture alarmed him : he got away a step, 
 and involuntarily assumed an attitude of self-defence, as 
 if the problem before him were a pugilistic one. Recover- 
 ing himself immediately, he kissed her, and impatiently 
 accompanied her to the house door, which he closed softly 
 behind her, leaving her to walk in search of her carriage

 alone. Then he stole upstairs to the library, where he 
 found Lydia reading. ' 
 
 " She's gone," he said, 
 
 Lydia put down her book ; looked up at him ; saw 
 what was coming ; looked down again to hide a spasm 
 of terror ; and said, with a steady severity that cost her a 
 great effort, " I hope you have not quarrelled." 
 
 " Lord bless you, no ! We kissed one another like 
 turtle doves. At odd moments she wheedles me into 
 feeling fond of her in spite of myself. She went away 
 because I asked her to." 
 
 " And why do you ask my guests to go away ? " 
 
 " Because I wanted to be alone with you. Dont look 
 as if you didnt understand. She's told me a whole heap 
 of things about myself that alter our affairs completely. 
 My birth is all right ; I'm heir to a county family that 
 came over with the Conqueror ; and I shall have a 
 decent income. I can afford to give away weight to old 
 Webber now." 
 
 " Well ? " said Lydia sternly. 
 
 " Well," said Cashel unabashed, " the only use of all 
 that to me is that I may marry if I like. No more 
 fighting or teaching now." 
 
 " And when you are married, will you be as tender to 
 your wife as you are to your mother ? " 
 
 Cashel's elation vanished. " I knew youd think that," 
 he said. " I am always the same with her : I cant help 
 it. I cant like a woman through thick and thin merely 
 because she happens to be my mother ; and I wont 
 pretend to do it to please anybody. She makes me ^k 
 like a fool, or like a brute. Have I ever been so with 
 you ? " 
 
 " Yes," said Lydia. " Except," she added, " that you 
 have never shewn absolute dislike to me." 
 
 " Ah ! Except ! Thats a very big except. But I dont

 dislike her. Blood is thicker than water ; and I have a 
 softness for her ; only I wont put up with her nonsense. 
 But it's different with you — I cant explain how, because 
 I'm not good at sentiment — not that there's any sentiment 
 
 about it. At least, I dont mean that 5 but Youre 
 
 fond of me in a sort of way, aint you ? " 
 
 " Yes ; I'm fond of you in a sort of way." 
 
 "Well, then," he said uneasily, "wont you marry 
 me ? I'm not such a fool as you think ; and youll like 
 me better after a while." 
 
 Lydia became very pale. "Have you considered," 
 she said, " that henceforth you will be an idle man, and 
 that I shall always be a busy woman, pre-occupied with 
 work that may seem very dull to you ? " 
 
 " I wont be idle. There's lots of things I can do 
 besides boxing. We'll get on together, never fear. 
 People that are fond of one another never have any 
 difficulty ; and people that hate each other never have 
 any comfort. I'll be on the look-out to make you happy. 
 You neednt fear my interrupting your Latin and Greek : 
 I wont expect you to give up your whole life to me. 
 Why should I ? There's reason in everything. So long 
 as you are mine, and nobody else's, I'll be content. And 
 I'll be yours and nobody else's. Whats the use of 
 supposing half-a-dozen accidents that may never happen ? 
 Lets take our chance. You have too much good nature 
 ever to be nasty." 
 
 " It would be a hard bargain," she said doubtfully ; 
 " for you would have to give up your occupation ; and I 
 should give up nothing but my unfruitful liberty." 
 
 " I will swear never to fight again ; and you neednt 
 swear anything. If that is not an easy bargain, I dont 
 know what is." 
 
 " Easy for me : yes. But for you ? " 
 
 " Never mind me. You do whatever you like ; and 
 


## p. (#285) ################################################

Chap. XIV Cashel Byron's Profession 257 
 
 I'll do whatever you like. You have a conscience ; so I 
 know that whatever you like will be the best thing. I 
 have the most science ; but you have the most sense. 
 Come ! " 
 
 Lydia looked around, as if for a means of escape. 
 Cashel waited anxiously. There was a long pause. 
 
 " It cant be," he said pathetically, " that youre afraid 
 of me because I was a prizefighter." 
 
 " Afraid of you ! No : I am afraid of myself; afraid 
 of the future ; afraid _^r you. But my mind is already 
 made up on this subject. When I brought about this 
 meeting between you and your mother, I determined to 
 marry you if you asked me again." 
 
 She stood up quietly, and waited. The rough hardi- 
 hood of the ring fell from him like a garment : he 
 blushed deeply, and did not know what to do. Nor did 
 she ; but without willing it she came a step closer to 
 him, and turned up her face towards his. He, nearly 
 blind with confusion, put his arms about her and kissed 
 her. Suddenly she broke loose from his arms ; seized the 
 lappels of his coat tightly in her hands ; and leaned back 
 until she hung from him with all her weight. 
 
 " Cashel," she said : " we are the silliest lovers in the 
 world, I believe : we know nothing about it. Are you 
 really fond of me ? " 
 
 He could only answer " Yes " in a constrained way, 
 and stare helplessly and timidly at her. His ineptitude 
 was embarrassing ; but she had sense enough to be glad 
 to find him unmistakeably as entire a novice at love- 
 making as herself. He remained shy, and was so 
 evidently anxious to go that she presently asked him to 
 leave her for a while, though she was surprised to feel a 
 faint pang of disappointment when he consented. 
 
 On leaving the house, he hurried to the address which 
 his mother had given him : a prodigious building in

 Westminster, divided into residential fla;ts, to the seventh 
 floor of w^hich he ascended in a lift. As he stepped from 
 it he szw Lucian Webber viralking away from him along 
 a corridor. Obeying a sudden impulse, he followed, and 
 overtook him just as he was entering a room. Lucian, 
 finding that some one was resisting his attempt to close 
 the door, looked out ; recognized Cashel j turned white ; 
 and hastily retreated into the apartment, where, getting 
 behind a writing-table, he snatched a revolver from a 
 drawer. Cashel recoiled, amazed and frightened, with 
 his right arm up as if to ward off a blow. 
 
 " Hallo ! " he cried. " Drop that damned thing, will 
 you ! If you dont, I'll shout for help." 
 
 "If you approach me, I will fire," said Lucian excitedly. 
 " I will teach you that your obsolete brutality is power- 
 less against the weapons Science has put into the hands of 
 civilized men. Leave my apartments. I am not afraid 
 of you ; but I do not choose to be disturbed by your 
 presence." 
 
 " Confound your cheek," said Cashel indignantly : " is 
 that the way you receive a man who comes to make a 
 friendly call on you } " 
 
 "Friendly ,««zf, doubtless, when you see that I am 
 well protected." 
 
 Cashel gave a long whistle. " Oh," he said : " you 
 thought I came to pitch into you. Ha ! ha ! And you 
 call that science — to draw a pistol on a man ! But you 
 darent fire it ; and well you know it. Youd better put 
 it up, or you may let it off without intending to : I never 
 feel comfortable when I see a fool meddling with fire- 
 arms. I came to tell you that I'm going to be married 
 to your cousin. Aint you glad ? " 
 
 Lucian's face changed. He believed ; but he said 
 obstinately, "I dont credit that statement. It is 3 
 lie."

 This outraged Cashel. " I tell you again," he said, in 
 3 menacing tone, "that your cousin is engaged to me. 
 Now call me a liar, and, hit me in the face if you dare. 
 Look here," he added, taking a leather case from his 
 pocket, and extracting from it a bank note : " I'll give 
 you that twenty-pound note if you will hit me one blow." 
 And he put his hands behind him, and placed himself 
 before Lucian, who, sick with fiiry, and half paralyzed by 
 a sensation which he would not acknowledge as fear, 
 forced himself to stand his ground. Cashel thrust out 
 - his jaw invitingly, and said, with a sinister grin, " Put it 
 in straight, governor. Twenty pounds, remember.''' 
 
 At that moment Lucian would have given all his 
 political and social chances for the strength and skill of 
 his adversary. He could see only one way to escape the 
 torment of Cashel's jeering, and the self-reproach of a 
 coward ; for his point of honor, learnt at an English 
 public school, was essentially the same as the prize- 
 fighter's. He desperately clenched his fist and struck 
 out. The blow wasted itself on space ; and he stumbled 
 forward against Cashel, who laughed uproariously, and 
 exclaimed, clapping him on the back, 
 
 "Well done, my boy. I thought you were going to 
 be mean ; but youve been game ; and youre welcome 
 to the stakes. I'll tell Lydia that you have fought me 
 for twenty pounds and won on your merits. Aint you 
 proud of yourself for having had a go at the champion ? " 
 
 "Sir " began Lucian. But nothing coherent 
 
 followed. 
 
 " You just sit down for quarter of an hour, and dont 
 drink any spirits ; and youU be all right. When you 
 recover youll be glad you shewed pluck, So good-night 
 for the present : I know how you feel ; and I'll be off. 
 Be sure not to try to settle yourself with wine : itll only 
 make you worse, Ta-ta ! "

 As Cashel withdrew, Lucian collapsed into a chair, 
 shaken by the revival of passions and jealousies which he 
 had thought as outgrown as the schoolboy jackets in 
 which he had formerly experienced them. He rehearsed 
 the scene a hundred times, not as it had happened, 
 though the recollection of that stung him every moment, 
 but as it might have happened had he, instead of Cashel, 
 been the stronger man. He strove in vain to get on 
 the lower plane, and plume himself on his pluck in 
 having at least dared to strike. There was no escape 
 from his inner knowledge that he had been driven by 
 fear and hatred into a paroxysm of wrath against a man 
 to whom he should have set an example of dignified 
 control. An exhausting whirl in his thoughts, at once 
 quickened and confused by the nervous shock of bodily 
 violence, to which he was quite unused, distracted him. 
 He wanted sympathy, refuge, an opportunity to retrieve 
 himself by doing it all over again the right way. Before 
 an hour had passed, he was on his way to the house in 
 Regent's Park. 
 
 Lydia was in her boudoir, occupied with a book, when 
 he entered. He was not an acute observer : he could 
 see no change in her. She was as calm as ever : her 
 eyes were not fully open ; and the touch of her hand 
 subdued him as it had always done. Though he had 
 never entertained any hope of possessing her since the 
 day when she had refused him in Bedford Square, a sense 
 of intolerable loss came upon him as he saw her for the 
 first time pledged to another — and such another ! 
 
 "Lydia," he said, trying to speak vehemently, but 
 failing to shake off the conventional address of which 
 he had made a second nature : " I have heard something 
 that has filled me with inexpressible dismay. Is it 
 true ? " 
 
 " The news has travelled fast," she said. " Yes, it is

Chap. XIV Cash el Byron's Profession 261 
 
 true." She spoke composedly, and so kindly that he 
 choked in trying to reply. 
 
 "Then, Lydia, you are the chief actor in a greater 
 tragedy than I have ever w^itnessed on the stage." 
 
 " It is strange, is it not ? " she said, smiling at his 
 effort to be impressive. 
 
 " Strange ! It is calamitous. I trust I may be 
 allowed to say so. And you sit there reading as calmly 
 as though nothing had happened." 
 
 She handed him the book without a word. 
 
 " Ivanhoe ! " he said. " A novel ! " 
 
 " Yes. Do you remember once, before you knew me 
 very well, telling me that Scott's novels were the only 
 ones you liked to see in the hands .of ladies ? " 
 
 "No doubt I did. But I cannot talk of literature 
 just- 
 
 " I am not leading you away from what you want to 
 talk of. I was about to tell you that I came upon 
 Ivanhoe by chance half an hour ago when I was 
 searching — I confess it — for something very romantic 
 to read. Ivanhoe was a prizefighter : the first half 
 of the book is a description of a prizefight. I was 
 wondering whether some romancer of the twenty-fourth 
 century will hunt out the exploits of my husband, and 
 present him to the world as a sort of English nineteenth 
 century Cid, with all the glory of antiquity upon his 
 deeds." 
 
 Lucian made a gesture of impatience. " I have never 
 been able to understand," he said,- "how it is that a 
 woman of your ability can habitually dwell on perverse 
 and absurd ideas. Oh, Lydia, is this to be the end of 
 all your great gifts and attainments ? Forgive me if I 
 touch a painful chord ; but this marriage seems to me 
 so unnatural that I must speak out. Your father left 
 you one of the richest and best-educated women in

 Europe. Would he approve of what you are about to 
 do ? » 
 
 " It almost seems to me that he educated me expressly 
 to some such end. Whom would you have me marry ? " 
 
 " Doubtless few men are worthy of you, Lydia. But 
 this man least of all. Could you not marry a gentleman ? 
 If he were even an artist, a poet, or a man of genius of 
 any kind, I could bear to think of it ; for indeed I am 
 not influenced by class prejudice in the matter. But 
 
 a 1 will try to say nothing that you must not in 
 
 justice admit to be too obvious to be ignored — a man of 
 the lower orders, pursuing a calling which even the 
 lower orders despise ; illiterate, rough, awaiting at this 
 moment a disgraceful sentence at the hands of the 
 law ! Is it possible that you have considered all these 
 things ? " 
 
 " Not very deeply : they are not of a kind to concern 
 me much. I can console you as to one of them. I 
 have always recognized Cashel as a gentleman, in your 
 sense of the word. He proves to be so : his people are 
 county people and so forth. As to his trial, I have 
 spoken with Lord Worthington about it, and also with 
 the lawyers who have charge of the case ; and they say 
 positively that, owing to certain proofs not being in the 
 hands of the police, a defence can be set up that will save 
 him from imprisonment." 
 
 "There is no such defence possible," said Lucian, 
 angrily. 
 
 " Perhaps not. As far as I understand it, it is rather 
 an aggravation of the offence than an excuse for it. But 
 if they imprison him, it will make no difference. He 
 can console himself with the certainty that I will marry 
 him at once when he is released." 
 
 Lucian's face lengthened. He abandoned the argument, 
 and said blankly, " I cannot suppose that you would allow 
 


## p. (#291) ################################################

Chap. XIV Cashel Byron's Profession 263 
 
 yourself to be deceived. If he is a gentleman, that of 
 course alters the case completely." 
 
 " Lucian," said Lydia earnestly : " will you believe 
 that it actually altered the case with me ? There is, I 
 know, a plane upon which his past pursuits are wrong ; 
 but we are not upon that plane any more than he. The 
 discovery of his rank does not alter the weight of one 
 blow he has ever struck ; and yet you have just now 
 admitted that it alters the case completely. It was not 
 prizefighting that you objected to : that was only a 
 pretence : your true repugnance was to the class to which 
 prizefighters belong. And so, worldly cousin Lucian, I 
 silence all your objections by convincing you that I am 
 not going to connect you by marriage with a butcher, 
 bricklayer, or other member of the trades from which 
 Cashel's profession, as you warned me, is usually recruited. 
 Stop a moment : I am going to do justice to you. You 
 want to say that my unworldly friend Lucian is far more 
 deeply concerned at seeing the phoenix of modern culture 
 throw herself away on a man unworthy of her." 
 
 " That is what I mean to say, except that you put it 
 too modestly. It is a case of the phoenix, not only of 
 modern culture, but of natural endowment and of every 
 happy accident of the highest civilization, throwing her- 
 self away on a man specially incapacitated by his tastes 
 and pursuits from comprehending her or entering the 
 circle in which she moves." 
 
 " Listen to me patiently, Lucian ; and I will try to 
 explain the mystery to you, leaving the rest of the world 
 to misunderstand me as it pleases. First, you will grant 
 me that even a phoenix must marry some one in order 
 that she may hand on her torch to her children. Her 
 best course would be to marry another phoenix ; but as 
 she — poor girl ! — cannot appreciate even her own 
 phoenixity, miich less that of another, she perversely

264 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap, xiv 
 
 prefers a mere mortal. Who is the mortal to be ? Not 
 her cousin Luciaii ; for rising young politicians must 
 have helpful wives, writh feminine politics and powers 
 of visiting and entertaining : a description inapplicable to 
 the phoenix. Not, as you just now suggested, a man of 
 letters. The phoenix has had her share of playing help- 
 meet to a man of letters, and does not care to repeat 
 that experience. She is sick to death of the morbid 
 introspection and ignorant self- consciousness of poets, 
 novelists, and their like. As to artists, all the good ones 
 are married ; and ever since the rest have been able to 
 read in hundreds of books that they are the most gifted 
 and godlike of men, they are become almost as intolerable 
 as their literary flatterers. No, Lucian : the phoenix 
 has paid her debt to literature and art by the toil of her 
 childhood. She will use and enjoy both of them in 
 future as best she can ; but she will never again drudge 
 in their laboratories. You say that she might at least 
 have married some one with the habits of a gentleman. 
 But the gentlemen she knows are either amateurs of the 
 arts, having the egotism of professional artists without 
 their ability ; or they are men of pleasure, which means 
 that they are dancers, tennis players, butchers, and 
 gamblers. I leave the nonentities out of the question. 
 In the eyes of a phoenix, even the arena — the ring, as 
 they call it — is a better school of character than the 
 drawing-room ; and a prizefighter is a hero in com- 
 parison with the wretch who sets a leash of greyhounds 
 upon a hare. Imagine, now, this poor phoenix meeting 
 with a man who had never been guilty of self-analysis in 
 his life — who complained when he was annoyed, and 
 exulted when he was glad, like a child and unlike a 
 modern man — who was honest and brave, strong and 
 beautiful. You open your eyes, Lucian : you do not do 
 justice to Cashel's good looks. He is twenty-five ; and

Chap. XIV Cashel Byron's Profession 265 
 
 yet there is not a line in his face. It is neither thought- 
 ful, nor poetic, nor wearied, nor doubting, nor old, nor 
 self-conscious, as so many of his contemporaries' feces 
 are — as mine, perhaps, is. The face of a pagan god, 
 assured of eternal youth ! I should be mad, since I must 
 marry, to miss such a man." 
 
 "You are mad as it is," cried Lucian rising, scared 
 and vehement. " This is infatuation. You no more see 
 the real man as I see him than " 
 
 "Than you can see me as I appear to those who 
 dislike me, Lucian. How do you know that what you 
 see is the real man ? " 
 
 " I see him as every one sees him except you. That 
 shews that you are infatuated. You know — ^you must 
 know — that you have lost your senses on this subject." 
 
 " I have given you reasons, Lucian. I am open to 
 argument." 
 
 " Argument ! Reasons ! Do you think that your 
 folly is any the less folly because you have reasons for it ? 
 Rational folly is the worst of all folly, because it is armed 
 against reason." 
 
 Lydia opened her eyes fully for the first time during 
 the conversation. " Lucian," she said, delightedly : 
 "you are coming out. I think that is the cleverest 
 thing I ever heard you say. And it is true — ^frightfiilly 
 true." 
 
 He sat down despairingly. " You would not admit it 
 so readily," he said, "if you intended it to have the 
 smallest effect on you. Even if all your arguments were 
 good ones, what would they prove ? If you really 
 despise the pursuits of gentlemen, is that a reason for 
 respecting the pursuits of prizefighters ? Is the ring 
 any the better because you can pretend to think the 
 drawing-room worse ? — for you do not really hold any 
 such monstrous opinion. How you would scout your

 own sophistry if I used it in trying to persuade you to 
 conform to social usuages ! " 
 
 "We are drifting back again into mere rationalism, 
 Lucian. However, it is my fault. 1 began an explana- 
 tion, and rambled ofF, womanlike, into praise of my lover. 
 Do not think that I wish to .represent my choice as 
 any better than a choice of the least of two evils. I 
 strongly think that Society ought to have made some- 
 thing better of Cashel than a prizefighter ; but he, poor 
 fellow, had no choice at all. I once called him a ruffian ; 
 and I do not retract the word ; though I expect you to 
 forgive him his ruffianism as you forgive a soldier his 
 murders, or a lawyer his lies. When you condemn the 
 others — and with all my heart I say the sooner the 
 better — condemn him, but not before. Besides, my 
 dear Lucian, the prizefighting is all over : he does not 
 intend to go on with it. As to our personal suitability, 
 I believe in the doctrine of heredity ; and as my body 
 is frail and my brain morbidly, active, I think my impulse 
 towards a man strong in body and untroubled in mind a 
 trustworthy one. You can understand that : , it is a 
 plain proposition in eugenics." 
 
 " I know that you will do whatever you have made up 
 your mind to do," said Lucian desolately. 
 
 " And you will make the best of it, will you not ? " 
 
 " The best or worst of it does not rest with me. I 
 can only accept it as inevitable." 
 
 " Not at all. You can make the worst of it by 
 behaving distantly to Cashel ; or the best of it by being 
 friendly with him." 
 
 " I had better tell you," he said. " I have seen him 
 
 since — since " Lydia nodded. " I mistook his object 
 
 in coming into my room as he did, unannounced. In 
 fact, he almost forced his way in. Some words arose 
 between us. At last he taunted me beyond endurance,

 and offered me — characteristically — ^1,0 to strike him. 
 And I am sorry to say that I did so." 
 
 " You did so ! " said Lydia, turning very pale. " And 
 what followed ? " 
 
 " I should say rather that I meant to strike him ; for 
 he avoided me, or else I missed my aim. He only gave 
 me the money and went away, evidently with a high 
 opinion of me. He left me with a very low one of 
 myself." 
 
 " What ! He did not retaliate ! " exclaimed Lydia, 
 recovering her color. " Oh, he has beaten you on your 
 own ground, Lucian. It is you who are the prizefighter 
 at heart ; and you grudge him his superiority in the very 
 art you condemn him for professing." 
 
 "1 was wrong, Lydia, but I grudged him you. I 
 know I acted hastily ; and I will apologize to him. I 
 wish matters had fellen out otherwise." 
 
 " They could not have done so ; and I believe you 
 will yet acknowledge that they have arranged themselves 
 very well. Now that the phoenix is disposed of, I want 
 to read you a letter I have received from Alice Goff, 
 which throws quite a new light on her character. I have 
 not seen her since June j and her mind seems to have 
 grown three years in the interim. Listen to this, for 
 example." 
 
 And so the conversation turned upon Alice. 
 
 When Lucian returned to his chambers, he wrote the 
 following note, which he posted to Cashel Byron before 
 going to bed. 
 
 Dear Sir, 
 
 . I beg to enclose you a bank note which you left here 
 this evening. I feel bound to express my regret for what 
 passed on that occasion, and to assure you that it proceeded 
 from a misapprehension of your purpose in calling on me.

 The nervous disorder into which the severe mental applica- 
 tion and late hours of the past session have thrown me must 
 he my excuse. I hope to have the pleasure of meeting you 
 again soon, and offering you personally my congratulations on 
 your approaching marriage. 
 
 I am, dear Sir,

CHAPTER XV 
 
 In the following month Cashel Byron, William Paradise, 
 and Robert Mellish appeared in the dock together, the 
 first two for having been principals in a prizefight, and 
 Mellish for having acted as bottleholder to Paradise. 
 These offences were verbosely described in a long indict- 
 ment which was to have included the fourth man 
 captured. But against him the grand jury had refused 
 to find a true bill. The prisoners pleaded not guilty. 
 
 The defence was that the fight, the occurrence of 
 which was admitted, was not a prizefight, but the 
 outcome of an enmity which had subsisted between the 
 two men since one of them, at a public exhibition at 
 Islington, had attacked and bitten the other. In support 
 of this, it was shewn that Byron had occupied a house at 
 Wiltstoken, and had lived there with Mellish, who had 
 invited Paradise to spend a holiday with him in the 
 country. This accounted for the presence of the three 
 men at Wiltstoken on the day in question. Words had 
 arisen between Byron and Paradise on the subject of the 
 Islington affair ; and they had at last agreed to settle 
 the dispute in the old English fashion. They had 
 adjourned to a field, and fought fairly and determinedly 
 until interrupted by the police, who, misled by appear- 
 ances, mistook the affair for a prizefight. 
 
 Prizefighting, Cashel Byron's counsel said, was a 
 


## p. (#298) ################################################

270 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. XV 
 
 brutal pastime, rightly discountenanced by the law ; but 
 a fair stand-up fight between two unarmed men, though 
 doubtless technically a breach of the peace, had never 
 been severely dealt with by British juries or British judges, 
 who knew how much it was to our national and manly 
 tolerance of the fist, Nature's weapon, that we owed our 
 freedom from the murderous stiletto of the Italian, the 
 revolver of the cowboy, and the treacherous kick of the 
 French savate player (Mellish, whose favorite spectacle 
 was Devonshire and Lancashire wrestling, murmured in 
 patriotic assent). The case would be amply met by 
 binding over the prisoners, who were now on the best of 
 terms with one another, to keep the peace for a reason- 
 able period. The sole evidence against this view of the 
 case was police evidence ; and the police were naturally 
 reluctant to admit that they had found a mare's nest. 
 In proof that the fight had been premeditated, and was a 
 prizefight, they alleged that it had taken place within an 
 enclosure formed with ropes and stakes. But where 
 were those ropes and stakes ? They were not forth- 
 coming ; and he (counsel) submitted that the reason was 
 not, as had been suggested, that they had been spirited 
 away, which was plainly impossible ; but that they had 
 existed only in the excited imagination of the posse of 
 constables who had arrested the prisoners. 
 
 Again, it had been urged that the prisoners were in 
 fighting costume. But cross-examination had elicited 
 that fighting costume meant practically no costume at all : 
 the men had simply stripped in order that their movements 
 might be unembarrassed. It had been proved that Para- 
 dise had been — well, in the traditional costume of Paradise 
 (Roars of laughter : Paradise grinning in confusion) until 
 the police borrowed a horsecloth to put upon him. 
 
 That the constables had been guilty of gross exaggera- 
 tion was shewn by their evidence as to the desperate 
 


## p. (#299) ################################################

Chap. XV Cashel Byron's Profession 271 
 
 injuries the combatants had inflicted upon one another. 
 Of Paradise in particular it had been alleged that his 
 features were obliterated. The jury had before them in 
 the dock the man whose featiu'es had been obliterated 
 only a few weeks previously. If that were true, where 
 had the prisoner obtained the unblemished lineaments 
 which he was now, full of health and good humor, 
 presenting to them ? (Renewed laughter. Paradise 
 sufFused with blushes.) It was said that these terrible 
 injuries, the traces of which had disappeared so miracu- 
 lously, were inflicted by the prisoner Byron, a young 
 gentleman tenderly nurtured, and visibly inferior in 
 strength and hardihood to his herculean opponent. 
 Doubtless Byron had been emboldened by his skill in 
 mimic combat with softly padded gloves to try conclu- 
 sions, under the very different conditions of real fighting, 
 with a man whose massive shoulders and determined cast 
 of features ought to have convinced him that such an 
 enterprise was nothing short of desperate. Fortunately 
 the police had interfered before he had suffered severely 
 for his rashness. Yet it had been alleged that he had 
 actually worsted Paradise in the encounter — obliterated 
 his features ! That was a fair sample of the police 
 evidence, which was throughout consistently incredible 
 and at variance with the dictates of common sense. 
 
 It was unnecessary to waste the time of the jury by 
 comment on the honorable manner in which Byron had 
 come forward and given himself up to the police the 
 moment he learnt that they were in search of him. 
 Such conduct spoke for itself. Paradise would, beyond a 
 doubt, have adopted the same straightforward course had 
 he not been arrested at once, and that too without the 
 least effort at resistance on his part. Surely this was 
 hardly the line that would have suggested itself to two 
 lawless prizefighters. 
 


## p. (#300) ################################################

272 Cashel Byron's Profession Chap. XV 
 
 An attempt had been made to prejudice the prisoner 
 Byron by the statement that he was a notorious pro- 
 fessional bruiser. But no proof of that was forthcoming ; 
 and if the fact were really notorious there could be no 
 difficulty in proving it. Such notoriety as Mr. Byron 
 enjoyed was due, as his friend Lord Worthington had let 
 slip in the course of examination, to his approaching 
 marriage with a lady of distinction. Was it credible 
 that a highly connected gentleman in this enviable 
 position would engage in a prizefight, risking disgrace 
 and personal disfigurement for a sum of money that could 
 be no object to him, or for a glory that would appear to 
 all his friends as little better than infamy ? 
 
 The whole of the evidence as to the character of the 
 prisoners went to shew that they were men of unim- 
 peachable integrity and respectability. An impression 
 unfavorable to Paradise might have been created by the 
 fact that he was a professional pugilist and a man of hasty 
 temper ; but it had also transpired that he had on one 
 occasion rendered assistance to the police, thereby em-, 
 ploying his athletic attainments in the interests of law 
 and order. As to his temper, it accounted for the 
 quarrel which the police — knowing his profession — had 
 mistaken for a prizefight. 
 
 Mellish was a trainer of athletes : hence the witnesses 
 to his character were chiefly persons connected with 
 sport ; but they were not the less worthy of credence on 
 that account. 
 
 In fine, the charge would have been hard to believe 
 even if supported by the strongest evidence. But when 
 there was no evidence — when the police had failed to 
 produce any of the accessories of a prizefight — when 
 there were no ropes nor posts, no written articles, no 
 stakes nor stakeholders, no seconds except the unfor- 
 tunate man Mellish — whose mouth was closed by a law

Chap. XV Cashel Byron's Profession 273 
 
 which, in defiance of the obvious interests of justice, 
 forbade a prisoner to speak and clear himself — nothing, 
 in fact, but the fancies of constables who had, under 
 cross-examination, not only contradicted one another, 
 but shewn the most complete ignorance (a highly credit- 
 able ignorance) of the nature and conditions of a prize- 
 fight, then counsel would venture to say confidently that 
 the theory of the prosecution, ingenious as it was, and 
 ably as it had been put forward, was absolutely and utterly 
 untenable. 
 
 This, and much more of equal value, was delivered 
 with relish by an eminent Queen's counsellor, whose 
 spirits rose as he felt the truth change and fade whilst 
 he rearranged its attendant circumstances. Cashel at 
 first listened anxiously. He flushed and looked moody 
 when his marriage was alluded to ; but when the whole 
 defence was unrolled, he was awestruck, and stared at 
 his advocate as if he half feared that the earth would 
 gape and' swallow such a reckless perverter of known 
 facts. Paradise felt that he was free already : his 
 admiration <for the barrister rose to the point of hero- 
 worship. The Judge, and the more respectable persons 
 in court, became extraordinarily grave, as Englishmen 
 will when their sense of moral responsibility is roused on 
 behalf of some glaring imposture. Every one in court 
 knew that the police were right ; that there had been a 
 prizefight ; that the betting on it had been recorded in 
 all the sporting papers for weeks beforehand ; that Cashel 
 was the most terrible fighting man of the day; that 
 Paradise had not dared to propose a renewal of the inter- 
 rupted contest. And they listened with solemn appro- 
 bation to the man who knew all this as well as they did, 
 but who was clever enough to make it appear incredible 
 and nonsensical. 
 
 It remained for the Judge to sweep away the defence, 
 
 T

 or to favor the prisoners by countenancing it. Fortu- 
 nately for them, he had handled the gloves himself in his 
 youth, and w^as old enough to recall, not writhout regret, a 
 time wrhen the memory of Cribb and Molyneux wzs yet 
 green. He began his summing-up by telling the jury 
 that the police had failed to prove that the fight w^as a 
 prizefight. After that, the sporting spectators, by in- 
 dulging in roars of laughter whenever they could find a 
 pretext for doing so w^ithout being turned out of court, 
 shewed that they had ceased to regard the trial seriously. 
 The lay public retained its gravity to the last. 
 
 Finally the jury acquitted Mellish, and found Cashel 
 and Paradise guilty of a common assault. They were 
 sentenced to two days imprisonment, and bound over in 
 sureties of ;^I50 each to keep the peace for twelve 
 months. The sureties were forthcoming ; and as the 
 imprisonment was supposed to date from the beginning 
 of the sessions, the prisoners were at once released. 
 
 "By Jingo," said Cashel emphatically as he left the 
 court, "if wedidnt fight fairer than that in the ring, 
 we'd be disqualified in the first round. It's the first 
 cross I ever was mixed up in ; and I hope it will be the 
 last."

CHAPTER XVI 
 
 Miss Carew, averse to the anomalous relations of court- 
 ship, made as little delay as possible in getting married. 
 Cashel's luck was not changed by the event. Bingley 
 Byron died three weeks after the ceremony (which was 
 civil and private) ; and Cashel had to claim possession of 
 the property, in spite of his expressed wish that the 
 lawyers would take themselves and the property to the 
 devil, and allow him to enjoy his honeymoon in peace. 
 The transfer took some time. Owing to his mother's 
 capricious reluctance to give the necessary information 
 without reserve, and to the lajv's delay, his first child was 
 born some time before his succession was fully established, 
 and the doors of a dilapidated country house in Dorset- 
 shire opened to him. The conclusion of the business 
 was a great relief to his solicitors, who had been unable 
 to shake his conviction that the case was clear enough, 
 but that the referee had been squared. By this he 
 meant that the Lord Chancellor had been bribed to keep 
 him out of his property. 
 
 His marriage proved a happy one. To make up for 
 the loss of his occupation, he farmed, and lost six 
 thousand pounds by it ; tried gardening with better 
 success ; began to meddle in commercial enterprise as 
 director of joint-stock companies in the city ; and was 
 soon after invited to represent a Dorsetshire constituency

 in Parliament in the Conservative interest. He w^as 
 returned by a large majority ; but as he voted just as 
 often writh the extreme Radicals as w^ith the party which 
 had returned him, he was speedily called upon to resign. 
 He flatly refused, and held on until the next general 
 election, which he carried as an independent candidate, 
 thanks to a loud voice, an easy manner, the popularity 
 of his own views, and the extent of his wife's informa- 
 tion, which he retailed at second-hand. He made his 
 maiden speech in the House unabashed the first night he 
 sat there. Indeed, he was afraid of nothing except 
 burglars, big dogs, doctors, dentists, and street-crossings. 
 Whenever an accident through any of these was reported, 
 he read it to Lydia very seriously, and preserved the 
 newspaper for quite two days as a document in support 
 of his favorite assertion that the only place a man was 
 safe in was the prize-ring. As he objected to most 
 field sports on the ground of inhumanity, she, fearing 
 that he would suffer in health and appearance from want 
 of systematic exercise, suggested that he should resume 
 the practice of boxing with gloves. But he shook his 
 head. Boxing was too serious a pursuit to him to be 
 either an amusement or a mere exercise. Besides, he 
 had a prejudice that it did not become a married man. 
 He had gone through with it when it was his business ; 
 but he had no idea of doing it for pleasure. His career 
 as a pugilist was closed by his marriage. 
 
 His admiration for his wife survived the ardor of his 
 first love for her ; and her habitual forethought saved 
 her from disappointing his reliance on her judgment. 
 Her children, so carefully planned by her to inherit her 
 intelligence with their father's robustness, proved to her 
 that heredity is not so simple a matter as her father's 
 generation supposed. They were healthy enough, cer- 
 tainly ; and in their childhood they were all alike in

 being precocious and impudent, having no respect for 
 Cashel, and shewing any they had for their mother prin- 
 cipally by running to her when they were in difficulties. 
 Of punishments and scoldings they had no experience. 
 Cashel was incapable of deliberate retaliation upon a 
 child ; and in sudden emergencies of temper he could 
 always master his hands : perhaps because he had learnt 
 to do so in the ring : perhaps because he remembered his 
 own childhood. Lydia controlled her children, as far as 
 they were controllable, just as she controlled every one 
 else. When she spoke of them to Cashel in private, he 
 seldom said more than that the inips were too sharp for 
 him, or that he was blest if he didnt believe they were 
 born older than their fether. Lydia often thought so 
 too ; but the care of this troublesome family had one 
 advantage for her. It left her little time to think about 
 herself at the time when the illusion of her love passed 
 away, and she saw Cashel as he really was. She soon 
 came to regard him as one of the children. He was by 
 far the stupidest of them ; but he needed her more, 
 loved her more, and belonged to her more than any of 
 them. For as they grew up, and the heredity scheme 
 began to develop results, the boys disappointed her by 
 turning -out almost pure Carew, without the slightest 
 athletic aptitude, whilst the girls were impetuously 
 Byronic : indeed one of them, to Cashel's utter dismay, 
 cast back so completely to his mother that when she 
 announced, at thirteen, ' her intention of going on the 
 stage, he bowed to her decision as to the voice of Destiny. 
 Alice Goff, when she heard of. Lydia's projected 
 marriage, saw that she must return to Wiltstoken and 
 forget her brief social splendor as soon as possible. She 
 therefore thanked Miss Carew for her bounty, and begged 
 to relinquish her post of companion. Lydia assented, 
 but managed to delay this sacrifice to a sense of duty and

 necessity until a day early in winter, when Lucian, who 
 felt inclined to commit suicide, allowed his cousin to 
 persuade him to offer his hand to Alice. She indignantly 
 refused : not that she had ajiy reason to complain of him, 
 but because the prospect ,of returning to Wiltstoken 
 made her feel ill-used, and she could not help revenging 
 her soreness upon the first person she could .find a pre- 
 text for attacking. He, lukewarm before, now became 
 eager ; and she, after trampling on him to her heart's 
 content for months, drifted into an engagement, and was 
 promptly married to him by Lydia, who took the matter 
 in hand with her usual decision. She kept Lucian's 
 house, entertained his guests, and domineered over his 
 select social circle with complete success. She was some- 
 thing of a domestic bully; but her empire over her husband 
 and home was never shaken. Lucian found unexpected 
 depth and strength in her nature ; and his uxoriousness 
 was only held in check by the fierce impatience with 
 which she sometimes made him feel that the excess of 
 his content was measured by the shortcoming of hers. 
 She invited her brother-in-law and his wife to dinner every 
 Christmas day, and once a year in the season ; but she 
 never admitted that Wallace Parker and Cashel Byron 
 were gentlemen, though she invited the latter freely, 
 notwithstanding the frankness with which he spoke of 
 his former exploits to strangers after dinner, without 
 deference to their professions or prejudices. Her respect 
 for Lydia remained so great that she never complained 
 of Cashel save on one occasion, when, at a very special 
 dinner party in her house, he shewed a bishop, whose 
 mansion had been recently broken into and robbed, how 
 to break a burglar's back in the act of grappling with 
 him. 
 
 The Skenes returned to Australia and went their way 
 there, as Mrs. Byron did in England, in the paths they

 had pursued for years before. Cashel spoke always of 
 Mrs. Skene as "mother," and of Mrs. Byron as 
 " mamma." 
 
 William Paradise, though admired by the fair sex for 
 his strength, courage and fame, was not, like Cashel and 
 Skene, wise or fortunate enough to get a good wife. So 
 exceedingly did he drink that he had but few sober 
 intervals after his escape from the law. He claimed the 
 title of champion of England on Cashel's retirement from 
 the ring, and challenged the world. The world responded 
 in the persons of sundry young laboring men with a 
 thirst for glory and a taste for fighting. Paradise fought 
 and prevailed twice. Then he drank whilst in training, 
 and was beaten. By this time, too, the ring had lapsed 
 into the disrepute from which Cashel's unusual combina- 
 tion of pugilistic genius with honesty had temporarily 
 raised it ; and the law, again seizing Paradise as he was 
 borne vanquished from the field, atoned for its former 
 leniency by incarcerating him for six months. The 
 abstinence thus enforced restored him to health and 
 vigor ; . and he achieved another victory before he 
 succeeded in drinking himself into his former state. 
 This was his last triumph. With his natural ruffianism 
 complicated by drunkenness, he went rapidly down the 
 hiU into the Valley of Humiliation. Becoming noted for 
 his readiness to sell the victories he could no longer win, 
 he only appeared in the ring to test the capabilities of 
 untried youths, who beat him with all the ardor of their 
 age. He became a potman, and was immediately dis- 
 charged as an inebriate. He had sunk into beggary 
 when, hearing in his misery that his former antagonist 
 was contesting a parliamentary election, he applied to 
 him for alms. Cashel at the time was in Dorsetshire ; 
 but Lydia relieved the destitute bruiser, whose condition 
 was now far worse than it had been at their last meeting.

 At his next application, which followed soon, he was 
 confronted by Cashel, who bullied him fiercely ; 
 threatened to break every bone in his skin if he ever 
 dared present himself again before Lydia ; flung him five 
 shillings ; and bade him begone. For Cashel retained 
 for Paradise that contemptuous and ruthless hatred . in 
 which a duly qualified professor holds a quack. The 
 poor wretch, inured to insult and violence from men who 
 had once feared his prowess as he, to give him such 
 credit as he cared for, had never feared Cashel's, thought 
 the abuse natural, and the gift generous. He picked up 
 the money and shambled oiF to buy a few pence-worth 
 of food, which he could hardly eat ; and to spend the 
 rest in brandy, which he drank as fast as his stomach 
 would endure it. Shortly afterwards, a few newspapers 
 reported his death, which they attributed to "con- 
 sumption, brought on by the terrible injuries sustained 
 by him in his celebrated fight with Cashel Byron."

PREFACE 
 
 The Admirable Bashville is a product of the British law 
 of copyright. As that law stands at present, the first 
 person who patches up a stage version of a novel, how- 
 ever worthless and absurd that version may be, and has it 
 read by himself and a few confederates to another con- 
 federate who has paid for admission in a hall licensed for 
 theatrical performances, secures the stage rights of that 
 novel, even as against the author himself ; and the author 
 must buy him out before he can touch his own work for 
 the purposes of the stage. 
 
 A famous case in point is the drama of East Lynne, 
 adapted from the late Mrs Henry Wood's novel of that 
 name. It was enormously popular, and is still the surest 
 refuge of touring companies in distress. Many authors 
 feel that Mrs Henry Wood was hardly used in not 
 getting any of the money which was plentifully made in 
 this way through her story. To my mind, since her 
 literary copyright probably brought her a fair wage for 
 the work of writing the book, her real grievance was, 
 first, that her name and credit were attached to a play 
 with which she had nothing to do, and which may quite 
 possibly have been to her a detestable travesty and pro- 
 fanation of her story ; and second, that the authors of

 that play had the legal power to prevent her from having 
 any version of her ow^n performed, if she had w^ished to 
 make one. 
 
 There is only one way in which the author can protect 
 himself; and that is by making a version of his own and 
 going through the same legal farce with it. But the 
 legal farce involves the hire of a hall and the payment 
 of a fee of two guineas to the King's Reader of Plays. 
 When I wrote Cashel Byron's Profession I had no 
 guineas to spare, a common disability of young authors. 
 What is equally common, I did not know the law. A 
 reasonable man may guess a reasonable law ; but no man 
 can guess a foolish anomaly. Fortunately, by the time 
 my book so suddenly revived in America, I was aware 
 of the danger, and in a position to protect myself by 
 writing and performing The Admirable Bashville. The 
 prudence of doing so was soon demonstrated ; for rumors 
 soon reached me of several American stage versions ; and 
 one of these has actually been played in New York, with 
 the boxing scenes under the management (so it is stated) 
 of the eminent pugilist Mr James Corbett. The New 
 York press, in a somewhat derisive vein, conveyed the 
 impression that in this version Cashel Byron sought to 
 interest the public rather as the last of the noble race of 
 the Byrons of Dorsetshire than as his unromantic self; 
 but in justice to a play which I never read, and an 
 actor whom I never saw, and who honorably offered 
 to treat me as if I had legal rights in the matter, I must 
 not accept the newspaper evidence as conclusive. 
 
 As I write these words, I am promised by the King 
 in his speech to Parliament a new Copyright Bill. I 
 believe it embodies, in our British fashion, the recom- 
 mendations of the book publishers as to the concerns of 
 the authors, and the notions of the musical publishers as 
 to the concerns of the playwrights. As author and play-

 wright I am duly obliged to the Commission for saving 
 me the trouble of speaking for myself^ and to the wit- 
 nesses for speaking for me. But unless Parliament takes 
 the opportunity of giving the authors of all printed 
 works of fiction, whether dramatic or narrative, both 
 playright and copyright (as in America), such to be 
 independent of any insertions or omissions of formulas 
 about " all rights reserved " or the like, I am afraid the 
 new Copyright Bill will leave me with exactly the 
 opinion both of the copyright law and the wisdom 
 of Parliament I at present entertain. As a good Socialist 
 I do not at all object to the limitation of my right of 
 property in my own works to a comparatively brief period, 
 followed by complete Communism : in fact, I cannot see 
 why the same salutary limitation should not be applied to 
 all property rights whatsoever ; but a system which enables 
 any alert sharper to acquire property rights in my stories 
 as against myself and the rest of the community would, it 
 seems to me, justify a rebellion if authors were numerous 
 and warlike enough to make one. 
 
 It may be asked why I have written The Admirable 
 Bashville in blank verse. My answer is that I had but 
 a week to write it in. Blank verse is so childishly 
 easy and expeditious (hence, by the way, Shakespear's 
 copious output), that by adopting it I was enabled to do 
 within the week what would have cost me a month 
 in prose. 
 
 Besides, I am fond of blank verse. Not nineteenth 
 century blank verse, of course, nor indeed, with a very 
 few exceptions, any post - Shakespearean blank verse. 
 Nay, not Shakespearean blank verse itself later than the 
 histories. When an author can write the prose dialogue 
 of the first scene in As You Like It, or Hamlet's 
 colloquies with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, there is 
 really no excuse for The Seven Ages and " To be or

 not to be," except the excuse of a haste that made great 
 facility indispensable. I am quite sure that any one who 
 is to recover the charm of blank verse must frankly go 
 back to its beginnings and start a literary pre-Raphaelite 
 Brotherhood. I like the melodious sing-song, the clear 
 simple one-line and two-line sayings, and the occasional 
 rhymed tags, like the half closes in an eighteenth 
 century symphony, in Peele, Kyd, Greene, and the 
 histories of Shakespear. How any one with music in 
 him can turn from Henry VI., John, and the two 
 Richards to such a mess of verse half developed into 
 rhetorical prose as Cymbeline, is to me explicable only 
 by the uncivil hypothesis that the artistic qualities in 
 the Elizabethan drama do not exist for most of its critics ; 
 so that they hang on to its purely prosaic content, and 
 hypnotize themselves into absurd exaggerations of the 
 value of that content. Even poets fall under the spell. 
 Ben Jonson described Marlowe's line as "mighty" ! As 
 well put Michael Angelo's epitaph on the tombstone of 
 Paolo Uccello. No wonder Jonson's blank verse is the 
 most horribly disagreeable product in literature, and in- 
 dicates his most prosaic mood as surely as his shorter 
 rhymed measures indicate his poetic mood. Marlowe 
 never wrote a mighty line in his life : Cowper's single 
 phrase, " Toll for the brave, " drowns all his mightinesses 
 as Great Tom drowns a military band. But Marlowe 
 took that very pleasant-sounding rigmarole of Peele and 
 Greene, and added to its sunny daylight the insane 
 splendors of night, and the cheap tragedy of crime. 
 Because he had only a common sort of brain, he was 
 hopelessly beaten by Shakespear ; but he had a fine ear and 
 a soaring spirit : in short, one does not forget " wanton 
 Arethusa's azure arms " and the like. But the pleasant- 
 sounding rigmarole was the basis of the whole thing; 
 and as long as that rigmarole was practised frankly for

Preface 289 
 
 the sake of its pleasantness, it was readable and speak- 
 able. It lasted until Shakespear did to it what Raphael 
 did to Italian painting: that is, overcharged and burst it 
 by making it the vehicle of a new order of thought, in- 
 volving a mass of intellectual ferment and psychological 
 research. The rigmarole could not stand the strain ; 
 and Shakespear's style ended in a chaos of half-shattered 
 old forms, half-emancipated new ones, with occasional 
 bursts of prose eloquence on the one hand, occasional 
 delicious echoes of the rigmarole, mostly from Calibans 
 and masque personages, on the other, with, alas! a great 
 deal of filling up with formulary blank verse which 
 had no purpose except to save the author's time and 
 thought. 
 
 When a great man destroys an art form in this way, 
 its ruins make palaces for the clever would-be great. 
 After Michael Angelo and Raphael, Giulio Romano and 
 the Carracci. After Marlowe and Shakespear, Chapman 
 and the Police News poet Webster. Webster's speciality 
 was blood : Chapman's, balderdash. Many of us by this 
 time find it difficult to believe that pre-Ruskinite art 
 criticism used to prostrate itself before the works of 
 Domenichino and Guido, and to patronizje the modest 
 little beginnings of those who came between Cimabue 
 and Masaccio. But we have only to look at our 
 own current criticism of Elizabethan drama to satisfy 
 ourselves that in an art which has not yet found its 
 Ruskin or its pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the same folly 
 is still academically propagated. It is possible, and even 
 usual, for men professing to have ears and a sense of poetry 
 to snub Peele and Greene and grovel before Fletcher and 
 Webster — Fletcher! a facile blank verse penny-a-liner: 
 Webster! a turgid paper cut -throat. The subject is 
 one which I really cannot pursue without intemperance 
 of language. The man who thinks The Duchess of

 Malfi better than David and Bethsabe is outside the pale, 
 not merely of literature, but almost of humanity. 
 
 Yet some of the worst of these post-Shakespearean 
 duffers, from Jonson to Heywood, suddenly became poets 
 when they turned from the big drum of pseudo-Shak- 
 spearean drama to the pipe and tabor of the masque, 
 exactly as Shakespear himself recovered the old charm of 
 the rigmarole when he turned from Prospero to Ariel 
 and Caliban. Cyril Tourneur and Heywood could cer- 
 tainly have produced very pretty rigmarole plays if they 
 had begun where Shakespear began, instead of trying to 
 begin where he left off. Jonson and Beaumont would 
 very likely have done themselves credit on the same 
 terms : Marston would have had at least a chance. Mas- 
 singer was in his right place, such as it was ; and one 
 would not disturb the gentle Ford, who was never born to 
 storm the footlights. Webster could have done no good 
 anyhow or anywhere: the man was a fool. And Chap- 
 man would always have been a blathering unreadable 
 pedant, like Landor, in spite of his classical amateurship 
 and respectable strenuosity of character. But with these 
 exceptions it may plausibly be held that if Marlowe 
 and Shakespear could have been kept out of their way, 
 the rest would have done well enough on the lines of 
 Peele and Greene. However, they thought otherwise; 
 and now that their freethinking paganism, so dazzling to 
 the pupils of Paley and the converts of Wesley, offers 
 itself in vain to the disciples of Darwin and Nietzsche, 
 there is an end of them. And a good riddance, too. 
 
 Accordingly, I have poetasted The Admirable Bash- 
 ville in the rigmarole style. And lest the Webster 
 worshippers should declare that there is not a single 
 correct line in all my three acts, I have stolen or 
 paraphrased a few from Marlowe and Shakespear (not 
 to mention Henry Carey) ; so that if any man dares

 quote me derisively, he shall do so in peril of inadvertently 
 lighting on a purple patch from Hamlet or Faustus. 
 
 I have also endeavored in this little play to prove that. 
 I am not the heartless creature some of my critics take me 
 for. I have strictly observed the established laws of stage 
 popularity and probability. I have simplified the char- 
 acter of the heroine, and summed up her sweetness in 
 the one sacred word : Love. I have given consistency 
 to the heroism of Cashel. I have paid to Morality, in 
 the final scene, the- tribute of poetic justice. I have 
 restored to Patriotism its usual place on the stage, and 
 gracefully acknowledged The Throne as the fountain of 
 social honor. I have paid particular attention to the 
 construction of the play, which will be found equal in 
 this respect to the best contemporary models. 
 
 And I trust the result will be found satisfactory.

 CASHEL. Lives in this castle \ Owns this park ! A

 Marry a prizefighter ! Impossible. 
 And yet the prizefighter must marry her. 
 
 Enter Mellish 
 
 Ensanguined swine, whelped by a doggish dam. 
 Is this thy park, that thou, with voice obscene, 
 Fillst it with yodeled yells, and screamst my name 
 For all the world to know that Cashel Byron 
 Is training here for combat. 
 
 MELLISH. Swine you me ? 
 
 Ive caught you, have I ? You have found a woman. 
 Let her shew here again, I'll set the dog on her. 
 I will. I say it. And my name's Bob Mellish. 
 
 CASHEL. Change thy initial and be truly hight 
 Hellish. As for thy dog, why dost thou keep one 
 And bark thyself? Begone.

 Your duty to your backers, do you hear ?

 CASHEL. The putrid bag engirdled by thy belt 
 Invites my fist. 
 
 MELLISH [weepingl Ingrate ! O wrretched lot ! 
 Who would a trainer be ? O Mellish, Mellish, 
 Trainer of heroes, builder-up of brawn. 
 Vicarious victor, thou createst champions 
 That quickly turn thy tyrants. But beware : 
 Without me thou art nothing. Disobey me. 
 And all thy boasted strength shall fall from thee. 
 With flaccid muscles and with felling breath 
 Facing the fist of thy more faithful foe, 
 I'll see thee on the grass cursing the day 
 Thou didst forswear thy training. 
 
 CASHEL. Noisome quack 
 
 That canst not from thine own abhorrent visage 
 Take one carbuncle, thou contaminat'st 
 Even with thy presence my untainted blood. 
 Preach abstinence to rascals like thyself 
 Rotten with surfeiting. Leave me in peace. 
 This grove is sacred : thou profanest it. 
 Hence ! I have business that concerns thee not. 
 
 MELLISH. Ay, with your woman. You will lose your 
 fight. 
 Have you forgot your duty to your backers ? 
 Oh, what a sacred thing your duty i^ ! 
 What makes a man but duty ? Where were we 
 Without our duty ? Think of Nelson's words :

 CASHEL. Shall twaddle 
 
 About his duty. Mellish : at no hour 
 Can I regard thee wholly without loathing ;

 But when thou playst the moralist, by Heaven, 
 My soul flies to my fist, my fist to thee ; 
 And never did the Cyclops' hammer fall 
 On Mars's armor — but enough of that. 
 It does remind me of my mother. 
 
 MELLISH. Ah, 
 
 Byron, let it. remind thee. Once I heard 
 An old song : it ran thus. [He clears his throat] Ahem, 
 Ahem! 
 [Siftgs] — They say there is no other 
 
 Can take the place of mother- — 
 I am out o' voice : forgive me ; but remember : 
 Thy mother — w^ere that sainted woman here — 
 Would say, Obey thy trainer. 
 
 CASHEL. Now, by Heaven, 
 
 Some fate is pushing thee upon thy doom. 
 Canst thou not hear thy sands as they run out ? 
 They thunder like an avalanche. Old man : 
 Two things I hate, my duty and my mother. 
 Why dost thou urge them both upon me now ? 
 Presume not on thine age and on thy nastiness. 
 Vanish, and promptly. 
 
 MELLISH. Can I leave thee here 
 
 Thus thinly clad, exposed to vernal dews ? 
 Come back with me, my son, unto our lodge. 
 
 CASHEL. Within this breast a fire is newly lit 
 Whose glow shall sun the dew away, whose radiance 
 Shall make the orb of night hang in the heavens 
 Unnoticed, like a glow-worm at high noon. 
 
 MELLISH. Ah me, ah me, where wilt thou spend the 
 night ? 
 
 CASHEL. Wiltstoken's windows wandering beneath, 
 Wiltstoken's holy bell hearkening, 
 Wiltstoken's lady loving breathlessly.

 Now from the ring to the high judgment seat

 LUCiAN. I have been greatly occupied of late. 
 The minister to whom I act as scribe 
 In Downing Street was born in Birmingham, 
 And, like a thoroughbred commercial statesman, 
 Splits his infinitives, which I, poor slave, 
 Must reunite, though all the time my heart 
 Yearns for my gentle coz's company. 
 
 LYDiA. Lucian : there is some other reason. Think ! 
 Since England was a nation every mood 
 Her scribes have prepositionally split ; 
 But thine avoidance dates from yestermonth. 
 
 LUCIAN. There is a man I like not haunts this house. 
 
 i.YDiA. Thou speakst of Cashel Byron ? 
 
 LUCIAN. Aye, of him. 
 
 Hast thou forgotten that eventful night 
 When as we gathered were at Hoskyn House. 
 To hear a lecture by Herr Abendgasse, 
 He placed a single finger on my chest. 
 And I, ensorceled, would have sunk supine 
 Had not a chair received my falling form. 
 
 Lydia. Pooh ! That was but by way of illustration. 
 
 LuciAN. What right had he to illustrate his point 
 Upon my person ? Was I his assistant 
 That he should try experiments on me 
 As Simpson did on his with chloroform ? 
 Now, by the cannon balls of Galileo 
 He hath unmanned me : all my nerve is gone. 
 This very morning my official chief. 
 Tapping with friendly forefinger this button. 
 Levelled me like a thunderstricken elm 
 Flat upon the Colonial Office floor.

 Looked none the worse in the Australian's corner.

 But found the champion there already. Both 
 Most heartily shook hands, amid the cheers 
 Of their encouraged backers. Two to one 
 Was offered on the Melbourne nonpareil ; 
 And soon, so fit the Flying Dutchman seemed, 
 Found takers everywhere. No time was lost 
 In getting to the business of the day. 
 The Dutchman led at once, and seemed to land 
 On Byron's dicebox ; but the seaman's reach. 
 Top short for execution at long shots, 
 Did not get fairly home upon the ivory ; 
 And Byron had the best of the exchange." 
 
 LYDIA. I do not understand. What were they doing ? 
 
 LUCIAN. Fighting with naked fists. 
 
 LYDIA. , Oh, horrible !

 LUCIAN [to Bashvjlle] Skip to the final round.

 about 
 Of a breakdown in Byron's recent training 
 Seemed quite confirmed. Upon the call of time 
 He rose, and, looking anything but cheerful, 
 Proclaimed with every breath Bellows to Mend. 
 At this point six to one was freely ofi«red 
 Upon the Dutchman ; and Lord Worthington 
 Plunged at this figure till he stood to lose

 Forcing the fighting mid tremendous cheers." 
 
 LYDiA. Oh stop — no more — or tell the worst at once.

 Contest elections, and at foot o' th' poll

 To be a prizefighter, and maul poor mariners 
 With naked knuckles, is no work for you. 
 
 CASHEL. Thou dost arraign the inattentive Fates 
 That weave my thread of life in ruder patterns 
 Than these that lie, antimacassarly, 
 Asprent thy drawingroom. As well demand 
 Why I at birth chose to begin my life 
 A speechless babe, hairless, incontinent, 
 Hobbling upon all fours, a nurse's nuisance ? 
 Or why I do propose to lose my strength. 
 To blanch my hair, to let the gums recede 
 Far up my yellowing teeth, and finally 
 Lie down and moulder in a rotten grave ? 
 Only one thing more foolish could have been. 
 And that was to be born, not man, but woman.

 Fight for us, and be fame and fortune thine ?

 CASHEL. Go tell thy painters to turn stockbrokers. 
 Thy poet friends to stoop oer merchants' desks 
 And pen prose records of the gains of greed. 
 Tell bishops that religion is outworn. 
 And that the Pampa to the horsebreaker 
 Opes new careers. Bid the professor quit 
 His fraudulent pedantries, and do i' the world 
 The thing he would teach others. Then return 
 To me and say : Cashel : they have obeyed ; 
 And on that pyre of sacrifice I, too. 
 Will throw my championship.

 So cruel are all callings. Yet this hand. 
 That many a two days bruise hath ruthless given, 
 Hath kept no dungeon locked for twenty years, 
 Hath slain no sentient creature for my sport. 
 I am too squeamish for your dainty world. 
 That cowers behind the gallows and the lash, 
 The world that robs the poor, and with their spoil 
 Does what its tradesmen tell it. Oh, your ladies ! 
 Sealskinned and egret-feathered ; all defiance 
 To Nature ; cowering if one say to them 
 " What will the servants think ? " Your gentlemen ! 
 Your tailor-tyrannized visitors of whom

 Almost to the whole world, might for a Man

 Had but one breadbasket, that with my fist

 Gasp itself out on the gravel. Fare you well. 
 I did not choose my calling ; but at least 
 I can refrain from being a gentleman.

 CASHEL. My calling hath apprenticed me to pangs. 
 This is a rib-bender ; but I can bear it.

 Or, if thou hast nostalgia of the mud.

 Of gilded snobbery, ventre a terre.

 And hang thee thick with diamonds. I am rich ;

 Counting the steps of his approaching doom,

 Two horrid shadows. Death and Poverty : 
 
 In the which anguish an unnatural edge 
 
 Comes on his frighted brain, which straight devises 
 
 Strange frauds by which to filch unearned gold.

NOTE ON MODERN PRIZE- 
 FIGHTING 
 
 In 1882, when this book was written, prizefighting 
 seemed to be dying out. Sparring matches with boxing 
 gloves, under the Queensberry rules, kept pugilism faintly 
 alive ; but it was not popular, because the public, which 
 cares only for the excitement of a strenuous fight, 
 believed then that the boxing glove made sparring as 
 harmless a contest of pure skill as a fencing match with 
 buttoned foils. This delusion was supported by the 
 limitation of the sparring match to boxing. In the 
 prize ring under the old rules a combatant niight trip, 
 hold, or throw his antagonist ; so that each round finished 
 either with a knockdown blow, which, except when it is 
 really a liedown blow, is much commoner in fiction than 
 it was in the ring, or with a visible body-to-body struggle 
 ending in a fell. In a sparring match all that happens is 
 that a man with a watch in his hand cries out " Time ! " 
 whereupon the two champions prosaically stop sparring 
 and sit down- for a minute's rest and refreshment. The 
 unaccustomed and inexpert spectator in those days did 
 not appreciate the severity of the exertion or the risk 
 of getting hurt : he underrated them as ignorantly as 
 he would have overrated the more dramatically obvious 
 terrors of a prizefight. Consequently the interest in the

334 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 annual sparrings for the Queensberry Championships 
 was confined to the few amateurs who had some critical 
 knowledge of the game of boxing, and to the survivors 
 of the generation for which the fight between Sayers and 
 Heenan had been described in The Times as solemnly as 
 the University Boat Race. In short, pugilism was out of 
 fashion because the police had suppressed the only form of it 
 which fascinated the public by its undissembled pugnacity. 
 
 All that was needed to rehabilitate it was the discovery 
 that the glove fight is a more trying and dangerous form 
 of contest than the old knuckle fight. Nobody knew 
 that then : everybody knows it, or ought to know it, now. 
 And, accordingly, pugilism is more prosperous to-day 
 than it has ever been before. 
 
 How far this result was foreseen by the author of the 
 Queensberry Rules, which superseded those of the old 
 prize ring, will probably never be known. There is no 
 doubt that they served their immediate turn admirably. 
 That turn was, the keeping alive of boxing in the teeth 
 of the law against prizefighting. Magistrates believed, 
 as the public believed, that when men's knuckles were 
 muffled in padded gloves ; when they were forbidden to 
 wrestle or hold one another ; when the duration of a 
 round was fixed by the clock, and the number of rounds 
 limited to what seems (to those who have never tried) 
 to be easily within the limits of ordinary endurance ; and 
 when the traditional interval for rest between the rounds 
 was doubled, that then indeed violence must be check- 
 mated, so that the worst the boxers could do was to " spar 
 for points" before three gentlemanly members of the 
 Stock Exchange, who would carefully note the said points 
 on an examination paper at the ring side, awarding marks 
 only for skill and elegancfe, and sternly discountenancing 
 the claims of brute force. It may be that both the 
 author of the rules and the "judges" who administered

 them in the earher days really believed all this ; for, as 
 far as I know, the limit of an amateur pugilist's romantic 
 credulity has never yet been reached and probably never 
 will. But if so, their good intentions were iipset by the 
 operation of a single new rule. Thus. 
 
 In the old prize ring a round had no fixed duration. 
 It was terminated by the fall of one of the combatants (in 
 practice usually both of them), and was followed by an 
 interval of half a minute for recuperation. The practical 
 effect of this was that a combatant could always get a 
 respite of half a minute whenever he wanted it by pre- 
 tending to be knocked down : " finding the earth the 
 safest place," as the old phrase went. For this the 
 Marquess of Queensberry substituted a rule that a round 
 with the gloves should last a specified time, usually three 
 or four minutes, and that a combatant who did not stand 
 up to his opponent continuously during that time (ten 
 seconds being allowed for rising in the event of a knock- 
 down) lost the battle. That unobtrusively slipped-in 
 ten seconds limit has produced the modern glove fight. 
 Its practical effect is that a man dazed by a blow or a fall 
 for, say, twelve seconds, which would not have mattered in 
 an old-fashioned fight with its thirty seconds interval,^ has 
 
 ^ In a treatise on boxing by Captain Edgeworth Johnstone, just published, 
 I read, " In the days of the prize ring, fights lasted for hours ; and the knoclc- 
 out blow was unknown." This statement is a little too sweeping. The 
 blow was known well enough. A veteran prizefighter once described to me 
 his first experience of its curious effect on the senses. Only, as 'he had 
 thirty seconds to recover in instead of ten, it did not end the battle. The 
 thirty seconds made the knock-out so unlikely that the old pugilists regarded 
 it as a rare accident, not worth trying for. The glove fighter tries for 
 nothing else. Nevertheless knock-outs, and very dramatic ones too (Mace 
 by King, for example), did occur in the prize ring from time to time. 
 Captain Edgeworth Johnstone's treatise is noteworthy in comparison with 
 the earlier Badminton handbook of sparring by Mr. E. B. Michell (one of 
 the Queensberry champions) as throwing over the old teaching of prize-ring 
 boxing with mufflers, and going in frankly for glove fighting, or, to put it 
 classically, cestus boxing.

 under the Queensberry rules either to lose or else stagger 
 to his feet in a helpless condition and be eagerly battered 
 into insensibility by his opponent before he can recover 
 his powers of self-defence. The notion that such battery 
 cannot be inflicted with boxing gloves is only entertained 
 by people who have never used them or seen them used. 
 I may say that I have myself received, in an accident, a 
 blow in the face, involving two macadamized holes in it, 
 more violent than the most formidable pugilist could have 
 given me with his bare knuckles. This blow did not 
 stun or disable me even momentarily. On the other 
 hand, I have seen a man knocked quite silly by a tap from 
 the most luxurious sort of boxing glove made, wielded by 
 a quite unathletic literary man sparring for the first time 
 in his life. The human jaw, like the human elbow, is 
 provided, as every boxer knows, with a " funny bone " ; 
 and the pugilist who is lucky enough to jar that funny 
 bone with a blow practically has his opponent at his 
 mercy for at least ten seconds. Such a blow is called a 
 "knock-out." The funny bone and the ten seconds, 
 rule explain the development of Queensberry sparring 
 into the modern knocking-out match or glove fight. 
 
 This development got its first impulse from the dis- 
 covery by sparring competitors that the only way in 
 which a boxer, however skilful, could make sure of a 
 verdict in his favor, was by knocking his opponent out. 
 This will be easily understood by any one who remembers 
 the pugilistic Bench of those days. The "judges" 
 at the competitions were invariably ex-champions : that 
 is, men who had themselves won former competitions. 
 Now the judicial faculty, if it is not altogether a legal 
 fiction, is at all events pretty rare even among men whose 
 ordinary pursuits tend to cultivate it, and to train them 
 in dispassionateness. Among pugilists it is quite cer- 
 tainly very often non-existent. The average pugilist is

 a violent partisan, who seldom witnesses a hot encounter 
 without getting much more excited than the combatants 
 themselves. Further, he is usually filled with a local 
 patriotism which makes him, if a Londoner, deem it a 
 duty to disparage a provincial, and, if a provincial, to 
 support a provincial at all hazards against a cockney. 
 He has, besides, personal favorites on whose success he 
 bets wildly. On great occasions like the annual com- 
 petitions, he is less judicial and more convivial after dinner 
 (when the finals are sparred) than before it. Being seldom 
 a fine boxer, he often regards skill and style as a reflection 
 on his own deficiencies, and applauds all verdicts given for 
 " game " alone. When he is a technically good boxer, 
 he is all the less likely to be a good critic, as Providence 
 seldom lavishes two rare gifts on the same individual. 
 Even if we take the sanguine and patriotic view that 
 when you appoint such a man a judge, and thus stop 
 his betting, you may depend on his sense of honor and 
 responsibility to neutralize all the other disqualifications, 
 they are sure to be exhibited most extremely by the 
 audience before which he has to deliver his verdict. 
 Now it takes a good deal of strength of mind to give 
 an unpopular verdict j and this strength of mind is not 
 necessarily associated with the bodily hardihood of the 
 champion bqxer. Consequently, when the strength of 
 mind is not forthcoming, the audience becomes the 
 judge, and the popular competitor gets the verdict. And 
 the shortest way to the heart of a big audience is to stick to 
 your man ; stop his blows bravely with your nose and return 
 them with interest ; cover yourself and him with your 
 own gore j and outlast him in a hearty punching match. 
 It was under these circumstances that the competitors 
 for sparring championships concluded that they had better 
 decide the bouts themselves by knocking their opponents 
 out,' and waste no time in cultivating a skill and style

 for which they got little credit, and which actually set 
 some of the judges against them. The public instantly 
 began to take an interest in the sport. And so, by a 
 pretty rapid evolution, the dexterities which the boxing 
 glove and the Queensberry rules were supposed to sub- 
 stitute for the ofd brutalities of Sayers and Heenan were 
 really abolished by them. 
 
 Let me describe the process as I saw it myself. 
 Twenty years ago a poet friend of mine, who, like all 
 poets, delighted in combats, insisted on my sharing 
 his interest in pugilism, and took me about to all 
 the boxing competitions of the day. I was nothing 
 loth ; for, my own share of original sin apart, any one 
 with a sense of comedy must find the arts of self-defence 
 delightful (for a time) through their pedantry, their 
 quackery, and their action and reaction between amateur 
 romantic illusion and professional eye to business. 
 
 The fencing world, as Moliere well knew, is perhaps 
 a more exquisite example of a fool's paradise than the 
 boxing world ; but it is too restricted and expensive to 
 allow play for popular character in a non-duelling country, 
 as the boxing world (formerly called quite appropriately 
 "the Fancy") does. At all events, it was the boxing 
 world that came under my notice ; and as I was amused and 
 sceptically "observant, whilst the true amateurs about me 
 were, for the most part, merely excited and duped, my 
 evidence may have a certain value when the question 
 comes up again for legislative consideration, as it assuredly 
 will some day. 
 
 The first competitions I attended were at the begin- 
 ning of the eighties, at LilKe Bridge, for the Queensberry 
 championships. There were but few competitors, in- 
 cluding a fair number of gentlemen ; and the style of 
 boxing aimed at was the "science" bequeathed from the 
 old prize ring by Ned Donnelly, a pupil of Nat Langham. 
 


## p. (#367) ################################################

Modern Prizefighting 339 
 
 Langham had once defeated Sayers, and thereby taught 
 him the tactics by which he defeated Heenan. There 
 was as yet no special technique of glove fighting : the 
 traditions and influence of the old ring were unquestioned 
 and supreme ; and they distinctly made for brains, skill, 
 quickness, and mobility, as against brute violence, not at 
 all on moral grounds, but because experience had proved 
 that giants did not succeed in the ring under the old 
 rules, and that crafty middle-weights did. 
 
 This did not last long. The spectators did not want to 
 see skill defeating violence : they wanted to see violence 
 drawing blood and pounding its way to a savage and 
 exciting victory in the shortest possible time (the old 
 prizefight usually dragged on for hours, and was ended 
 by exhaustion rather than by victory). So did most of 
 the judges. And the public and the judges naturally 
 had their wish ; for the competitors, as I have already 
 explained, soon discovered that the only way to make 
 sure of a favorable verdict was to "knock out" their 
 adversary. All pretence of sparring " for points " : that 
 is, for marks on an examination paper filled up by the 
 judges, and representing nothing but impracticable 
 academic pedantry in its last ditch, was dropped ; and 
 the competitions became frank fights, with abundance of 
 blood drawn, and "knock-outs" always imminent. Need- 
 less to add, the glove fight soon began to pay. The 
 select and thinly attended spars on the turf at Lillie Bridge 
 gave way to crowded exhibitions on the hard boards of 
 St. James's Hall. These were organized by the Boxing 
 Association ; and to them the provinces, notably Bir- 
 mingham, sent up a new race of boxers whose sole aim 
 was to knock their opponent insensible by a right-hand 
 blow on the jaw, knowing well that no Birmingham 
 man could depend on a verdict before a London audience 
 for any less undeniable achievement. 
 


## p. (#368) ################################################

340 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 The final step was taken by an American pugilist. 
 He threw off the last shred of the old hypocrisy of the 
 gloved hand by challenging the whole world to produce 
 a man who could stand before him for a specified time 
 without being knocked out. His brief but glorious 
 career completely re-established pugilism by giving a 
 world-wide advertisement to the fact that the boxing 
 glove spares nothing but the public conscience, and that 
 as much ferocity, bloodshed, pain, and risk of serious 
 injury or death can be enjoyed at a glove fight as at an 
 old-fashioned prizefight, whilst the strain on the com- 
 batants is much greater. It is true that these horrors 
 are greatly exaggerated by the popular imagination, and 
 that if boxing were really as dangerous as bicycling, a 
 good many of its heroes would give it up from simple 
 fright ; but this only means that there is the maximum 
 of damage to the spectator by demoralization, combined 
 with the minimum of deterrent risk to the poor scrapper 
 in the ring. 
 
 Poor scrapper, though, is hardly the word for a 
 modern fashionable American pugilist. To him the 
 exploits of Cashel Byron will seem ludicrously obscure 
 and low-lived. The contests in which he engages are 
 like Handel Festivals : they take place in huge halls 
 before enormous audiences, with cinematographs hard at 
 work recording the scene for reproduction in London 
 and elsewhere. The combatants divide thousands of 
 dollars of gate - money between them : indeed, if an 
 impecunious English curate were to go to America and 
 challenge the premier pugilist, the spectacle of a match 
 between the Church and the Ring would attract a colossal 
 crowd ; and the loser's share of the gate would be a 
 fortune to a curate — assuming that the curate would be 
 the loser, which is by no means a foregone conclusion. 
 At all events, it would be well worth a bruise or two.

 So my story of the Agricultural Hall, where William 
 Paradise sparred for half a guinea, and Cashel Byron stood 
 out for ten guineas, is no doubt read by the profession in 
 America with amused contempt. In 1882 it was, like 
 most of my conceptions, a daring anticipation of coming 
 social developments, though to-day it seems as far out of 
 date as Slender pulling Sackerson's chain. 
 
 Of these latter-day commercial developments of glove 
 fighting I know nothing beyond what I gather from the 
 newspapers. The banging matches of the eighties, in 
 which not one competitor in twenty either exhibited 
 artistic skill, or, in his efforts to knock out his adversary, 
 succeeded in anything but tiring and disappointing him- 
 self, were for the most part tedious beyond human endur- 
 ance. When, after wading through Boxiana and the 
 files of Bell's Life at the British Museum, I had written 
 Cashel Byron's Profession, I found I had exhausted the 
 comedy of the subject ; and as a game of patience or 
 solitaire was decidedly superior to an average spar for a 
 championship in point of excitement, I went no more to 
 the competitions. Since then six or seven generations of 
 boxers have passed into peaceful pursuits ; and I have no 
 doubt that my experience is in some respects out of date. 
 The National Sporting Club has arisen ; and though I 
 have never attended its reunions, I take its record of 
 three pugilists slain as proving an enormous multiplication 
 of contests, since such accidents are very rare, and in fact 
 do not happen to reasonably healthy men. I am prepared 
 to admit also that the disappearance of the old prize-ring 
 technique must by this time have been compensated by 
 the importation from America of a new glove-fighting 
 technique ; for even in a knocking- out match, brains 
 will try conclusions with brawn, and finally establish a 
 standard of skill ; but I notice that in the leading contests 
 in America luck seems to be on the side of brawn, and

 brain frequently finishes in a state of concussion, a loser 
 after performing miracles of "science." I use the word 
 luck advisedly ; for one of the fascinations of boxing to 
 the gambler (who is the main pillar of the sporting world) 
 is that it is a ^ game of hardihood, pugnacity and skill, all 
 at the mercy of chance. The knock-out itself is a pure 
 chance. I have seen two powerful laborers batter one 
 another's jaws with all their might for several rounds 
 apparently without giving one another as much as a 
 toothache. And I have seen a winning pugilist collapse 
 at a trifling knock landed by a fluke at the fatal angle. 
 I once asked an ancient prizefighter what a knock-out 
 was like when it did happen. He was a man of limited 
 descriptive powers ; so he simply pointed to the heavens 
 and said " Up in a balloon." An amateur pugilist, with 
 greater command of language, told me that " all the milk 
 in his head suddenly boiled over." I am aware that some 
 modern glove fighters of the American school profess to 
 have reduced the knock-out to a science, But the results 
 of the leading American combats conclusively discredit 
 the pretension. When a boxer so superior to his opponent 
 in skill as to be able practically to hit him where he 
 pleases not only fails to knock him out, but finally gets 
 knocked out himself, it is clear that the phenomenon is 
 as complete a mystery pugilistically as it is physiologically, 
 though every pugilist and every doctor may pretend to 
 understand it. It is only fair to add that it has not been 
 proved that any permanent injury to the brain results 
 from it. In any case the brain, as English society is 
 at present constituted, can hardly be considered a vital 
 organ. 
 
 This, to the best of my knowledge, is the technical 
 history of the modern revival of pugilism. It is only one 
 more example of the fact that legislators, like other 
 people, must learn their business by their own mistakes. 
 


## p. (#371) ################################################

 and that the first attempts to suppress an evil by law 
 generally intensify it. Prizefighting, though often con- 
 nived at, was never legal. Even in its palmiest days 
 prizefights were banished from certain counties by hostile 
 magistrates, just as they have been driven from the United 
 States and England to Belgium on certain occasions in 
 our own time. But as the exercise of sparring, conducted 
 by a couple of gentlemen with boxing gloves on, was 
 regarded as part of a manly physical education, a conven- 
 tion grew up by which it became practically legal to 
 make a citizen's nose bleed by a punch from the gloved 
 fist, and illegal to do the same thing with the naked 
 knuckles. 'A code of glove-fighting rules was drawn up 
 by a prominent patron of pugilism ; and this code was 
 practically legalized by the fact that even when a death 
 resulted from a contest under these rules the accessaries 
 were not punished. No question was raised as to whether 
 the principals were paid to fight for the amusement of 
 the spectators, or whether a prize for the winner was 
 provided in stakes, share of the gate, or a belt with the 
 title of champion. These, the true criteria of prize- 
 fighting, were ignored ; and the sole issue raised was 
 whether the famous dictum of Dr. Watts, " Your little 
 hands were never made, etc.," had been duly considered 
 by providing the said little hands with a larger hitting 
 surface, a longer range, and four ounces extra weight. 
 
 In short, then, what has happened has been the virtual 
 legalization of prizefighting under cover of the boxing 
 glove. And this is exactly what public opinion desires. 
 We do not like fighting ; but we like looking on at 
 fights : therefore we require a law which will punish the 
 prizefighter if he hits us, and secure us the protection of 
 the police whilst we sit in a comfortable hall and watch 
 him hitting another prizefighter. And that is just the 
 law we have got at present. 
 


## p. (#372) ################################################

344 Cashel Byron's Profession 
 
 Thus Cashel Byron's plea for a share of the legal 
 toleration accorded to the vivisector has been virtually 
 granted since he made it. The legalization of cruelty 
 to domestic animals under cover of the anesthetic is only 
 the extreme instance of the same social phenomenon as 
 the legalization of prizefighting under cover of the boxing 
 glove. The same passion explains the fascination of 
 both practices ; and in both, the professors — pugilists and 
 physiologists alike — ^have to persuade the Home Office that 
 their pursuits are painless and beneficial. But there is 
 also between them the remarkable difference that the 
 pugilist, who has to suffer as much as he inflicts, wants 
 his work to be as painless and harmless as possible whilst 
 persuading the public that it is thrillingly dangerous and 
 destructive, whilst the vivisector wants to enjoy a total 
 exemption from humane restrictions in his laboratory 
 whilst persuading the public that pain is unknown there. 
 Consequently the vivisector is not only crueller than the 
 prizefighter, but, through the pressure of public opinion, 
 a much more resolute and uncompromising liar. For 
 this no one but a Pharisee will single him out for special 
 blame. All public men lie, as a matter of good taste, 
 on subjects which are considered serious (in England a 
 serious occasion means simply an occasion on which 
 nobody tells the truth) ; and however illogical or capri- 
 cious the point of honor may be in man, it is too absurd 
 to assume that the doctors who, from among innumer- 
 able methods of research, select that of tormenting 
 animals hideously, will hesitate to come on a platform 
 and tell a soothing fib to prevent the public from punish- 
 ing them. No criminal is expected to plead guilty, 
 or to .refrain from pleading not guilty with all the 
 plausibility at his command. In prizefighting such men- 
 dacity is not necessary : on the contrary, if a famous 
 pugilist were to assure the public that a blow delivered

 with a boxing glove could do no injury and cause no 
 pain, and the public believed him, the sport would in- 
 stantly lose its following. It is the prizefighter's interest 
 to abolish the real cruelties of the ring and to exaggerate 
 the imaginary cruelties of it. It is the vivisector's interest 
 to refine upon the cruelties of the laboratory, whilst per- 
 suading the public that his victims pass into a delicious 
 euthanasia and leave behind them a row of bottles con- 
 taining infallible cures for all the diseases. Just so, too, 
 does the trainer of performing animals assure us that his 
 dogs and cats and elephants and lions are taught their 
 senseless feats by pure kindness. 
 
 The public, as Julius Cassar remarked nearly 2000 
 years ago, believes, on the whole, just what it wants 
 to believe. The laboring masses do not believe the 
 false excuses of the vivisector, because they know that 
 the vivisector experiments on hospital patients; and 
 the masses belong to the hospital patient class. The 
 well-to-do people who do not go to hospitals, and who 
 think they benefit by the experiments made there, believe 
 the vivisectors' excuses, and angrily abuse and denounce 
 the anti-vivisectors. The people who "love animals," 
 who keep pets, and stick pins through butterflies, support 
 the performing dog people, and are sure that kindness 
 will teach a horse to waltz. And the people who enjoy 
 a fight will persuade themselves that boxing gloves do 
 not hurt, and that sparring is an exercise which teaches 
 self-control and exercises all the muscles in the body more 
 efEciently than any other. 
 
 My own view of prizefighting may be gathered from 
 Cashel Byron's Profession, and from the play written by 
 me more than ten years later, entitled Mrs Warren's 
 Profession. As long as society is so organized that the 
 destitute athlete and the destitute beauty are forced to 
 choose between underpaid drudgery as industrial pro-

 ducers, and comparative self-respect, plenty, and popu- 
 larity as prizefighters and mercenary brides, licit or 
 illicit, it is idle to affect virtuous indignation at their 
 expense. The word prostitute should either not be 
 used at all, or else applied impartially to all persons 
 who do things for money that they would not do if they 
 had any other assured means of livelihood. The evil 
 caused by the prostitution of the Press and the Pulpit 
 is so gigantic that the prostitution of the prize ring, 
 which at least makes no serious moral pretensions, is 
 comparatively negligeable by comparison. Let us not 
 forget, however, that the throwing of a hard word such 
 as prostitution does not help the persons thus vituperated 
 out of their difficulty. If the soldier and gladiator fight 
 for money, if men and women marry for money, if the 
 journalist and novelist write for money, and the parson 
 preaches for money, it must be remembered that it is 
 an exceedingly difficult and doubtful thing for an indi- 
 vidual to set up his own scruples or fancies (he cannot 
 himself be sure which they are) against the demand of 
 the community when it says. Do thus and thus, or starve. 
 It was easy for Ruskin to lay down the rule of dying 
 rather than doing unjustly ; but death is a plain thing : 
 justice a very obscure thing. How is an ordinary man 
 to draw the line between right and wrong otherwise than 
 by accepting public opinion on the subject ; and what 
 more conclusive expression of sincere public opinion can 
 there be than market demand ? Even when we repudiate 
 that and fall back on our private judgment, the matter 
 gathers doubt instead of clearness. The popular notion 
 of morality and piety is to simply beg all the most im- 
 portant questions in life for other people ; but when these 
 questions come home to ourselves, we suddenly discover 
 that the devil's advocate has a stronger case than we 
 thought : we remember that the way of righteousness or

 death was the way of the Inquisition ; that hell is paved, 
 not with bad intentions, but with good ones ; thaf the 
 deeper seers have suggested that the way to save your 
 soul is perhaps to give it away, casting your spiritual bread 
 Oil the waters, so to speak. No doubt, if you are a man 
 of genius, a Ruskin or an Ibsen, you can divine your 
 way and finally force your passage. If you have the 
 conceit of fanaticism you can die a martyr like Charles I. 
 If you are a criminal, or a gentleman of independent 
 means, you can leave society out of the question and prey 
 on it. But if you are an ordinary person you take your 
 bread as it comes to you, doing whatever you can make 
 most money by doing. And you are really shewing your- 
 self a disciplined citizen and acting with perfect social 
 propriety in so doing. Society may be, and generally is, 
 grossly wrong in its offer to you ; and you may be, and 
 generally are, grossly wrong in supporting the existing 
 political structure ; but this only means, to the successful 
 modern prizefighter, that he must reform society before 
 he can refofm himself. A conclusion which I recom- 
 mend to the consideration of those foolish misers of 
 personal righteousness who think they can dispose of 
 social problems by bidding reformers of society reform 
 themselves first. 
 
 Practically, then, the question raised is whether fight- 
 ing with gloves shall be brought, like cockfighting, bear- 
 baiting, and gloveless fist fighting, explicitly under the 
 ban of the law. I do not propose to argue that question 
 out here. But of two things I am certain. First, that 
 glove fighting is quite as fierce a sport as fist fighting. 
 Second, that if an application were made to the Borough 
 Council of which I am a member, to hire the Town 
 Hall for a boxing competition, I should vote against the 
 applicants. 
 
 This second point being evidently the practical one.

348 Cash el Byron's Profession 
 
 I had better give my reason. Exhibition pugilism is 
 essentially a branch of Art : that is to say, it acts and 
 attracts hy propagating, feeling. The feeling it propa- 
 gates is pugnacity. Sense of danger, dread of danger, 
 impulse to batter and destroy what threatens and opposes, 
 triumphant delight in succeeding : this is pugnacity, the 
 great adversary of the social impulse to live and let live ; 
 to establish our rights by shouldering our share of the 
 social burden ; to face and examine danger instead of 
 striking at it j to understand everything to the point of 
 pardoning (and righting) everything ; to conclude an 
 amnesty with Nature wide enough to include even those 
 we know the worst of : namely, ourselves. If two men 
 quarrelled, and asked the Borough Council to lend them 
 a room to fight it out in with their fists, on the ground 
 that a few minutes hearty punching of one another's 
 heads would work off their bad blood and leave them 
 better friends, each desiring, not victory, but satisfaction, 
 I am not sure that I should not vote for compliance. But 
 if a syndicate of showmen came and said. Here we have 
 two men who have no quarrel, but who will, if you pay 
 them, fight before your constituency and thereby make a 
 great propaganda of pugnacity in it, sharing the profits 
 with us and with you, I should indignantly oppose the pro- 
 position. And if the majority were against me, I should 
 try to persuade them to at least impose the condition that 
 the fight should be with naked fists under the old rules, 
 so that the combatants should, like Sayers and Langham, 
 depend on bunging up each other's eyes rather than, 
 like the modern knocker-out, giving one another con- 
 cussion of the brain. 
 
 I may add, finally, that the present halting between 
 the legal toleration and suppression of commercial pugil- 
 ism is much worse than the extreme of either, because it 
 takes away the healthy publicity and sense of responsi-

 bility which legality and respectability give, without 
 suppressing the blackguardism which finds its opportunity 
 in shady pursuits. I use the term commercial advisedly. 
 Put a stop to boxing for money ; and pugilism will give 
 society no further trouble.
