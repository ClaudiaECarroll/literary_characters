PREFACE.
« WITH HARP AND CROWN" is a story of woman's fidelity,
patience, and unmerited misfortune. Contrary to the usual
practice in novels, and more in accordance with the experience
of real life, Marion Revel's sufferings are rewarded—cynically,
some critics, unthinking, said-by the withholding of life's
supreme happiness. Who will deny that this is no strange
and unknown fate? The years of self-denial, were women
like Marion to look for the reward of selfish joy, would seem,
in the end, a mockery and a waste. There are thousands such
as she : their youth is spent in toil for others more helpless
than themselves. They have no crown of husband and tender
children. But in their calm and passionless faces, in the smile
of content which reigns like the sun of heaven in their eyes,
we know that they have their reward. Is there not in every
family such a history, such a memory, such a woman?
“Strength and honour are her clothing: she openeth her
mouth with wisdom: in her tongue is the law of kindness :
her own works praise her in the gates." It is nothing to her
that the strong and the crafty, like Joe Chacomb, grow rich:
that the helpless and the weak of will, like her brother Fred,
live in idleness and eat the fruit of her hands. She is happy.
For the sake of these good women, and for the real lessou of
their lives, we have written this book.

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
CHAPTER I.
WHEN the Princess Belle-Belle in the story is ravished from
the castle, and carried off by the wicked sorcerers and demons
of the rabble rout, she meets her troubles resigned, and leaves
them unchanged. No anxieties of mind are able to dim the
lustrous splendour of her beauty, or to furrow that fair cheek
with the lines of trouble. She plunges into the sea of sorrow
with a sigh, but emerges with a smile. Prince Florio is sure
to be constant: her loveliness is not evanescent, like that of
ordinary damsels; she waits in patience, conscious of the
abiding disposition of her charms and the fidelity of her lover.
Above all, she has no duties. Heroines are never expected to
do more than sit down. If the worst comes to the worst, she
has but to cry, in the attitude of a startled fawn,“ Unhand
me, sir!" and straightway one at least of her defenders rushes
in, sword drawn, and frees her in a twinkling from her
oppressor. These dramatic rescues, indeed, are nothing inore
than the Princess Belle-Belle expects. And when the last
chapter arrives, after which comes the real dulness of life,
with tranquil wedded love and the rearing up to virtue of
Princess Belle-Belle the Second, she steps to the throne on
which, beneath the glare of the lime light, she poses a grace-
ful farewell, ere she quits the agitated waters of adventure for
the secluded haven of safety. In the after-years she will
yawn, perhaps, over the peaceful present, while she recalls the
variety and the charm, the doubt and the uncertainty, of the
troubled past. It is a great thing to be a heroine of romance;
but then it is so different from being a heroine of reality.
For, to begin with, in real land, Princess Belle-Belle is not
alone in her misfortunes. If she is torn from the delights or

per childhood; if the fabric of fortune fall about her ears ;
the grim order of destiny oblige her to pack up her traps, and
be off and away from her earthly paradise-she does not
alone. The thunderbolts which strike one,
strike
many;
the
misfortunes which fall upon one, fall upon all her family; and
the fair young princess, instead of bewailing her fate, must
needs tuck
up her sleeves, put on her oldest dress, and work
with the rest and for the rest, oblivious, save when the respite
of night brings time for thought, of all she has lost. Florio
is gone. Ah! will he come back unchanged? The years are
passing on; will they leave the cheek as fair, the eye as bright,
the lips as ripe, the sinile as ready, the dimples as deep?
Poor Belle-Belle of reality! She forgets herself in her devo-
tion to the rest; she lives out her life spending it for others.
Hers is the self-denial which is the highest lot of poor
humanity, and yet seems to us creatures of self the hardest
and the saddest. When the winters have passed their ap-
pointed number; when her fair hair is touched with untimely
grey; when the crows’-feet have fallen too early around her
lustrous eyes; when her hands are rough with toil; when
her face her sweet, comely face is lined with care; when
her shapely figure is shrunken; when the thousand little graces
and delights of her maidenly ways are forgotten and lost-
Florio returns. He comes back to his Belle-Belle, but, alas,
he loves her no more. Down falls the castle of cards; the
chambers of imagery are despoiled of all their golden pictures.
Were it not for the vision that greets her streaming eyes, and
comforts her stricken heart, poor Belle-Belle would be sor-
rowful indeed. But she has gained the higher glory. To
those who wait and work comes a reward not hoped for or
expected. The peace which passeth all understanding is
theirs at last. Theirs are the soft strains of rejoicing resigna-
theirs is a crown, if they care to wear it, more glorious
than any wreath of the Nemæan games; theirs is the golden
harp, with which to celebrate the mysterious victory over
sorrow and disappointment—the solution of the problem
insoluble to the world, the final triumph of Love over Pain,
tion ;
We are on the highest slope of a breezy cliff, a foreland of
the glorious coast which makes North Devon the loveliest of
English counties. The path, mounting straight up from the
village below without any curve or winding, out of effeminate
regard for the steepness of the hill, has left the thick hedges,

which at its lower levels rise over it on each side, like an old
arch out of which the keystone has dropped, but which yet
preserves its stability. It has passed beyond the fringe of
flowers on either hand—the tall foxglove, vellow hawkweed,
pink herbrobert, and the white milfoil; it has emerged upon
the open down, where it runs along the edge of the precipice,
and looks out upon the tossing sea beneath and beyond. The
great waves of the Channel show from this height no signs of
motion, save in the white lines of crested foam and wild sea-
horses' manes that lie flecked about the surface; the steamer
below, that is tossing and rolling as she plunges along, seems
to be moving on a sea of molten glass; the clouds that fly
across the sky cast their shadows before and behind them
apon the waters; and the face of ocean, as you gaze upon it
to its blue distances beyond, is as bright, as profound, and as
impenetrable as the face of the Sphinx rising out of the white
sands and warmed with the cloudless sunshine of the desert.
For that “multitudinous smile” which we quote so often is a
subjective thing. We see in the ocean, as in nature, what we
feel in ourselves: we are in amood of laughter,and ocean smiles;
we are in a mood of sadness, and ocean is grave; we are con-
templative, and its face is like that of the owl-faced Athênê
for unutterable wisdom. On either side the hill descends
rapidly; on either side the view is nearly the same. To right
and left is seen a circular cove, into which the waves rush
through the narrow mouth and sweep back, dragging with
them shingle, stones, drift-wood, seaweed-all the flotsam
and jetsam of a wild coast. On either side are long jagged
teeth of rock, lying in slanting strata, stuck at the entrance
of the little bay like sharks' teeth, ready to grip and destroy.
Behind the cove is the perpendicular face of the rock, with
ledges on which
grow
wild rose, honeysuckle, blackberry, and
bramble; and curving down to meet the sands slide the long
slopes of the hill, planted thickly by the great gardener-
Nature-with giant ferns, among which a tall man would
tramp, shoulder high, like some Titan among the palms of a
tropical island. On the right hand is a narrow ledge of sand,
with rock that crops up in dentated edges, and backed only
by its bulwark of straight and steep precipice; and on the
left is a hamlet, consisting of half a dozen cottages, and one
pretty house standing by itself, apart from the rest. You
may distinguish it without the aid of any glass in this bright
and clear August sunlight. It is little more than a cottage,

with its single storey rising above the verandah, which seems
to run all round it; it is covered to its highest chimney pots
with a flowing robe of clematis, fringed with westeria and
Virginia creeper. It has a fair lawn in front, stretching away
from the sea ; and if you were near enough, you would see
that its gardens are planted almost wholly with roses-roses
of every colour: roses white and red, of York and of Lancaster;
roses brighter than any that bloom in the gardens of Gulistan;
roses of Provence and of Auvergne; roses of Gueldres, and
roses of England.
Hard by t' cottage is the church, never-failing adjunct of
the English hamlet-a grey old structure, too large for the
scanty congregation which on Sunday gathers within its
mouldering walls. The pathway slopes down the hill to join
the cart road—a Slough of Despond in the winter, and in the
summer a gridiron of Saint Laurence. This winds in and
out among the houses ; passes here by the mill-wheel,
rolling slowly round under the light pressure of the streamlet,
that drips rather than flows upon the broad feathers, and
turns round the creaking, strong machine; here by the gate
of the farmyard, where the pigs lie poking contented noses
into the reeking straw, content to believe that the days of
transformation into bacon are yet far off, though the fiat has
already been issued, and the knife of fate been sharpened;
here by an orchard, red and yellow with the apples that will
soon be gathered and sent to the cider-press ; here by the
village school, where the voices of the children are rising in
the afternoon hymn of dismissal; and lastly down to the
shore, where the ruts are lost in sand and shingle. It is high
tide, or else you might see the carts gathering the seaweed,
which is drifted up in heaps; but now the waves are beating
and lashing about the sides of the cove, and the one boat
which belongs to Comb Leigh is tossing like a cork at anchor. ;
If
you look inland, you see a long valley stretching back far
into the grey distance, where the mists of the summer after-
noon lie over the hillsides, and wrap the trees that are nearer
with the softness of a Claude landscape, and those that are
farther with drapery of transparent muslin, through which, as
through the Coan robe, you may see the leafy limbs all ranged
m seemly order. The meadows lie between the trees—broad
slopes, green with pasture land, or yellow with the ripened
corn that waits to be cut. A fair English landscape, meaning
peace and prosperity and the blessing of heaven and eartk.

And on the cliff, on the very highest part, between the
path and the precipice, where a gentle slope affords ten feet
or so of breadth on which to lie and rest and watch the sea
are two young people.
One of them—she—is sitting pulling a flower carelessly,
and the other-he-is lying at her feet, looking now upon
the sea beneath him, and now at the fair face above
him.
It is a face a little irregular of feature, though oval of
form;
the forehead is too high, the chin a trifle too pro-
nounced, the nose not quite straight; and the whole is
crowned with brown hair, with just—as the sunlight falls
slantingly upon it—the smallest tinge of gold to give it colour
and warmth. It is a face where you might expect a pair of
bright and restless, mutinous eyes ; in their stead you find
them clear and steadfast of expression-eyes whose depths a
painter, could he study them, might take as models for the
illustration of many virtues, but chiefly those of courage,
truth, and love. If I were to classify women, as my own sex
has been so often classified by philosophers, I should divide
her, first of all, into two great sections by means of her eyes.
For the eyes of some women mean love, and of some an in-
capacity for love. The former are the sisters, wives, mothers,
and aunts to whom children of all ages passionately cling;
the others are those whom we respect, or love perhaps, as in
duty bound, because they happen to be near to us. Their
hearts are cold; they love themselves more than their own; if
they have children, they neglect them; if they have husbands,
they slight them; if they have abilities or the faculty of
imitation, they write movingly about domestic affections with
that unreal twang that we know as well as the familiar gag
of an actor. The girl sitting on the cliff had eyes that could
love; they rested from time to time furtively upon the curly
head by her knees, and on the comely limbs which lay
stretched at full length upon the sward. Her head was bare,
and in her lap lay the straw hat she had worn on her walk up
the hill.
The young man broke the silence with a laugh.
“We have got metaphysical, Marion-another word for
nonsensical. Have we nothing better to talk about after our
long parting ? And tell me, cannot you find some way of
reconciling duty with pleasure ?"
She turned her head a little to one side-girls in the

country get these tricks and ways—while she thought a
moment, before she answered-
“I do think that the way of duty is sometimes a very
hard
And when so many people are disappointed in the
world, when we read of so many lives falling short of their
ideal, oh, surely it is better to give up thinking of life as
bringing pleasure, and only make up our minds to bear and
do what is right!”
“ You to give up the pleasures of life, Marion? You-
why, Democritus in-in-a brown holland frock and a red
ribbon !”
The ribbon is not red, but magenta.”
“ Matter of detail; and the prettiest little boots in the
world.”
She drew them back with a blush.
Gerald, if life has pleasures and duties too, I think it has
besides great nonsenses, which must not be allowed.”
“Forgive me, Marion," he said, looking up with his frank
smile. “Forgive me, and let me finish. Do you seriously
propose to give up looking for happiness ?”
“Ah, no," she replied, softening at once, and brightening
like the face of a lake when the April cloud has passed.
“No, it is not that, Gerald. I look forward to a great deal
of happiness. I am happy now at home-I hope I shall be
happy always, in some way or other; only I think it cannot
be right to set your entire heart upon one way of happiness.
“I do so set mine,” said the young man. Marion, I
think life is full of joys and glorious gleams of happiness.
They call it stormy. Nonsense ! it is a Pacific Ocean for calm
and sunniness. See now, I am six-and-twenty, or very nearly;
you, Marion, are already two-and-twenty. We have walked
and talked together for at least twelve years—how many
unhappy days have we known ?”
“None, Gerald, thank God!"
“And how many shall we know ? None, Marion, none !"

sprang to his feet, and looked out upon the sea, where the
sun was hastening to his western bed. “It is an invention
of old women and cowards that misfortune is always hanging
over us. Why should we pitch our songs in a minor key
because bad things happen? They will not happen to us;
and if they do, our singing penitential psalms will not alter
the course of events. "If I ever wanted a thing,' Byron used
to pule and cry, 'I never get it.' Then why the deuce-I beg

your pardon, Marion—why could he not help himself to it ?
Did he expect it would drop into his mouth? I hate a man
who sits and wishes, when he might be up and working. It
is far better to have no wishes at all, to sit and wait like an
Arab. I used to watch them, Marion, in the desert of Egypt,
before I went to Brazil, under the blue sky of evening and
night, in their attitude of dignity, while we smaller fryi
chattered. They are the only people who want nothing and
hope for nothing; they accept and are contented. We who
belong to a colder climate are for ever discontented with our
lot; we grumble and struggle.”
She laughed.
“No one, at least, will accuse you of being contented with
things as they are. Are you as great a Radical as you used
to be when you left us four years ago ?”
“We are all Radicals at one-and-twenty, I suppose. But,
Marion, I have found out now the truest happiness of life,
and I mean to try for it.”
" What is that, Gerald ?”
“Marion, it is love.”
She did not reply, but her cheek turned a deep red; and
presently she became aware, without looking up, that his
eyes were fixed on her.
you know people very well, and
are thinking of them, you get to feel when they are looking
at you, without turning your own eyes to ascertain the fact.
Perhaps this is elective affinity, or perhaps it is biology, or
perhaps we know all about a thing when we can give it a fine
name. Scientific gentlemen, it is certain, when they have
once called a millstone by a Greek name, are instantly enabled
to see several inches deeper than other folk into it.
“Love, Marion,” he went on, sinking again on the grass,
and gazing into her face—“love requires two people. Let us
two love one another."
“We always have, Gerald," the girl murmured.
Always, Marion. How many times have we climbed this
hill together, and sat here looking at the sea ! We have been
, lovers always, from the days when I had to help you along if
you got tired. Always we have loved each other, Marion.
But I did not know how much, or with what kind of love, till
I was coming back to England, and thought of you day and
night. We used to be brother and sister, but we are that no
more. The long separation has parted the old bond between
us, but the new one has come in its place. I want you to be

more to me than we have ever been before to each other.
Marion, I want you to be my
wife.”
She was silent for a while.
“Tell me, dear, that you can love me with a warmer feeling
than that of a sister for her brother."
She looked him straight and full in the face; there was no
doubt, no hesitation there.
“I do love you, Gerald. I do not know how you want me
to love you, but I am certain that no wife could ever love you
more.”
He took her hand and kissed it, softly at first, and then
passionately.
· The thought has never been out of my mind, dear Marion,
since I became a man. I have seen no other girl that I could
love, and resolved to tell you my heart the first day we were
alone together. Yesterday I was afraid to speak lest I might
spoil all, lest I had made a mistake. Marion, we have made
no mistake, have we? We love each other; we will give each
other our lives. Speak to me, dearest !”
“If thy handmaid find favour in the eyes of my lord,
and if-"
“No, Marion, you are not my servant; you are my princess
and my queen.
And this time he did not kiss her hand, but drew her face
down to his own, and pressed her lips to his. Marion's heart
passed from her with the kiss, and she drew back blushing,
confused, trembling.
Then Gerald began to tell her of the lives they would lead
together, and the happiness before them; and as he talked,
Marion grew cold, and her heart fell. She shivered.
“I feel,” she said, “as if I had lost something."
“ It is your hand that you have lost, my darling, for that
is given to me."
"Not that, Gerald, not that,” she replied. “Let us go
home; I am cold.”
The clouds had gathered up from the south, and were
lowering black before them as they rose to go down the hill
to Comb Leigh. Marion turned for another look at the sea ;
the waves were black, and the grey face of ocean was troubled
with the crows’-feet of innumerable cares. There was no sun-
light on the waters, and sea and cloud were blended together
in the far horizon. Gerald passed his arm through hers, and
led her gently down the hill.

loved me;
“ Don't be saddened by a rain cloud, Darion dear," he
whispered. “Life has got nothing to do with weather. Look
at the lightning up the valley! One might as well hear evil
in the growling of the distant thunder."
“It is not the cloud,” Marion replied, bursting into tears-
“it is not the cloud, Gerald; but as you spoke to me, I knew
that
you
I knew it was coming, and I felt so happy
-oh, so happy !-all in a moment to know that you were
really and truly my lover. I had not thought of it till the
last few days, since you came home again, and we have been
different to each other. And suddenly my happiness seemed
to be dashed like a cup of water from my lips. What does
it mean, Gerald ? what does it mean?”
“ It means that my Marion is the best and dearest of all
the girls that ever lived, as well as the prettiest and sweetest.
It means that she gave me her heart, and felt cold for a
moment for want of it. And it means that my love is a little
frightened to think what she has done, and all she has pledged
herself to. See, dear, the clouds are rising again over the
woods; there is the rift among them, and the bit of blue.
Look at the glint of sunshine on the copper beech yonder.
Everything is brighter for the rain, though it has been but a
shower. See how the hills seem to start into light and colour
again; that is a picture of our life, dear. Marion, Marion,
stay here by the stile, and let me tell you again how I love
you—so; let me press you in my arms. Dear, dear Marion,
how I love you-how I love you!"
It was two hours later when they reached the bottom of the
lane-Marion bright again, laughing at herself, and animated.
At the gate of the Rosery they stopped.
“I must go home,” said Gerald. Tell
your father what
you like, dearest.”
“I cannot say anything even to Adie, Gerald. Come and
tell
papa to-night. Good-bye."
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye."
He pressed her hands, and looked her full in the face with
eyes of passionate longing-a look that Marion was to treasure
up in her heart for ever. The first tender words and the first
warm look of a lover are as sacred to a woman as the first
little shoes of her eldest born. It seemed as if his eyes were
on her and his hands in hers still when she recovered from
the first tumult of her heart, and lifted her eyes to watch
her lover, striding along the road that led up the valley to

CHAPTER II.
CAPTAIN REVEL, on half-pay, of her Majesty's Navy-that
service which we treat so badly and regard so proudly-was
not in any respect like the mariner Ben Bowling, or Admiral
Benbow, or Lieutenant Luff, the sailors with whom the lite-
rature of imagination has made the world familiar. He did
not wear loose blue trousers and a pilot coat, nor did he hitch
up his garments in moments of aroused virtue, nor did he
drink rum, nor did he swear, unless under provocation, nor
did he stand habitually with his legs apart, nor did he have
a red nose. He was a sailor of quite the modern school,
though now a man of between fifty and sixty years of age;
being a rather quiet and precise man, with little of the self-
assertion that usually comes from habits of command; modest
of speech, and diffident in manner. He was pale, and had
cheeks hollowed with study; short-sighted, and carried double
glasses; and was absent, frequently wandering away from
the topic, and having to be recalled by his daughter Marion.
He was a student in literature and a dabbler in science, as
great a gardener as Adam, and learned in flowers, especially
roses, of which he had all the varieties that he could afford
to buy. His face, with thin sharp features and delicately
clear outlines, proclaimed his foreign extraction; for Captain
Fabien de Lussac Revel was a Frenchman and the son of a
Frenchman, although an English officer. Out of the great
army of émigrés--who mostly, it must be confessed, left their
country for their country's good--a few found commissions
in the English navy, and fought as manfully against the
France of the new régime as any Frenchman had ever fought
under Jean Bart or Labourdonnaye. Among these was the
Comte de Reville, who carried abnegation of his country so
far as to Anglicise his name, and appeared on the Navy List
as Lieutenant Revel. He never mounted ans higher on the
ladder of promotion, but he put his son into the service and
brought him up as an Englishman. Captain Ravel preserved
the papers which proved his ancestry and his title, in case ho
should ever wish to resume it, and pleased himself with the
comfortable reflection that his race was an ancient and
honourable one, with a history as long as its pedigree.
He came to Comb Leigh when he retired from the navy,
some sixteen years before our story opens, with three children,

his half-pay, and a modest patrimony. He had married
twice. By the first marriage he had one child, Marion, now
aged twenty-two; by the second he had a son Fred, now
nearly twenty, and a daughter, Adrienne, now sixteen.
Marion you have seen. Of two girls one is always the
daughter of the house, the father's friend and confidante-
the ruler, if there is no mother; the prime minister, if there
is ; and in any case the teacher and adviser.
This was
Marion. As for the son Fred, he was at Oxford, where it
was felt certain that he would achieve great things. Adrienne,
little Adie, was the plaything and darling, and, like all
darlings, childish for her years, and exacting of much tender-
ness and sympathy.
It was a household full of tenderness. The captain was a
soft-hearted man, fond of his children; the children, brought
up in the seclusion of a happy valley into which the outer
world penetrated rarely, believed that no one was so wise, so
good, and so learned as their father. Those are the happiest
families where all believe in each other, just as he is the
happiest man who mostly believes in himself. The quality
of self-conceit, if it is valuable for the individual, is priceless
for the family. We all know those domestic circles, never
tired of each other, in which Jack, otherwise a miracle of
stupidity, is supposed to have the finest voice in the world;
Tom, who got prizes at school, is the cleverest man in the
world ; Susan, the saucer-eyed, is the prettiest girl; and
Jane, with a face like a frying-pan, the most remarkable.
Marion Revel honestly believed that her brother Fred was
far cleverer than his compeers, though he failed to get any
prizes at all as a boy, and had not yet distinguished himself
at college ; while little Adie seemed to her the personification
of brightness, affection, ard beauty. To the outer world,
Fred Revel was a good-natured, handsome young fellow, who
took things as easily as if he had been born to ten thousand
& year; to the unprejudiced observer, Adie was a girl with a
face which a few years might render beautiful, and a figure
which required the ripening of two or three summers before
you could pronounce an opinion on it. And, up to the pre-
sent, if the captain has had any anxiety about his son's future,
it has not crossed his lips. In truth, he has had none. When
Fred refused at thirteen to go into the navy, his father was
grieved, but let the boy have his way. When he
grew
older
and resolved upon going to the University, the captain, con.

vinced that education was the finest thing in the world,
devised with Marion schemes of pinching and economy, to
get for the boy all the advantages of learning. He is at
present making the most of those advantages. He attends
the college lectures, at which undergraduates learn so much
and are so thankful for; he has, through the thoughtful
kindness of Oxford tradesmen, a fair mount occasionally, a
tolerable glass of claret in his room, can give those little
breakfasts by which the fatigues of study are dispelled, can
decorate his apartment with costly engravings, and can par-
take in all the amusements of the place. Oxford and Cam-
bridge are rich indeed in endowments, but they are richer in
those fine philanthropists who force fine things upon inex-
perienced youth, and teach them lessons, never contemplated
by the pious founders, in the luxury of that rich outer world
to which few undergraduates will ever belong. Like so many
of his kind, young Fred Revel, too, on his allowance of two
hundred pounds a year, was living at the rate of a thousand
in eight months, without as yet troubling himself as to what
the end might be.
Ah, how pleasant it is, this paradise of the youthful fool,
whose every banquet is a delight, and every noisy revelry a
feast of reason ! A dream from which the awaking may be
bitter, but the recollection is sweet. We in England have
much to be thankful for, and especially that we have two
such places as Oxford and Cambridge, where for three years
the poorest undergraduate may enjoy the privileges of
unlimited tick, and feel all the reality of being rich. A great
English University is like a dream of fairy-land; in it those
who work and are good boys and are lucky get pocketsful of
money for all the rest of their lives; those who lie idling in
the sun or sit singing in the shade are patted on the head by
their tutors, tempted to eat, drink, and be merry by the
benefactors above named, and troubled by no difficulties or
debts till the allotted time runs out. So the Sheikh of the
Mountains took his young men into an Eden, where houris
brought them iced sherbet and played with them upon beds
of roses for three days and three nights; then they were
taken out, and paid the penalty for the brief season of joy
by a life of obedience and slavery. After all, they could
remember.
The girls knew nothing of this pleasantness; girls are taughty
very properly, to believe that young men are always engaged

in intense study when they are not discussing points of phi-
losophy. Marion and Adie thought that Fred was hard at
work. When he came home, resplendent in the gorgeous
costume proper to the High, he wanted a long holiday, and
must put away his books. Moreover, he must tell them of
the Oxford world. Fred was willing to listen reason;
during the vacations he was content to forego the improve-
ment of his mind, and devoted himself, like the best of
brothers, to boating, fishing, and his sisters.
This little Anglicised French family, living in the quietest
place in all England, without any relations or connections in
the country, where they had settled like Naomi in the tribe
of Judah, had but one house where they could find intercourse
with the outer world. It lay a mile and a half up the valley,
and was called Chacomb Hall. There had been a hamlet of
Chacomb and a race of Squire Chacombs from time imme-
morial. No Chacomb had ever distinguished himself; no.
event connected the place with the history of the country;
the annals of the hamlet boasted no village Hampden, so that
very likely there never was one there at all; and if there had
been a Milton ever born among them, he was mute and
inglorious, and so might just as well have been a Smith.
But for the Revels there was Gerald Chacomb. He was
older than Marion by some four years, and had been her only
friend and chief companion. The two, when Gerald was at
home for his holidays, roamed about the hills together like
Paul and Virginia, as loving and as thoughtful of each other,
though of sterner stuff than that sentimental and unfortunate
couple. They knew every bird in the woods by its call,
every wild flower, and every tree; they were wise in the
manners and customs of the smaller beasts of prey-weasels
and polecats and martens, and their like—which lie hidden
in the Devonshire woods; they learned together by long
familiarity that neglected science of woodcraft which no
books can teach; and when the boy, obeying the instincts of
his nature, took to reading works of travel and natural
history, it was to Marion that he read them, filling her soul
18 well as his own with images of the strange wild animals
of those Southern lands, dim with the haze of perpetual heat,
tilled with the haunted silence of a tropical noon, and bright
with the splendour of cobra, panther, and jaguar. They sat side
by side on the edge of the cliff, while Gerald read aloud of the
mighty river, across whose broad bosom the green and gold

-serpents glide in the blaze of the sun; on whose shores lies
the lazy alligator; and to whose waters come to lap, at
morning and at eve, the chattering monkey, the sleek puma,
and the giant python.
“It is over there, Marion.” Gerald would point across the
“Only three weeks' voyage, and we could get there and
see it for ourselves. When I am a man I will go.”
When he was a man he did go. Nothing could stop him.
He left the University, and obtained a travelling fellowship,
which, with the little fortune he had inherited from his
mother, made him independent of his father's opposition.
Marion stayed at home, and tried to paint—it was her
only accomplishment the scenes which Gerald's letters
described. She covered acres of paper with imaginary
sketches, in which were reproduced his stories of the life he
led upon the Amazons and Orinoco.
While he travelled, she, womanlike, looked on, watched, and
waited, almost unconscious of the place he filled in her life.
Four years: it is a long time even in the life of a man
whose years are like a piled-up sheaf, and whose days are
hastening the swifter to their autumn, as the waters hurry
the faster as they near the fall; but it is a great gap indeed
in that period when a girl is becoming a woman. Marion
was eighteen when Gerald Chacomb went away, full then of
the trembling perplexities and twilight visions of the future
which surround the way of a girl. She was twenty-two
when he came back, a woman ripe for love; and Gerald
Chacomb was doubly a man, because he was a lover.
CHAPTER III,
GERALD CHACOMB strode with swinging step along the
road up the valley to Chacomb Hall, his heart aglow, his
-eyes aflame, his lips trembling with the recollection of the
last two hours. Nor did he trouble himself to wonder how
his father might take it. That consideration, indeed, one
must own, was not one that often stood in the way of his
resolutions. His plan was rather to treat the paternal per-
mission as a kind of grace after meat; to act first, and ask
afterwards ; to do, and then, with filial care that his father
should have some part, to insure a kind of posthumous con-
currence in the deed. And as he stepped along, his thoughts
'ran mainly on the life he would lead at Chacomb.

“Tho governor wants me to live at home and potter about
among the Collection. Hang the Collection! Well, he will
be happy, Marion will like to be near her own people, 80
she will be happy too. I should like to take her away with
me somewhere, but I suppose that cannot be. My pretty
Marion !"
About a mile from Comb Leigh he was awakened disagree-
ably from his meditations by the appearance of a man waiting
for him by the roadside. He was a big, burly man, dressed
in a fashion not often seen in the lanes of North Devon: a
sober suit of black, with a tall hat; his long-tailed frock coat
swung back from his big, brawny shoulders ; and his waist-
coat, as far removed from the M.B. type as is possible in a
black waistcoat, showed an expanse of shirt front which might
have been whiter ; his trousers were wide and bulged at the
knees, as if he sat writing in them with his feet under the
chair, after the manner of those to whom Nature has not been
prodigal in the matter of legs—though his were long; his hat
was glossy, and yet not new; and he wore no gloves. In his
hand he carried a silk umbrella, which had seen slenderer
days; and about the whole appearance of the man there was
manifest the desire to preserve somehow a respectable exte-
rior. His features were coarse and common, but not more
vulgar than may be seen in many a man who is bidden to sit
up high at great festivals. When he laughed, which was
often, he laughed with the mouth, and not the eyes; when he
smiled, the frequency of his smiles depending a good deal on
the
company he was in, he smiled with his lips, and showed
his teeth. Strangers, who were apt to take a violent dislike
to him at first sight, often found themselves before the even-
ing was over talking confidentially to him, and next morning
repented. His name was Joseph Chacomb, and he was
Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and first cousin to
Mr. Chauncey Chacomb, the squire of Chacomb Hall.
“You here?” said Gerald, holding out his hand with no
very cordial show.
“I am, as you see, my boy," returned the other.
• And
right glad to welcome the traveller home. Left the patients
with a brother poisoner. He is younger than I am, and his
conscience is clearer. Came down last night as far as Exeter.
You are looking in splendid condition. As for your father,
he is a different man already. You know, my dear boy, his
temper."

“Never mind my father's temper.”
“I don't mind it. I am the only man who never did mind
it. In fact, I rather like it. If I was his son, I dare say I
should think a great deal of it. Being only Dr. Chacomb-
Joe Chacomb-with a practice like a joint-stock company
(Why? Because it's limited), I can afford to sit down and
laugh. However, he has niade a splendid addition to the
Collection-an undoubted Dow, and he's now at home with
it on his knees. My cousin Chauncey ought to have been a
good father if he treated his baby-you, the only—as he
treats his Collection. But then your head was not by an Old
Master, eh?—after the manner of an Old Master.”
Gerald was irritated, partly at a long-standing dislike of
the man, and partly owing to the interruption to his thoughts,
but he laughed.
“You are on your way home, I suppose. Captain Revel
is with your father. It wants two hours of dinner. This
Devonshire air, what an appetite it gives! If I lived here, I
would have two dinners a day and a supper. It must be
dreadful to be poor at Chacomb. Perhaps it is to escape their
country appetite that so many people come up to London,
that, and to get their medical attendance for nothing. Tell
me about your travels, Gerald. Your beard improves you,
and you've filled out about the shoulders. You are like your
grandfather: he was a fair Chacomb. Your father is a black
Chacomb. And I am a red Chacomb. We are nearly pris-
matic. All the colours of the family represented in us three.
In the smoking-room to-night you shall tell me some of your
adventures, eh?”
He winked, and looked so knowing that Gerald felt inclined
to kick him.
“By Jove! I wish I had had your chances of seeing the
world. But when I was one-and-twenty I was walking the
hospital; and ever since I've been making blue pills and
brewing black draughts. All the rest of the Pharmacopeia
is humbug, Gerald. With blue pills and black draughts I'd
clear out half the sick wards of the hospital: beat doctors
black and blue, eh? But never mind that. Tell me where
you went, and all about it. The squire is hazy in geography.
I believe he thinks Brazil is in Africa."
Presently they reached Chacomb Hall.
The Hall was approached by an avenue of elms, urder
which the carriage drive ran, grandly arched over by branches

80 close together that the crowded leaves supported each
other, and remained upon the trees till January. The house
stood on a slope : a great square modern house, with no pre-
tensions to beauty save a western gable. This portion was
built of brick-a warm and soft brick, over which years had
spread a mellow tinge ; two sides of it were clothed with ivy;
the third looked due west down the valley to the sea; and in
clear days—most days in North Devon are clear-you got a
glimpse of Lundy in the far distance from the upper window.
This bit, the last of the old Hall, had been mercifully pre-
served by that interposition of Providence which killed the
former squirema great builder-and gave the estate to his
cousin, Gerald's father.
Between Chauncey Chacomb as a young man and the estate
there had once been so many lives, that in accepting a clerk-
ship in Somerset House at a hundred a year, he thought him.
self provided with all the goods the gods would send him.
Dis aliter visum. The owner of Chacomb had no children;
the two intervening lives fell in; and Chauncey at thirty
came into possession.
At thirty-five he took a wife. Also, about this period he
began to form those Collections of his which, he felt,could make
him famous. When he was thirty-seven his wife presented
him with a son. The same annus mirabilis was also remark.
able for the acquisition of a rose noble; an original Murillo,
purchased through the agency and by the advice of Mr. Burls,
the eminent picture dealer; the picking up of an ancient
pike-head, which marvellously resembled the useful end of a
modern spud; and for the death of his wife, who never
recovered the effects of her confinement.
The Collection was the bugbear of Gerald Chacomb's
boyish existence. He knew every glass case and its contents.
He knew by heart the expository discourse with which his father
would explain his treasures while he exhibited them to the
unhappy wanderer whose steps brought him to the door. The
cases were placed in what Mr. Chacomb called his library,
though never read, and his son had carried away the books
to his own side of the house, the old portion. The Collection
contained coins, flint implements, bronze ornaments, beads,
swords and daggers, and a multifarious collection over which
the rustic gaped and the antiquary yawned. For, in truth,
Mr. Chacomb's Collection was as valueless a set of trumpery
forgeries, worthless curios, motorn antiques, and twopenny

bric-à-brac as might be picked up at Cairo, Rome, Naples,
Jerusalem, or any other place where the chief industry is that
of forging ancient relics. No bishop of the twelfth century,
travelling to Palestine for the good of his sinful soul, was
more eager after saints' bones than Mr. Chacomb after any
old fragment to which he could attach a history. He had
travelled, too, and brought home with him, after each voyage,
stones from the places he had visited. These got a good deal
mixed on the way; so that what had been a fragment from
Luxor was exhibited as a specimen of the marble of the Acro-
polis at Athens, and what had been knocked off the long-
suffering Sphinx was labelled as a stone from the Colosseum
of Rome. Young Mr. Chacomb, too, in his irreverence for
the past, had still further jumbled and confused things, by
altering labels and changing stones—sins pardonable only on
the score of youth and ignorance of archæology.
All his spare moments Mr. Chacomb devoted to writing the
catalogue of his Collection. It was a bulky manuscript, which
he constantly wrote, re-wrote, and corrected.
Here was
recorded the history of each precious relic, told at length,
with all the circumstances connected with its find, and an
excursus on the probable connection of the treasure with the
political history of the period at which Mr. Chacomb's
imagination chose to fix the date. The document was the
repository of all that its author owned of fancy, history, or
scholarship. His reading, such as it was, bore perpetually
upon his catalogue. He bought journals of the archæological
societies, and he hunted them for new hints with which to
embellish his catalogue.
On the walls of the room in which the Chacomb Collection
was placed hung a dozen masterpieces, to which the squire
added as opportunity offered.
“I have," he was wont to say, " only a few pictures, but I
am proud to say that they are originals.
In one sense they were originals, having been mostly
painted for Mr. Burls, and at the request of that distinguished
collector, by young men in his employ; their natural merits
being improved by a resemblance, perhaps accidental, to one
or other of the great masters. Any one can copy a picture
in a gallery, but it requires a painter of genius to produce an
original work in the style of a master. Latterly, however,
Mr. Burls had few dealings with his former patron; for Dr.
Joseph Chacomb suddenly developed a curious taste in oil

..
paintings, and became the fortunate means of introducing to
his cousin one or two chefs-d'ouvre of the very greatest value,
which he obtained for him, on commission, at a comparatively
small cost.
Gerald found his father, as usual, in the Collection. The
glass cases were open ; on the table stood his basin of water,
his hydrochloric acid for treating the coins, his camel's-hair
brush, and his labels. But instead of fussing, as usual,
among them, the squire was sitting in an easy-chair by the
window, nursing a blackened and smoke-dried picture in a
tarnished gilt frame. And standing by him, eye-glasses in
hand, was Captain Revel.
Mr. Chauncey Chacomb's appearance did not proclaim
aloud his parentage of Gerald. For the son was fair and
tall, square-shouldered and stalwart, while the father was
short and daik. Gerald's face was round and comely, while
his father's was sharp and hard. The squire, in fact, recalled
the old portraits of Richard the Third. He had the same
look of ability in the low, square forehead; the same cunning
which the limner always depicts in the expression of that
wicked Plantagenet: he was strong, like Richard; and, like
Richard, he was slightly deformed-though not in the same
way, for his right shoulder was higher than his left. This
gave his appearance an awkwardness to which no familiarity
ever quite accustomed his friends. His manner was always
cold, but with a studied civility. He smiled a good deal, but
not so often nor in the same way as his cousin, the doctor
and he never deceived any living soul into the belief that he
was going to commit, for him or her, an unselfish act
Chauncey Chacomb, as a clerk in the Admiralty, was unsocial
and unpopulır. When the news came of his cousin's death,
there was an impious but intelligible expression of feeling
among his fellows that so great a piece of fortune might have
been bestowed more fitly upon one with more of the makings
of a good fellow. As a lady supplies with ceruse, rouge,
padding, and other artful agencies the deficiencies of Nature,
so Mr. Chacomb learned to wreathe his face in habitual smiles,
and assume a cordiality towards the world which he did not
feel. He was not cynical, but indifferent. He did not sneer
at people, nor was he envious of them, nor did he impute
unworthy motives, nor did he say bitter and carping things
he was only cold and careless. To the aims and objects of
his kind, to the tendencies and movements of his kind, to the

sufferings and sorrows of men and women-to these hopes
and fears Chauncey Chacomb was dead. He loved but one
created thing—not himself, because he was too conscious of
his own defects to love Chauncey Chacomb, but his son; and
he had only one vulnerable point at which his hide of indiffer-
ence could be pierced by a simple pin's point-his invaluable
Collection.
When the rhinoceros, at whom you may discharge your
arrows and hurl your javelins till you are tired, actually feels
the prick of one which by accident finds out a thin place in
the hide carelessly flung across the creature's back, like a
railway rug over a lady's knees, he begins to rage and roar,
and makes things perilous for the black Nimrods in his
neighbourhood. The rhinoceros, in fact, gets into a vulgar
rage, and plays indiscriminate devilry. The elephant, on the
other hand, if anybody hurts him, keeps his resentment to him-
self till the chance comes of paying off old scores. Then he
puts his big foot on the offender, who is seldom strong
enough to preserve much rotundity after the operation, and
pretends, with an apologetic twirl of his trunk, that it was by
accident.
Mr. Chauney Chacomb, not elephantine in any other respect,
had the nature of that glorious creature in this, that he nursed
his wrath. When he was offended he smiled, and, taking the
injury night after night to bed with him, tenderly looked after
it, fostered and fed it, kept it always alive and flourishing,
and looked on admiringly while the little ugly monster grew
up into a great amorphous Frankenstein.
He brooded over a wrong. He pleased himself with invent-
ing schemes of imaginary revenge, on which he would gloat,
picturing the agonies of the victim and his own ungodly
triumph. Twenty years before this story begins, he had
received, as he thought, a great injury and a wanton insult
from a man who unthinkingly scoffed at his ancient arrow-
heads, and disputed the authenticity of his beloved rose noble.
The man who did it had long ago forgotten the whole thing, but
in Chauncey Chacomb's mind it was flourishing like an ever-
green bay tree, growing ever taller and spreading wider, like
2 Norfolk Island pine. For twenty years he had been in
almost daily intercourse with this man, dining at his table,
walking and talking with him, asking and giving advice, re..
ceiving his confidences, and appearing, to all the rustic world
of Comb Leigh, his dearest and most intimate friend.

And he hated him all the time. Day after day, and night
after night, Chauncey Chacomb pursued the shadow of
an imaginary revenge for an imagined injury. It was a sort
of habit. Perhaps he would have done his enemy no harm
had he found the opportunity. But the hatred, unforgiving.
ness, and malice lay in his heart, like those little devils whom
the magician puts into bottles-so lively and so harmless, 89
long as the bottle is corked.
This enemy who believed himself, who was believed by
everybody, to be Chauncey Chacomb's greatest friend, was
the man who stood by him, looking at the newly bought
picture, when Gerald and the doctor came into the room.
CHAPTER IV.
“I THINK I should have it cleaned, Chacomb," the captains
said, looking at the picture with puzzled eyes. “See what
you make of it, Gerald.”
At first sight nothing was to be made out of it at all, except
a perfectly black surface, covered with a dull and much
cracked varnish, set in a dingy frame. Mr. Chacomb placed
it on a chair before the window, and began to move slowly
before it in a semicircle, so as to catch the light from every
possible point of view, holding his hands, after the manner
of art critics, slightly curved over his eyes. His attitude was
one of speechless admiration. The doctor, with a gleam on
his face which might mean amusement, and might mean in-
credulity, or, indeed, almost anything, took his place beside
his cousin, and began a similar pantomime of observation with
a grave countenance.
There was one thing especially noticeable about Dr.
Chacomb, that the spirit of mimicry was so strong in him as
sometimes to make him overact his part, and even to lead, by
too zealous an impersonation, to the loss of many little coup;
carefully prepared beforehand. On the present occasion, with
an involuntary glance at the other two, to see if they realized
the humour of the situation, he crept with the squire slowly
from left to right and from right to left, swaying his big
shoulders and rolling his head, in grave imitation of his cousin.
occasionally throwing in a gesture, a gasp, or an indication a
rapture, as some hitherto unobserved beauty rewarded his
inspection

" What delicacy!" murmured Chaunoey Chacomb.
“What fidelity!" echoed the doctor in a whisper.
"Splendid breadth of outline !” exclaimed the squire,
bringing his forefinger round in a comprehensive circle, which
finished by pointing to the fine proportions of the doctor.
Majesty and height!" replied the doctor, with an upward
sweep.
“ You see it, Joseph ?” said the squire.
“I do, Chauncey. Now that you point it out, I do."
“Then hang me," said the captain, who had no perception
of the ridiculous—“hang me if I can see anything at all!"
Chauncey Chacomb answered not a word, but pointed to
the centre of the panel.
Revel shook his head. The doctor sighed with pity, and
nodded approbation.
“I suppose,” said Gerald, “ that we have not been able to
catch the right light. I can see nothing at all; but I dara
say I shall make it out presently. Perhaps there are duskier
pictures even than this in galleries, and people admire them.
Tell me what it is, father."
“I am studying it,” replied Mr. Chacomb, solemnly.
“ There is a trunk, and-and-yes—it is a leg-an arm and
hand, and what appears to be a head, but I am not quite

it would be a sin to have this masterpiece touched. Look at
that curve-see-Hogarth’s line of beauty anticipated.”
“I see,” said the perverse captain, "a daub of drab-
colour paint, that looks as if it had been laid on by the
brush of a house painter. All the rest is black panel, var-
nished by an apprentice. Come, Chacomb, you do not surely
mean us to admire this ?”
“Not unless you like, Revel. Eh, Joseph ? not unless he
likes," said the squire, chuckling.
“ Certainly, Captain Revel, no one can force you to admiro
anything," said the courtier. “ Still, if delicacy and breadth
of outline fail to please you, what will ?”
“ Tut, tut," said the captain ; "I may be a fool, but I
cannot see anything.”
“ Gerald," said his father, “look at it carefully. Come
where I am standing; here, my boy. You must see that leg,"
he added, almost piteously.
“There is certainly something, but I cannot-my ere

The captain whistled softly.
u Mr. Burls said it was a Dow, did he? Well, it may
Do; but I don't think it is a Dow.”
At this simple joke they all laughed, except the squire,
who had not learned how any one could dare to laugh at a
picture of the Collection.
“What do you propose to call it ?” asked the captain.
“ Burls believed it to be the Village Porkshop," the doctor
said, modestly. "He promised to bring up all the details
by a new process if—"
“I won't have it cleaned,” the squire interposed, putting
his hands in his pockets, and falling back in admiration.
“Nothing should induce me to have his confounded process
applied to this beautiful thing. What are you doing, Revel?”
The captain, turning it round, was tapping the back with
his knuckles.
“ It is odd,” he said. * The panel seems double. Lend
me a knife, Gerald.”
He cut the paper, and loosened the nails which held the
board to the frame. Then behold a great marvel. For it
was a false back, and behind it, on the reverse of the panel,
lay the true picture, the back of which they had been
admiring. A young girl's face, fresh as Etty, creamy as
Greuze, bright as Titian, with the pearly tints of health and
innocence-a beautiful painting, whose pigments were as
unfaded as if they had been laid on the day before. It had
been turned round for some purpose of preservation, and so
had been left, forgotten and secure-guarded only by some
tradition that it was a picture and probably lying among a
lot of lumber waiting for a purchaser.
Why, in the name of all that's—" the captain turned it
round and round—“here's the picture itself; and, by gad,
Chacomb, we've been looking at the back!”
“ Then it is a Dow, after all," cried the doctor with much
presence of mind.
“Dow, you see, Gerald; dos in French-
back-eh? Ho! ho! Chauncey, my boy, we've been sold !
That rascal Burls! Wait till I get back to town and have
it out with him.”
“It is the most extraordinary thing I ever knew,” said the
captain, “ And a sweet little painting, after all. Chacomb,
you are in luck. This damsel's face strikes me as a good
deal better than the delicate-ha! ha!—the delicate flesh
tints and the fidelity of touch. I don't think-"

Here he caught a glimpse of the discomfited squire, and,
though little prone to extravagant mirth, sat down and fairly
bubbled over with laughter.
“The back of the picture, after all. Only the back! How
about the flesh tints, eh? And the leg, and the line of
beauty! The delicacy and the fidelity! Chacomb, we shall
never forget it, never!”
When Don Quixote, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,
experienced that adventure of the fulling-mills, which is
known to all who are acquainted with his biography, he
showed no more melancholy spectacle of discomfiture than
Chauncey Chacomb at this sudden collapse of his newly
acquired masterpiece. His frame shrank; his hands hung
down; his face was pale, save where the cheeks were flushed
with an angry red. The doctor had retired. One glance at his
cousin had been too much for him; and stealing quietly
through the window, he retired to a convenient spot out of
sight, where he might sit down and laugh at his ease.
The captain turned the picture round, and set it in its
proper place.
“This is almost worth sending to the papers," he said.
“The prettiest little picture, too, Chacomb. Come, man,
you can afford to laugh, because you have won. Why, this
fresh, bright girl's face is worth all the sham Gerard Dows
you could buy in a lump of Burls and all his people."
But Chauncey Chacomb was too disturbed to answer.
“Come, Chacomb, you are not angry, are you? Even the
best judges get deceived sometimes. Though, of all the
wonderful things--how Marion will laugh when I tell her!
Now who could have suspected-who the deuce could tell
that the thing was hindside before ? I've seen a sailor get
on horseback with his nose to the crupper; but hang me if
I ever saw a picture stern on before !"
“Angry?" echoed the squire. “Angry? No, why should
I be? As you say, we all make mistakes. My cousin there,
for instance
“Oh, I," said the doctor cheerily, who had returned re-

who put you all out. Laugh at me as much as ever you like,
if you must laugh. Ho! ho !"
He laughed as if he was laughing at somebody else.
“Yes," said Chauncey, with woebegone face.
“ Ha! ha!"
It was an interjection with so little of the emotional and

spontaneous character about it that the doctor laughed the
louder.
“When I think of myself," he said, “in Burls's shop-I
went there, you know, with this thing under my arm-I will
never forgive Burls-never. • What is it worth, Burls ?' I
asked him. It's worth Well, never mind the price
Burls put upon it, because it would astonish you. 'It is a
genuine Gerard Dow'-Burls's own words, not mine. 'A
Gerard Dow; and I shouldn't wonder if it does not turn out
to be the long-lost Village Porkshop. The long-lost Village
Porkshop-think of that, Chauncey.'
“I never heard of that picture,” said the captain.
“Perhaps not,” the doctor went on. “Very few people
have."
This struck him as being a remark so true, and so apposite
to the fable he was inventing, that he broke into a new
laugh.
“Excuse me, Chauncey ; you ought to laugh, not I. But
I can't help it, for the life of me. What I thought were
flesh tints, he said was dead pig. Never trust Burls again,
Chauncey.
The squire's face relaxed.
"Of course I was deceived,” he said, rather hoarsely.
“And as for the picture, Joseph, you may take it back,
“No, don't do that," said the captain. “The picture is
really a good one. Look at it again, Chacomb. Do keep it
if you can.”
The squire shook his head gloomily.
“No; I shall send it back."
But he kept it all the same, and the picture still hangs in
Chacomb Hall, where those who now own the place tell its
strange story.
Then the captain looked at his watch, and went away,
Gerald with him. Chauncey Chacomb listened to their voices
outside the house. When their steps had died away, he turned
to his cousin, who was expecting one of the sharp speeches
which the head of the Chacomb house was accustomed to use
in moments of displeasure to such of his relations as owed
him money. It was annoying to the doctor, because he wanted
to borrow more, and was most sincerely anxious that his
cousin should be kept in good temper. But the squire was
not thinking of him.

"It is envy, Joseph,” he whispered, with a kind of groan-
“it is malignant envy. I am richer than he is, and he envies
me and sneers at me. You saw it, Joseph-you saw how his
lips turned pale with envy when he found the picture hidden
behind the frame. He envies me my money, he envies me my
Collection, and he even envies me my son-my Gerald.”
The doctor was entirely confused with this sudden and
unexpected turn; he began, indeed, to murmur that it was
highly creditable to the captain, but left off in time.
“If I were like other collectors,” the squire went on, “I
should be annoyed at such an incident. It might be a blot
on my reputation; but I can afford to disregard that. It is
not even that he should be able to make up a story out of
it, and laugh at me. It is the man's real nature that
I see through and despise. That is the contemptible
thing."
“It is,” sighed the doctor, getting interested. “That really
is the saddest part of the whole affair.”
“I am glad you noticed it as well as myself. Joseph, let
us two have one more look at this picture—what he calls the
back of it-eh? Put it in the light again-so. What do you
think? Tell me candidly, Joe."
The doctor's eyes glistened as he caught the cue.
“ Think? What I thought all along, Chauncey; though
Revel put me out a little at first with his confounded discovery.
The real picture is here, after all ; just where we were looking
at it.”
He glanced doubtfully at his cousin. The assertion seemed
too daring. But it was received with credulity.
“I knew it all along—I was certain of it. We can't deny
the girl's head, Joe—any one can see that. A modern thing,
put in by some copyist. Pretty enough, too. It wants eyes
to see the other, though. Let us look at it again. Yes;
Joe, you are quite sure-are you quite sure that you see the
details ?”
As sure as I was at the
very
first."
This, at least, was true.
“Ah, now it is our turn to triumph! Joe, if he makes a
story out of it-'good enough to send to the papers,' Revel
said if he does, we shall have the laugh over him, eh? After
all, you can't take in the real connoisseur."
“Burls would hardly go so far as to see a picture when
there was none. I rely more on Burls and yourself than on

Revel"
“Spite and envy, Joe; it is what we must expect in the
world. Ah, sometimes one would be a hermit.”
“You feel things too much, Chauncey. It is the goodness,
you see, of your heart that runs away with you.”
"Perhaps, Joseph, perhaps."
He had spoken in a braggart, self-satisfied voice; but in
putting the picture down, he laid it with the face upwards.
“Now," said the doctor, when the squire left him to dress
for dinner, “I wish for once that I knew a little of my own
profession. Chauncey has got a twist somewhere to-day. I
thought he would have had a fit when Revel went away.
Perhaps it is his heart going wrong, if I only knew it. Too
much goodness—ho! ho! Humbug won't teach me, however,
what I should like to find out. It is a good thing enough for
the workaday world. Humbug doctors sick people; humbug
makes them thankful when they get well again; humbug
even, sometimes, makes them happy to go off; huinbug fills
my scanty coffers ; humbug makes my clients believe in a
couple of capital letters and a red lamp; but humbug breaks
down when you want it to be uncommercially useful. It pays
all my bills, but it won't help me to read the problem of
Chauncey Chacomb. Is he cracked ? Has my cousin dropped
a tile ? None of the family ever showed any inclination to
mania. But it looks queer. He rounds on bis dearest friend,
and slangs him. He gets as mad as a badger in a cask, with-
out even being baited with the rubbish and the general foolish-
ness of the Collection. As for this picture, which I bought
without looking at it—who the devil would have thought
that a picture could be hindside before? However, Joe, my
boy, you have not done so badly. You have sold it for ten
times what you gave. You have had a holiday from the
infernal shop; you have got your travelling expenses paid,
with a trifle over; you are in hopes of borrowing the hundred
pounds your creditors want so badly; and you have got a
whole bottle of port before you. I don't think, on the whole,
that the original Joseph, in his palmiest and artfulest days,
could have done much better for himself with Pharaoh than
I have done with Chauncey. And then,” he added, with some
confusion as to scriptural sequence,
“ there is certainly no
Potiphar's wife in North Devon. Potiphar lives in London."
Chauncey Chacomb locked the door with extreme care in

his own room, and then abandoned himself, with all the
pleasure of a secret voluptuary, to the rapture of unbridled
rage. He strode backwards and forwards, swinging his arms,
cracking his fingers, dancing, gesticulating, with fiercely
glaring eyes, as he gave full play to a revenge worthy of the
Furies, devising schemes of retaliation in which he had his
enemy at his feet and crouching before him. I believe, and
am firmly convinced, that if one half of the world were judges,
the other half would be condemned to undying torment; else
why the frequent “ damn?” But then, the usurpers of the
throne of Minos, lacking that functionary's judicial coldness,
would presently repent and be sorry. To be sure,
their re-
pentance would not make the fatigues of Sisyphus, toiling
after his aggravating stone, a whit more endurable; but, to
the philosopher, the picture of judges and prisoners, both
justly unhappy together, might not be without its useful
lesson. At this moment Chauncey Chacomb believed that, if
an opportunity should occur, there would be nothing in the
way of revenge too dreadful to resolve upon. The laugh of
the captain had fallen upon his nerves like the lecturer's
oxygen upon the wire in the glass-that instructive experi.
ment which we used to see at lectures before chemistry was
aught in schools-rousing and stimulating the dull spark to
a flame.
It is one of the advantages of a small place, where society
is limited necessarily to a circle of two or three, that the soil
adapts itself especially to the growth of the passion flowers of
envy and suspicion. In great cities they are reared with
extreme difficulty, and kept alive only with watchfulness and
attention. But in the country they grow like the giant lianes
in the tropics, twisting and twirling, strengthening and in-
creasing, till they squeeze the spiritual life out of the tree
which has been their host.
In London we hate each other honestly, particularly we
who have reviewed each other's books, and been reviewed : it'
is a keen emotion, but seldom roused. Nobbs hates Dobbs ;
when Nobbs meets Dobbs his liver is stirred to the extent of
wishing he could knock him down, were he strong enough and
were no one looking. If Dobbs is spoken of, Nobbs coarsely
swears if he is of the old school, or calmly smiles-the smile o?
superior venom—if he belongs to the party of sweetness and
light. For the rest, neither Nobbs nor Dobbs wastes time it
thinking of each other. But in the solitudes of the country,

hatred may become a cherished and a beautiful possession,
the priceless pearl of imagination, the salt and spice of life,
he chief thing which confers superiority, dignity, and the
sense of power.
“I could kill him now where I stand," said the wry-necked
little squire, who, like the majority of mankind, felt most
largely the gifts of bull-dog tenacity and reckless daring when
there was nothing present on which to exercise them. “I
could kill him now, with his cold laugh and his sneer. He
thinks I am his friend; how can I undeceive him? He thinks
he can do what he likes with me; how can I show him the
truth ? He thinks he can direct and order me; how can I
let him know-Gar! If I could crush him to powder beneath
feet; if I could sell him up, and send him and his beggars
upon the streets; if I could ruin his name; if I could blight
his hopes—I would do it. If, unknown to all the world, I
could compass his end- I would-yes, yes, yes, I would do
that too!”
And the squire burst into a short laugh, not the laugh of
irony, or that of conscious power—these being impossible,
except in works of fiction—but a laugh of pretended amuse-
ment combined with spite: it is a laugh that may be heard
any day among men discussing those of their friends who are
in the same trade with themselves. Its invention is said to be
due to Sir Fretful Plagiary; but my own belief is that the
distinguished dramatist appropriated that, as well as other
beauties, from older men. Lucian, to my certain knowledge,
laughs in much the same way, and perhaps earlier authors
handed down the method to him. Chauncey Chacomb
laughed, hitching up his uneven shoulder with an action
which seemed like imparting a confidence to his right ear.
Then he opened a secret drawer in an escritoire by touching a
spring. In it, among a lot of old jewellery and trifles, lay
the most commonplace of all worldly possessions--a simple
box, labelled “ Cockle’s Antibilious Pills." This he took out
and opened, gazing at the contents with a look which
amounted almost to rapture. To the superficial observer the
box contained only those blue-black globules and the nasty
white magnesia, put in by the philanthropic manufacturer to
ieter us from taking too many. To Chauncey Chacomb the
box spoke a whole volume, in folio, of evil imagination and
back-handed revenge.
“I wonder which of them it is,” he said, sitting down und

shaking up the pills. “Who would think that it lies among
the rest, so like them all that the Devil himself could not tell
which it was. There were a lot of pale yellow crystals-
poisonous little deadly crystals—in a drawer in the laboratory
which Joseph showed me. When nobody was looking I took
a pinch. And in the night I made up a pill, rolling up the
crystals in the middle of coloured bread so that it looked like
a Cockle. He who takes that pill will have pains and convul-
sions all over; and then he will bend back, like a bow turned
the wrong way, with his heels touching the back of his head;
and then he will go off altogether. Ha! Revel would look
well with his heels kicking the back of his head. And digni-
fied. Just as he was having his final curl, I could whisper
softly in his ear that I had done it, and that it was a lesson
to teach him for the future not to sneer and flout at better
men-yes, better men than himself.
“It would be dangerous, because some one else might take
the pill, and I bear no malice to any one else. Revel is my
only enemy. Perhaps the girls don't take Cockle's.
But
then Fred might. If I could make sure that only the captain
would use the box, I could leave it on his dressing-table.
And I should watch and wait. A week, a month, a year
would pass, and the captain would be strong and well. Then
would come a day when he would feel a little queer. And
then-then-then-ah-h!"
He gave a sigh of infinite satisfaction, and closed the box,
gazing at it with loving eyes, such as a medieval bravo might
have turned, after purging his soul by confession, upon his
sharp and trusty stiletto. Then he replaced it in the escritoire,
and locked up all safe. And then he rubbed his hands softly,
dressed for dinner, and went downstairs just as the gong
sounded.
For the moment, his ill-temper and malice had vanished.
They came from time to time, like those familiars, formerly
the plague of foolish old women, who, to be fed, sold their
ridiculous souls to the Devil. Chauncey Chacomb_allayed
their voracity with dreams and schemes of revenge. Perhaps,
had he been induced to carry his visions into reality, there
would have been nothing left to dream about, and so the
world would have become a thirsty Sahara of actual fact.
The Tempter insinuates his abominable counsels into some of

to some the vision is dearer than one of luxury, pride, glory,
honour, or even fair women.
The squire, then, having indulged his genius, fed his
familiar, smoothed his mind, and crushed his imaginary
enemy, came down to dinner in better temper. The doctor
was cheerful, as he always was at dinner-time. Gerald was
happy, if a little silent, and the talk went round as if no one
of all three had a single thought in the background. This,
you see, is the grandest achievement which our modern
civilization has wrought for us. It has enabled us to use
speech so as to forget care, as well, according to the cynic, as
to conceal thought. The squire put his secret hatred behind
him; the doctor forgot his anxieties about money; and
Gerald, as hungry as a man of five-and-twenty ought to be,
forgot Marion.
As soon as dinner was over, the younger man left the other
two with the wine, and went out. Presently they heard him
crunching the gravel-walk beneath the elms. The squire's
eyes contracted with an impatient expression.
“Not back three days,” he said," and off again to the
cottage. You see, Joseph-you see! He cannot be allowed
to spend a single evening with his father. Revel entices him
away.”
“There are other attractions at the cottage besides Revel;
there are two young ladies.'
Cousin Joseph,” said the squire,
do
you forget that you
are speaking to a Chacomb, that you yourself are a Chacomb,
and that Captain Revel is a mere half-pay officer ?"
“Cousin Chauncey," returned the doctor, unabashed, “I
remember that the Chacombs have been owners of this
pleasant and secluded little hamlet for a large number of
generations. During that time they have done nothing to
distinguish themselves, except to show that they can hold on
to what they have got. Do you forget that Captain Revel is
the last representative of an ancient and honourable French
house?”
"Bah!-a beggarly French title !"
“Whose ancestors were fighting men with the king, while
ours were ploughing Devonshire clays. So far as family goes,
my cousin, we must give in. To be sure, we—that is, you-
have got money."
“I would rather give it all to-to-to you, Joseph," said
Chauncey, flushing, “than that Gerald should have a penny
if he marries one of those Revei girls."

“Ay, ay ?” the doctor replied, thoughtfully. Then he
looked up and laughed.
“To be sure, Chauncey, if you were going off before me,
which isn't likely, comparing your constitution and mine" -
he was as strong as one of the New Forest oaks to look at
# I should say, leave me your money, by all means. Still, if
you do not want mischief to be done, you might perhaps keep
Gerald out of the way of it. You know that the best method
of handling the patent safety matches is not to let them get
near the outside of the box, eh?”
Here the squire banged the table, and used a strong ex-
pression-what some writers used to call a Saxon expression,
until we were taught that there never were any Saxons at all,
and reflected besides that the word is really of Latin origin.
“Everybody would think," the doctor went on, with a half-
glance at his cousin's face, “that you wanted it. You and
the captain are bosom friends; you go there, he comes here;
the girls come here when they like; you— No, Chauncey,
you really should not bang the table when all the glasses are
on it. You have spilt some of my port on the cloth-a sinful
waste of excellent wine. Before you bang again, allow me to
take another sip.”
“Finish the bottle," said Chauncey, rising abruptly; "I
ghall go into the garden."
He left his guest, and, passing through the open window,
stepped out upon the lawn.
The doctor looked after him with a smile, and
gave up
his
whole mind to quiet enjoyment of the port. When there was
no longer any in the decanter, he rose thoughtfully, and fol-
lowed his host.
Chauncey Chacomb was marching backwards and forwards,
gesticulating. The devils, which had slept for a while, were
awake again, and rending him to pieces. It was singular
that the secret he had kept for so many years should be
irresistibly torn from him by so foolish an accident as that of
the picture. But it was so. He could no longer contain
himself or his passion. Every feeling which overmasters a
man must, soon or late, find expression, and take unto itself
a confidant.
Come, Chauncey,” said the doctor, taking him by the arm.
"I am a medical man, you know, and cannot have you exciting
yourself. Relieve your mind, and have done with it. Give
sorrow words,' as Shakspeare says; and if you don't tell me,

teil somebody else. What a man like you, in good health,
with a fine income and no debts, can have to trouble him,
I don't know. But you have something. Repressed care,
my friend, is like suppressed gout—it plays the devil with the
constitution. That's why they say that care killed a cat, I
suppose.
I had a caso last week of a man, about your
age, but of slighter build, who choked, Chauncey, literally
choked, not to use the technical term, with the effort of
keeping something on his mind. As he was dying, he tried
to communicate it to me; but too late, poor fellow, too late!
and he is gone. I believe if he had lived I should have
come in for something handsome in his will. There is another
man I attend every day, who is paralyzed in the lower limbs
through getting into a righteous rage with his son, and trying
to keep it under. Give Nature way, Chauncey. You are
annoyed, and very naturally, because Revel found out what
had escaped you and memeh? Bah! Sit down and swear
for five minutes, and then forget it.”
Oh, if I could trust you !” groaned the squire.
“ That seems an odd thing to say, after all these years.
Njt trust me? Why, who the deuce have you ever trusted
except me? Who helped you to get the Collection together?
Who watched and lay in wait for bargains for you? Who
stood between you and my lady when you had the kick-up ?
Who has always been your best friend ? In the words of
the poet,
“Who bailed him when they ran him in ?
Who backed the bill and nailed the tin ?
Who never flinched through thick and thin ?
His cousin."
Not that you were ever run in, Chauncey—on the contrary, I
believe it was I who once-but never mind. The meaning is
clear. Come, old fellow, out with it. Make a clean breast,
or you'll be having-you'll be having—" he paused to think
what he could best frighten his cousin with "

Chauncey sat down and gasped.
“I hate him, Joe,” he said. “I hate him worse than I
náte mortal sin. Don't tell any one, but I hate him.”
“ Who? Gerald ?"
“No-Revel, Revel! I've hated him for fifteen years."

self out of this revelation.
“He tramples on me; he insults me before my own son;
he sneers at me; he gives himself airs of superiority. I hate
him !”
The doctor remained thoughtful for a little while. Then
he spoke professionally,
Come
up
to town; go and travel; see other scenes and
other people. If you hate Revel when you return, come to
me again. No”—for the squire was going to speak again
“no, you have told me quite enough. I thought there might
have been some reason; I mean-yes-tell me of something
else.”
The squire shrank back into himself again.
“Promise me, Joseph,” he said, catching him helplessly by
the hand, “ that you will keep my secret. I can't help it,'
he added, piteously—“I can't indeed. The sight of him
makes me mad. I want to kill him; I want to do him
mischief. I lie awake and think about it at night. Tell me,
Joe-you know I have always told you everything-we have
no secrets from each other, have we? We never had.”
“None, Chauncey, none,” replied the mendacious physician,
whose pocket-book was bulging with secrets unsuspected by
his cousin. “I am thankful to say that I have always been
as open with you as you with me—as open with you as you
with me," he repeated, pleased with the roundness of the
phrase.
“ Then, Joe, tell me if you meant what you said if you
think there is any chance—any danger of Gerald falling
in love with that , Marion girl. If there were, I would—”
“What wound you do, Chauncey ?”
“I would cut him off with a shilling, Joe. I would leave
all
my money to you, I would, by gad—Chacomb Hall, and

The doctor looked round him. They were in the centre of
the lawn: behind him stood the Hall; before him stood the
great trees of the avenue; on either hand stretched long

green glades up
the hillside ; a sweet breath of summer was
in the air; the sun was long gone down, and only the light
sapphire hues of evening left in the west; but the moon was
up—the full August moon, the harvest moon-pouring floods
of silver light on wood and copse, softening the straight lines
of the modern part of the Hall, and bringing out into relief
every buttress and projection of the old western gable as
lovingly as if they had belonged to Melrose Abbey. There
was a deep stillness in the woods. To the doctor's heart,
weary with struggle, trouble, and the endless fight that
belongs to a man who is ever sinning and ever trying to
escape the consequences of his sin, the squire's words brought
a sudden hope like a ray of sunshine.
“ Answer me, Joseph. Have you reason ?”.
Perhaps, Chauncey, perhaps,” said the doctor. “So you
would cut off your own flesh and blood for a marriage against
your permission ?'
“I would. Mind you, Joe, Chacomb belongs to the
Chacombs. If Gerald does not get it, it goes to you.”
Lord, Lord!" said the doctor, we talk nonsense. You
are only sixteen years older than I—and will outlive me.
Put such things out of your mind. As for Gerald, of course
he will marry to please you-sons always do," he added, in
a sort of undertone. • Come in, Chauncey. Let us have
some brandy and water after this cold talk. I must doctor
you.
don't tro yourself about Revel for a while.
Control yourself, my cousin. We Chacombs should be strong
to act, but slow to speak. Your secrets are safe with me.”

Gerald came home at twelve, and found the doctor smoking
a cigar outside the house.
They walked up and down together in the calm night.
“If I were you, Gerald, my boy," said the doctor, “I
should marry. It has always been my greatest regret that 1
did not mariy. Get yourself a wife, and soon.”
“I mean to,” said Gerald.
“Very proper. And I hope you will have the good sensa
to choose the right girl.”
“I have chosen, if I may say so, the best and sweetest girl
in all the world. I've known her nearly all her life, and there
can be no mistake about her being the right girl.”
“I am very glad to hear it, Gerald, very glad; and I amı
sure your father will be greatly pleased-greatly pleased.
Good night, my dear boy, good night."

CHAPTER V.
If there were rage and fury at the Hall, at the Rosery it
was all love and calm.
Gerald and Marion were together on the sands, which the
receding tide had left dry: without, the wavelets followed
each other, caressing the beach and lapping gently against
the edges of the great sharp rocks; the softest of moons was
over their heads, the softest of breezes playing in their faces.
Together they strolled hand in hand, with the soft warm
pressure of early love. A woman unthinkingly lends her
hand to be caressed, and, lo! her fond heart straightway
glows with thoughts of unutterable happiness, and her
charmed thoughts lover about the image of her lover, like
the silly pigeon round the enchantress serpent. They were
silent, because there was nothing to say. The immoral
grammarians of every tongue have with one consent placed
the verb to love first of all the conjugations, so that those who
read may learn more things than grammar-Io ť amo, je
ťaime, and all the rest. That said, little is left but to say it.
again, or to be silent while the pulses vibrate from one to the
other, singing speechlessly, like the trembling strings of
Anacreon's lyre, nothing but love, love, love, which swears to
be unchanging and eternal.
From the cottage came the sound of a piano. Adie was
playing, while her father was reading. Presently the music
ceased, and everything was still save the ripple of the waves.
“I suppose we ought to go in, Marion,” said Gerald.
"Reflect, dear, before we tell the world. There is yet time.
to reflect; no one has heard your promise but me. Think it
all over again, and tell me, dearest, once more if you can
love ine.”
There are many thousand stories yet to be written about
human life, although so many thousand exist already. Fate
shakes up the great kaleidoscope, and produces combinations
without number; but there is one which never tires. On such
a night a youth told a maiden that he loved her; on such a.
night she threw her white arms round his neck, and with
self-abandonment most maidenly and pure, laid her face
against his face, as he stooped his head to meet it, and
whispered words, while her heart beat with the tumult of

strange and new feelings, which were never to be forgotten
or recalled.
“Gerald, you know that I love you, and-oh, gently, gently,
Gerald dear."
He led rer, trembling and glowing, back to her father's
house, daughter still, but yet not quite the same. For maid
Marion was pledged, and the golden cestuz was ready to be
loosed.

hood meet, and make each other ashamed, as the old thoughts
of the one are beaten back by the new-born thoughts of the
other; a tall and lithe damsel, with thin long limbs which
want filling out. She is unlike her sister at every point. Her
features are straighter and clearer; her blue eyes are bright,
but they want the depth of Marion's; her fair hair hangs, as
a young maiden's should, loose about her shoulders ; she
carries her head with a certain defiant haughtiness, unlike
her sister's modest pose; and while Marion's lips are closed
with the earnestness of duty and resolve, Adrienne's are
lightly parted, as if catching at some unknown pleasure.
“You are come back, then!” she cried, petulantly. “Gerald,
it is too bad. Only home three days, and you monopolize
Marion the whole afternoon and evening. No, sir, I am too
big to be kissed now; and I don't want my hair pulled, thank
you. And, Marion, something has happened. Fred has
written to papa, and there is a big bundle of letters come from
Oxford, and papa is put out.”
Marion's heart fell. Her brother Fred was one of that too
numerous class of correspondents who write only when, as
Adrienne said, “something has happened.” That, in our
euphemistic manner of speech, means something bad.
“What is it, Adie ?”
“I do not know. The letter was brought this afternoon,
but stupid Susan forgot to give it to papa till this evening,
He turned quite pale when he read it, and of course won't tell
me anything Go in, Marion, and say what you can for poor
Fred. I suppose he is in another scrape.
Fred never writes
unless he is in a scrape, Gerald. And ever since I have been
old enough to be told things, the dear boy always has been
in a scrape.”
Marion, troubled, went into the drawing-room, where her
father was sitting at his own table with a pile of papers
beford

him. It was the family room. It was long, low, and narrow:
it had a piano, a bookcase, and a table—the captain's—
covered with books. It was Marion's studio, Adie's practising-
room, and their father's library, all in one. When Fred was
at home it was his lounging-room as well. Captain Revel's
face, as he sat before the lamp and read his letters, was pale,
and his hand trembled.
“Come in, my dear. Is that Gerald outside ?"
6. What is it, papa ?”
“ Call Gerald, Marion. We want his advice. Gerald, help
me if you can. We are simple people here,” he said, bitterly,
“and do not understand the ways of the learned world. Read
my son's letter, and advise me what I am to do. Listen,
Marion, my child. It is your brother's latest freak.”
Gerald read
“MY DEAR FATHER-I am sorry to bave to tell you that
I got into a mess at Oxford last June. I did not like to let
you know the truth at the beginning of the Long, and I hoped
the tutor would manage to get me out of it. But I find that
he cannot. Perhaps he has himself written to you by this
time. The fact is, I was rusticated for a year for a little
escapade in which I foolishly joined. Lord Rodney Benbow
was the other man. We laid a train of powder round the
court for a firework, which no one would have cared very much
about, only Rodney would finish it up with a cracker or two
at the Dean's door. The porter saw us, and gave information.
So the Dons had us up, and made unpleasant remarks; and
we were rusticated. I hope you will not be greatly annoyed.
It will delay my degree for a twelvemonth, but that is all.
You will be glad to learn that I have enjoyed the reading
party greatly. We had good fishing, and very good fun all
round. Lord Rodney wants me to join him in a journey up
the Nile, and to the East, to last till the expiration of our
sentence. He very kindly offers to bear most of the expenses.
But of course I cannot accept his invitation till I hear from
you, as I cannot ask him to pay the travelling fares. Rusti-
cation is not so very awful a thing, after all; and I dare say
we shall get over it. Tell me if you would like me to run
down to the Comb before we start for Egypt. Love to Mariou
and my little Adie.—Your affectionate son,
FREDERICK REVEL."
“Oxford is a place where young men are sent to receive tho

highest education the world can give,” said Captain Revel,
"and at twenty years of age they behave like naval cadets.
He calls a public disgrace nothing. He talks of losing a year
as if it was nothing. And he offers to go out to Egypt as if
it was a part of the course. Gerald,
you
know all our family
secrets—if we have any secrets. Advise me what to do.”
Gerald hesitated.
“ After all, it is hardly a disgrace, sir," he began.
Not a disgrace? Not a disgrace for a man of twenty to
be firing crackers at his superior officer's door like a boy of
twelve? Why at twency I was cutting out slavers on the West
Coast. It may be no disgrace at Oxford, but it is a sore
disgrace at Comb Leigh."
“I mean,” said Gerald,“ that the offence is foolish enough,
but not-not-in fact, it might have been worse.'
“The boy is light-headed,” groaned the captain. “A
feather turns him; he has no more will than the shuttle-
cock; he—"
“Papa," said Marion," don't be too hard on poor Fred."
" It was for Oxford,” the captain went on, pacing up and
down the room,
" that we saved and scraped, Marion and I—"
Oh, never mind that, papa!"
“It was to give him the best start in life that a lad can
have, and the best education, that I denied my girl here the
training that she deserved. We pinched in her dress and in
our living, Gerald; we made Marion governess to Adie when
she ought to have been herself at school; we have lived
cooped up in this little village when I might have taken her
to see something of the world—in order that Fred might
have the means of going to a public school and the University.
And this is the end of it. He was to have brought credit on
the old name—a name older and more honourable on the
other side of the water than yours, Gerald, my boy—he was
to be the pride of all of us; and see what it has all come to.
Look at it, Marion—think of it."
“ Nay, sir,” said Gerald, “ all is not lost because Fred has
been unluckily foolish.”
“ All is not lost? No. All would not be lost if the boy
would work, but he will not. This is the last blow. Fred
has spent all our savings, Marion, my dear. There is nothing
left. You did not read his postscript, Gerald. He tells me
the tutor has sent on his bills. And here they are. He adds
a remark that they may wait.”

Tell me,
"Oh, Gerald," murmured Marion, "say something to help."
May I look at the bills, sir ?”
“ Look at them all. It is a pretty collection for one year
of Oxford life. Champagne, claret, water-colours, engravings,
boats, horses, for the son of a half-pay officer! You have
been at Oxford, Gerald.
if you can, that all young
men are so.”
Gerald was silent for a while.
“ Fred has been extravagant,” he said. “Let us own that
he has been as foolish as a man well can be. Still, he is but
twenty."
“But twenty? Yes, with a long life before him, and,
like a ship with no ballast to keep her steady, without
principle.”
Oh, papa!”
Marion, shuffling words do not alter facts. Fred's life is
before him, and what will he do with it ? •Unstable as
water, he shall not excel.'”
“Let the debts wait,” said Gerald. " As he has contracted
them, let him do what many a man has to do—pay them
afterwards. They will be a log about his neck for years ;
but he will have to pay them in the long run.”
“No, Gerald,” said the captain, we will not do that; will
we, Marion ? We will not let a pack of cheating horse-
dealers and rascals make jokes on the name of Revel. We
will
pay
them
every farthing, if we starve for it ourselves.
But he must never set foot again in Oxford.”
“Perhaps," said Gerald, hesitatingly-"perhaps, captain-
if—if—if
you would let me make terms with these fellows—"
“ Thank you, Gerald; but I will not borrow of you. If I
want a loan, I will ask your father, my old friend. He will
do it for me. Fred's debts shall be paid. But the debts are
nothing, nothing—we can scrape for a few years more, and
settle them. As for the boy, all the world knows already,
I
suppose,
that he is rusticated-all the world except our-
selves. He came home, sir, with the shame of the thing still
upon him, to play and sing and laugh with the girls whose
money he had wasted; and not a word to me, though he knew
I must learn it, sooner or later. Marion, say, if you can,
something in excuse for your brother. I can find nothing."
Marion's tears came into her eyes, but she could not say a
word. It was all too cruel.
" And he wants to travel—as a reward, I suppose, for bis

folly," said the captain, bitterly. “I know what I will do;
I will see your father, Gerald, and borrow the money from
him to pay off all in full. I will go up to town myself, take
the boy down to Oxford, and settle up every liability. Then
he shall apologize to the college authorities, and take his
name off the boards. I sent him there to work; and since
he will only play, he may come to Comb Leigh and lay trains
of gunpowder round the cove, if he likes. They cost less here."
Marion looked at Gerald.
“Perhaps, sir," he said, “I may be able to arrange for
you. Let me go to town and see him. Let me bring Fred
home to you. And-and-Captain Revel—perhaps a word
or two of kindness may affect him more deeply than anger.
You were good enough to take me into your confidence, you
know."
Aye, Gerald, aye; you can say what you like in this
house."
“May I, sir? Then let me say another thing, though it is
not a favourable moment. Captain Revel, accept me as
another son.”
He took Marion's hand.
“I asked this dear girl to-day,” he went on," to be my
wife. Will you consent if she will—since she does ?"
Marion, Gerald, I did not look for this !"
The captain was silent for a while. The two stood before
him like a pair of prisoners waiting their sentence. When
he spoke, it was with the voice and look of one whose thoughts
are far off.
“When Marion was born, I was angry and disappointed
that the child was not a boy. When Fred was born, I
rejoiced, because the old line might still be carried on.
Fred's mother-well, never mind. Marion and I brought up
the two babies. When Marion was only six years old, I
repented of my disappointment, and thanked God solemnly
for my girl, Gerald.'
He stopped, and taking her head upon his breast, patted
her face, while he went on-
“I have thanked God daily ever since for her. Not a
morning, not an evening, that I have not thanked Him for
His great gift of this my daughter. What Marion has been
to me and my house, who knows but myself? How can I
tell, even to you, who have known her so long, how Marion
has been the stay and comfort of my life ? Marion, you bave

wasted the spring of your time on your father and your
sister"
“No, father, not wasted."
“Not wasted, dear,” he repeated. “The life of love is
never wasted : it is like the rain which fertilizes, and the sun
which brings forth; we see the fruits, and we forget the way
they grew. Not wasted, Marion ; only spent and given for
You want to take her away from me, Gerald. It is a
great thing you ask, but it shall be as my child wishes.”
“Gerald knows what I wish,” said Marion, simply. “ But
not to leave you, father-not to leave you.”
“ Chacomb is not very far off," Gerald said.
“ It will be as good as a hundred miles away when I have
to come to breakfast in the morning and find no Marion.
My dear, your father is selfish-he thinks of nothing but his
own comfort-forgive him, and go with your lover. I have
nothing to give with her, Gerald ; but she brings you a heart
full of love-ah, Marion, my daughter !—full of love. That
is her only heritage, for her brother has wasted all the rest.
“ Never mind her brother, sir," said Gerald. “ You have
given me something of a right to interfere, and I will go to
town and bring him back to you to-morrow, if you let me.”
“Ay, bring him back, Gerald. Tell him that he must
come home, and spend no more money, while we consider his
future. My heart is too full to-night to have any anger in it.
By Jove, I wish you could tie him up and give him three
dozen, and so wipe out all the score. Now leave me, both of
you, to go through these bills, and find out what I shall have
to borrow.”
Not a thought crossed the simple sailor's mind that his old
friend-his companion of near a score of years—could pos-
sibly object to lending him any sum he might ask. Not an
idea that a Chacomb could object to an alliance with a Revel.
CHAPTER VI.
GERALD looked back at the captain as he drew Marion
silently from the room. The papers lay spread beneath his
hands, but he was not looking at them. His thougbts had
flown back a long way beyond Fred and his debts; they were
in the old time before Marion was born. His eyes were full,
and his lips were moving. People who, in these superior

times, believe in such things, might have thought him
praying
Outside in the garden, swinging her hat by the strings,
and singing as she went, was Adie-untroubled, though she
knew there was trouble. Hers was the light nature, which
she shared with her brother Fred, of being able to disbeli ve
in trouble. She was impatient with people who took things
seriously; she wanted everybody not to mind; she could not
bear to see Marion and her father vexing themselves because
Fred could not keep in the straight and narrow way; it was
incomprehensible to her why anything should give trouble
except sickness and suffering.
“I am glad you have come,” she said, “ because now, I
suppose, it is all made right again. I heard you all talking,
and poor Fred's name used a good deal, so I thought I ought
not to listen, and went right away down to the cove. See
what it is, Gerald, to be in a small house when you are not.
considered grown up, and must keep out of the way. Well,
Marion, you have smoothed things, I hope, for the poor boy.
Marion is the greatest peacemaker in all the world, Gerald.”
“I am sure she is," said her lover.
“ See, dear,” said Marion. “It is past eleven, and you
will catch cold. Let us go in."
Adie pouted, but obeyed.
“Good night, Gerald. You may
kiss me if you
like ; it's
very nice, but I don't think you ought to, you know; you
don't kiss Marion. It is pleasant to have you back again,
though I suppose I am too big now for the old games we used
to have. But there's the swing still, and we can go fishing;
and I can play to you now, instead of Marion; and we can
sing trios. Don't go off to any
horrid places.
Marion used
to read your letters a dozen times, and got creeps and shivers
over the snakes and alligators. Marion, I keep fancying I
hear footsteps in the shrubbery. I was getting quite nervous.
when you came in. Good night, Gerald.”
“ Come, Marion,” said her lover, when her sister ran in,
come to the gate, at least, with me. See, what a lovely
night! Everybody is asleep; walk two steps up the lane.
with me.
It has not been a pleasant ending to the first day
of our engagement, dear Marion ; but you will be happy in:
spite of Fred's weakness, will you not? After all, he is only
& schooiboy, as you said."
“No, Gerald; but a man ought to be strong; it is his duty."

ness.
<
“I will go to town to-morrow, and see what I can do with
him. We shall be back the day after, and enough of Fred,
dear Marion. Now, when no one is looking but the moon,
which has seen so many kisses, put your arms round my neck,
and promise me all over again. My love, it is too great happi-
This is what I dreamed of when I was abroad; it was
for this that I came home. My dear love, my Marion, could
there ever come a time when I should cease to love you ?"
Ten minutes later Marion turned to go into the house.
Gerald was walking home. Comb Leigh was all asleep. And
then she heard, as Adie had heard, steps in the shrubbery.
She stopped and listened.
“ Marion!”
It was a voice that she knew, calling her in low tones. She
turned sick with dread.
“Marion, come here into the shrubbery."
She hesitated a moment, and obeyed.
“Oh, Fred, Fred, Fred !" she whispered, kissing him,
“how could you be so wicked and so foolish ?”
It is Fred, hiding behind the shrubs for a chance to speak
to Marion. His handsome face is clouded with a little care,
but not very much. His blue eyes and fair hair are like
Adrienne's, as is the lofty carriage of his head. His chin is
narrow and retreating, and the corners of his mouth are weak.
But for beauty of form he is a very Apollo, and his voice is
as sweet as a flute.
"I don't know," he replied. “I was wicked because I was
so foolish; I was foolish because I was so wicked; and of
course I have been a great ass. Don't reproach me, Marion;
I came here for a little comfort, and you must not turn upon
me.”
“How can I help turning upon you ? You are breaking
my
father's heart."
“Nonsense, Marion !-nonsense, sweet maid Varion !” he
laughed, flippantly. “People don't break their hearts for a
trifle of money to be paid for their sons' debts. They get
very angry, pay up, and then forgive them.”
“Come in, and see him. Don't hide behind the bushes in
your father's own garden, Fred. Be brave. Come in, and
beg his pardon.”
"I don't know about being brave," he replied. "If I
hadn't gone such an awful cropper, I shouldn't mind so
much; but addition is a beast of a rule in arithmetic when

you come to bring it home to yourself; and I find that the
people have all sent in their bills, and there will be the devil
and all, and—”
“And, oh, Fred, why did you not tell us in June ?”
“Well, you see, my sister, the fact is, I thought there would
be a tremendous row, and-and-when came down the
tutor's letter arrived with me; so I took it from the postman,
and thought it would be just as well that the governor should
not have it."
"Do you mean to tell me, Fred, that you actually stopped
a letter intended for your father?”
“ That, Marion, is just exactly what I did do. No one
knows it except yourself, and no one ever will. Now, Marion,
don't go on and be silly. There's no great harm done, after
all."
Oh, Fred, Fred !" she cried; "and you that we hoped so
much of! It isn't only the debt and the folly and the dis-
grace; but oh, my brother, it is the terrible disappointment.”
He shook off her hand from his shoulder.
“ That's the way with the women. They cry and lament
about nothing. There, Marion, don't make mountains out of
molebills. A little debt and a stupid rustication. Now kiss
me, and say you forgive."
“As if I should not forgive. But it is not my forgiveness
that will do any good. Only come in and see him.”
“ No, Marion, I will not. I came down this evening-tra-
velled with the mail that brought my letter-and hung about
here while you were talking with Gerald Chacomb. Adie
wrote to me that he was back again; but I could not see him
through the trees. I knew his voice, though. If you were a
different sort of girl, I should have thought you were spoon-
ing. Well, I want you to be my friend. Smooth him over.
Tell him he need not worry about the debts. Oxford trades-
men always give long credit, and we will pay them somehow.
And I want to go to Egypt with Lord Rodney. He's quite
the best fellow in the world.”
“ And where is the money to come from ?”
“It won't cost much. Rodney will pay for all but the
travelling expenses. Don't you see the importance of keeping
a friend like that ?”
“Have you forgotten, Fred, that you have no money, that
you have spent all that your father set aside for you, and that
you will have to work your own way in the world ?”

“Don't put things in such a bald, coarse manner, Marion.
It's bad enough to be poor, without being reminded of it."
“What are we to do, Fred? Oh, what are we to do about
you?
“Just nothing, Marion. Let things go on by themselves.
It is always the wisest thing not to fidget and fuss. My dear
child, you are making a great deal of worry."
Fred, you do not understand-you will not understand !
There is no more money left, none at all; but that is nothing.
It is you that we are anxious about-your future, your own
conduct. Once more, will you come in and see your father ?”
“No, I will not,” he returned, doggedly. “I shall go back
as I came. You had better go and tell him that I have been
here."
" It would break his heart to learn that his son came home
and waited outside like a-like a-
“ Like a burglar, I suppose.”
“ Afraid to go into the house and seek his forgiveness."
“ Yes, I am afraid. It is all very well for you, Marion.
You are his favourite. You have been his companion always.
It is with me that he has always been stern and unforgiving.
Poor little Adie and I are the children of his second wife. It
is not our fault, I suppose.”
“Fred, you are unjust.
“ Very likely. I do everything that is wrong. I go to
Oxford, and I live among gentlemen, and not among cads, as
a gentleman. It costs my father a little more than he expected.
I am unlucky enough not to get the scholarships and prizes
you thought I should get. If you only knew the kind of
men who do get these things, you would not think so badly
of me.”
“Gerald Chacomb got a scholarship, and was a fellow."
“ Gerald Chacomb is a prig. Well, it is no use talking,
Marion; go and fetch my little Adie out to give me a kiss.
She won't reproach her brother when he is down on his luck.
If she cannot help me as you can, she can tell me I have done
nothing disgraceful or dishonourable.”
“No, I will not bring Adie to you. _She is in bed, poor
child. Tell me what I can do for you, Fred-don't be cruel.
You know there's nothing in the world I would not do for
you. But, oh, if you would only come in with me!”
“Then I tell you what you shall do for me. To-morrow
you will get my father to write me a letter sanctioning

was
“I have ten pounds left from my own money.
“ Then lend me that, my dear girl. I will give

back
as soon as ever I have any more. I must get back to London.
Run and bring it at once, because I must be off.”
Marion said nothing, but went away
for her
purse.
It
all she had, and with it vanished her last hope of any new
dresses. But she gave it with a cheerful countenance, such
as the Lord loveth.
“And now, Fred, what are you going to do ?”
"I shall walk on to Barnstaple, and go up to town by the
night train. Write to me at the Tavistock, where Rodney
and I are staying."
“ Fred, do not—do not spend more money.".
“ The Tavistock is the cheapest place in all London,” he
replied, airily. “You could not spend money there if you
wanted ever so much. Good night, Marion dear. You are
the best of all girls, only a little inclined to sermonize. You
will never get a husband if you are so solemn and serious.
Come, give me a kiss. There—you are a dear girl—and now
one for Adie. And now I will be off. Mind, I depend upon
your good offices. You will_”
“I will do what I can for you—when have I not? And,
oh, Fred—” remembering suddenly that Gerald was going
to town on purpose to see him.
But Fred kissed her lightly on the cheek, and was gone.
Marion sighed, and returned to her father.
“ You will be happy, child," said the captain, patting her
cheek,
as you
deserve to be, my dear—as you deserve to be.
I am sorry that this other thing has fallen upon us on such
a day; we ought to have been all gladness and joy for my
girl's engagement."

will go to town and see Fred; and we must hope for the best.

ning ways, and how we loved him.”
She spoke as if her half-brother were about ten years
younger than herself.

of will, and how he would fall into temptation-it was the
fault of his nature: we must make allowances for all. Du

papa, he is only a schoolboy-is he not?”
"I will endeavour, dear, to remember, and to make allow-
But the disappointment is grievous, Marion. After
all, money spent is gone, and we are foolish to regret it.
Only I can make no more now; and when I die, dear Marion,
what is to become of those two helpless children? Who will
provide for them ? Thank God, dear, that your future is at
least placed above starvation point.”
“ We are in better hands than our own, father. Now, go
to bed, dear. Let me put up all your papers. See, here is a
letter unopened among them."
“ Another bill, Marion-another bill. I will look at it
to-morrow.”
He put it into his pocket, and shut up the packet of Fred's
bills in his desk.
“My daughter”—he took her face in his hands, and held
it up to his—two faces as honest, brave, and true as this
world has ever seen, and both strangely alike—“ my daughter,
I am going to lose you. I, that have had the first place,
shall have to be content with the second. It is the way
of
the world, and I do not repine, dear. Remember always, my
child, that no husband can love you better than your
father."
“I know it, father!” whispered Marion.
“I did not think I should be so moved, my dear, by any-
thing. It seems as if I had so much to say, and no time to
say it in. I feel as if opportunities for talking to my
daughter would come no more, and yet so much is untold.
It seems as if I were going—not my
Marion.”
“ You are nervous, papa, dear. You will be better to-
morrow."
“Good night, dear. God bless my darling! God preserve
her from harm, and surround her with happiness and love."
The captain's voice broke down, and his eyes melted into
tears.
So the girl's day, that should have been the happiest in her
life, was spoiled by her brother's fault; and the night that
should have been as a bridal night was mingled with a sense
of bitterness that jarred upon her joy. Through her soul
flowed the harmonies of love, but now and then the thought
of ner brother struck discordant notes, and marred the music.
Sowiehow, in the education of our boys, we have dropped out
one or two of the elements of morality. They do not learn

in our great schools and universities the grand duty of
looking things in the face. If they are taught the lesson of
working first and enjoying afterwards, it does not seem to
stick; and the simple principles of common sense, which
should assign to every boy his own way of beginning the
battle of life, are left to be taught by experience. Now, as
Herodotus says,
“Our lessons are mainly taught by our
sufferings.” Poor Fred wanted to enjoy. And, that he
might enjoy, he had brought upon his father's house the
common tragedy of a ruined home. Meantime, with his
sister's last ten pounds in his pocket, he was marching gaily
across the country, to catch the mail train from Barnstaple.
CHAPTER VII.
EARLY in the morning Marion was roused from sleep by a
familiar signal. Not a lover's serenade, for Gerald was in
his bed at Chacomb; nor by the voice of the lark leaving his
watery nest; nor by the early crow of chanticleer ; but by
the rattling of gravel thrown up at her window. She knew
it for the réveille of her father, and, throwing open the case-
mate, looked out-her face making a pretty picture, with the
long hair loose, crinibus solutis, floating round and over it;
her cheeks as dainty as a peach, and her dimpled mouth.
Paint me such a picture, cunning limner. Put in a hand

them to and fro. In the garden is her father. On his face
no signs of last night's trouble, for the morn is bright. He
has slept, and the good has driven off the evil.
“Dress quickly, Marion, and come down,” he whispered,
loud enough for her to hear. “Do not waké Adie.”
Adie was in her own room, next to Marion's, sleeping
soundly. The two servants, who completed the household,
were asleep too; for it was only five, and nothing astir get
but the captain. Nothing ? Everything. The birds were
busy with the early worm—the early worm was busy about
affairs connected with his own digestive organs. The swallow
hunted the fly, the fly looked about for the midge; and
nature wore that busy and cheerful aspect-we associate it
with universal joy and hymns of praise—when everything is
hunting and being hunted. There were sounds from the
village, whose life was already awake and hard at work : a
pump-handle was working noisily; a ploughboy was whistling;
cocks were clearing their throats; somebody was sharpening
a tool upon the grindstone ; pigs were grunting; an ass-
probably a descendant of Lucius, the Golden Ass of Apuleius
--full of emotion at the brightness of the dawn, was greeting
Aurora with melodious bray; a child was crying—Nature in
her loveliest moods seems somehow dissatisfied unless she
can throw in a squalling child; a woman was scolding-if
all were harmony the sweetest morning would pall upon the
senses—but at such a distance as only to touch the soul with
a little jar, a saddened sense of dissonance; and the freshest
of breezes was lifting the leaves upon their stalks and waving
the branches.
Happiness wakes first; hope, next; trouble, last. The
unfortunate young gentleman in the picture, who is just going
to be awakened to fight the tiger for the gratification of Nero
and the delight of the Roman ladies, is very truthfully repre-
sented in that stage of dreaminess which precedes the happy
waking. In another moment he will open eyes full of hope;
in the next he will turn to the roaring and hungry creature
who now pokes eager claws through the bars at him, eager to
slay and devour, and the trouble of horrid anticipation will
begin. Marion woke to happiness and hope. The only trouble
in her heart was the thought of her brother, and this, for the
nonce, she put aside. It was one that could wait.
“ It is such a morning, Marion darling,” said the captain
“ Dress and come down, and we will go for a sail.”

It was indeed a murning of the very finest-such a morn
ing as makes those who have been pulled out of bed at six to
glow with conscious virtue, because it seems like the reward
of a good action. Happy those who have only got up early
on fine mornings. There are men-living men—who have
risen at six on rainy mornings, and so learned to probe some
of the deeper depths of remorse.
Then began a day which was destined afterwards to live in
her memory
-so short, and yet so long—all her life. Not
one single detail was ever to be lost. She remembered how
she knelt for a moment while her father called to her ; how she
prayed quickly for him, for Gerald, and for Fred how she
caught her straw hat-the dainty little straw, brown with sun.
shine and sea breezes, that sat on her head like a crown-and
ran lightly downstairs into the garden and her father's arms
He took her face in his hands, kissing her on the cheeks
and on the lips and on the forehead in a comprehensive way
unusual with him. Then he held her for a moment without
saying anything; and then he passed his hand through her
hair, which hung loose in pretty morning fashion.
“My daughter," he whispered," and so I am going to lose
you.'
"Not yet, papa ; and not altogether, you know."
He shook his head, and let her go.
“Let us make the best of the bright morning, my dearest.
I lay awake half the night thinking of you and Gerald and
poor Fred, until it occurred to me that thinking would be of
no possible use; so I gave it up and went to sleep. Never
mind, dear. I will make it up to-night. Tell your father all
about it, Marion.”
“There is nothing to tell," she replied, reddening a little.
“ It was only yesterday afternoon that Gerald—"
Well, dear, I am not going to ask you what Gerald said.
You know that lovers' words are sacred.”
“ Gerald told me he loved me, that is all. He said he loved
me even before he went away; and I knew nothing of it.”
“But you were always fond of Gerald.”
“Oh, yes, papa-always fond of him; but not in that
way.
And it all seems so different now. I cannot tell you how
different. The world is changed with me since yesterday.”
“ Yes, life is so. A woman leaves her father and her
mother, and cleaveth to her husband. It is the rule of
Nature."

“ But I do not want to leave you, my dear father."
"No, dear. You do not want to, but you will have to leave
ne. Thank God, you can go happily with the man you love."
“I do love Gerald,” she murmured.
And so yesterday was the very first time that young man
spoke to you on this important subject ”
Yes, the first time; unless, perhaps, it was the day before
he left us to go to America, when we had our last walk
together. I remember it so well. We were walking home
through Chacomb Wood, listening to the birds. I was
saying how stupid and lonely it would be without him, and
he-but perhaps he did not mean anything."
“What did he say, Marion ? That is, if I may
ask.”
“He said that he hoped I should always find it lonely and
stupid without him."
“Some prayers are granted,” said her father. “One of the
old philosophers—I suppose it must have been Socrates,
because nobody else ever seems to have said anything at all-
used to say that men ought to be very careful what they
prayed for. The gods, he remarked, sometimes give us what
we ask for, and pretty fools we look then. However, Gerald's
prayer seems to have been a reasonable one, considering every-
thing.”
“ You are not jealous, are you, dear? You know I love
you better than anybody in this world; better even-yes,
perhaps better than my Gerald. But I love him too."
“No, dear, I am not jealous," said the captain, stoutly.
“ Tell me you are glad, papa.”
“Half-truths, my dear, as your poet Tennyson w old tell
you, are a very dangerous kind of falsehood. I am not glad
on my own account. I am saddened, and a little confused to
know what I shall do without you. But I am more glad than
I can tell you for your sake, dear. You are going to marry
the best young fellow in all the world. I do believe, the most
honest, the truest, the most loyal, and the most generous."
Marion's
eyes
filled wih tears.
“ You are the best and kindest of dear fathers. Gerald is
all that you have said, I am sure, and a thousand things
more."
“ You will have to find out how to manage your husband,
you know, Marion. The old rule used to be, never to let him
know how much you love him. That is nonsense. I will give
you a hetter. Make him proud of his work, whatever it is.

steadfast to the one, and you will have the other. The true
ars amoris is the use of intelligent sympathy. You drive your
husband with a light rein when you drive him to success."
“ But I do not want to drive Gerald, papa.”
Do
you not, dear? Chaucer's ladies confessed that what
they liked best of all earthly things was power. But perhaps
the women of the nineteenth century are wiser."
“I shall always be proud of Gerald.”
“Yes, my dear; there are ladies who value their lords

ments. Well, be happy, dearest, let who will be wise. You
will
go and put yourself under the heel of that young man;
he will be your tyrant; he will order you and direct you~'
“Papa, Papa, Papa-will you be quiet? So long as he
loves me, what matter what he does or says ? People who
love each other cannot help being kind and thoughtful.”
“Come down to the cove, my dear, and let us get the boat
ready."
The boat was tossing in the middle of the tiny harbour,
fretting at the rope which held her, while the blue waves came
rolling in over the bar of sand, and tearing themselves to
pieces against the ragged rock on either hand. She was a
strong and serviceable little craft, not afraid of a North
Devon sea or a stiff breeze-one of poor Kingsley's keen
north-easters-and as safe in a squall as a Portsmouth wherry.
The captain hauled in the rope, and Marion shipped the
rudder while he went to the boat-house for mast and sails.
If Marion had few accomplishments, she possessed one in
perfection--the art of sailing. It was a kind of instinct with
her. Had she been so fortunate as to live in the days when
there were no boats, she would have been the first to arm her
heart with triple brass, and invent a raft of some kind for
herself. Fallen on days when there is little in this way
left
to invent, except torpedoes, she made herself as handy as any
boy on the whole coast, from Burnham to Clovelly; good at the
rudder, good at lowering the sail, good at keeping the boat's
head before the wind, good at tacking, good at running,
with gunwale touching the water, before the steady Channel
breeze.

" The breeze is fresh, Marion.” He took the oars, and
rowed out of the cove into the sea beyond. “Now, then, up
with the canvas; keep her steady ; 80! Now she feels it.
Dip your nose in it; jump and dance, my pretty ; show then
a clean pair of heels." He was addressing the boat.
“ Isn't
this better than lying in bed ? And now, Marion, we are
quite alone, and there is nobody but ourselves to hear—let us
talk about your marriage.”
“But I am only just engaged, papa."
“ Gerald is six-and-twenty, dear—an age when a young
man does not look on waiting with any rapture. This morn-
ing I will walk over and talk to Chacomb about it. I expect
him to be as pleased as I am myself."
“Papa, I am afraid of Mr. Chacomb."
“Nonsense, Marion.”
"It is not nonsense. Sometimes he looks so odd. I have
seen him looking sideways at you, papa, woen he thought no
one saw him; and it was as if he wanted to strangle you.
And we have known him all these years, and I never draw
any closer to him."
« Chacomb has his reserved side, Marion, but he is a good
fellow at heart; and he is very fond of Gerald.”
“Ah, yes," said the girl, softening, “he is fond of Gerald.
His voice drops when he speaks to him ; his eyes follow him
about; he forgets to hitch up his shoulder when Gerald is
with him; and-and, oh, papa, he is jealous of you."
“ Marion, you suspicious child, you are making up,'” said
her father.
“No, I am not. It is all true. And suppose he were to
become jealous of me after I am married ?”
“ Then he will be a great donkey, dear. Put these fancies
out of your head. Chauncey Chacomb is as fond of you as I
am almost, though he does not show it. As for m+, I believe
there is nothing that he would not do for me.
For nearly
twenty years we have been companions and friends. No,

without thinking of his son at all. You will own it when I

still day, and try to sketch the light of these early mornings.
But I shall have to come out alone soon, shall I not?

poor
little Adie
with you to see something of the world, will you not?”
They lapsed into silence for a while, wrapped in their
thoughts, and watching the water as the boat flew before the
breeze. The captain's face was composed and grave, but his
expression was that of one who looks forward.
So they glided swiftly past the long shore of headland after
headland; passing the peaceful villages lying in long streets
behind the coves; catching glimpses of homesteads dotted
here and there, and hearing the tinkle of the sheep bells
from the high downs. Presently the captain shook himself
together.
"I am dull for you, Marion; but I was thinking. Let us
'bout ship, and tack for Comb Leigh again. I was thinking
about the old days—the days before you were born, my dear.
Strange that the time should come back to me to-day so vividly
that I thought put away and buried long ago. I never told
you, Marion, about your mother's marriage; somehow we
have not talked together a great deal about her, even when
we have been alone.
“She was very beautiful, Marion-more beautiful than you,
my dear. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever
seen, and the best and kindest. You are like her so far.
She was the daughter of a man in the position of Chauncey
Chacomb—a country squire of Dorsetshire. Until I knew her
father, I did not understand what was meant by county
families and county pride. My dear, your grandfather was
as proud as Lucifer. He had nothing whatever, so far as I
could ever learn, no single point of distinction, to be proud
of. He and his grandfathers had held their estates for a
great many generations. During all these centuries, always
opulent, always well educated, always with every chance of
success, not one single man had ever distinguished himself.
Most of the great Englishmen, somehow, do seem to come
from the landed people; but your mother's family had not yet
produced even a third-rate great man. However, the fact
remained that he was proud. I was only a lieutenant, with
very little except my pay. Mary loved me. I spoke to her
father, and was received with rather more contumely, I thought,
than he would have bestowed upon one of his own footmer
soming with the same request. I was a Frenchman ; tha
was his first objection. "No Frenchman,' he said, "coul
possibly be of good family. Thereupon I produced the deas

old genealogy-you know it, dear—with Charlemagne, Godfrey
of Bouillon, and the rest of them. He laughed at the pedi.
gree, which he politely insinuated was a forged one. "If I
had a pedigree, he said, 'where were the estates? You
see, he could not possibly understand descent without estates.
Of course, it was hopeless to explain to him what the Revo-
lution had done for us. Also it was hopeless to tell him that,
with his great fortune, it ought to matter simply nothing-
and would have mattered nothing in old France-whether I
had money or not. So, dear, as it was of no use to expect
anything from him, and time was valuable, we took the law
into our own hands, Mary and I, and ran away together.
We were married the same day at Southampton. When your
grandfather received the fatal news, he sent a letter cutting
his daughter off with the little portion he could not touch.
It is what you have now, dear Marion-your fifty pounds a
year. Then he struck her name out of the big Bible, forbade
her ever to be mentioned again, and sat down with the con.
sciousness of having behaved in a manner becoming his
dignity."
« Poor mamma!”
“She cried a little at first, but we made ourselves happy.
I had a little money to spend, and we went to visit the old
place in France, which I had never seen at all.
Then we
agreed to live at Portsmouth until I could get a ship, for
which I had to wait about a year. Marion, it was a very
happy year, the happiest year I ever had. Only a year, and
then you came, my dear; and and I lost your mother. So
I went to sea again; and—well, until you grew up, my love,
and could talk to me, I had very little happiness.
Of his second wife the captain never spoke to any one.
Fred and Adie had learned by some instinct to ask no questions
about their mother. Nor had Marion ever rentured to lift
the curtain which her father kept closed.
“And now, Marion, that you are going to marry into one
of the oldest county families in Devonshiremas old as the
Carews, or the Mays, or the Poles—we might, perhaps, think
about a reconciliation. I have lived out of the world with
you
too long. You will be able, when you are married, to go into
society; and I should like you to go with such family cre-
dentials as we can boast."
“ But, papa, have we no relations in France ?"
“ Conisins in plenty, dear; and some day I will hunt them

out, and we will go over and call upon them; and I will take
my own name and title again for the occasion.”
“I am glad,” said Marion, “ that in all the great family of
humanity we have some one to call of our kin."
“ To-morrow, dear, I will give you all your mother's letters.
You shall read her love letters to me. I think I could not
have shown them to you before your heart had learned what
love means, and what those letters had been to me-how
sacred and how precious. I want your mother to teach you,
from her grave, something of what a woman can be to her
lover and her husband. I should not like you to be married
without learning for yourself all that these letters can teach.
Enough talking, dearest. Here is Comb Leigh. Have you
enjoyed your sail ?”
Yes, papa ;
but the talk more."
“Now, then. Hold her up, Marion—80-cleverly steered.
There is Adie coming down to meet us. Breakfast-break-
fast, both my daughters."
He kissed Adie on the forehead; but as they walked up to
the house together, his arm was on the neck of his elder girl.
CHAPTER VIII.
PERHAPS if one were asked to name a time when his courage
would be highest and his spirits most buoyant he would fix
by choice upon a holiday morning in August, when the sun
was shining, All the better, then, if he might be on the
North Devon coast, watching the course of the south-west
wind sweeping up the broad stretches of the Bristol Channel,
and crisping the waves into foaming curls. Great, above all,
is the power of the sun. When Aurora and old Tithonus,
like a buxom young Cambridge bedmaker and an elderly
gyp, have put out the stars and swept up the untidy clouds,
the sun goeth forth to work marvels. We know very well
how he brings with his breath the golden clusters to the
laburnum, and the blushes with his staring to the young
grape's cheek. What we do not sufficiently take note of is
his power on the heart of man, bringing to it flowers and
fruit as to a tree, and making tender sprays of imagination
shoot up even in the most unlikely breasts. I believe that if
you nail a scholar to a south wall, he will become a ripe
scholar; and I am sure that a young prig, caught early, and

trained like a pear tree, may be made to produce in time big
word-criticisms in the People who live habitually in the
sun never nurse evil dispositions, or brood over fancied wrongs,
or spend valuable time in anticipating evil. It is best, there-
fore, to be born in August, so that the first things your eyes
rest upon in this world may be flowers, the clear sky, the
sun, and faces which, like Ruth among the stooks, "praise
the Lord with sweetest looks." I can hardly think it lucky
to be born in March or April, when east winds blow. Children
of those months are apt to grow up perverse, ill-conditioned,
and of uncertain temper; and it is of course ridiculous for
any one to be born between December and February. The
folk of sunny lands, prone, it may be, to sudden storms-even
to sticking wrathful knives in neighbourly ribs—are a gay
and light-hearted people, dwelling together in amity, careless
of the future.
The sunshine entered into Captain Revel's heart. He had
no misgivings this morning-no doubt about the future.
What had been dark was now bright. The sky was clear
above him. He left the cottage to call upon the squire,
Marion watching him as he slowly started on his journey.
First he loitered for a few minutes among
his
roses;
then he
stepped into the road briskly, but stopped to hold a short
conversation with a neighbour's dog, one of his oldest and
most trusted friends. Then, apparently at the dog's invita-
tion, he looked into the farmyard and inspected the pigs.
Oh, papa,” said Marion to herself,“ do go on.
Then he stood for five minutes in the road, studying
thoughtfully the mechanism of the water-wheel. Being quite
satisfied at length with its working, he proceeded a few steps
higher up. Here there was a smithy with the smith hard at
work, the fire blazing and roaring, the anvil ringing, and the
sparks flying.
“Now he will go in and talk to the smith," thought
Marion
The captain did not go in, but he stood at the doorway
talking to the man. The sparks of the hammer ceased, the
roaring of the bellows dropped to an occasional groan; and
in the quiet of the noonday Marion heard the voices. Then the
faptain took out his pocket-book, and made a little sketch.
Marion knew what he was drawing. Back at the end of the
ww, dark smithy part of the roof had fallen in, and the sun.

shades among the blackened beams and the iron tools hanging
upon the nails.
“I wish I was with him," said Marion.
The sketch finished, the captain nodded a friendly fare-
well to the smith, and proceeded a few yards farther. Pre.
sently there crossed his path a file of geese, following each
other with heads down, outstretched necks, flapping wings,
and as much importance in their manner as if they were a
band of strong-minded women with a particular engagement,
now due, to go and sit upon a platform and demand that
everything should be all argued out again from the beginning,
with a special proviso that no more knowledge should be
imparted into the controversy than each woman could her-
self boast.
“Cackle, cackle, cackle!” cried the geese. Leave us to
reconstruct the world : we know everything. Cackle, cackle
-we will teach the world everything; we will upset every
thing. Let the ganders lay the eggs. Cackle, cackle! Sage
and onions shall be cultivated no more. We will argue only
with those who agree with us. Cackle, cackle! We are the
wise and learned sex. Who is this two-legged creature in the
path? Let him go and lay eggs.'
"Pardon, mesdames,” said the captain, taking off his hat
and making a very fine bow, quite a reverence of the ancien
régime, to the little procession.
They crossed the road and plunged into the next field,
when they began to fall out with each other.
Then the captain went on.
Presently he came to where the road to Chacomb was met
by the path which ran down from the cliffs, the same lane
which Marion and Gerald had climbed the day before. Here
he stopped, and besitating for a moment, took the turn to the
left, and began to walk up the lane.
“I thought,” said Marion, with a little disappointment,
" that he was going to Chacomb Hall."
The fact was that the captain, wrapped in his thoughts,
quite forgot the purpose with which he started, and was now
taking his customary walk up the hill.
When he was out of sight, Marion went into the house for
something to read. New and recent literature rarely found
its way to Comb Leigh, and the most attractive volume she
could find was one of Pope's poems. She chose this, and
retreated to the shadiest place in the garden, where she could

escape the rattle of her younger sister's talk, and sat down
with the volume open before her. But her thoughts very soon
wandered far away from the poet. Ah, philosophers and
verse-makers, how many a time your books are opened, and
the characters, which never reach the brain, read by the eye
alone! The ghost of the little Twickenham poet was looking
down upon her from the spirit world. “She is reading me,
he observed, with pardonable pride, to his friend Bolingbroke.
“She is reading my poems. Observe, my St. John, she leaves
all meaner things to vain ambition and the pride of kings.
She could do nothing better. Prudent nymph! Happy
bard !”
First her thoughts wandered away to Gerald, and to the
sweet confidences of yesterday. There was the novitas rei, the
newness of the thing, which yet seemed, under all the cir.
cumstances, as if nothing else could ever have been expected.
It was not strange at all. She belonged to Gerald, she said
to herself; but then, somehow, she always had belonged to
Gerald, and so that was nothing new. And then she fell to
wondering what Gerald's father would say, and her thoughts
yielding to the soft influence of the summer season, she
began, in dreamy fashion, with lids dropped, to listen to the
sounds in the air around her. The geese, after disputing
with each other as to which knew most, through personal
wrongs in particular, about the rights of geese in general, fell
to pecking and snapping, quite like platform ladies, and with
guch a cackle as may be heard on a Saturday evening in
Ratcliff-highway, what time the placens uxor expects her hus-
band to return with wavering step and multiplying eye,
bringing home the scanty residue of the weekly wage. After
this battle, the geese, arriving at the conclusion that there
was nothing to be got by arguing with nasty, obstinate
things who would not listen, retired to separate corners and
sulked, making savage dabs at tasteless tufts of grass, and
pitching, with more than usual vehemence, into the unwary

ing. Presently the old village carpenter, who was also a
boatman, came along the road, swearing softly and melodiously,
because there was nobody to talk to, at things in general,
and bearing with him something hot and smoking, which
he began to daub over the bottom of his boat. The smoke
curled up, black and sooty grey, darkening, where it spread,

the clear blue of the sky. Then the carpenter, too, taking
his hammer, chimed in with the blacksmith, the geese, the
anvil, and the fire, with a steady tap-tap, as he tinkered and
cobbled the bottom of his old craft. Every sound was
separate and well-defined, but yet seemed to blend together
and make music. Marion's thoughts passed away wholly
from herself, and became a part of what she heard; so that
in the future, where this morning was to live for ever, it
seemed as if no precious moment had been lost, nor one
single thing dropped from her memory of what made it
sweet and beautiful. Besides the blacksmith, and the boat.
man, and the geese, she became aware of the great water-
wheel going round with a steady burr-r-r in deep undertone,
like the pedal notes of an organ; there was a grasshopper
at the foot of an apple tree, pretending to be an Italian and
a cigale; there were those big, foolish fellows, the credulous
humble-bees, going about with their trumpets, firmly con-
vinced, and trying to convince other people, that the devil
was dead, and that “ warm days should never cease;" there
were the pigs, fond and faithful lovers of the present, grunt-
ing violoncello notes of satisfaction and content; there was
the turkey, whom the poetical Scott calls the bubbly-jock,
gobbling in the distance, with a melodious gurgle as of an oboe
played softly; with him were the ducks, a material-minded
race, whose hearts are too much set upon things of this world
- they quacked like the gentle flageolet in its lower notes ;
there was a peacock who screamed, and it was as if cymbals
clashed; everything chimed in, as if there was no shirking
possible on such a day, but all must help to swell the great
concerted piece. The waves lapped gently upon the shore,
the leaves rustled in the light breeze, and from the orchard
came the twittering of the birds. Marion knew how to diso
tinguish them every one; that was the cooing of the wood-
pigeon; that the shrill pipe of the wren.
August is late for him," said Marion.
The chaffinch, somewhere invisible, added his monotonous
song; the little bluetit flew from branch to branch with a
short, quick note, in impatience at the concert; the blackcap
sang as if he was uncertain whether to imitate the nightingale
or the blackbird ; on the top of a rugged and twisted old apple
tree sat the chiff-chaff, calling his own name as loudly as if he
were playing a part in a burlesque; the yellowhammer, wlic

“There are more,” said Marion to herself ; “but I cannot

As she listened, peace flowed in upon her soul with a rush
like the bore of a tidal river; the music set itself to words;

“Gerald-Gerald-Gerald-my lover Gerald !"
Presently her head leant backwards, her eyes closed, and
the volume dropped from her hands upon the grass.

CHAPTER IX.
The lane up which the captain was walking was a lane of
set and serious purpose. It ran straight up the hill, bending
neither to the right nor to the left, perhaps in imitation of
bigger roads built by the Romans. It was paved with loose
flat stones, like stepping-stones or stairs, and now and then
made you desire, when they slipped from your foot and
brought you down, to pile them in a heap, and use them to
raise
your Bethel instead of your woes, as recommended by
the hymn. Nevertheless, a pretty lane, set on either side
with a hedge whereon climbed and clung the wild rose, its
blossoms gone for the summer, but bright with hips; the
honeysuckle, which is mercifully ordered to bloom from
June till October; and the sweet wild convolvulus, which
flowers whenever it gets any encouragement in the way of
sunshine. Half-way up the lane there was a pound, crected
once by a defunct churchwarden of Puritanical views as

regards straying animals. As he was alone in his opinions,
and died without disciples, no living thing had ever been
impounded in it. Sitting on the topmost bar of the pound,
bis feet on the second rail, among the long grass and weeds
which grew up in the interior of this sunlit dungeon, and
poked spikey heads through the rails, was the very man whom
Captain Revel wished to see-Chauncey Chacomb. The squire
was, unfortunately, more moody, more savage this morning
than the previous night. He was especially angry with
himself, because he had let his great secret, the secret of his
overpowering jealousy and hatred, pass from himself to the
doctor. So felt Samson when he awoke in the morning, and
remembered what he had told to Dalilah. He had noticed
his cousin's strange and searching glance. He knew what it
meant. It wanted no words for him to understand that Joe
Chacomb thought him—Chauncey-to be going mad; and he
knew, besides, that it was true. He had pressed upon his
cousin that morning a cheque for double the sum he had
asked for the day before, and both felt that it was to pay
for
silence. They had walked together gloomily after breakfast
up the lane, and Joseph, tired of his moody companion,
went on and left him on the rail, alone with his reflections.
He did not look well. His face was pallid; his eyes were
bloodshot, for he had been awake all night; his lips were
twitching; there was a long, straight crease across his
forehead ; his right shoulder--the uneven one-was hitched
up to his ear; his fingers were beating a tattoo upon the
rail. What cruel fate was this that brought the two men
together in such a place, and at such a time?
It is in the seventeenth century style-quite rococo now,
and antiquated-to attribute disastrous events to the agency
of the Devil in person. The more modern, perhaps the
better, plan is to avoid going quite to the bottom of things,
and
say that accident, circumstance, or chance led to such and
such a conjunction of events. What are we to say? Is it
design, or is it chance ? One is taken, and the other left.
One catches the train which is going to be smashed, but goes
off jeering at the other who is too late, and is left behind
upon the platform. One starts for Australia by the steamer
which founders in the Bay of Biscay, while the othe: waits for
that which is going to resist the storm. One gets a bullet in
the head, while the other comes out of the battle with only
bis coat sleeve ridded. On this August morning, a man took

a turn to the left instead of keeping straight on, as he had
intended. Safety was in the one path, and in the other-
death.
The rugged upland path led the captain's straying feet
slowly up the flat stones which formed the rough steps of the
lane. Before him, leading him insensibly, in fact, by the
hand, stalked the fine actor who plays the principal part in
the Danse Macabre. It is a defect in that otherwise admirable
series of drawings, that every single sketch is a group of two,
wherein the intention of the leading figure, despite his polite-
ness-you will observe the gallant bearing of the Chevalier
La Mort towards the ladies—is but_too apparent. A later
artist would bave represented the Disguise of Mors. He
would have shown him as lurking beneath a stone in the
shape of a viper, or flying through the air as an eagle, or
crouching in shrubs like a panther, or even sitting on an old
village pound by the side of mad Chauncey Chacomb, whis-
pering devilry. But, in any case, the patient-or beneficiary
-Dominus Moribundus, would have advanced to his fate
with a step as cheery, a smile as jocund, a bearing as gallant,
a countenance as unsuspicious, a heart as light, as Captain
Revel.
He greeted Chacomb with a laugh, which reminded him of
yesterday's humiliation-a laugh which set every nerve of the
jealous and suspicious man tingling; a laugh utterly regard-
less of those morbid feelings which natures such as Chauncey
Chacomb's generally mistake for evidences of superior deli.
cacy and refinement.
" You, Chacomb ?” he cried; "and up here? The very
man I wanted to see. Come off your perch, man, and walk
up to the top with me. Where's the doctor ? Did Gerald
go off this morning? How is the picture looking to-day?
Ha ! ha! We shall find it a breather for the next five
minutes. Not so young as we were, we old fellows. How
are the flesh tints, and the delicate outlines of the panel, eh ?
Ho! ho !"
Chauncey Chacomb screwed his mouth into what he meant
for a smile, and slowly descended from his rail. If he was
getting older---granted that he was sixty-one---so much the
more reason for hiding the fact away. If he had made a
mistake about the picture—and he was not so certain of that
- it was an additional proof of bad taste in the captain to
barp upon it.

of us are,
I
suppose.
“I like the niggers for one thing," said Revel, leading
" they never know their own age within forty or
fifty years. I once knew an old fellow on the West Coast
who died at a hundred and twenty, as near as could be
guessed, and refused to be comforted when he was being
snuffed out, because he was cut off in his youth."
“I am not a hundred and twenty,” returned the other,
gloomily.
Revel did not notice bis bad temper. He was one of those
men whose own tempers are so equable, that they are slow to
suspect ill-temper in others. Nothing short of the wildest
outbreak on the part of Chauncey Chacomb would have
made the captain realise that his old friend could be actuated
by any but the most kindly and cheerful sentiments.
“Look round, Chacomb, at the view up the valley. I do
not know which is the best time in the day to mount this
hill. It'rink such a morning as this, when there is no mist
to hide the glorious breadth of colour. There was a light
sea fog at six, but it has gone. There is a picture for you.
It ought to be all the more enjoyable for being your own,
eh ? À more valuable picture than any in the Collection.
Possession adds an additional charm of its own, I should
think. I remember going to France about three and twenty
years ago. I took my first wife there, in fact, for our honey-
moon, poor tbing, to show her the old place that was ours
for a thousand years, until the Revolution swept us all away.
It was on a summer morning like this. The ruins of the
châter 11 are on the left bank of the Loire as you go down
the digue, you know, is on the other side. There is a town on
the right bank, just a scrap of a town; a bridge over the
river, which runs like a brook over its shallow and pebbly
bed; and on the other side there is a little bill where they
built the castle—one tower at each end, halls and chapels and
dungeons between-almost a royal castle for the memory of
abominable things; for my people were great sticklers for
seigneurial rights. Very odd, Chacomb, that a man's heart
glows with pride to remember that his ancestors were great
rogues. The place is all in ruins now, but I went over it and
spent the pleasantest day in all my life, pointing out to my
wife the place where the thumbscrewing went on, where the
rack stood, where the peasants were shut up on bread and

water, and all the rest of it. It was just such a day as this,
and we stood on the top of the tower, and looked over miles
of as fertile country as there is in France. All ours once. I
understood the pride of ownership for the first time, though
I had no part or share in a single rood of land. I envy you,
Chacomb.".
The squire's head relented a little. It is undoubtedly a
pleasant thing to be envied. The desire of exciting envy is,
perhaps, next to the spur of necessity, one of the principal
motives to work and stimulants to success. Those who de-
precate the love of envy are themselves most liable to the
passion—the poor and disappointed folk, not the rich and
envied. I have known ladies who, I am quite certain, enjoyed
their own fine things in proportion to the green and bilious
feelings of envy they saw aroused in their friends and guests.
If you want to see the highest enjoyment, chiefly caused by
the awakening of profound envy in others, give a small
schoolboy a watch and chain; a youthful schoolgirl a seal-
skin jacket; or a charity child a fourpenny-piece.
“Yes, Chacomb,” the captain went on, "I envy you. I
wish I had broad acres and forest land of my own, as my
grandfather had. It would help me now, at all events."
The squire, who was panting behind him, instinctively took
his hands out of his pockets and buttoned up his coat. At
all events, he would lend no money.
Why now ?” he asked.
“ First, because I should have less anxiety about that boy
of mine ; and secondly, because I should not have to let my
Marion go to your Gerald empty-handed.”
The squire lifted his head, wagged it, nodded it, and
grinned silently. Then he accelerated his pace, and lessened
the distance between the captain and himself.
“Say that again, Revel. "I did not quite catch.”
“I say, Chacomb, that I am sorry to let Marion go almost
empty-handed to her husband."
6 Åh !” said the squire.
66 When did rald tell you ?”
“ He did not tell me."
The captain went on, still striding in advance. It was
like one of those processions that may be seen in a mediæval
manuscript. First marches the knight, chivalrous and frank;
behind him goes the villein, with the thoughts of a villein
stamped upon his face; with the latter, arm in arm, no less

a personage than the Devil. The first walked with a light
and springy step, the sunshine pouring over the hedge upon
his face; he walked as one whose heart is full of hope; the
second, crouching and bent, seemed to pull his feet painfully,
step by step, up the ascent. He was in shadow, too, being
much shorter than the other, save when a gap in the bushes
allowed the sunshine to throw a gleam of light upon his face,
which brought out the more forcibly the seaminess with
which his passions were furrowing it. As for the third Per-
son, he was invisible. Had it been otherwise, I would joy.
fully have described him to you in this place, and then iny
history would have been indeed original, unique, and priceless.
“ Gerald did not tell you! Ah, he went off too early this
morning. But you suspected, old friend, eh? You thought,
perhaps, what might happen when the boy came home
again ?"
"I suspected? Yes, I did suspect," said the squire.
“I did not, Chacomb. You knew your boy better than I
did. But it seems natural now: a thing so right and fitting
for both that, though it was only arranged last night, it has
settled down in my thoughts as completely as if it had been
arranged from the beginning. To be sure, the pair have been
always together, except when Gerald was away. You know
the long letters he used to send her. There was not a word
of love in a deskful of them; but it would be easy to read
them now by the light of what we know, and find out proofs
-eh ?-of something deeper than friendship. I wish you
joy, Chacomb, of your new daughter. Marion will make a
fair châtelaine of Chacomb Hall."
The squire answered nothing, but twitched up his right
shoulder with a half-glance sideways, as if to make sure that
it was there. That portion of his frame might have been
the chosen seat of an evil genius, from the attention he be-
stowed
upon
it in disturbed and anxious moments. A look
of doubt, as if his way was not quite clear before him,
crossed his face. Then he lifted his head and listened again,
for the captain's heart was full, and he must needs go on.
“ Gerald and Marion-Marion and Gerald—they have
been in my thoughts together so long that it will be no
effort to keep them together always. Gerald and Marion.
It is a great happiness to me--a greater happiness, Cha-
comb, than I could have hoped or expected. Gerald has
been to me always as dear as my own son.
There is no boy

to whom I would more gladly entrust my girl's happ)
ness."
His son's praises only made the self-tormentor more angry.
But he chafed in silence.
“I do think, Chacomb," the captain went on, that Hea-
ven is kinder to us than we can even ask. When things
look darkest, comes a touch of fortune that lights up the
whole atmosphere again. They looked very dull last night
when I heard how Fred had disgraced himself. Did Gerald
tell you that?”
“No-no! Disgraced himself? Tell me about that,"
answered the squire, quickly.
“ He has been rusticated for a year."
“ Ah !" The squire smacked his lips and drew a long
breath-perhaps of fatigue. “ Was it—was it for anything
more than usually shameful and dishonourable ?"
“ As you please to look at ito Gerald tries to make light
of it. It was only a schoolboy freak.”
"A schoolboy freak, you call it. Fred is only twenty, is he?"*
“ Very nearly. He is three years younger than Marion.
The news came last night. I was gloomily looking over the
letters and bills"
“Fred has got into debt, then ? Ah !"
“When the two came in, and told me all about it. Well,
I have had a long spell of fair weather : I must expect an
occasional squall. But I have thought it all out, Chacomb.
I will tell you what I propose. I take it for granted, my
dear
old friend, that you are as pleased at the match as I am.
Gerald will stay at home with you; he will be your right-
hand nan. Marion will show you what it means to have a.
daughter. You shall lend me money to pay off the prodigal's.
debts. We will have the wedding in September; and then
I shall take the boy to London, put him to some work, and
take care of him myself. Poor Fred is only a boy, after all."
As the captain enumerated each clause of his proposed
plan of perfect happiness, the squire's right ear and shoulder
came together with little jerks, each of great meaning.
“Oh, Fred is only a boy. And the marriage will take
place in September. And you will go to London to take care
of him. I see. Very good.”
“ That is what I think of doing. It runs in the blond,
you see. My father, who was forty-five when he married,
began with what you may call a good solid foundation of

on the
debt. The hereditary tendency passed over me, and has
attacked
poor Fred. Unfortunate that I did not foresee the
danger. Then I should not have had to borrow of you."
“Quite so," said the squire, with a grin. “That's very
unfortunate ; extremely unfortunate—that is."
“Fred's debts come to about a thousand pounds, all told.
Not so bad for the son of a half-pay officer, is it? But what
should we have said if he had emulated the example of his
great-great-uncle, the chevalier, who distinguished himself, a
century and a half ago, by a career rather shorter and a great
deal merrier? It only lasted six months. He was a private
friend of the Regent, and a very particular friend of the
Countess de Parabère. Some other young fellow ran him
through the body, after one poor little
chuck, as we used to say in the navy, and they found his
debts were half a million of francs. No one paid them, poor
fellow; and history, while it drops a tear over the chevalier,
has none for his creditors. There must have been something
winning about the young fellow to make all the world trust
him. Perhaps Fred is like him. At all events, Chacomb,
this is the position of affairs. There is a balance of four
hundred or so in the bank, all that is left of the money
saved
for the boy's education. Marion and I put it by, you know.
There will be six hundred to pay. Now, I intend to ask you
for that sum, Chacomb."
“Ah!” said the squire, who was growing purple in the
face, perhaps with the exertion of going uphill.
Yes, you shall lend me that sum, and I shall be able to
pay you back when Fred gets an income.”
“When Fred gets-ah !-gets an income,” gasped the
squire.
" It will be a few years——two or three years-first, I am
But I shall devote myself to the boy. Never fear
for Fred, Chacomb. Perhaps I have been too fond of my
Marion, and neglected the boy. That shall be seen to-and
at once."
The squire, answering nothing, began to swing his arms
backwards and forwards. Over his face came the same ex-
pression which had alarmed the doctor the previous night, a
look of uncontrollable passion, which surged up into his
cheeks in bursts of crimson, and receded, leaving them pallid;
which made his lips full and his mouth tremble; which gave
unwonted fire to his eyes. But now the doctor vas not

present, and Chauncey Chacomb, with that invisible com.
panion we have spoken of, had it all his own way.
As the captain spoke the last words, the lane came to an
end at a field gate which led to the open down. The level of
the summit was reached.
“Ah,” cried Revel,“ here we ard at last.”
Without looking rouud he vaulted the gate, and turned
off upon the level, springy turf towards the edge of the cliff,
followed by the other two, a little distance behind him-
Chauncey Chacomb and the Devil.
Tine grass is pleasant after the stony path," said the cap-
tain. “This is the place that my girl is so fond of. I believe
she used to sit up here by herself, and watch the ships coming
up the Channel — silver sails all out of the west'—thinking
that one of them might bring Gerald. I will take
you
where
she used to come: the very best place for a good sea view,
especially when it is fine enough to see Lundy, between this
and Clovelly. You may watch the sea, if you like, while I
read you my young scapegrace's letter."
Captain Revel was like the unfortunate draper in “Pierre
Pathelin,” divided between his wool and his sheep, inasmuch
as his thoughts went from one thing to the other. They
were divided between Marion and Fred.
“And when we have read the letter, we will talk over
Gerald and Marion's affairs."
There was near them a fourth person lying on the grass,
whom Chauncey Chacomb had forgotten, his cousin Joseph.
He was reclining supine in considerable comfort; his head
was propped on a pillow made up of a little mound of tufted
grass, surrounded by one of the squire's soft felt hats—a new
and a very good hat—which he had crumpled up; he had
put on a new Tweed coat belonging also to the head of the
Chacomb clan-it mattered very little about the sleeves being
too short; he was smoking one of half a dozen cigars he had
thoughtfully taken from Gerald's own box, brought by him
from Havana ; he occasionally tapped with thankfulness that
portion of his chest on which lay the pocket-book with
Chauncey Chacomb's cheque for £200; his legs were crossed
and his arms thrown out upon the grass, so that the warm
sun and the cool breeze could work unchecked all their bene
ficent will upon him.
His eyes were half-closed as he watched the blue wreaths
from his cigar rise daintily into the air, and the wind blow

them away, streaming like a girl's tresses by the sea-shore.
Near him sat a fat and motherly-looking ewe, pretending to
be pleased rather than frightened at the proximity of the
stranger. Every now and then he made faces at her, blew
the smoke in her direction, and even shook a menacing boot
at her. In vain: the experienced matron smiled like a
Celestial, but moved not. Ugly faces do not hurt, they
amuse; boots may shake, but do not fly off like flints and
pebbles ; tobacco smoke is even pleasant in the open air. To
be sure, all sheep naturally have an aversion to the smell
within closed doors, because butchers' assistants have a habit
of smoking common tobacco in certain places, never named
among the race, where the associations are unpleasant. So
the sheep sat and looked on; while the doctor, in murmuring
tones, like one who eats the lotos in a land where it is always
afternoon, addressed her with honeyed words and dulcet tones.
“Mother of mutton," he said, with a smack of his lips,
“fear not the stranger who comes with neither club nor
dog. Your children, madam, have gone, perhaps, to the
bourne which makes that stranger the man he is. The lambs
whom you imagine to be in exile in foreign lands have worked
up into these arms and legs, and this scientific brain. Alas,
unmindful of mint sauce, among the mint they played. There
is thus, madam, if one may say so, a kind of relationship
between us.
We may even one day knit closer the tie that
binds us. The grass which you are champing—it is succulent,
and eats short, I am sure, from the expression of your open
countenance—may perhaps, in other forms, become part of
the frame of the humble philosopher who addresses you.
This, madam, is a law of the universe: life preys on life, the
strong devour the weak; and though I'sincerely hope that I
shall not eat your ladyship, and that your sphere of maternal
usefulness may
be protracted for many a happy summer, you
will acknowledge that I must devour somebody, and may
have to devour you. Animals with brains are more dangerous
to lambs than animals with muscles. Your respected husband,
madam, Sir Timothy Ram-I believe it is a good old county
name-is a strong creature, but a mighty fool; the fox is a
crafty animal, and, though he lacks strength, has hitherto
managed to preserve his independence. I, La Mère, if you
will allow me the expression, am both strong and crafty;
therefore I am to be feared by lambs. I will give you s
wrinkle, madam: never you work for yourself, if you can get

any one to work for you. Joseph Chacomb, O sheep of
solemn vacancy, is forty-five years of age; he has hitherto
made other people work for him; he proposes to continue
that line of action; and he hopes devoutly never to do any
more work at all.
For his cousin Chauncey has blossomed
into an Ass so enormous, that it would be an unspeakably
sinful thing to let another have the squeezing and the plucking
of him. Families should keep their hawks as well as their
pigeons among themselves; and it is only Christian to do
unto your cousin that which other men would do unto him
if they could. Gerald, madam, is an ass of another kind.
My own sincere prayer is that Gerald may marry Marion,
and-
Here his soliloquy was cut short by the sound of voices, or
of one voice, and raising his head a little he saw Revel, with
the squire following at his heels, walking as I have described
across the down in the direction of the cliff. Naturally he
did not see the third person, who was invisible.
“What the devil is the matter with Chauncey ?" murmured
the doctor. “He looks exactly as he did last night.
Just then the squire raised his face, so that the sunlight
fell full upon it.
“By gad,” said the doctor, rousing himself, “I believe
there will be a row. Look at the captain pointing placidly
with his stick to the sea, while Chauncey mops and mows
behind him, like an ape who would like to swear horribly,
but forgets the words. This grows interesting."
>
Chauncey Chacomb followed mechanically, his body bent
and half crouching, though the ground was level; but his
hands were spread out half-way between the hips and the
shoulders, with quick restless movements ; his
eyes
watched
Revel's back with a strange intensity of gaze, which was like
a wild beast's glare; his lips worked uneasily; his cheek
twitched.
“I wonder if he is mad?” said the doctor, watching. “I've
a good mind to go and spoil the row. I believe he must be mad.”
He sat up to see better. The ewe, thinking the time for
dissimulation was past, started to her feet and scuttled off in
undisguised terror. But Dr. Chacomb was not thinking of her.
“I am sure,” he said to himself, “that if Chauncey had a
dagger he would stick it into Revel's back. He looks more
dangerous than he did last night. There must be a row.

the sea.
Why does not Revel turn round ? It would be fun to see
him, just now, catch that charming expression on my cousin's
face, when it looks most devilish. If they come to a fight I
shall have to intervene, like the Queen's Proctor, or a police-
man at a pantomime.”
He had not long to wait.
The two moved on across the ground, which rose a little
until it reached a sort of saddle-back, from which the turf
sloped rapidly for eight feet or so, until it came to the edge
of the cliff, which here descended almost perpendicularly to
The figures stood out for a moment to the doctor's
eye like two black silhouettes before the bright and sunny
sky: the one erect and tall, the other crouched and mis-
shapen.
Then the captain stopped.
“Here we are, Chacomb. The best place in all Devonshire
on a fine summer's day; a place for lovers to sit and dream.
I believe it was here that Gerald and Marion yesterday came
to an understanding, as the country folk say. Ha! ha!
Now we will sit down and talk it over.” He turned round
slowly, as a man does who is looking for a soft place to sit
“Good God, Chacomb, what is the matter?"
The man's face was wild with boiling rage: his cheek was
white; his eyes were red; his hands were raised to the level
of his face, and held palms outward ; his teeth chattered, but
he could find no words. Chauncey Chacomb was mad, much
more mad than when, the night before, he had poured out the
secret of his foolish soul.
“Chacomb !" repeated the captain.
“I-I-I hate you !” stammered the other, feeling about
the air with his hands, as if searching for words.
"I hate
you! I would kill you if I could !"
He moved forward with a threatening gesture. Captain
Revel, bewildered, stepped back. And then-then, all in a
moment, the bloodshot eyes of the madman looked into space,
for Captain Revel had disappeared. His foot slipped upon
the smooth grass as he recoiled before the threatening ges-
tures of his companion; he reeled and staggered; he fell
head foremost on the slope ; he caught with both hands at
the short turf, but the roots came away from the rocky soil
in his grasp; and, without a cry or a sound, he rolled over the
edge of the cliff, and was gone.
When the fit left Chauncey Chacomb, he remembered, as in
down upon.

do you
a dream, the captain's last look of horror, and it remained with
him an accusing spirit till the day of his death.
It took him a few moments to realize what had happened.
When he did, his madness being still strong upon him, he
threw himself forward on the slope, at imminent risk of falling
over, and lay on hands and knees, with his head projected
over the edge. The cliff was about a hundred feet high, not
quite perpendicular. Just above the water was a narrow
ledge. On this ledge lay a helpless mass of clothes and
broken bones, which had a mjaute before been Captain Revel.
It still moved, so that he was not dead.
The wretched man cried and shouted, exulting like an
Israelite over the fall of his
enemy.
“Revel!”—the rocks rang out the name, and the echoes
took it up, and repeated it along the black line of curved and
indentedcliff—“ Revel-Revel-Revel-listen, before you
die. Gerald shall never marry Marion—do you hear? I will
lend no money to your spendthrift son-
hear ? Fred
and the girls shall starve-do you hear? I lend them money!
I will see them begging their bread in the streets first. Do
you hear? do you hear? do you hear? There you are, and
there
you
will die. Ho! ho! ho! There you will die !"
Did the broken and shattered form of the man below catch
the mockings of his enemy, as they rolled from point to point
round the coves and bays of the vexed shore? But the harsh
tones did not break upon the sleep of the innocent girl by
Comb Leigh Cove, to mar the beauty of her love dream.
The squire felt with thankfulness that he had recovered
his powers of speech, and was going on with greatly increased
freedom and liberty of utterance, but found he could not, being
suddenly and violently pulled backwards by the heels. It
was his cousin dragging him up, at the risk of his own life
and limbs—a more perilous feat than the rescue of a drown-
ing man; for Chauncey Chacomb kicked and writhed, shout-
ing curses and imprecations on Revel, on his cousin, and on
Marion. Doctor Joseph, however, went about his work with
great coolness, and, after five minutes' struggle, had his
cousin safely on the level sward, with one hand firmly in his
collar, coat and shirt and all.
“Let me go!” cried the maniac; “let me go! Let me see
him die! Joseph, it isn't half enough to kill him. I want
to taunt him. Let me go! Suppose he were to die before I
have told him all. Oh, what a chance to miss !"

“ Be quiet, madman, or I will squeeze the breath out of
your miserable little body. Be quiet, I say.”
The doctor shook him backwards and forwards till his
struggles ceased, and then turned him round, and looked
straight into his eyes.
“Let me go, Joe,” he whimpered; “let me go—please let
me go; and I will give you five hundred pounds. I want just
to have one more look—one more look. Ah, one more !"
Here his voice died away in broken murmurs; and he fell
to shaking like one who has an ague. For he could not choose
but look back into the doctor's eyes, which seemed searching
into his very soul. He struggled to speak, but his tongue
refused to move; he tried to turn away his gaze, but he could
not: the mesmeric influence of the stronger will was upon the
weaker. His mania passed away from him, his arms dropped,
his lips closed. The doctor, still holding him by one hand,
made a pass or two with the other, and then laid him gently
on the inner slope of the sward, his face turned inland.
“So,” he said ; “here is a devil of a business! What is to
be done next ?”
What, indeed! He left his patient safe for a while in his
mesmeric sleep, and crept warily down the slope. Where it
shelved most steeply, close to the edge, he laid himself along
the ground, and digging knees, toes, and elbows in the turf,
he looked over.
It was a fearful place; the cliff was inclined
at a slight angle to the vertical, was stuck with small ledges
and projections, on which the man had broken his fall, and
80 prolonged his pains. He lay on the lowest ledge, but now
seemed motionless and dead. The doctor noticed that the
projection ran along the base of the cliff, and apparently
round the corner, and into a cleft in the wall, where Nature
seemed to have designed a cove, but changed her mind owing
to the difficulties of the undertaking.
“I might get down there,” said the doctor; " at any rate,
I can try.”
He scrambled back, and looked again at his cousin.
“ Sleep on, you miserable little madman,” he said. “A
pretty morning's work you've done. Sleep, you-you-you
microcephalous imbecile, till I come back and kick you up
Chauncey Chacomb made no answer. His eyes were closed,
and he was sleeping.
"Had I known anything of the medical profession,” the
doctor murmured, “I should have locked you up last night

But here,
A strait-waistcoat and a little gruel, and myself for your
private physician and adviser. What a chance—what a
chance to miss ! Everything," he added with a sigh, and
hurrying along the cliff to the gap—“everything is in the
hands of the man who has taught himself his profession.
Joseph Chacomb, you were a fool, a very great fool, not to read
in the days of your youth. I wonder if I can get down there?"
It was his only chance, for all along the road beyond the
waves washed the bare faces of the vertical cliff.
where the ledge seemed to be carried round the curve of the
rock, there was a deep indentation, as if a large knife had
begun to cut a triangular stile, but failing partly in the task,
had left a ragged mass at the bottom piled up by broken
rocks and overgrown with brambles.
It was possible to get down as far as this by an active
man; but beyond? Beyond it the waters ran into the gap,
and at its mouth the cliffs stood face to face to make a gate.
But the doctor thought it looked just possible to get round
by the boulders and rocks that lay about the entrance.
“I don't like it,” he said; “but I will try. I think
Chauncey will do for half an hour."
He talked to himself, as was his wont, in cheerful tones ;
but his face was pale and his hand shook as he thought of
the murdered man.
“ Murdered,” he said, half aloud; “murdered, if ever man
was murdered !"
There was a kind of landslip at the end of the gap,
down
which he lowered himself step by step, holding by bramble
and briar, clinging to projecting rocks, which gave way
beneath his weight, creeping warily along the edge of pre-
cipices—not Alpine, certainly, but high enough to kill him
if he fell—and dropping down smooth faces from ledge to
ledge. But at last he stood above the water, where a single
stone gave him a slippery foothold. He looked round him,
and groaned.
“Chauncey, if I get safe out of this, I will make you pay
for it."
It was a black and savage-looking place, in which the
waves, though it was a comparatively smooth day outside,
Aung up jets and fountains of spray and foam, with loud
whistlings and roarings, which sometimes frightened belated
market women coming along the down after dark, when the
weather was stormy and the wind high.

He looked round him, and saw at the back the cave, dark
and yawning. He shuddered.
“I suppose the king of the octopods holds his throne
there. I hope his majesty is asleep. It would be a sweet
thing to see his long claws coming out of the cave, and feel
them catching me round the neck, and I without so much as
a penknife-even a toothpick might be useful."
He clambered, clung, and crept along the black and sloping
sides of the infernal hole, towards the opening. There he
found his further progress stopped by a rough, serrated rock,
standing like a sentinel to bar his way. He whistled in
despair. The big, dark rock barred his progress, and he felt
as if he could neither get forward nor back. Then he sat
down, his feet dangling over the water, and began to reflect,
looking at the boulder.
“I can't get over you,” he murmured, "you big, black
devil; but I might get round you. Suppose I was to fall in
and be drowned, like a rat in a trap, as I believe I shall !
It would serve me right, for getting down here at all. I
should be found in a few years, perhaps, all that would be
left of me -a button or two, a purse with some money, a
silver watch: that would be the final edition of the works of
this Josephus. Suppose, which is equally probable, that I
have to wait here and starve slowly till the octopus in the
cave thinks he is strong enough to throw off the mask and
attack me.
Chauncey, if ever I do get back, it shall be bad
for you. No!” as he made another effort to get over the
rock which barred him from further advance. He looked
down into the dark depths beneath him. “ That won't do.
Pah! The crabs are mustering in all their force, and sending
invitations to their relations. I can see them at the bottom,
I believe. The lobsters will hear of it, and come without
being invited. There are yellow starfish lying on the stones

selves, from a stall, with pepper and vinegar, in Whitechapel.
If I fall in, they will say that I went a-shrimping. Come,
Joseph Chacomb, pull yourself together-pluck up.
He laid himself flat upon the rough and sloping surface
holding on by one foot and both hands, while he threw his
leg round till he met with a projection. Bit by bit he
struggled on, panting and wheezing, for the doctor was not
me.

80 young as he had been, till he found himself round the
point, and with both feet on the narrow and broken ledge on
which the captain lay. He made his way cautiously along,
and in five minutes was kneeling beside the form which lay
apparently inanimate
upon
the rock.
"Poor beggar! poor beggar!" murmured the doctor ; "and
to think that he might have been alive and well still if
Chauncey had not been an Ass !"
He felt the pulse—the left arm was crushed and broken,
lying under the body, but the right appeared to be com-
paratively uninjured. There was a faint motion-it takes a
good deal to beat the life out of a man. The doctor dipped
his hat in the sea, and, raising the head, poured the water
over it. The captain's face was pale and white; from his
mouth oozed the blood drop by drop.
"Revel,” whispered the doctor, “Revel, can you speak ?"
There was no answer; nothing to show that he heard, or
comprehended, or lived-only the dull, slow beating of the
pulse at the doctor's finger.
Oh, that I were on the cliff now !” said Joseph.
“ What
would I give for a boat? And how the deuce am I to get
him, or myself either, out of this ?”
He resolved to try the next point; and stepping lightly
over the prostrate form, to which he could do nothing, he
crept along the ledge in the same direction, and disappeared
behind the next point.
It was half an hour later when he returned in Revel's own
boat, rowed by a couple of farm boys. In the boat sat
Marion. As the doctor-rough, coarse in grain, selfish, and
cynical— looked at the face of the girl, so suddenly stricken
that there was no time for weeping, no room for despair, tho
unaccustomed tears rolled down his cheeks.
They brought It, the poor crushed form, covered with a
sheet, home to Comb Leigh in the boat. As they lifted the
body, the doctor saw Chauncey Chacomb standing near. By
his trembling limbs, by the wan light in his eyes, by his
moaning and crying, he saw that the madman only partly
understood what had happened, and how. As they bore the
captain to the cottage, Chauncey followed with staggering
step. His confused brain knew, in a bewildered sort of way,
that he had somehow caused the thing to happen. He could
not remember yet; but he was filled with a dreadful terror.
He dimly perceived that there would be no rest or happiness

79
for him any more: the seal of Cain, the murderer, was on
his brow. But his victim's pulse yet beat, though feebly.
For three long hours they waited round the bedside. Marion
at his head, dry-eyed; Adie, weeping and sobbing, at the
foot of the bed; Chauncey standing helpless and silent, turning
his bewildered eyes from one to the other. The sun shone
in at the window, where the captain's roses climbed about,
throwing their branches across the light, and making fantastic
patterns in the shifting shadows of the floor.
Suddenly the watchers saw a change. There was a slight
quivering of the limbs, and the captain opened his eyes for a
moment.
“He is coming to his senses," the doctor whispered. “He
hears, my girl; be brave."
“Father," she whispered, “ do you know me?”
As she touched his poor pale lips with hers, he opened his
dyes again, and looked at her in a strange, wondering way,
with a tender pity in them. His thoughts were all with her-
Marion saw it with a wild tumult of misery and happiness-
all with her.
Then his lips parted, and she went closer.
“Marion,” he whispered, “my poor, poor Marion !—I see
it all! It was not my fault. Endure to the end, my darling
---and always trust in God. My dear!—my dear!-my dear!
His eyes both dropped as in very weariness; and presently
the doctor, laying his hand upon the captain's heart, found
that he had fallen into the sleep from which there is no
earthly waking.
CHAPTER X.
A WEEK has passed; the coroner has come to Comb Leigh
upon his errand, and by the help of a dozen farmers the
inquest has been held. The conduct and appearance of Mr.
Chauncey Chacomb, the principal witness, were remarkable:
the reporter said that his over mastering grief did equal credit
to his heart and to his head. In incoherent accents, and with
hesitating tongue, he set forth what was well known to every.
body present-how the deceased gentleman and himself had
been almost daily companions for many years, and how,
while they were talking together on the cliff, the captain's
foot slipped, and he fell. Being asked by an intelligent jury-

man if he knew of any cause-orange peel now, a thing he
had heard was fatal to many a man-why the captain should
have slipped, he stated, after the coroner had called attention
to the fact that orange peel would be a comparatively rare
thing to find in August at the top of the cliff, that he knew
of no cause or reason whatever. Being asked by another
intelligent juryman if the captain was possibly unwell that
morning-bile now, a thing often felt by himself, the ques-
tioner, after a market dinner—Mr. Chacomb said that Captain
Revel had made no complaint as to biliousness. Being asked
if the spot was considered dangerous, Mr Chacomb said that,
on the contrary, he had understood it to be a favourite spot
for lovers to sit and watch the view, and that he had never
heard of any one under those circumstances falling over.
Another juryman interposed with the remark that it was very
true, and he had sat there himself in younger days; whereat
everybody laughed. From time to time Chauncey Chacomb,
while giving his evidence, looked nervously at his cousin,
who sat with his head down, but made no sign. The doctor's
testimony was given with greater vigour, and bore internal
evidence of careful preparation. It made, as he intended, a
profound impression. He had heard, he explained, his cousin
Mr. Chauncey Chacomb's cry for help, and on lastening to
the place, and looking over the edge of the cliff, saw the
deceased gentleman lying on the rocks below. He had then
made his way to the spot by a breakneck path, which he
described at length with pardonable aggravation of the
difficulties, and had finally succeeded in getting round the
point and hailing the boat. The jury were unanimous in
expressing their highest admiration of Dr. Chacomb's heroism
in attempting a rescue. They were also unanimous in con-
curring that Parliament should be petitioned to put handrails
round all cliffs, and provide rope ladders in case of any one
falling over. And then they brought in their verdict of
“ Accidental death.” What other verdict was possible ? Evil
looks do not murder; and who was there except the doctor
to say that the man slipped and fell, overcome with confusion
at the threatening looks and gestures of his companion ?
As for Fred, for whom Gerald had gone in search, he came
home in time to attend the funeral. Not waiting for the
paternal permission to go to Egypt, he had started at once,
on getting the ten pounds from Marion, with a sanguine
confidence that more would follow, and yet with some fore-

bodings how his father might take it. At Paris he saw the
news in Galignani, and hastened back. He bore himself
steadily at the funeral, and the village folk congratulated
each other that the captain's boy was so brave and fine a
young fellow, and so admirably qualified to help his sisters.
Marion called upon him, indeed, at once for help, endeavour-
ing to face the realities of the future. But in vain. Her
brother would not look at the facts as they were. He put it
off; he fenced with the necessity; he refused to read through
the
papers ;
he declined to let her know his liabilities. And
yet he looked forward with a confident cheerfulness to a
wonderful future; for with men of Fred's character it is the
leading trait that they never can face anything real.
“You see, dear Fred, we must consider things; we have
very little money-only the insurance; and we must consider
what is to be done."
“I think, Marion" — with a yawn-
.6 that it shows
singularly little regard for my poor father's memory to begin
this kind of talk the very first day after he is buried. And
as for the future, I see no cause for any anxiety at all. I have
already told you that Lord Rodney-
« The firework man.
Oh, Fred!"
“ Has promised to get me something good. What will it
matter, then, that my father has left us no money? I hope,
Marion, you will remember that, as the head of the family, I
shall always feel it my duty to provide for you and Adie."
Marion repressed her rising irritation.
“Yes, Fred, it is very good of you to say so, and to think
80; but Lord Rodney is in Egypt; we do not know when he
will come back; and it will not do to trust to vague hopes.
We have to pay off your debts first; and what are we to do
till your friend finds something that will suit you?"
“ Confound it, Marion, do not worry a man! If things
look bad, staring at them won't make them look
any
better.
Let us sit down and wait till they come round again. At all
events there is the insurance; and something will turn up.”
Always 'a belief that things, if left alone, would right
themselves; always that blind confidence which borders
dangerously near the Paradise of fools. It is with certain
natures infectious. Adie caught it of her brother. She, too,
protested against the folly of anxiety about the future; she,
too, found it a flying in the face of Providence to add up
bills
and think of ways and means; and, with Fred, would leave

Marion alone with her papers, to wander along the leafy
lanes, and to talk together of the merry days in store for
them, and the pleasant paths of careless folly. It might
seem safe to prophecy of Fred that there will be few more
pleasant lingerings in the sunshine for him; but prophecy-
since the school of the Prophets finally broke up and dissolved
when Malachi left it-has been an eminently unsafe thing.
Some things we know, of course, from long experience. The
clever boy of the school becomes a pauper, after a thousand
failures ; the good boy gets hanged, after a long course of
hypocrisy. Any one can prophecy so far ; but what shall we
say
about the bad and lazy boy ? Observers have remarked
that though in after-life he continues to wallow in his laziness
and badness, like a pig of the flcck of Epicurus, he too
often gets a good income, a pleasant life, and easy times.
“ Women,” Dr. Chacomb once said to me, can always, un.
less they belong to the passive or stupid class, foretell the
future. Unfortunately their power is limited, and they are
all like Cassandra, inasmuch as they only see the bad things
that are coming." Still, that is better than nothing, especially
when you get predictions about your enemies' coming misfor-
tunes. Why is it that one-half-the greater half-of man-
kind have been excluded from the Jewish Prophets? Had
it been otherwise, what a screaming sisterhood should we
have had! Fancy a dozen Deborahs pouring out the heart's
fulness of invective, exultation, and denunciation! Fancy
the lost splendours, the tragic predictions, of a wronged and
angry Hebrew woman!
Marion, left alone, went carefully through her father's
papers. The letters she put aside to be burned; the accounts,
and all that seemed to refer to money, she kept. And so one
morning, a few days after the funeral, she came across a
secret that sent the blood from her cheek.
A dreadful secret; a shameful secret; a secret that touched
the happiness and the self-respect of those dearest to her; a
secret that told her why, in the prime of early manhood, her
father, an ambitious and active man, could
gn his hopes
for the future, and take refuge in a country village, where he
was unknown, and the thing could not follow him.
“My poor dear father !” she murmured. “He suffered
this through all these years, and made no sign. What shall
· do, what shall I do to keep it secret? I may at least tell
Gerald.”


## p. 83 (#89) ##############################################

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
But where was Gerald ? He had disappeared. No letter
came from him, and he made no sign. It was strange. At
Chacomb Hall the two men thought nothing of it; Gerald
was not in either's thoughts. At the Rosery there was one
at least who looked and waited all the day, who watched and
waited all the night. But no news could come; for Gerald,
fresh from Brazilian lowlands, was working off a fever-one
of half a dozen left in his system as a parting gift of the
Oroonoco swamps—in a hot' I at Boulogne, unable to write,
and frətting over the delay that kept him from Marion.
It was at this juncture that Joseph Chacomb, quite unex.
pectedly and to his own astonishment, developed an entirely
new side of character. He appeared as the man of sympathy.
During the bad days before the funeral he would walk over
every morning, and do what work there was to do. When
that business was finished, he still came in readiness to work
at Marion's request. She ended by liking him and looking
for him. He was rough, and he took dreadful views of human
nature. Still he was kind. He went through the papers with
her–Fred's papers of debts-noting things that might be
reduced; while the culprit himself was lying on the grass in
the shade, or singing duets with Adie.
• Well, there are all the bills before us. Of course," he
said, we are not going to pay half of them.”
“But we must; Fred owes them."
“I know. We need not pay one single farthing, I believe.
They are debts contracted in his minority. Fred is not yet
twenty-one. Besides, they are all extravagant debts. You
cannot make a minor pay for things manifestly unnecessary.
Look here: an Oxford hack, no doubt a broken-winded,
spavined, knock-kneed roarer, at two pounds a day; the
tennis court at three and sixpence an hour, with a few
pounds added in for beer. Where is their licence, Miss
Revel? answer me that—where is their licence ? And what
is this? Rabbit coursing in a dog-fancier's back yard.
Could any British jury pass that account-even a jury of
5'nall tradesmen ? Why, the thing is illegal. Come, Miss
Marion, if you pay this bill, I will borrow a guinea of you,
give it to the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to
Animals, and make them prosecute the rascal, with your
brother for principal witness. As for these bills---champagne
at a hundred and twenty shillings, claret at ninety, port at
eigbty-five--you will just leave me to do what I can for you."

..
"It is very kind," said Marion; "that is, if it is just."
“Of course it is just. There is one thing I should like to
understand: why the young fellows at Oxford, who belong to
exactly the same class as the young fellows at the hospitals,
are so much better off in the way of tick. Show me, if you
please, the London wine
who will trust a medical
student with champagne, or even with the homely Bass. Lord,
what a delicious time I should have had, with an under-
graduate's credit at my back! Look here, again: a bill for
badger baiting. Now, you know, that is too barefaced.
Fancy having your badger baited on credit! Scoring up
chalks for worrying a varmint in a tub! He's a glutton for
enjoyment, Fred is.”
He bundled all the bills into his pocket.
" Leave it all to me. I will do just the reverse of the
unjust steward. I will sit down quickly and write off half:
the champagne shall stand at fifty, and that will leave a
handsome profit; the port at forty-eight, and that will be
dear at the price; and as for the badger baiter, he shall not
be paid at all. Miss Revel, the dishonesty of people is to the
Christian mind appalling; to the unchristian mind—that is,
to me-it shows how very, very few Christian minds there are."
“If they do not accept your offer ?” said Marion.
“Then I button up my pockets. Then I say to thens,
• Men and brethren, naked came ye into the world ; naked, so
far as I am concerned, shall ye continue to go through the
world. I beg your pardon, Miss Revel; I mean that they
may then proceed to whistle for their money.'
" But I could not bear to have Fred laden with debts, per-
haps worried and persecuted by lawyers' letters."
Could you not?” he replied, with a twinkle in his eyes.
"Fred would bear it with very great resignation, I am sure.”
Ah, yes, Fred has the sweetest of tempers," said Marion,
tenderly.
“Hum! I like tempers a little more snappish. Well,
Qever mind
your
brother for the present.
What can I do for
you personally, Miss Revel? Do you propose to remain in
this cottage ?"
“We are your cousin's tenants—Mr. Chacomb's tenants.
Did he ask you to put that question ?"
“ No, he did not. The fact is, Chauncey is knocked silly,
quite literally. I never knew a man such mournful company
as he is. Not that he was ever festive; but of late days—"

"You forget, Dr. Chacomb, that the last few days have not
been festive days to any of us.
“Pardon me I do not forget it. Well, Chauncey has
made no allusion whatever to the subject. The question was
dictated by my own curiosity-my impertinence, if you will."
“No, no; but I have hardly yet considered it at all. It is
so strange to me, looking forward to the future; and yet we
must. And Fred is no help to me as yet.”
“Then let me be a help.
“You are very kind, Dr. Chacomb. I cannot tell you
how
grateful I am to you. Please give me your advice about this
letter. My father had insured his life for two thousand
pounds. I noticed, the day before his death, that
very
letter
Tying on his table, and gave it to him. He put it in his
pocket, and it was found there afterwards. Will you read it ?"
It was an official letter on blue paper, reminding Captain
Revel that the days of grace for the payment of the premium
would expire on the 13th of August, when the policy, unless
the sum was paid, would become null and void.
“He died on the 12th," said Marion.
“ Yes.” The doctor looked grave. "I
suppose we cannot
put off the delay on the postman or anybody, can we? He
got it on the 11th, or perhaps a week before, and forgot to
open it. It looks bad, but it might perhaps be fought.”
“What do you mean, Dr. Chacomb ?”
“I mean, Miss Revel, that your father's insurance policy
is probably a piece of waste paper. You may light candles
with it."
“But, Dr. Chacomb, it cannot be. My father has been
insured for five and twenty years."
“It can be, because the company have made an iniquitous
rule, and because his premium was not paid at a certain date.
There is one chance, and only one. Considering the circum-
stances of the case, your father's long-standing policy, and
the rest, the directors may concede the point.”
“But, Dr. Chacomb, they must concede it. I suppose theo
directors are gentlemen.”
“We are all gentlemen in this world. It is a façon de
parler. The mistake is, to suppose that the fact of our being
gentlemen prevents us from doing dishonourable things,
especially when we are on Boards. There is the custom of
the trade, which enables a man to break the eighth command.
ment without a pang. There is the necessity of making

money, which really does blacken the moral eye; and when
one is on a committee, you see, the moral responsibility is
divided. Dirty things are done by directors, which not one
of them would do by himself. The railway directors over-
work their servants, and overrun their trains. The insurance
directors pass an unjust law about the premiums, and rob the
children of their inheritance."
I wish I understood,” said Marion.
“It is an easy thing," the doctor went on; "only the
actuaries are afraid to let people know how easy it is. Life
insurance is an admirable plan of making the long-lived
people pay for those who die first. Of course no one minds
living a little longer than his neighbours. So many people
are born, so many die, every year. It is all, or ought to
be, carefully calculated and made out; so that, you see,
anybody knows at any time what is his expectation of life.
Very well; when your father insured, five and twenty years
ago, he agreed to pay so much a year, so that if he lived long
enough he would pay for those who died young; and if not,
that he would be paid for by those who lived longer. He
was to go on paying all his life, and at a certain day; that
was in the bargain.'
“Then all my father's money is lost ?" said Marion.
“But there is something else. It happens that at any time
a policy bas a surrender value, which is the greater the longer
it has run on.
In other words, the insurance company will
always pay you a certain sum—w
-which ht not to be an
arbitrary sum at all, but a properly advertised one--for giving
up the policy. Understand me: your father's policy a month
ago, after twenty-five years' premium, was worth a large sum
- nothing like his insurance, but still a large sum. Now
listen : the insurance companies have robbed us for generations,
and are robbing us still. As I have no shares in any of
them, I have no interest in hiding the fact. They rob us
in the surrender value, which they understate; and they rob
is far more when, as in your own case, a premium is not paid,
and they put into their pockets the whole of its surrender
value."
“ Is there no help ?” asked Marion.
“ Perhaps; we will try.”
He wrote the next day, explaining the circumstance. He
first asked for the insurance in full. The secretary reminded
him that the policy had lapsed. Then the doctor referred

the case to the board, which confirmed the secretary. Then
the doctor wrote a long and careful letter, setting forth his
revolutionary views as to surrender value. The answer to
this was referred to the actuary, who, not having time to
write an essay on the subject of life assurance, referred the
doctor to the two great standard works on insurance, and
begged him to correct his views. The doctor, who enjoyed
the correspondence amazingly, thereupon prepared the Pro-
spectus of a Company which propounded an entirely new
system of insurance. No one took any notice of his pamphlet,
which fell flat upon the market; and Dr. Chacomb, having
some other work to do, allowed the matter to drop. The
following is an extract from the prospectus.
“EVERY man shall insure for himself, and not for his
neighbour, and he shall insure for the expectation of his
own life.
man pay one pound at the age of thirty, his expecta-
tion of life being then about thirty-three years, he shall
receive a policy, not to be forfeited, for the sum of one pound
at compound interest for thirty-three years. In other words,
he can leave his heirs the sum of nearly three pounds.
“The new insurance company is thus a savings bank, in
which nothing but deposit accounts are kept, and from which
no money can be taken.
“A man can use his own discretion, by insuring when he
pleases, and for what he pleases.
“If a man, for instance, marries at twenty-four, he will be
able to insure for a thousand pounds by paying a sum down
of not much more than a quarter.
“It is a system which will require very little expense of
management.
“The new company will take ten per cent. out of profits,
but not more, and will be paid off, after which the rate of
interest on insurance will be lowered.
“ The new company will engage the services of Joseph
Chacomb, Esq., M.D., as secretary and manager, at a salary
of one thousand pounds per annum, guaranteed for five years,
in consideration of the idea. Dr. Chacomb will also be the
consulting physician.”
It was a beautiful prospectus, and I have always thought
it contained the germs of a just and prudent idea. But then
I am not an actuary. As regards the letters, they gradually

ceased, and the usual result happened—that the company
won. But let us return to the present.
Marion laid before her only adviser a paper on which she
had put down the family resources as clearly as she bad
calculated them. The list began with the insurance, through
which the doctor ran his
pen.
“ We will talk about that afterwards. Now let us see.
Deducting the arrangement I shall make with your brother's
creditors, there will remain in the bank a hundred and fifty
pounds; your own little fortune, settled on yourself, of fifty
pounds a year; and the furniture of the cottage. Is this
absolutely all ?"
“I am afraid it is all we have. Oh, Dr. Chacomb, do not
say that they will take away all our insurance money!”
“I can say nothing till I have heard from the office; but
let us talk as if they were going to be rogues—most men in
committee are, you know. And so, my dear young lady, on
that supposition, what do you propose to do with those
two children playing on the lawn ?”
They were literally playing on the lawn, and, with the
carelessness that belonged to their character, laughing and
singing while they played. Marion looked, and sighed.
“I have hardly begun to think about it. What can I do?
What are we all to do? And oh, Dr. Chacomb, where is
Gerald ? Why does he not come to us ?”
“We do not know. Surely, Miss Revel, if any one knew,
you would.”
It was an arrow shot at a venture.
“ Yes; but I have not heard from him since he went to
London. Where can he be? I am not able to think about
anything else till I have a letter from him."
“She is engaged to him, then,” thought the doctor, with
great satisfaction.
“Have you spoken to Mr. Chacomb yet P” he asked, aloud.
“ Not yet. Gerald was to have spoken. It was only the
day before

Chacomb does not like me. He never did. What will he say
when he hears of our engagement ?”
“What can he say, Miss Revel, except to welcome the
daughter of his friendf"

thought no one was looking, and was perhaps off his guard.
I think Gerald's father is somehow an unhappy man. He has
feelings that he hides; secret thoughts that he does not like
to show to the world. I have seen him look at my father-
his daily companion—with an expression that seemed full of
suspicion, hatred, and revenge. Then he would turn to me,
and it was with eyes of dislike. I used to laugh, thinking of
it afterwards. But I do not laugh now; for what may it
mean to me?"
“It means that the squire will be proud of his new daughter,
when Gerald takes
you home.”
Ah, when Gerald takes me home! When will that be?
Where is he now ?”
" At all events, Miss Revel, Gerald is not a man to trouble
himself much about what his father thinks. At least, I should
mot if I were Gerald.”
This was a speech to which there could be no reply.
Dr. Chacomb arranged with her about his visit to Oxford,
gave her the name of a solicitor under whose care she was to
place the slender family fortunes, and left her for the time.
On the lawn Fred and Adie were lightening the load of anxiety
with an extemporized Badminton, though that pastime was
not yet known to the world.
“ Battledore and shuttlecock is a very healthy exercise,
Fred Revel,” said the adviser—"capital for children, I believe.
Can you walk a little way with me ?”
“With pleasure."
The young man's face did not manifest any lively emotion
of joy, but he desisted from his game, tossed the toys to Adie,
and lounged into the road after the doctor, yawning heavily.
"You find Comb Leigh dull after Oxford ?”
"Dull !” said Fred. “It's dead and buried, put away and
forgotten. However, under the sad circumstances, I must
stay here to advise the girls, and arrange the future for them,
dull though it is."
“Of course,” said the doctor, with a smile of cynical delight,
" they naturally look to you, as the head of the family, for
support and guidance. What would Marion do with the
accounts without
you
?"
Fred reddened a little.
“I wish I could support them," he said, honestly. "I
sincerely wish I saw my way. Can you give me any advice,
Dr. Chacomb ?”

“ Let us sit down,” said the doctor. “ The road is dusty
at this season, and steep at all seasons.
As the poet
says :-
• These confounded long hills and rough, uneven ways
Draw out our miles and make them wearisome.'
I will light a cigar, if you do not object.”
He lit one-it was one of Gerald's, the doctor having been
so fortunate as to secure the whole box in the absence of its
owner-but neglected to offer one to Fred.
I like being in the country,” he said, stretching his legs
in the shade of the bazel shrubs, and sitting on the grass by
the roadside, “ if it is only for the comfort of a cigar in the
open. Comb Leigh is a delicious spot for a meditative weed.
Now, my young friend, you want my advice. Good; I am
forty-five, and you are twenty. I have the advantage over
you of a quarter of a century. I wish it was the other way
ahout, because I would a great deal rather be twenty than
forty-five. But, as Horace says-
. The fleeting years go by, my friends,
Time borrows what he never lends ;
Youth does not save, but always spends,
Drinks all the wine that Heaven sends,
And burns his candles at both ends.'
And so on.
You are fresher from college than myself, and
may go on with the quotation.”
· Tell me what you would advise me to take up as a pro-
fession ?"
“ That is the most difficult thing of all to do. Let us see.
Can you keep accounts ?”
No; I never could add up, except the points at whist.”
Do
you write a good hand ?”

“ You would not be likely to pass any competitive exami-
nation, I suppose ?”
Oh, no! That is why I am afraid-only I don't like to
tell Marion so—that Lord Rodney's influence will not be of
much use to me.”
Ah, some young fellows, without any turn for books, pick
up a pretty fair living as parsons. Just now it pays better
than it used to.
Would you— ?
No ? Very well, then. I

pretty well at the medical line, without injuring the delicate
structure of the cerebellum over the preliminary studies.”
“Nothing could make me read anatomy."
“Then we must leave the beaten paths, and try the unre-
cognized professious. My artless young friend, there are
many pleasures in belonging to an unrecognized profession.
You hold an uncertain social status which has its charms
you are a kind of Bohemian, which relieves you of many
moral duties; you año not expected to exhibit any more vir-
tues than you like; you find the way open for association,
particularly of a convivial nature, with crowds of good fellows,
impecunious like yourself; you are always devising new com-
binations for making money, which sharpens your wits till
they grow as keen as a razor; and the profits, my young
friend, the profits, if you do make a coup, are sometimes very
handsome.”
The doctor spoke with the enthusiasm of experience.
“But what are these professions ?”
Their is legion. I call myself a doctor; but I
belong in reality, for my practice is but small, to the tribe of
adventurers. Doing things on commission is the first method
that occurs to me. You may sell anything on commission,
but some things are not pleasant. I knew a man once, for-
merly in the Carabineers, who took to selling antibilious pills ;
they gave him a very handsome per centage indeed, but
twelve months of the work aged him more than five and
twenty previous years of hard drinking. Some men recom-
mend shops to their friends, and get a commission from the
shopkeeper-members of club committees do it, I believe, and
it seems an easy way of making money; but it does not last.
You can't be always recommending people to go to different
places to buy things; and then the shop people cheat you
shamefully in your commissions. They have no sense of
honour, that class. A friend of mine in this walk of life was
once very cruelly treated by a cigar dealer, after introducing
a young millionaire who actually smoked himself to death off
his shilling Havanas. Coals are not bad, though they have
a bad name. But then, you see, so many people go into
coals. You want nothing but an office, and you are not
obliged to buy a single ton. You get up the patter, and then
you are a dummy, and all your orders go to the real people,
who pay you ten per cent. Agencies are good, provided you
can hit op one not yet driven to death; but, Lord, the rapa-

city of people is dreadful to think of! A gentleman adven-
turer in these days has to fight very hard, whatever line he
takes up. Literature, I suppose, you would have no taste for,
though some literary friends of mine have managed to get
along without reading anything except old magazines and
the Annual Register. How should you like to be an adver-
tising agent? It is a business which depends entirely upon
personal appearance
and manners.
You would have a very
good chance-a very good chance indeed.”
“I don't like any of your professions," said Fred. “It
does not seem to me that a gentleman would take up a single
one of those lines."
“A gentleman!" said the doctor, inapatiently. “I should
like to write an essay, if I were an author-they are a scaly
lot, and thank Heaven I am not one on the word. For.
merly it meant everybody who wore the king's uniform ; now
it means everybody who does not. Young man, put your
gentility in your pocket till you can afford to take it out
again. A gentleman out at elbows, and pretending to be a
gentleman still, is a sorry spectacle. Let us see if we can
find anything else for you. Remember, however, that we
cannot escape certain laws. If we have no money, we must
work or starve. _Obviously, the thing is to get the lightest
work possible. You have been trained to nothing; you have
to find some work that you can do; you have, in short, to prove
yourself capable of inventing your own path in the world.”
“It would not be quite the thing, would it, for the repre-
sentative of a great French name to be selling coals on com-
mission ?" Fred asked, with his sweetest smile, and as if
the question was a clincher.
“Representative-nonsense! Will your countship fill
your pockets ? Will it keep you and your sisters? Will it
give you decent clothes? If not, forget it as fast as you can.
I've known a good many loose fish in the world; the worst I
ever knew was an Honourable without a farthing, who found
it impossible to forget his birth. Look you, Mr. Frederick
Revel, I like to call things by their right names. You have
already wasted and squandered the whole of the little
patrimony saved for yourself and your sisters by your father;
and you have got nothing to show for it. You have been sent
to expensive schools, and only learned the art of getting tick.
You are twenty years of age, and you have your living to
get. What will you do ?”

worn-out rubbish ?”
Fred was silent.
“You must, if you work at all, begin with the humblest
kind of work-farm work even-or you must take up
with
some such line as I have shown you. Of course you may, if
you please, live upon the very small fortune and the exertions
of

sister.”

you have rendered us. Your advice is insulting and ungen.
tlemanly. I shall not live upon my sister's exertions, nor
shall I become a tout and a cad. You will please to give me
no more advice.”
He turned on his heel, and left the doctor.
“I know the breed,” said Joseph, watching the young
man as he hurried down the lane with impatient gestures
“I know the breed well. They kick and fume when they
hear the truth. They are full of noble sentiments; they are
your lip gentlemen. I know the receding chin, the shifty
lips which curve into what novelists call a sweet smile; and
I know the bright eye, with what the same gentry call a
hundred laughs lying in it, which looks as if there was
nothing but sincerity and unselfishness behind. I suppose
the lad got it from his mother. Wonder who his mother
was?
The dancing eye,' as they call it, means a callous
heart. I never knew a fellow with it yet who would budge
a step to oblige anybody. That is an aphorism presented by
Joseph Chacomb, Esq., M.D., to literature generally. The
lancing eye means the callous heart. It's very neat. Give

if he had had the Chacomb rents instead of the little Asp
up yonder. Forty-five last month, and nothing done yet--
no money in the Funds, nothing to chuck away in foreign
mines, and nothing in the Bank. As for his moral character,
Joe's best friends—that is, the men who know him best-
don't believe he has got any morals at all. Once Joe was a
mealy-faced boy, with a rosy cheek. Joe was one of the
little cherubim; sang anthems, Joe did, in a church choir,
with a white nightgown on, like a blessed angel. Life is
rum-very rum.
Joe would be uncomfortable now among
the blessed angels. He wouldn't know how to handle bis
harp; he's forgotten the treble of all the anthems, and can't
sing bass.
Joe makes schemes of plunder; Joe borrows
without intending to pay back; Joe wants to see Gerald marry
the Revel girl, and get cut off by his idiotic father. Joe is
no longer a cherub at all—unless he is one of those unlucky
cherubs who've tumbled down. After all”—he sat up and
stretched himself, with a yawn—"we are as things have
ypade us.
Joe isn't any worse than his neighbours. It is
eautiful weather, and this is a lovely cigar."

CHAPTER XI.
DURING these days Chauncey Chacomb kept entirely at
home, and refused to go outside the gates of the lodge. His
cousin, who watched him with an interest growing daily,
observed that a curious change was creeping over the squire's
expression. His very features seemed changed. There had
been formerly a look of cunning and suspicion latent in the
man's face, which always made themselves felt in the sharp,
quick upward glances of his small keen eyes.
That was
gone. His occasional wild glances, apparently uncontrollable,
which first roused the doctor's suspicions, disappeared as
well. There were no more bursts of a jealous rage, perhaps
because the object of the rage was dead; but in place of all
these there was left a settled gloom, a sadness which never
varied. The spare form was shrunken. Chauncey Chacomb
had become smaller; his head was lower between his shoul.
ders; he stooped as he walked; he noticed nothing. If his
cousin plied him with wine at dinner, he drank it, and re-
mained as dismal as if it had been cold tea. He made no
reference to the absence of his son, paid no attention to

95
external matters, and made no sign of interest in anything,
except that he heard the name of Revel with a visible shrink-
ing and horror. The worst sign was that he neglected the
Collection; he forgot to correct the Catalogue; he locked up
his drawers, and left the keys on his dressing-table; and he
spent the day in wandering aimlessly about from room to room.
“Go," said Joseph Chacomb one morning, pushing him into
the Collection room go and potter about as you used to;
that will do you good.”
Chauncey made no resistance; but when, an hour later,
the doctor opened the door, he found him sitting in a straight-
backed chair, in the middle of the room, his thoughts far
away from any of his curiosities.
Then he watched his cousin more closely. He observed
that every day after breakfast Chauncey manifested a keen
desire to be left alone. One morning he pretended to go out,
but returned after the space of five minutes. He found that
Chauncey had crept away to Gerald's rooms, which were, as
has been stated, in the western gable, the old part of the
house. Hither, when Chauncey began to make his Collec-
tion, had been transported gradually the old shelves of books
which once formed the library. They were ranged in rows
in Gerald's study, Gerald's bed-room, and the room which
Gerald used for his workshop: an old and curious library, con-
sisting almost entirely of French eighteenth century books, those
works of learning in which the French of that time excelled.
People got together materials in the sixteenth century; they
learned in the seventeenth; they boiled down, digested,
annotated, and correlated in the eighteenth. Every kind of
subject was treated of in this cyclopædic collection, which was
especially rich in books on medicine. The doctor, stepping
silently over the carpets in the direction pointed out by the
footman, passed through the open doors, and found Chauncey
in Gerald’s bed-room. He was not sighing over the vacant
place of his son; he was not shedding a tear over the por-
trait of his son's mother, which hung upon the wall; he was
not thinking of son or mother either, because he was thinking
of himself. He was standing at the shelves, with a book in
his hands, swiftly devouring the contents. Dr. Chacomb
marked the eager and concentrated gaze of his eyes, as he
read page after page, turning over swiftly, as if he sought
for something that concerned himself. Presently he put
back the book with a heavy sigh, and sat down. The doctor

marked the volume—it was an old calf-bound octavo, whose
gilt lettering was faded so that he could not read the game,
but he saw its place among the rest. Then, having made
his observation, he slipped away, and presently his cousin
cam out, with a dejected air, and crept like some scared and
sick animal into the shade of the trees of his park. Then the
doctor sought the place, and took down the volume. It was
a French treatise on hallucinations and diseases of the brain.
“I thought so," said the doctor. “The pour little beggar
has quite gone out of his wits. We may as well see what he
has been reading, anyhow.”
He carried the book away with him, and read in it that
night before going to bed. There was a strange and dreadful
fascination about the pages.
They fixed the eyes on the
letters, while the vivid images of haunting heads seemed to
crowd round the reader, to float around his brain, and to
whisper in his ears. The doctor threw it away at last, with a
shudder. Before getting into bed he opened the window and
looked out. On the lawn, a silver sheet lit by the splendid
harvest moon, was walking backwards and forwards his
cousin Chauncey, swinging his arms, tossing them over his
head, rolling about as if he were drunk. He looked at his
watch. It was two o'clock.
“I wonder if he has been carrying on this game every
night,” he murmured. Upon my word, I don't like it.
Why, hang it, he might come in and murder a man while he
was asleep.'
He hastened to lock and bolt the door, and then, feeling a
little safer, he went to bed and to sleep.
Next day he tried to rouse his cousin. He made him go
with him for a walk, almost dragging him by the arm.
Chauncey," he said, “ you are getting worse company
than ever.
I wish I could only hear you swear a little. Try,
my dear fellow, just one small damn, to break the ice.”
Chauncey shook his head mournfully.
“I fear I shall never swear again, Joe,” he murmured.
“Never again."
“Don't say that, Chauncey," returned his cousin, really
affected at this dreary prospect ; "you are young yet, and
while there's life there's hope. Pull yourself together.'
But he would not be coaxed into cheerfulness.
Then the doctor tried bullying. It was after dinner. Now,
Joseph Chacomb, who was not at all times owing to pe-

cuniary conditions—accustomed to what the Americans call a
square meal, was making the most of his stay at Chacomb.
The dinner, when he was at the Hall, was like Mr. Cook's
tours-personally conducted. He ordered it and looked after
it himself, down to the potatoes, which he liked served as a
separate dish, to remind him of the merry days when he was
a student in the Quartier Latin; and to the beer, which he
drank from a tankard, to remind him of hospital days in
London-for the doctor liked to be sentimental over his
dinner. In the same spirit of poetical reminiscence, he chose
every day a bottle of Chauncey's best and oldest port, of
which he drank every drop, to remind him of the aspirations
which had once filled his brain. Naturally, after the port he
wanted conversation, and then found himself with a man who
neither spoke nor moved.
“I would rather sit with the Aldgate pump, Chauncey.
Hang me if the pump would not be a mor 3 lively companion.
At least it could wag a handle. What are you staring at?
Do shut your eyes, man; and if you must stare, look at me.
His cousin was sitting with his short legs tucked under his
his uneven shoulder was level with his right ear, and
his head bent down to meet it. The room was dark, save for
a pair of wax candles on the table; the windows were open,
for it was a sultry night, and thunder was in the air. Chauncey
Chacomb was staring straight before him, into the darkest
part of the room, with a steadfast gaze.
“Don't glare in that way, Chauncey. It's simply disgusting
to a man who wants to be cheerful. Tell me, my dear fellow,
he continued, quite softly—“ tell me, if you can, what you see
every night. Tell me why you go out into the park when you
ought to be asleep.”
Always the same thing, Joseph-always the same thing.
I see Revel's eyes. There--there-there !" he shrieked, as a
gleam of summer lightning lit up the room for a moment.
“He is here himself. I saw his face as well as his eyes. And
yet he is dead. Joseph, help me! Oh, cousin Joseph, help
me! It is dreadful to see a dead man's face."
His voice dropped to a low wail. He sank his head into
his hands, and bowed himself upon the table, covering his
eyes and moaning.
The doctor shivered, and looked round him uneasily. The
dining-room was dark with crimson paper and heavy hangings.
“I hate a place where there is no gas,” he murmured.
chair;

“ And I hate a room like this, which nothing will light up
Here, Chauncey, old man, wake up! We will go into the
Irawing-room, and light all the lamps and candles. Come, I
will play you backgammon for sixpence a game, if you like."
This was genuine self-denial on the part of Joseph, because
he hated backgammon; and, like a great many poor men with
grand ideas of money, he despised sixpences. Chauncey got
up, and followed his cousin in silence. Presently, he recovered
so far as to take an interest in the game. He won three il
succession, and putting up the sixpences in his pocket, went
so far as to chuckle. But then he relapsed suddenly into his
former moody state, and sat intently watching nothing.
When the doctor had put him to bed, with a little dose of
morphia, he proceeded to consider the position.
“ Which,
,” he said, “I cannot say I like. It is not interest-
ing, and it does not promise to be profitable. I am wasting
my time here-time is valuable at five-and-forty-when I
ought to be back in town. Things will go wrong if I stay
idling here, and I do not understand what I shall gain by
waiting on. I believe Chauncey has gone mad; but I don't
see just yet how that will do any good to me. That Revel
girl runs in my head. I believe I shall end by seeing her
eyes just as Chauncey sees the captain's. Perhaps something
has happened to Gerald; but it is no use expecting that.
Let us see. Gerald comes back; Gerald marries the girl-as
if that ought not to be enough for any young fellow. His
father cuts him off—but his father is mad. Then who is to
prove it? Suppose I say he is sane. The worst of making
calculations about what is going to happen is, that what you
expect never does happen. The best scheme is disconcerted
by the one thing that is least likely. After all, the cleverest
man is the man who knows how to use things as they turn
up, and at once. It is no use making a book on the events.
I shall wait and see what turns up.”
The time wore on, with no news from Gerald.
“Let us wait still,” said the doctor.
But it was weary waiting for Marion. The past was gone
and win it all the promise of golden fruit. The future was
dark, the present was a blank.
One day-a fortnight after the death of her father-Marion
could bear the suspense no longer. At least she could seu
Mr. Chacomb, and tell him all.

It was in the morning_such a morning as that when she
sat in the garden and fell asleep, to be awakened by the
tramp of feet that brought back her dying father. The house
was quiet and lonely, for the other two had gone out together.
The sight of the flowers, the wind in the trees, the songs of
the birds, all fell upon her nerves like blows upon some heavy
instrument. She left the cottage, and turned into the lane
that led to Chacomb Hall.
She met no one on the road. Had she been in a mood to
mark them, the flowers of early autuinn were springing in the
hedges at her feet, and she would have rejoiced in the sounds
and sights of Nature which called to her unheard as with a
voice of sympathy;

was listening to the voices of her thoughts, which were sad
and heavy. In a fitful way, as people do when they are dis-
turbed by some great sorrow, she noticed. little things which
passed across her brain, assuming great importance for the
moment, and then vanishing. Behind those evanescent images
lay the shadow of her sorrow, and with it the heavy prescience
of more trouble. She recalled the words of her father, the
last time they were together; the last talk with her lover-
and where was Gerald? Dark and boding were the spectres
of her brain, like those of Sisera's mother when her son lay
murdered by the woman whom Deborah blessed above all
Why is his chariot long in coming ?” But she
could not return answer to herself even in words, “Has he
not sped ?” She came to the stone pillars and the iron gates
of Chacomb Hall, and looked up the long avenue of elms,
cool and shady, which led to the house. Then, after a
moment's hesitation, she left the road, and walked quickly
up the drive. On either hand lay Chacomb Park, with its
broad stretches of grass and clumps of trees. At the end of
the avenue she could see the western gable, with its warm
red brick, its pointed roof, and its latticed windows. These
were Gerald's rooms. Her pulse quickened when she saw
them. Perhaps-perhaps there might be news of Gerald.
Presently, in the shadiest and darkest part of the avenue,
where there lay on either side thick plantations, there came
across her path and stood in front of her—as Apollyon met
Christian—the man she partly hoped but greatly feared to
meet: Gerald's father. When he saw the girl coming, he
threw up both his arms, and cried aloud-
“Why do you come here? What have I to do with you?

Why do you come to me in your black dress? Do you accuse
me? Do you dare to say I did it ?”
“ Accuse
you, Mr. Chacomb?" she stammered.
“Then why are you here ?”
“I came to ask if
you
know-if
you
have heard anything
about Gerald.”
“Gerald-Gerald ?” he replied, impatiently. “What is all
his about Gerald ? He is away-he has been
away
for
four years. Stay; my memory is confused. Gerald came
back again. He was at home for four days, and now he has
gone. I forget things very strangely. Where has he gone to?”
“ You are not well, Mr. Chacomb ?”
“I am quite well. That is, Marion, I am not well, and the
doctor watches me about. I have dreadful dreams. Some.
times I think I did it."
“ Did what?”
He looked cunningly out of his small eyes.
“No-10; I am not going to tell you that. Let us talk
of something else."
As he spoke a change came over him, and he seemed to
become quite suddenly quiet, self-contained, and impenetrable.
“You came to ask after Gerald, Marion ?” he said. “Pardon
my brusqueness this morning. I was thinking of other things,
and am not quite well. Yes; it is a great anxiety to me that
I do not know anything about my son. He is, however, sure
to return soon. The sad news, when it reaches him, will
bring him home. He was always fond of your poor
father."
“I hope he will come back soon,” said Marion, sadly.
“Do you know that we are going away, Mr. Chacomb ?"
“ No. Are you going away? Actually going to leave the
cottage? Where shall I find another tenant? Going to-
where are you going to ?”
He spoke as if he was uncertain whether to be pleased or sorry.
“We are going to London. We have no money at all
The wicked insurance people refuse to pay my poor
father's policy. We are going to sell all that we can, and move
to where we can get employment of some kind—whatever
kind may suit us."
“Aye-aye,” he replied. “Well, Miss Revel, you have my
good wishes, my very good wishes. I should think that your
brother's talents would be quite certain, directly they find a
proper scope, a fitting channel, to put your sister and yourself
in affluence.

“ Poor Fred! I fear we cannot depend entirely upon him.
I shall try to get some work for myself.”
“Quite right; quite right. Many ladies get work for
themselves nowadays, I hear, and do not mind it very much."
“It is not a question of whether we mind it or not,” said
Marion;
we have to do it.”
“Dear me, dear me!-that is
very
sad.”
“I want to talk to you about Gerald, Mr. Chacomb," said
Marion, blushing:
“My son Gerald. Yes, yes-oh, certainly,” said the squire,
blandly.
“Tell me, Mr. Chacomb, did Gerald say anything to you
ever about me ?”
Mr. Chacomb shook his head, and looked surprised.
“ Did he tell you that—that we were engaged ?"
“He did not,” said Mr. Chacomb, with decision.
“I suppose he had no time. We were engaged, with my
father's consent,"
“Oh, with your father's consent! Your father agreed to
it, did he ?"
“ The day before--before the dreadful day my father went
out to talk it over with you. He met you on the hill; did he
say nothing-nothing at all to you?”
“How could he find time to say anything, Miss Revel ?”
“ Then I must tell you, for it is right that you should
know,” said the girl. « Gerald told me in the afternoon-
we were sitting on the very place where my father fell—that
he—he loved me; and I accepted him. In the evening we
told father.”
“ Gerald had a father too," said the squire.
“He promised to tell you about it. Why did he not ?"
“ Young lady,” said Mr. Chacomb, with dignity, and slowly,
had better take the very first train to London, you and
your brother and sister. It may save future unpleasantness.
As the engagement has only been entered upon for one day,
to speak correctly, I think we may consider at once that it

I wish you to know the truth. Understand, if you please,

bered in her father. He was staggered for a moment, but
presently went on again, with dignity-
“It would be best for all of you to go away at once,
before Gerald returns. I can explain to him my reasons, if I
choose to do so, for refusing my consent. It never could have
been given, remember. Gerald Chacomb is heir to the
Cbacomb estate; he must marry position and wealth. Besides
-but my reasons have nothing to do with you.”
Nothing,” said Marion, proudly. “ At least, I have told
you I am engaged to Gerald. What your reasons may effect
with him I do not know, and cannot tell. But I am engaged
to Gerald until he releases me. Now I understand-now I
understand.”
“What do you understand? What do you mean?”
She looked at him steadily, trying to put a sudden gleam
of conviction into her words.
“Now I understand the expression that I used to catch
sometimes in your eyes, when you looked at my poor father.
Mr. Chacomb, you hated him. I know it now.
rejoice at our misfortunes. You were with him at his death.
You have not told us yet why, when you two were together
on the cliff, my father, who had walked there a thousand
times, fell over, and only one was left. Why did my father fall?”
The words were spoken at random, but the man turned
pale and trembled. He answered nothing, but his lips moved.
Why did my father stop and fall ?” repeated the girl.
“I do not know," he stammered—“I do not know. How
can I tell? He slipped, he fell. You heard my evidence at
the inquest. Go and ask everybody if it is not true. How
dare you say such things? How dare you ask such questions?”
Why did you hate him, Mr. Chacomb?” she went on,
quickly. “Was it because he was kind, and you are cruel ;
because he was unselfish, and
you are selfish;
because he was
loved by everybody, and you-are not; because he was frank
and sweet-tempered, and you are jealous and suspicious ?
Were these your reasons, Mr. Chacomb,for hating a good man?"
She stopped for a moment, and continued, with a softer
voice-
“You are Gerald's father—that is why we tried to like you.
I see now that it was labour lost. When Gerald and I marry,
it will not be to come here. Your permission will not be asked.

until he releases me himself.”
The blood ran hotly to his cheeks, and he moved his hands
uneasily.
“ You shall never marry him-do you hear? You shall.
never marry him. I would rather that Gerald was lying dead
before me in the path. I would rather-rather-
She interrupted him fiercely-
· Rather

I fell from the cliff, Mr. Chacomb."
The words fell from her lips before she understood their
full meaning. They produced a strange effect upon him.
He shifted his feet, and turned his head about as a man
troubled with a sudden sharp spasm of pain. But he mas-
tered this, and drew himself upright, reaching to the shoulder
of the tall girl before him.
“Then,” he said, calmly, "if you will have the truth, hear
it. Marry my son if you like-marry Gerald if you can.
But if you do, you
will
marry the son of your father's mur-
derer, Yes,” he continued, as she recoiled with a cry-
“his murderer. I did it. I pushed him over the edge. I
always hated him, and I never, somehow, got a good, safe
opportunity till then of doing him a mischief. He drove me
mad, too, all the way up the hill, talking of you and Gerald,
and what fine things he was going to do when you were
married, with my money-my money. I had no knife, or
pistol, or anything to kill him with, or I should have done it
when I was walking behind him in the lane. He laughed at
me the day before about my pictures, too. It was not likely I
was going to forget that. So, when we came to the edge, I
pushed him over. He fell very quick, Marion, so that I had
only a short opportunity of seeing him roll over and over;
but I lay down when he was gone, and mocked him from the
edge. I think he heard what I said--at least, I hope so.
If I had you in the same place, Marion Revel, I would push
you over too. It is a nice wild spot for lovers to sit and talk,
is it not? and a nice wild spot for people to wreak their
revenge on their enemies. I cannot harm you here, because
I should be found out; and my constant principle is never to
be found out. For instance, I had thought of poisoning him
with a pill, but I kept putting it off because I was afraid.
I am glad now that I did not. That damned cousin of mine
finds out most things, and he is always watching and following
me about. He would have found out, very likely, if I had

used the pill. Well," he went on, with great steadiness,
“ you know the truth now. I do not suppose for a moment
that you will want to marry Gerald after what I have told
you. Take my advice, and go to London at once, to avoid
any more trouble. I am a dangerous man, and if you don't
accede to my wishes, I shall very likely do a mischief to your
brother Fred, or perhaps to your sister. Go at once, I
say,
and before a worse thing happens."
The girl, stunned by the cruelty and horror of the thing,
could make no answer. Mr. Chacomb's voice rose to a shriek
as he began his last sentence, but sank into a sort of moan
as he finished it; for he saw before him the doctor, walking
up the avenue.
He came straight to the squire, and took him by the arm.
“Better go in, Chauncey-goin, and wait for me. Go, I say!"
Then Mr. Chacomb turned quietly, and walked away.
“Has he been talking wildly, Miss Revel? I am sorry
you met him. Chauncey is a little—no, if you please, not a
little, but a good deal upset just at present. The suddennegs
of the calamity of last week affected his nerves, and he does
not know what he says. You see, he is quite amenable with
me: he knows his excitable nature, and obeys orders at
least."
“ Is it excitement? Is it madness ?"
“Who can say what is madness and what is not ?"
“I know he hated my father,” said Marion. " That must
have been madness. But now, I know more. Poor Gerald !".
she added, softly, “it is very hard on him; and now it must
all be over.”
“Why must it be all over ?"
6 I cannot tell you.
It is another secret that I must bear
in silence. Dr. Chacomb, belp me, in the name of Heaven,
to get away from this horrible place. The air stifles me. I
am always finding something new and dreadful. There is
murder in it, and madness, and horror. Oh, wbat shall I do
-what shall I do?"
“Tell me what Chauncey has been saying. Has he been
talking wildly ?"
“No; he has been talking sense. Ah, me! he has been
talking sense."
“ Then it is tha first time for a week and more. Miss
Marion, if you will tell me nothing, I can only obey your
orders. You shall go to-morrow, if you will. I will send

after
you the furniture that you will want in London. Per-
haps it will be best to get out of his way, and to go at once.
Now let me know how I may help you with Gerald."
She clasped her hands tightly, to keep down the tears that
rose to her eyes and the sobs to her throat.
“It is too much to bear,” she moaned—“it is too much.
What have I done, what has my poor father done, that he
should be punished like this? It is but a week ago-no, a
week ago we were in wretchedness-only a fortnight ago the
world was bright and happy. I had his love, my dear father's
love, and Gerald's too. But that was only for one day. I
had one day of the most perfect happiness that a girl can have
in this world. I had Gerald's hand in mine; his lips touched
mine ; I saw his eyes soften as they met mine -oh, what
happiness, what happiness! It all vanished in a moment.
And now his own father, my Gerald's father, sets between us
a barrier that can never be passed. I must give him up.'
“Let nothing that Chauncey Chacomb has said make you
give up Gerald,” said the doctor. “He is mad; how mad I
cannot say, but mad enough to make his words wild. Forget
what he has said.”
“I cannot forget what he has done. Oh, cruel, cruel !"
She sat upon a fallen trunk and sobbed. Joseph Chacomb
watched her with a pity which penetrated even the triple
folds of selfishness which wrapped his heart.
“I will go,” she said. “ Thank you for all your kindness
to me.
I cannot tell you how I thank you. We will go to
London to-morrow. Anything, anything to get away from
this dreadful place. I will write a letter to Gerald, and send
it to you for him. When he comes back you will give it him.
Promise me that, without my permission, you will not tell
him where we are.”
“It is odd,” thought the doctor, " that now, at this most
important juncture, when I ought to want her to marry
Gerald above all things, my own interests seem nowhere.
Can I be growing sympathetic-I, who have always been
preaching self-interest ? It is only a troubled girl, only a
woman breaking her heart, and I must needs help her because
she bids me.
“I promise,” he said. “You shall do with me as you please.
I will keep your address a secret till
you
bid me speak. But
think again. Do not set the words of a miserable creature
like Chauncey Chacomb against the happiness of your life.

Do not turn Gerald away because his father has said harsh
things. If Gerald were here himself to plead—”
“Ah!" she caught at the words with a gasp. “If Gerald
were here himself it would be harder to say, but sweeter to
remember. We should part in love, and I should have his
farewell. Now, oh, now what will he think of me—what will
he think of me? for I can tell him nothing."
“In God's name,” cried Joseph, moved out of himself,
“what has Chauncey said ? What mischief has he brewed in
your
mind ?”
She shook her head, and gave him her hand.
“Good-bye. I will write you a letter for Gerald to-night
-if I can, if I can.”
She left him, and sped swiftly down the avenue, with
bowed head.
Joseph Chacomb looked after her with something like
moisture in his eye. Then he blew his nose.
“I have not felt so,” le said,“ since I went to the Adelphi for
the first time, and saw Celeste play Janet Pride. I thought I
had mastered the weakness. What the deuce! It was not I

Chauncey cracked, even before this last business—I saw the
most beautiful, the most fortunate chance. Gerald, who is
as headstrong as a mule, was going to marry the girl, in
spite of his father; there was going to be a grand family
kick-up; the crooked little animal, with a brain as unsettled
as his body, was going to leave everything to me. I know
his life is a bad one, and this place, with its lovely incomo,
was going to be mine. It is too bad, upon my word! No
will would stand a contest with Chauncey as mad as a batter.
The servants will talk, if no one else does. It is a splendid
stake missed. And now we must confine ourselves to smaller
operations. At all events, let us borrow all we can.
The

may. Poor Marion ! the girl's eyes are enough to melt the

me.
Six days afterwards--the Revels gone-Gerald appeared,
worn and weak from his fever, and ignorant of what had
happened. Joseph Chacomb told him in a few words.
“Gone ? Marion gone ? And without waiting to see me?"
“She is gone. All the village children are crying after her
still; but she has left a letter for you.”
Gerald tore it open.
“ What is this?” he cried fiercely. “Do you know the
contents of this letter ?”
“ I know," said the doctor, “ that she asked me to give you
a letter containing her farewell to you, and that she made me
promise not to give you her address without her permission.
“It is your doing! I believe this is your doing!” the
young man burst out.
“ It is not,
returned the doctor. “I am innocent of any
knowledge even of Miss Revel's reason. She refused to tell
You may believe me, Gerald, when I assure you that I
wanted above all things to see you married, and to her.”
“Then who—do you know—for God's sake tell me some-
thing!—do you know anything, the smallest thing, that could
make her write this letter ? Read it, read it slowly, and try
to account for it.”
The doctor read as follows:-
· DEAR GERALD-A thing has happened which will pre-
vent our ever being to each other what we hoped to be.
Think kindly of me-indeed, it is not my fault! I pray you
earnestly not to try to see me. Forget me, and forget the
words we spoke to each other. That can never be thought
of now which you hoped for then, and I too—God knows.
You
may
believe that it is no light matter which forces me
to write this letter.
“ MARION.”
“What does it mean? I cannot understand it. I was
seized at Boulogne with a touch of my old marsh fever, and
have had a baddish fortnight. The moment I could travel I
returned, to find this letter, and the place deserted."
“Yes, and the captain in the churchyard."
“ Have you no clue? Man, you were here the whole time;
you must know something."
“Gerald, if you want to know why Marion wrote the letter,
you must ask your father. I do not know what he said to
her, nor why she wrote the letter.”
The conversation took place on the way from the Barn.

staple railway station, whither the doctor drove to meet
Gerald. Nothing more was said till they reached the Hall.
" Where is my father ?" the young man asked.
“With his Collection, I believe. Gerald, be patient with
he is excited and worn by the captain's sudden death."
Gerald pushed the doctor roughly back, and ran up the
steps. Joseph Chacomb heard him open and shut the door
of the museum, and groaned.
“Now all the fat is in the fire. Anyhow, it is only hasten-
ing the inevitable row. We shall have to lock up Chauncey
to-night with a strait-waistcoat, I suppose. Dear, dear, what
a pity for me, and for Marion too, poor girl, that things could
not run smoothly !"
He never knew what passed between the father and the
He heard loud voices, which died away; he heard the
shrill notes of Chauncey Chacomb; he heard his cries and
entreaties. In ten minutes Gerald came out, white and
trembling.
“ Go to my father, cousin,” he said. “Do what you can
for him. Hide him—for God's sake hide him from people,
lest he should talk. Treat him kindly so long as he lives, for
I shall never see him again.”
“What have you said, Gerald ?”
“Do not ask me. If he tells you, you will keep it secret,
for the credit of the name. Joseph”—he gasped for breath,
being perhaps still weak from his recent illness——“I am going
away, away from England. I cannot bear to stay here. I
leave my father to you, mind. He is to be your charge if I
never return. Tell Marion, when you see her, that I accept
the inevitable, but I love her still."
“I will take care of your father, but why— ?”
“ Again, do not ask me. Has that fellow taken out my
luggage? Very good; then it may remain in the dogcart.
I shall drive back to the station. Perhaps I will write to you
from London."
He seized the reins, and drove away, leaving the doctor
speechless.
Then he went to see his cousin. Chauncey was sitting,
calm and composed, at the window. He raised his eyes
heavily when he saw the doctor, but did not speak.
He maintained a perfect silence for four days. The doctor
began seriously to think of a private asylum. Then came a
letter from Gerald, telling in the fewest words possible that

he was starting immediately for Southern Africa, and would
be gone when the letter arrived.
“I ask,” he said, “ for no news, because there can be none
but bad news. I leave no address, and shall not go to the
post-office at the Cape or Natal for letters. Perhaps I shall
come back again in a few years. Perhaps not at all.”
Joseph Chacomb read the letter to Chauncey in the evening.
“I had absolutely made up my mind, Joe, that Gerald
should not marry that Revel girl. I hate her as much as I
hated her father. Did you hear how she turned upon me,
and forced me to tell the whole truth-the whole truth, by
Jove? Well, I told Gerald just what I told Marion."
“What did you tell them, Chauncey ?"
“Marion found it out herself, and taxed me with it. As
no one was looking, not even you, I confessed it all at once,
and laughed at her. She did not look so scared as you might
have expected; only her eyes were something like the captain's
when he fell; but not so wild—no, not so wild: there never
were eyes so wild as those. But they reminded me, you know.
And when Gerald came in just now-Gerald is a handsome
boy when he is in a rage I told him too. He looked like his
mother, very much. It is odd how little that boy resembles
me.”
“What, in Heaven's name, did you tell them ?”
Why, Joe, where is the use of pretending between our.
selves? You know as well as I. You saw me do it. You
saw me with your own eyes push him over the cliff. That
was why the only evidence you gave at the inquest was how
you tried to rescue him. I understood-yes, I understood
perfectly well. You cannot deceive a man of my penetration.'
“Let me look at you, Chauncey."
“ Look at me as long as you like. You thought I was mad.
I thought so myself for a little while. But I am not. I
was never cooler in my life. It is true that I lost my compo-
sure a little when Gerald swore he would never return home
again. That was natural with such a fine boy as Gerald-a
boy to be proud of-only I am quite sure he did not mean it.
He can never, you see, marry the daughter of the man I
murdered. No, Joseph, you are a clever fellow, but you will
not make me out to be mad. That is past even your medical
skill."
“Chauncey, pull yourself together, man. Think, think
what you are saying. I saw it all, from the beginning."

“I know you did, Joe-I know you did. And very good
it was of you to hold your tongue. Very good and thoughtful
indeed. To be sure, you were always a kind-hearted fellow."
“ I saw it, I say. Chauncey, you did not touch the man :
he slipped and fell. Your hands were six feet from him,
and more.”
“Kind of you, Joe-cousinly. Let us keep up the family
honour, outside, and say so everywhere. You and I know
better.'
What am I to say to this man ?” cried the helpless phy.
sician. “How am I to persuade him ? Good heavens,
Chauncey, I tell you that you did not push Captain Revel
over the cliff.”
“Quite right, when you speak so loud."
“Who the devil is to speak soft in such a matter?
Chauncey," he said, in a stage whisper, “ you did not-you
did not-you did not do it. It is a delusion which you will
shake off when you recover.”
“I am recovered," said the squire. “I know well now.
I see the whole scene before me. But let us talk nr, more
about it. The inquest was ' Accidental death. So that I
am quite safe. Only it will be well to keep things quiet to
ourselves, will it not?”
Quite off his head,” murmured the medical man-
Come, Chauncey, come, my poor cousin,” Joseph pleaded,
put this awful hallucination out of your min.d.'
“Do not be a hypocrite, Joseph Chauncey. I hate hypocrisy
where it is unnecessary. So would you,
if
you had had, like
me, all your life, somehow or other, to protend. I pretended
to be in love with Gerald's mother. I pretended to be fond
of your society—”
«Gad!" cried the doctor, “this is like a horrid nightmare."
“I pretended to be the special friend of Revel; I pretended
to like his girl; and I pretended to be sorry for what has hap-
pened. But I was glad, Joe—I was glad-only for one thing.”
“What is that, Chauncey ?” asked the doctor, catching at
a possible means of restoring him.
“It is, Joe, that I understand now what the Lord did when
he put a seal on Cain's forehead. He has put one on mine,
and I feel it hot and hravy. It grows hotter and heavier
every day. I expect it will be like red-hot steel before I am
dead. But I must bear it, and everything else. You will not
sear me complain, Joe, whatever I suffer. It is upon me day

and night-day and night. It would have been better that I
had never been born, for I have lived to be a murderer."
Then the doctor, by a stroke of inspiration, bethought him
all at once of his own utterances on the cleverness which is
able to make capital out of things as they happen, rather
than to speculate on things that might happen.
He rose solemnly, and standing before his cousin, a great
burly person, over a misshapen, withered little man, like a big
schoolmaster over a small boy, shook his forefinger-a very
large, fat, and red forefinger, terrible in its shaking as
Jupiter's nod-at his face.

asylums. If they make a noise, they are put into strait-

padded rooms. If they do not obey the keepers, the fellows
kneel on them and break their ribs, and then say that the
foolish madman did it himself. They tickle the soles of their
feet with feathers; they put them on bread and water ; they
never let them go out in the open air; they laugh at them,
and mock them; they give them no books to read; they shut
them up with gibbering idiots, who dangle their hands-8am
and drive them really mad with their dreadful grinning; or
else with raving maniacs, who glare and roar, and tear with
their claws. Cousin Chauncey, you, I am sorry indeed to

CHAPTER XII.
East and west of Tottenham-court-road-a thoroughfare
whose great shops have not been able to redeem it from a
vulgarity which enters into the soul of those who journey
upon its flags—there run lines of parallel streets, this part of
London being as regular as the city of Philadelphia, U.S.A.
When they were originally built, a hundred and forty years
ago, they displayed in their fronts a good deal of aristocratia
bauteur and coldness, befitting an expensive and fashionable
part of town. Their coldness remains, but their haughtiness
has vanished. The streets are not vulgar, but vulgarized.
Queer trades are carried on in the houses ; brass plates,
shutters, and window blinds bear announcements of callings
alien to the general experience. A modeller of human limbs,
a stippler of photographs, a wax flower maker, a valentine and
lace-paper manufacturer, a maker of playing cards, a painter
of fans, a Parisian artist engaged upon the petty trifles on
which we waste our money at Christmas and Easter: these
are some of the professionals who live side by side in Low-
land-street, Tottenham-court-road, in such amity as is con-
sistent with trades which are not in rivalry. The majority
of the ground floors belong to the offices and workshops; the
first and higher floors are let out either on a system of flats,
or in separate rooms to ladies and gentlemen who are, as a
rule, occupied elsewhere during the day. It is to apartments
in Lowland-street that the gallant young draper's assistant
of Oxford-street brings home his lovely bride. It is here that
the tutor (London B.A.), who gives lessons at a shilling an
hour in all the sciences and most languages, finds a lodging
adapted to his modest wants. It is to this retreat that the
translator and the literary compiler, whose days are spent in
the British Museum, return when midnight closes the public-
house. Here are third-rate actresses and actors; here are
betting men, whose sphere of action is limited to the suburban
fixtures, here are City clerks, who, by chumming together,
are able to afford one festive evening in the week at the
Oxford; here are the young and hopeful who look for better
days; here are the old and battered, praying that the worse
days may not become the worst; here are those who pretend
to have fallen from affluence, and pride themselves, like
Lucifer, upon the depth of their fali; aere are those, once

gentiefolk indeed, who would, if they could, fain forget the
past and be contented with the present. The romance, the
contrast, the poetry of London are not always where we have
agreed to place them. Where life is assured and easy, the
romance is of the drawing-room school, which ripples rather
than disturbs the surface. Among the reeking and foul
purlieus of the courts, about which not even a penny paper,
trying to work up to the highest sensational level, dares to
tell the whole, horrible truth, the romance, if there is any-
thing that is not real, is brutally and repulsively tragic.
Perhaps it is among these strugglers in byeways for life, these
hangers-on to the ornamental robes of civilization, these
people who profit by the foibles and vanities, rather than the
necessities of their fellows, that a deeper romance may be
found, in which life is really earnest, and the situations are
really melodramatic.
No. 15, Lowland-street, stands at the corner which marks
the confluence of that thoroughfare with Euphrates-row, a
place of less pronounced respectability. It is on the south
side of the street; its door bears two plates, one of brass : on
this the name of Ruddiman represents, as was supposed a
generation or two back, a landlord long deceased. The plate
has remained, a monument of his worth, destined to last as
long as the brass, and entirely unexpected in life. Immortality
sometimes takes a shape not looked for. The other plate, a
brighter and a newer one, is above it. It is in zinc, and pro-
claims the fact that here is Mr. Rhyl Owen's Academy. The door
itself is decorated and furnished with a row of half a dozen
bell handles, each of which is attached to its own room. In
the window of the ground floor is a card, setting forth that
lessons may be procured from Mr. Rhyl Owen on moderate
terms, in book-keeping, French correspondence, Latin, arith-
metic, and penmanship in all its branches. At the back of
the house, where oncē stood the garden, in the old times
before Euphrates-row was a modern encroachment on the
privacy of Lowland-street, they have built the school-room-
a long and low apartment, whence may be heard, at morn and
afternoon, the buzz of many lessons, the voice of the admo-
nisher, and the wail of the admonished. That is the select
academy of Mr. Rhyl Owen, In the evening it is let out as a
genteel dancing school, to a professor with a respectable con-
nection, whose daughters assist in imparting a knowledge of

the art, and in maintaining the lofty tone of the establish-
ment. Ladies of the ballet are not admitted to these lessons.
Once a year-I am sorry the anniversary will not fall within
the limits of this book-a ball is given: tickets of admission
for lady and gentleman, half a crown each ; refreshments,
provided by the eminent host of the Grapes, of course are
extra. The staircase of the house is dingy, and one which is
sometimes swept, but rarely cleaned. The wainscoted walls
are blackened at about the height of four feet six, where
people's shoulders have rubed against them for five genora-
tions; but it is a broad and handsome staircase not so
stately as one of those in the decayed houses of Soho, but a
staircase which shows conscientious work and no contract.
The house, as compared with most in the street, is thinly
populated. On the third floor front dwells a lady who may
have heard of seventy springs, but as all her life has been
passed in London, she has never actually seen one. She lives
on her means, and is reported by the outside world to be pos.
sessed of a comfortable income. It may be so, and it is per-
haps nothing but a miserly disposition which makes her lie
in bed rather than light a fire, dine habitually off bread and
butter, and find a banquet in a plate of cold beef bought at a
cookshopin Euphrates-row. Perhaps, however, it is her ostenta-
tious cleanliness which favours the idea. One of the bed.
rooms at the back of the same floor is occupied by a young
gentleman of four or five and twenty, who lives with his sister
downstairs, and is supposed to be engaged "in the City.” On
the second floor there lives a hermit. This class of thinker is
not so numerous as in the old days when-as in the sixth
century, before the Caliph Omar came to change things—the
whole of Palestine resounded perpetually, day and night, and
from end to end, with the litanies of those who fasted and
sang, and the howls of those who flogged their own sinful
backs. I have, myself, only known one or two cases of the
modern hermit. One was a man who got into the bacit of
living quite alone, never going out of his chambers except to
dinner, and then always to a restaurant close at hand, where
he sat daily on the same bench and had the same food. He
is still living, though prematurely grey. The other was the
case of Mr. Lilliecrip, the hermit of Lowland-street. He was
not a religious hermit, so far as the public knew, nor did he
sing litanies like a Benedictine, nor did he flagellate himself
with a cat-o'-nine tails like a repentant garotter, nor did he
fast and macerate himself like a Ritualist in Lent. But bo

had earned and maintained the character of a hermit by
simply never going outside his own door. He had the two
rooms, back and front, and the voice of rumour was busy with
him. He was reputed rich; he was said to be a nobleman in
disguise ; he was as great a mystery as the Man with the Iron
Mask; he was a great criminal; he was a murderer hiding
from the law; he was a forger, afraid to go into the streets ;
he was a political spy, obliged to keep himself dark; but,
above all, he was fabulously, enormously, tremendously rich,
and could buy up the whole of Lowland-street and never feel
it. On the ground floor, as has been stated, is Mr. Rhyl
Owen; with him his daughter Winifred, of her Majesty's
Telegraph Department. And the first floor, together with
the bed-room of the third floor back above mentioned, is let
at twelve shillings a week, taken by the quarter and money
paid in advance, to a family consisting of two young ladies
and their brother. The elder of the two paints all day at her
easel when she is not copying at the National Gallery; the
younger sits at home and watches her sister, or goes out
with her brother to walk along the streets and look at the
shops. For it is four years since the captain died. Comb
Leigh has long since passed away into the dim twilight of
the happy past. The Revels—Marion, Fred, and Adie-have
descended together to the level of Lowland-street, and to the
life that is called “ from hand to mouth."
It is an evening in April, when the advent of spring makes
itself felt in the heart of London by longer daylight and
colder winds, rather than by any of the gracious phenomena
familiar to lovers of nature in the country. All the children
are in the street, playing noisily; the nearest clock has struck
six; a German band blows at the corner with an energy
which shows temper as well as tune; and the cold wind
which, outside London, has stripped the apple tree of its
blossoms, turned the lilac flowers brown, curled up the young
leaves of the roses, and killed every little peachlet which was
beginning to swell out on its tiny stalk, is sweeping through
the streets and round the corners, driving the shavings and
bits of paper round and round in the areas, rasping the house-
maid's elbows, and painting the children's legs a lively red.
Where does it come from, this bitter wind of the east? Does
it always blow across the flats which stretch from Ostend to
the Ural Mountains ? And what manner of people are those
who dwell beneath its baneful influence ?

On the ground floor of No. 15, Mr. Rhyl Owen is engaged
in putting away his tea-things, having prepared and eaten
that meal by himself, according to his usual wont, after the
dismissal of the boys. The room is at once his dining,
sitting, and sleeping apartment. A turn-up bedstead of the
old-fashioned kind, constructed to look as much like a ward-
robe as possible, stands in one corner ; a wooden arm-chair
is in the window; a cupboard by the fireplace holds the
crockery of the ménage ; two or three hanging shelves con
tain Mr. Owen's library, which consists principally of transla-
tions—not used as cribs, but forming, when he is not engaged
upon Plutarch or the Book of Proverbs, his favourite reading;
for Mr. Owen is as fond of Homer) Virgil, and Ovid as any
other schoolmaster, though his mastery of their original
tongues is defective. The table is equally divided between
a pile of exercise books and a girl's workbox; an easy-chair
stands by the fireplace, and one or two other chairs complete
the furniture, The tenant of the room is small in stature,
like Zaccheus, Tydeus, Julius Cæsar, Napoleon, and most of
the other men known in history. His face is seamed, crow's-
footed, crossed and furrowed by a thousand lines, every one
of which represents a vexation or a disappointment. His short
and curly hair is an iron grey, and stands up all over his
head, giving him a look of perpetual surprise.
He wears
neither beard nor whiskers. His eyebrows are thick and black,
as if he was of a fierce and determined nature, which he is
not. On his large and bony hands the knuckles stand out
like cairns upon a hill-side. His lips are large and mobile ;
his eyes are as bright as a ferret’s. He is dressed in a long
black frock, once a coat belonging to a taller member of
society; its extreme rustiness proclaims its durability, and
furnishes a proof that English honesty is not yet become a
byeword and a proverb among the nations, in spite of the
sizing of cotton and the manufacture of shoddy. Round his
neck is a voluminous black tie. His linen, for it is Friday
evening, might be cleaner with advantage. His legs are
encased in trousers of a dark grey. How much his garments
bulge at the elbows and the knees, how their folds and
sinuosities betray the habitual disposition of their master's
legs beneath the chair, it would be long to tell. On his head
he wears a black skullcap.
Mr. Rhyl Owen placed the tea-things in the cupboard,
reduced the fire to a minimum, and taking his pipe from the

mantelshelf-a long clay-loaded and lit it. Then he looked
all round the room, like a dog who searches about for the
most comfortable place, took a book from the shelf, sat down
in the wooden chair, with his back to the light, and heaved
a mighty sigh.
Just at the moment when he took the first whiff a knock
came to the door, accompanied by the rustle of feminine
garments. He listened for a moment, and an expression,
half of fear, half of annoyance, crossed his face.
“If that's Mrs. Candy,” he called out, as the door partly
opened, "you needn't say, ma'am, what you came to say. I
caned your second to-day, and I caned your eldest yesterday,
and I shall do my duty upon both boys' trousers to-morrow
if they deserve it. So you may take your boys away or not,
as you like, Mrs. Candy. There's the national schools,” he
went
on, in a lower voice, as if he was working off an angry
mood;
“there's the young coxcomb of a certificated master
he knows everything. He ought to be caned for conceit, and
I should like to have the job. “Wisdom is too high for a
fool. You had better send them there. And there's the
Roman Catholic schools, where the priest ought to be caned,
and I should like to have that job too."
“It isn't Mrs. Candy, Mr. Owen,” said a voice from outside.
“ If it's the milk, you must come again, then; I've got no
money."
There was a little laugh.
• It isn't the milk."
Mr. Owen walked to the door with the solemnity that a
schoolmaster of many years' standing naturally acquires, and
opened it bimself.
“Oh, it's you, Miss Adie, is it?" he cried, with a changed
voice.
May I come in, Mr. Owen ?”
“Surely, surely; come in."
She came in the Adie Revel we left four years ago, a young
girl of sixteen. She is twenty now, and a woman; ber
figure is tall and shapely; her face, with features perfectly
and absolutely regular, is set in a framework of light and
waving hair; her eyes are of that limpid blue which seems as
full of expression as the eyes of Sappho or Heloise; her lips
are pırted in a smile, which seems one of perpetual content
it is the smile of a nature which looks for little more than to

pression of her eyes, which seems so deep, is as yet but the
light of youth and health. Love, quickener of the real
niture, has not yet come to transform the maiden. The
sorrows of her lifs have passed over her as the breath of
evening over a sea of molten glass, and left no trace behind.
ller dress is of a cheap and common stuff, but it is made, by
herself, in that perfect taste which almost deceives even
fuminine appraisers of the marketable value of other women's

been of silk, and fits her slender figure as if it had been made
in Regent-street. Round her neck she wears a blue ribbon
tied in a simple knot-her only ornament.
But she is so
beautiful that she wants none, it is pleasure enough to look
upon her; and if you listen while she speaks, you hear a
voice as clear and musical as any bell, if somewhat thin-
voice which seems to be the fitting organ for a soul of infi.

lighted my pipe, but I am grumpy."
“Poor old man!” said Adie, touching his cheek with the
tips of her fingers. “Why is he grumpy ?”
“Miserrimus," said Mr. Owen, bringing his chair from the
window to the fireside, and putting back the coals he had
taken off—"Miserrimus (nominative case, masculine gender,
superlative degree, from miser, wretched) is the adjective that
describes a schoolmaster. It is told that Dionysius the
Younger sank to the lowest depths of misery, and became a
schoolmaster—the lowest depths, you see : that is how men
gird at the profession. Shakspeare puts a Welsh school-
master like me upon the stage to be laughed at. No one
ever forgot that Louis Philippe had been a schoolmaster.

The girl turned red for a moment.
“I came down because I was all alone upstairs, with
nothing to do, and—and-oh, Mr. Owen, give me some tea.

“ Tea ? To be sure, to be sure." He got up and began
to oustle about, laying another stick on the fire.

Eungry! I have been hungry

thing.'
She laughed.
“Oh, not so very dreadful. Marion went out yesterday to
sell some pictures, but could not get her money. so we had
no dinner. This morning we finished all the bread for break-
fast, and Marion went out ngain directly afterwards, and has
not come home since. I worked till I was tired, and then I
went to sleep. But sleeping won't make up for no dinner.”
“ Where is your brother ?” asked Mr. Owen, shortly.
“He's gone into the City. But Fred will look after himself
-he always does."
“No dinner to-day, and none yesterday. Both days I had
a beautiful dinner, and just now I was grumbling !"
He shook his head as if he was sick of the selfishness of
human nature, dived into the cupboard and produced a piece
of bacon, from which he cut two or three slices. The girl
looked on with ill-disguised eagerness while the bacon was
cooking in the little Dutch oven. When it was ready, she
devoured it with the natural eagerness of an appetite sharp-
ened by the absence of dinner for two days.
CHAPTER XIII.
MK, RHYL OWEN sat opposite, watching his guest with
loving eyes. He was a soft-hearted creature, though he was
the master of a Commercial Academy; and it went to his
heart to think that this fair young creature should actually
want the commonest necessaries of life. He cut the bread and
poured out the tea with zealous solicitude.
“Is it good ? is it refreshing ?” asked he. “Now, do have
another slice--some more bread: eat plenty of bread with it;

drunk it all up myself—a greedy beast! Some people like a
bloater with a meat tea. I say bacon's more wholesome. As
for sprats, now, I suppose a young lady like you wouldn't
look at them.”
"I would have looked at anything five minutes ago. Oh,
Mr. Owen, I am so much obliged. It is so horrid to be
hungry.”
She finished her tea, and then looked up, with her familiar
laugh.
“That's right,” he nodded, and smiled back. “Already
you
look filled out in the cheeks, in a manner of speaking ;
though you're not, no more than your sister, like my
Winifred
for plumpness. Tell me, Miss Adie, you are not often so bad
as this upstairs, eh?”
“I don't think we have ever been quite so bad before, even
before Marion was able to sell her sketches. But then we have
been thrown back. It was necessary for Fred, who must have
a good appearance when he goes into the City to look for a
secretaryship, to have a new suit of clothes, with a great-coat,
this weather. That took all our spare money, as you may
guess. Then we have had to pawn things—my father's watch
and chain, and even his sword. You may think how Marion
liked that.”
“My dear, you had better not tell me more than you think
right,” said Mr. Owen, with some delicacy about hearing
further particulars.
“Why not? It is no use pretending to be proud-we have
nothing to conceal; we have been ladies and gentlemen-now
we are not, I suppose. What else is there to say? There is
no shame in being poor.”
She laughed, but she spoke a little bitterly.

“Yes, it's hardest on Marion, isn't it? because she does all
the work for us. Besides, she was the eldes i, and had been
most with poor papa. I hope she will bring some money home
with her.”
“ Perhaps your
brother"
“Oh,” she laughed again, “Fred never brings any money
home; he takes all the money out. But that will do about
myself. How have the boys been to-day-good ?”.
“Boys never are good. They are born bad-original sin,
you know—and it is our duty to thrash them till they grow
good. Listen, there's some one at the door again. If it is

Mrs. Candy, she is coming to have a row. Perhaps it's-
Why"-his face lit up all over with pleasure—“it's actually
Winifred, home two hours before I expected her.”
It was Winifred. She came running into the room, threw
her arms about her father, and gave him two great smacks,
one on each cheek; then caught Adie by the chin, held her
face up to the light critically, and kissed that too.
“You are the prettiest girl in all London," she whispered.
Then she took the lid off the tea pot and examined its
contents, put in some water, and got another cup
and saucer.
Then she threw off her hat and jacket; and then, everything
ready, she sat down and prepared to enjoy herself in a busi-
nesslike manner.
“It is perfectly delicious," she said. “Tea made, Adie to
tea with us, and a fire. Father, this is worth living for,
isn't it?”
He sucked his pipe and nodded.
“ Bread and butter, Adie, dear. How
sorry
I am I wasn't
home to have tea with you! No, I won't have any bacon,
thank you. There are times, father, when you feel yourself a
man to be envied, eh? Your daughter in the Civil Service,
like a proud young competitive clerk; a young lady to tea
with
you;
and work for the day done. Good work, too.
Adie, I am always proud of my father's work."
She read her father's moods by his face, and spoke accord-
ingly.
"I tell him," Winifred continued, looking sideways at the
little cloud which still hung upon her father's brow—“I tell
him it is noble work which he is doing, the best work a man
can do, to raise these poor boys out of ignorance, to bear with
their
ways, and try to make them like himself.”
Mr. Owen shook his head with mild deprecation. But he
enjoyed it,
Nonsense, father! Every teacher wants to make his
disciples like himself, else what would be the good of
teaching? A schoolmaster ought to be learned; you are
learned, father."
“Pretty well, my dear, pretty well. Cæsar at my fingers'
ends, as you may say; and as far as Compound Interest, per-
haps, you might find it hard to meet my match.”
“ He must be sober. Why, father, who could be soberer
than you ?"
“ Yes, my dear; I am too poor to drink if I wanted to."

“He must be just.”
Mr. Owen nodded, as much as to say that Lowland-street
Academy contained the justest of men.
Merciful, too, with his justice.”
He nodded again, with emphasis.
' By the way, father, who was that I heard crying yes.
terday?"
“Candy Secundus," said her father, shortly.
“Poor Candy Secundus! Poor little Sugar Candy! Do
you know little Sugar Candy, Adie? The dearest little
fellow, with blue eyes and curly hair, and always getting into
scrapes. His mother keeps the baker's shop over the way.
What did poor Sugar Candy do, father?”
'Justice comes before mercy,” said Rhyl Owen.
tise thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare
for his crying. Candy Secundus brought a piece of chalk in
his trousers pocket, and chalked upon my desk-my desk-
these lines:
• Taffy is a Welshman;
Taffy keeps a cane;
When I get a big man
He shall have it back again.'
Candy Secundus will remember his verses for some time
when he comes to sit down. I expect Candy's mother will
come to-night to give notice."
Winifred looked graver. The withdrawal of one boy from
the little school meant the loss of a pound a quarter, a sen-
sible item in the modest household.
“I will go round and see her presently,” she said. “Per-
haps she will be reasonable."
As the light fell upon her, the low fire on the left and the
gas just turned on overhead made pretty effects of colour in
the twilight. You may see that she is not a beautiful girl —
not beautiful in the sense that Adie, with her regular features
and calm eyes in a perpetual repose, is beautiful. Look
again: you see a face full of mirth and animation; a nose
rather short and perhaps a little too broad; lips half open,
showing the whitest teeth behind; and more still, cheeks as
soft as peaches and set with a pair of dimples petites
fossettes d'amour. Her chin is strongly accentuated and
rather pointed, for Winifred has a will of her own; the
tiniest and daintiest little pink ears nestle beneath a cloud of
rebellious locks of light brown, which escape from their

assigned places, and float at their own own sweet will; a face
full of affection, enjoyment, and possible passion; and, to
crown all, a pair of grey eyes which have caught the sun-
shine of June, and give it back through all the year-eyes
always ready to laugh ; eyes fearless and trusting; eyes that
enjoy the world, and are aglow with the fire of her youthful
blood, in which the lover-when the lover comes—will see
“a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
from Lebanon." Her fingers, long and delicate, quiver when
she speaks, as if she was working the telegraph still. As
she sits, as she moves, as she speaks, you feel that you are
with a girl whose nervous system is strung by nature to concert
pitch, so that one note out of tune would set the whole ajar.
The other girl, Adie Revel, beside her, is at present calmly
and dispassionately happy. She has had enough to eat-
that is sufficient for the time. Like the owner of the Splendid
Shilling, she can say, “Fate cannot harm me; I have dined
to-day." She has no more care for the next day than when
we left her last, playing Badminton with her brother. Like
the soft-eyed deer, she lies in the sun and warmth, enjoys
what the present has to give, and is a philosopher in this-
that she leaves the gods the rest. “ Heaven," we know,
“ which sees the future, keeps the issues in the darkness of
the night; nor does it forgive the man who trembles before
what is coming, more than is due to human uncertainty."
Adie had never read Horace; but she agreed with so much
of his philosophy as not to tremble at thinking of the future.
Now Winifred thought perpetually of things that might be
coming: she thought of Marion, who worked for the three;
of Adie, who could not work, but sat at home and hoped for
better things, and she thought—she thought too much-of
Fred: Fred the handsome, Fred the indolent, Fred, whose
very faults made him interesting, because they were not the
faults of the class among whom she had been brought up.
A young man of Lowland-street or Euphrates-row, if he
departed from the paths of rectitude, which was not un.
common, was to be seen smoking pipes at public-house doors,
reeling home at night, or even, in extreme cases of moral
obliquity, marching handcuffed between two men in blue, or
escorted from the doors of Bow-street Police-office to the door
of her Majesty's omnibus. The Lowland-street youth did
aot, like Mr. Frederick Revel, wear trousers and coat closely
cesembling those of Bond-street; they did not spend the day

in the fashionable end of the town; they did not frequent
West-end billiard rooms; nor did they despise the com.
panionship of other young gentlemen in the street. Per.
haps it was the contrast of Fred Revel with this other
young man which made Winifred think so much about him.
The old schoolmaster, retreating from the table to his place
in the window and his book, left the two girls to their talk.
“ Poor dear!” said Winifred. “ To think of your going
without
your
dinner for two days ! Why did you not tell us ?”
Adie laughed.
“That is nothing, providing we don't have to go without
our dinner to-morrow and the next day. But I dare say
Marion will get some money; she always does find money
somehow."
Perhaps your brother will get a proper place soon.”
“ Poor Fred! He says, Winifred, that some people are
born to work and some to spend, and he certainly was not
born to work. Sometimes I think that Fred will never get
any more work to do at all. You know, he does try; he goes
into the City, I believe, at least once a week—and everybody
knows it is in the City that you pick up rich posts. Once he
was made secretary to a company. His friend, Lord Rodney
Benbow, got him the post. To be sure, the company broke
up in a month ; but then, as Fred says, it gave him the
business experience that he wanted. Winifred, don't let
Marion know that I told you about our distress ; she is proud,
and would not like it. As if it matters now," she said, with
a bitter laugh—"as if it matters for all the world to know
how poor we are! Let them know. We have not a single
friend to care whether we starve or not.”
“Oh, Adie, you have me.”
“It is a horrid thing to be poor," she went on, passionately.
“It is a cruel thing, a wrong thing, a wretched thing to be
poor. Marion seems to think it enough if we get our
miserable meals day by day.”
“Give us this day our daily bread, Adie," said Winifred.
“I know. But my bread ought to be more than breakfast,
and dinner and tea. I want things, Winifred, that other
girls have. What is the good of life where there is no plea-
sure-nothing but working day after day to get enough to eat?"
“But we cannot have all we want to have,” said the tele-
graph girl, letting her thoughts loose vaguely in the field of
boundless impossibilities.

“ Why can't we? Once I had all that I wanted; it was
not much, to be sure, for I was only sixteen, and satisfied
with little. Now I am twenty, I want to live."
“Adie, do you think it is right to talk so ?”
Right or not, I do so because I think so. Yesterday I
went out with Fred for a walk. He will not take me to
Regent-street or the Park, for fear of meeting his old college
friends. You see, Winifred, this is the only dress I have
got. I can trim it up after the fashion, but I can't turn it
into a new dress. Fred keeps up appearances better—I do
not know how. Well, he is ashamed to be seen with his
sisters in the street. We walked part of the way down
Oxford-street, turned to the right up Berners-street, and then,
after seven o'clock, when all the gentlemen were having
dinner, and Fred was not afraid of meeting any one he knew,
we went down Bond-street and Piccadilly. As we came home
through the squares, the people were driving off to dinner;
in one or two houses we could see them sitting down, ladies
and gentlemen-ah, happy people !-dining properly, and
with servants to wait. Some other people, not so happy, but
better off than ourselves, were going to the theatres. We
came home.
Neither Fred nor I had a single sixpence
between us. When we got home, we found Marion sitting
with a single light, trying to draw an outline. She had no
money either. Fred smoked, nobody spoke, because we were
all three too miserable; and about ten we went to bed. We
had had neither tea nor supper, and Marion sat all the evening
with her head on her hand. Poor Marion ! Poor Fred! Poor
me! You don't mean, Winifred, that I should like this life ?"
A grunt escaped the lips of the schoolmaster, but he said
nothing. Adie looked up for a moment, and went on, in a
lower voice-
“ Fred keeps up his spirits and mine too, as well as he can,
the dear fellow. He is always cheerful; he says
that
thing will happen to make us all comfortable again. But
it is worse for Marion, because she has all the work to do,
poor thing! She is different from both of us, I think; and
takes things more seriously. To be sure, where should we
be without her ?”
“When Fred—I mean your brother," said Winifred—“ gets
the place he wants, it will be better, will it not? He will do
something for you.
It would be dreadful for him to go on
for ever allowing Marion to work for both of you.”

“That is what he says and thinks. Fred has, only you
would not think it unless you knew him as well as I do, the
noblest of hearts. He says that this living on the proceeds
of Marion's work is killing him, and I am sure that he is
getting thinner. He declares that he is ready to take any
kind of work that offers. Of course, you know, Winifred, it
must be such work as a gentleman can do. Now and then
Dr. Chacomb suggests something ; but Fred has got an aver-
sion to the doctor, and his way of looking at things. Above
all, as Fred says, he is a gentleman, and, if he pleased, a
nobleman."
“Yes, dear, I know."
There was another grunt from the schoolmaster.
“I read once,” he said, without looking round, “ of a
nobleman in France who fell into poverty. He resolved on
giving up his title and forgetting his rank. He handed his
sword to the Mayor of Bordeaux, and went away. When he
came home after twenty years, enriched by trade, he demanded
back, and received again, the sword of his ancestors."
Adie listened politely.
“ You had better tell Fred that story, Mr. Owen,” she said,
with a laugh. "I should like to see Fred depositing my
father's sword with the Lord Mayor of London while he went
about, on Dr. Chacomb's suggestion, as an advertising tout.
That was the last advice, I believe.”
“There are good families in Wales,” said Rhyl Owen, “as
well as in France. My father, Ap Rhyl, whose father was
Ap Owen, used to boast of our descent from Llewellyn, who
was a king: Yet my brothers and I had to work for our
living, and never grumbled at it."
“ Never mind, father," said Winifred. “You do not quite
understand.”
But Adie, disinclined to discuss the question, had risen.
“I shall go upstairs now,
she said. “ Good night,
Mr. Owen.” She went to the chair, and held out her hands.
“I am very, very much obliged to you.”
Child," said the schoolmaster, looking up at her, “stoop
down, and let me whisper. If you have got no money to.
morrow, you and your sister come down here at one o'clock-
ve will go shares. And, Miss Adie, make your brother do
some work, and try to get some for yourself. Don't leave
everything to Miss Marion."
Adie nodded her head, laughed, kissed him on the forehead,

and left him. It was two years since they came to the house.
Rhyl Owen and his daughter were not, as she and Fred con-
fessed to each other, strictly of the upper classes, but they
were kind.
Adie loved little attentions, and craved for the
outside signs of affection. Winifred was her only companion,
and, when Fred was not at home, she allowed herself a greater
approach to familiarity with Winifred's father than her
aristocratic brother would have approved of. At all events,
she felt that he would have shuddered if he had seen her
actually kiss the forehead of the little Welsh schoolmaster.
"Not even a University man!” he would have said.
“Winifred,” said her father, abruptly, “he's a worthless
chap.”
Winifred changed colour. But she knew whom he meant.
“He's a worthless chap, Winifred, my girl,” he went on.
“He hangs about billiard tables, and borrows money of
gentlemen. Sam Beagle, who is head waiter at the Guards'
Club, told me he heard Lord Rodney talking about him, saying
that Fred Revel cost him a sovereign every time he met him,
and he'd be dashed if he'd stand it any longer.”
Winifred was silent still.
"As for the girls—the young ladies, I mean—it's a good
thing for you and me that they came here. It isn't often
that we get the chance of knowing a real lady. As for Miss
Marion-Lord ! when I think of that girl, Winifred, and how
she toils and slaves, my blood boils—it boils, I say. There,
I've broken my pipe ! Give me the other one, my dear. As
for Miss Marion, I say, she's a good woman.
Who can say
more ?"
He got up, and stood before the spark that lingered in the
fireplace.
“What does Solomon say about a good woman ?” He took
a Bible, and opened it at the Book of Proverbs, and read-
“She riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to the
household. . Strength and honour are her clothing; and
she shall rejoice in time to come. In her tongue is
the law of kindness.
Many daughters have done
virtuously, but she excels them all. Let her own works
praise her in the gates.' That is Marion Revel. I have
watched her for two years. She is the good woman of Solomon,
and she is more—she is the true Christian, Winifred, because
she thinks and works for others, and not for herself.”
“ And so do you, father, dear."

He stroked his chin,
“In a measure, my child. Yes. It is the task of the
teacher, I read in a book the other day, to lose his own in-
terests in those of his pupil. The anxieties of one become
the sufferings of the other; he feels with his scholar_"
“Poor little Sugar Candy,” said Winifred, thoughtfully,
with a gleam in her eye.
Her father caught it, and laughed. He was a silent man
out of school, because he talked so much in school hours that
quiet was needful. He was a grave man, because he could
not indulge in the natural mirth of his nature before the
boys; but the old Adam broke out sometimes, as it did now.
i Ho! ho !” he laughed. Candy Secundus will become a
great poet:
*Taffy was a Welshman;
Taffy had a big cane ;
When I get a big man
He shall have it back again.'
Ho! ho! ho ! If little Candy does not turn out a gicat man,
my dear, they will tell of this day, and how his brutal school.
master flogged him. Dear me! Schoolmasters are a mis-
represented race! I dare say Orbilius in Francis's 'Horace'
-there is the book on the top shelf --was a merry, soft-
hearted, and gentle creature, only Horace never understood
the right side of his nature. Perhaps Busby used to cry
at night when he thought of all the boys wriggling on their
seats.”
“ Winifred,” he went on again, after a few meditative
puffs of his pipe, “ think over what I said, my dear. He is a
worthless chap. You went for a walk with him on Sunday
afternoon."
“Yes, father, but Adie was with us. Oh, you don't know !"
She took his face in her hands, and squeezed the wrinkled
and crow's-footed eyes and nose together. “ You don't know
anything about it, father. Why, the Revels are quite above
Fred is a gentleman, an Oxford man, a scholar, and a
Count—think of that—only he is too proud to take the title.
And what am I? Only a telegraph girl, father.”
She laughed as she spoke, but the tears came into her eyes.
She brushed them away quickly.
“ And now, father, I shall go round to Mrs. Candy's, and
find out if she is angry with you. I shall pretend to ask for
a loaf, you know. We can't have the school dropping to
us.

pieces just yet, can we? Dear old father, you have yet to
work a year or two longer, until your daughter can make
money enough to keep you.'
Left alone, the schoolmaster sat down and pondered. The
house was quiet and lonely. He thought of his bright and
pretty girl; he thought of the idler whose fancy she had
caught; he wondered what was best to be done. Outside the
house, in the street, the children shouted and played; within
there was the silence of the grave. And he thought of the
two friendless girls above him, and one of them so helpless.
“ Between most of us and starvation," he said, “there's
only the mercy of the Lord. Thank Him, it's a thickish plank.”
Presently he heard a heavy foot mount the stairs, and stop
at the Revels' door.
CHAPTER XIV.
and use.
The visitor knocked at Miss Revel's door. Getting no
reply, he gently turned the handle and looked in. Its only
occupant, Adie, was sitting in the dusk at one of the windows,
pressing her cheek against the glass, and gazing, with her
thoughts far away, at the passers below. The gas from
the street and the shop over the way lit up the room.
In
the softened twilight and the dim illumination you could
perceive that the room was comfortably furnished with easy
chairs, a sofa, a piano, and a few water-colour paintings. The
light was not strong enough to show that the covering of
chairs and sofa was worn in holes and faded, that the carpet
was ragged, that the piano bore marks of age
An
easel stood at one window, and by it a small stand with paints
and canvas. In the centre was a table covered with work,
over which Adio s fingers had been busy during the day. She
was not idle, for she kept the wardrobe of her sister and her-
self, and maintained, in spite of all difficulties, the neatness
of her brother s linen. The new-comer, who was indeed no
other than Dr. Chacomb, stepped across with the noiseless
tread affected by some heavy men, and laid his hand gently
on Adie's.
“ You ?” she started. “I did not hear any one operche
door. I thought you had deserted us, Dr. Chacomb. It is
nearly six months since you came to see us last.”
“I got very little encouragement in my last visit," he said.

)
“I am not quite certain that I ought to come here again at
all.”
“Did Fred say anything to annoy you? You remember
that you annoyed him very much.”
“ Šo that he had the right to annoy me in return, you
mean. No, it was not your brother's little outbreak of temper.
I hardly know what that young man could do which would
annoy me. He might surprise me, certainly. If he were to
get his living in any honest way, it would surprise me. But
he would never annoy me."
“Do not say unkind things about Fred," said Adie. “For
my own part, I should be extremely sorry to have him making
his living as an advertising tout; and that, you know, was
what you advised him to become.”
“That is about the only thing he is fit for," said the doctor.
“Well, if it was not Fred, who was it--Marion or myself?"
“ As it was not you, it was of course your sister.”
“I declare,” said Adie, pettishly, “it is too provoking.
What did Marion say or do, I should like to know? You are
absolutely the only decent creature left in the world-not to
speak of dear little Winifred Owen—that comes to see us, and
you take offence at some nonsensical fancy of your own. Oh,
why are men so stupid ?”
Hardly a nonsensical fancy," said the doctor. “It was
real hard fact. Where is Marion ?”
“I do not know. She went to Burls's shop. Perhaps she
stayed there to finish off something; perhaps she had to go
over Waterloo Bridge to Hermann's. She may be in any mo-
ment. Sit down and be comfortable, and tell me all about it.”
“Tell me first how you have been getting on since last I
saw you."
“We have been getting on worse and worse.
I think we
did have some money, a little, left when you came last. That
is all gone now. And Marion has not been doing very well
for the last three months. At present, we have nothing."
Nothing ?”
“Nothing at all. Not a sixpence in the world. We paid
our rent for the quarter out of Marion's dividends. Then we
had a little money left to live upon; we have got nothing now,
and out of that we have to save up for next quarter's rent,
and live besides. It's like what papa used to call a midship-
man's half-pay."
The doctor was silent.

“Yesterday we had no dinner. To-day we have had no
dinner. I do not know what poor Marion has done; but I
went downstairs, when I was so hungry that I could not bear
myself any longer, and asked Mr. Owen to give me something
to eat. I've had bacon, and bread and butter and tea.”
" And Fred ?"
“ Fred is like the sparrows : he picks up his dinner in the
street,” said Adie. “I wish I could.”
“No money, no dinner. Why did you not send to me,
child ?"
Why did
you
not come to us?”
“Did not Marion tell you anything ?”
“No. Marion tells me nothing about herself. Tell me what
was the matter, Dr. Chacomb. Perhaps I can help to put
things right. Heaven knows we can't afford to give up our
only friend.”
"It is a very simple matter," he replied. “I asked Marion
to marry me, and she refused.”
• Oh!”
Adie found nothing else to say before a statement the whole
bearing of which she could not immediately realize.
“You, too, I suppose, think it absurd,” said Dr. Chacomb.
“I have never thought anything about it at all," she replied;
“because this is the only time I have heard about it. But it
does seem at first as if it was too bad that you can't know us
without wanting to marry one of us. Why isn't all the stupid
love taken out of the novels ? No one would think of it at all
unless for them-I am sure Marion and I don't-and then
we could live together and be happy."
“ Childish talk," said the dootor. “You don't understand.
Now listen, Adie, and see if you can understand this. When
you knew me four years ago, I had no money, and was in
debt. I used to run down to Chacomb to borrow, when I
was hard up, of poor Chauncey. I had a mouldy little
surgery-I blush to think of it—at Islington, with half a
dozen patients, and what is called a general practice. I was
lazy, because I had nothing to do. I was forty-five years of
age, and a failure. You remember me then. Try to compare
me now with what I was. Tell me what you thought of
me."
Adie laughed, and shut her eyes. It was yreat fun to tell
Dr. Chacomb the exact truth, and not to offend him.
“ I shall not be complimentary,” she said.
“ You were a

red-faced man—such a red face !-and Fred used to say you
drank too much.”.
“Fred was always as fond of me as I am of him," said the
doctor, smiling. “But Fred was right."
“ You wore black trousers that bulged dreadfully at the
knees, and a coat that never-whether you walked or stood or
sat-hung anyhow but in bumps and folds. Your boots were
worn down at the heel, and you had a horrid black waistcoat
which was frayed at the pockets."
“Very likely,” said Dr. Chacomb. “The pockets were
worn by searching for the coins which were not there. Those
devils of pockets! I remember them, too. They were my
purse, and the reverse of the purse that Peter Schlemyl got-
“Who was Peter Schlemyı ?”
“I forget now, except that he sold his shadow, and that he
got instead of it a purse, out of which you could take as
much money as you pleased, without putting any in. Now,
you could put as much as you liked into my pockets, and.
there never was anything there. The gold changed into
silver, the silver into copper, and the copper into nothing at all.
But pray go on with your description. It grows interesting.”
“I think I have finished. Stay-you had immense red
hands. I used to wonder how it would feel to have hands of
such an enormous size. Your hair was thick and matted; your
lips were very large, I remember, and very red, you had great
black eyebrows, and your eyes were fierce and strong-they
seemed to take in everything, and to want to order everybody
about. Altogether, you were not quite nice, somehow. Comb
Leigh did not suit you."
Good,” said the doctor. “On the whole, it is a clever
portrait. But that was four years ago. Light the candles,
look at me again, and tell me if the portrait will do now.”
“There is only an inch or two of candle left, and what are
we to do for more when these are gone?” said Adie.
mind, we can go to bed in the dark. There, Dr. Chacomb.”
“What do you see now ?” asked the doctor.
No,” said Adie; " I will not describe you any more.”
The portrait, indeed, no longer represented Dr. Joseph
Chacomb. His face, lit by the candles, had lost its old red
hue, and was now pale, but not pallid; his large eyes-for-
merly, to the young girl's fancy, so fierce-were softened and
grave; above them lay eyelids beavy, as if with thought.
Eris eyebrows were no thicker than is befitting to a man of

great mental and physical strength. His lips wero large,
especially the lower lip; but you may remark the same pro-
ininence in that feature in the photograph of nearly every
great statesman, lawyer, or preacher. His hair, grown thin
at the temples, was strong, closely knitted, and not yet touched
with grey—a sturdy crop of brown curls. His large hands,
from which he had removed the gloves, were now white and
shapely. He was dressed by Poole, in such garments as
belong especially to the prosperous physician-a black but-
toned frock, and grey trousers in which no trace of Adie's
ancient "bulge" was visible. A pair of double eye-glasses in
gold bung from his neck.
“ Of course I knew,” said the girl, “without the candles,
that you were greatly changed. I was only talking of what
you used to be. You are not offended, are you ?”
“Not at all; but I want you to understand all about me,
and that very clearly. Look at me again. Am I younger or
older than I used to be ?"
· Younger, to look at.”
“If a man is younger to look at, he is younger in reality.
There is no wearing of wigs about me; it's all Nature's
handiwork. I am exactly what you see me, and I was
exactly four years ago what you knew me then. I ought, by
all the rules of life, to be four years worse
-fiercer in the
face, redder in the eyes, clumsier in the paws; but I am not,
you see. I am ten years younger; I am not red-faced at all.
You have never asked me what has effected this transfor-
mation.'
She shook her head.
"I will tell you."
“If it is a story, let me put out the candles. You can talk
by the gaslight just as well.”
“Rubbish! Let them burn out; I will give you plenty
more. Listen to me, child. When the unsuccessful man
putteth off his unsuccess, he lays aside his bad habits. Of
bad habits come red faces and fierce eyes ; of unsuccess come
old coats, down-at-heel boots, and bulgy bags. Failure in a
man is like a fallow soil to the fields, because it causes all
manner of ill weeds to grow. When you knew me first, I
was a failure; now I am a success."
“I am glad to hear it,” said Adie. “I wish
you
would
teach Fred the way to become a success.'
“ Fred! As if any teaching would do him any good! But

have you no curiosity? Do you not care to ask what I have
done?”
“No," said the girl. “Men are always doing something to
make money.
It seems to me to matter very little what
they actually do, so long as they get it, and give it to their
daughters."
“There is no critical faculty at all,” said the doctor, “in
the feminine mind. If Eve had only been told not to inquire
how Adam made his money, we should all have been gardening
in Paradise this day. I never did like gardening, for my
part, so I am mightily obliged to Eve. Then, Adie, since you
do not ask me, I must tell you. You have never heard, I
suppose, of the Royal Hospital for Gout, supported by volun.
tary contributions ?”
Adie shook her head.
You see,” she said, “I never had gout. It comes of
eating and drinking too much, I believe. We are not at all
likely-Marion and I—to get gout. Perhaps Fred may get
it some day.”
“I am its Founder," he said, with pride.
projects, it is the only one which I have pulled off. The rest,
poor innocents, perished unborn. But one is enough. I
founded it. Alone I did it. I hired the building, got my
secretary, and organized my management. It is now a
flourishing institution. I am the chief consulting physician.
We appeal especially—it is a stroke of real genius this, if
you
could only understand it-to those who have never had the
disease. The funds come in, and my fortune is made.”
“Do you mean that you take all the money that people
send ?” asked Adie, in her innocence.
No, my dear young lady. That would be an elementary
proceeding unworthy of my genius, and leading to unpleasant
interviews with the magistrates. My fortune is built upon
my reputation, and that is based upon my hospital. I am now
the leading specialist on gout. Dr. Porteous, of Savile-row,
pretends to be my superior; but you will not believe that.”
“Very well,” said Adie, innocently; "I will not."
“My income is over four thousand a year, and it goes us
increasing like a snowball. You understand so far?”
“Yes. You bave got more money than you know what to
do with.”
“ Not quite. However, this is what I am coming to. I want
to marry Marion. If she will have me, I will take you away

to a pleasant house at the other end of town. You shall have
a carriage to ride in. Do you hear ?”
“Ah !" cried the girl, her colour flushing.
“You shall leave this place, and go into the country, to the
seaside wherever you please. You shall have money to spend,
and as much as you want. You shall associate with ladies and
gentlemen again. You shall dress as a young lady of your
beauty-you know what a pretty girl you are, Adie-ought to
dress. You shall have lessons in all young ladies' accomplish-
ments. You shall pick up the threads of your life where
you
dropped them four years ago, only they shall lead to a life
broader and more famous, and fuller in enjoyment. You shall
belong to the world that you envy. Only you must help me.
“How can I help you?" she asked, with lips apart and
brightened eyes.
Will
you
if you can ?"
"Will I not ? Would I not do anything, anything to get
out of this dreadful place, and feel once more that to-morrow's
food at least is ready and certain ? You know that Marion
is reserved. I cannot go to her and say, ' Marion, you are a
great goose to refuse the good luck that offers for both of us.'
If I were even to hint at it, things would be worse than ever.
There must be no appearance of my helping, even if I see a
way.”
The doctor considered.
“Time is precious to a man when he is on the verge of

him. I want to marry at once, Adie, and waste none of those
valuable years. First of all, however, I must help you. Don't
be proud, child. You have no money ?”
“Not one penny. I told you so.
“ Then you must not refuse to take some. I suppose you
keep house while Marion paints ?"
“Yes.”
“I think you had better not let her know, if you can help it,
that I have given you anything. Only take care that you
always have plenty to eat. See, here are fivo pounds for you
and Marion, for your housekeeping. I put the money into
your hands on the condition that you do not give it to your
brother to waste. Spend it on yourselves. Let Marion, il
you like, believe that it is careful housekeeping. And as to
helping me, you can only do it by letting Marion feel, day by
day, the misery of poverty."

Adie considered.
That may seem cruel, but it is really kind. As soon as
Marion begins to realize that her compliance means your
restoration to the world of respectability, she will comply."
“But about Fred. You will help the poor boy too, won't
“I am not at all obliged to provide for Fred,” said the
doctor; “but I will do what I can for him. Fred shall not
be forgotten; that is all I can promise on his account. It is
you that I should like to see happy and well provided for, my
dear child. I want to have you with us for a year or two
before you marry and leave us; to see you enjoy yourself at
balls and operas and theatres; to bring a little more plun p-
ness to those fair cheeks of yours.”
The doctor had got her hand in his, was bending his face
to hers, and you might almost have thought by the look of
his
eyes that he was making love to her. But he was not:
it was only a way that he had, and the natural pleasure which
every well-regulated male mind feels at having a girl's soft
hand in his own.
“I should like, my girl, to make you happy, as well as
Marion. Are you afraid of me?"
“But Marion must be made happy first,” said Adie. "How
do I know that you will be kind to her, as well as to me?
Marion is not so easy to get on with as I am; she takes
everything so seriously, you know. And, besides, it is not
me you want to marry, but Marion."
- If you are not afraid of me, why should Marion be? If
you would not laugh at me, I would tell you that I love her.
I do indeed. I have always loved her.”
“ Have you? It seems very funny that you should love
Marion. You are such very different people. Perhaps,
though, that is the reason why you love her. But I do now
want to laugh."
“What would you say if I told you I loved you, Adie ?”
“I cannot imagine such a thing to happen at all," she
replied. “It is no use speculating. One thing you may be quite.
certain of: if you were Blue Beard himself, and I were only
going to be the last wife but one, I would marry you if you
asked me, to get out of this doleful life. Yes, I would. And
if I were Marion, I would marry any one who would give us
enough to eat. If I were Beauty herself I would marry the
Beast with pleasure, if he would give me proper dresses and

the things that make life comfortable as well. I would
do anything for more money, Dr. Chacomb-anything, I
declare."
“ Have patience a little, Adie,” said the doctor, smoothing
her hair with his palm. “Wait till I bring home Marion
for ny bride, and you shall have all you want. I am not
quite Blue Beard, nor yet quite the Beast; but tell me," he
added, sentimentally, “would you mind having me for your
brother-in-law ?”
“Not a bit,” said Adie, truthfully. “I should rather like
it, I think. You are the only gentleman we know, and I am
sick of starving. Fred never does anything for us; I can
do nothing for myself. What are we to look forward to ?
You are quite sure you will not do anything horrid after you
are married ? Because, you know, I should feel miserable
all my life if poor Marion were made unhappy through me."
“Trust me, Adie,” said Dr. Chacomb; “and help me if
you can.
See, you have forgotten the money."
Adie took up the five glittering sovereigns, and held them
in her hands, holding them to the light with an admiration
that had a sort of tremor in it. She had never before had
so much money given her all at once, and the gold repre-
sented a boundless vista of rich and luxurious probability.
" It seems wrong, somehow," she said, “to take your
money. Suppose nothing comes of it, after all. Suppose
Marion will not be persuaded to marry you. Suppose you
reproach_me for doing nothing. Mind, I cannot promise
much. I will do what I can, because I think it is the best
thing for us all, not because I want it by itself, and very
much, to happen. And you will perhaps turn round then,
and
say I took the money from you.”
“ Joseph Chacomb, Adrienne Revel”-in less prosperous
days he would have said “Joe Chacomb”—“ Joseph Chacomb
has faults. He is sometimes called overbearing, chiefly by
his enemies; but do not forget that he comes, like yourself,
of gentle blood. We are the Chacombs of Chacomb. My
cousin Chauncey, poor fellow, and I are now alone to repre-
sent the family, unless Gerald turns up again. You may at
least trust Joseph Chacomb to be a gentleman."
“Good night, then, Dr. Chacomb, and thank you.”
“Hush! I hear Marion's step.”
The pair separated guiltily, Adie slipping the money into
her pocket. The man's ear was quicker than the girl's, for

inimediately afterwards the door opened, and Marion Revel
came in.
Four years of hard and careworn struggles have placed
their mark
upon her. She was little more than a girl when
we saw her last, with the buoyancy of girlhood still on her;
she appears a woman of thirty now, by her wasted cheeks
and her faded look. She is dressed, like Adie, in a cheap
stuff, cut and trimmed by her sister in the fashion, so that
she might not look dowdy. Her gloves are worn and mended.
She has something of the air, without the meekness induced
by incessant obedience, of a nun or a Sister of Mercy. Under
her arm she carries a parcel, which Adie recognizes, with a
heart-sinking, as the packet of drawings she took away with
her in the morning.
“ You, Dr. Chacomb ?"
She put down her drawings, and held out her hand, with a
smile which suddenly brought back all her youth. She was
only twenty-seven, after all that halting-place in the growth
of womanhood where youth and beauty meet, the time when
a girl may be at her sweetest and freshest, or may be blasée
and worn out. Marion should have been at her sweetest and
freshest, but for the sad reasons of hard work, anxiety, and
insufficient food. The Princess of Fairy-land can live on
nothing; her tears nourish her, as they did the Psalmist :
her bopes sustain her; her faith cheers her. In Real-land
the Princess grows pale and weak when she has not a good
dinner every day. In her distress she lives chiefly on tea and
bread. After a while her spirits fail, her faith declines-
all for the want of proper food. Rabelais makes great
Gaster the first Master of Arts, the first great inventor, the
deviser of every art; he should have gone farther still, and
made him the nourisher, the support, stay, prop, and comfort
of love.
* You, Dr. Chacomb! It is a long time since you came to
see us last."
“ It is not my fault if I do not come oftener," said the
doctor. “ You have only to say that you like to see me.”
“Of course we like to see you. You are our last link with
the past. If it were not for you to remind us that things
were really what we remember, Adie and I should get to
believe that we had been all our lives in Lowland-street.'
“ Yes,” said Adie; “ sometimes I believe we were. Comb
Leigh seems a dream.”

She took her sister's packet of drawings, and looked
inquiringly. Marion shook her head.
“I have had a weary day, dear, and very little luck. Mr.
Burls swore, in his pretty fashion, over the forest birds, and
would not look at the wild flowers. But he has promised to
get me some work, doing curtains and backgrounds for a
portrait painter, if he can. Then I walked over Waterloo
Bridge, and saw Mr. Hermann. I think I dislike him worse
than Mr. Burls. He was not in his office, and so I came
home. Oh, I forgot to say that I waited for five hours at
Mr. Burls's, and began to copy a head for him. So I have
not wasted the day. And Adie— " She looked wistfully at
her sister.
“I have been alone all day. At six o'clock I left off work,
and went downstairs to have tea with Mr. Owen. Winifred
came home early Then Dr. Chacomb came in, and we have
been talking. Let me take the poor pictures, dear. I wish
Mr. Burls had his head between them, so that I could squeeze
it—like this—to a jelly, the horrid man, for swearing. I have
promised to see Winifred again this evening,” she added,
mendaciously. “I will leave you with Dr. Chacomb. Good
night, doctor."
Why do you reproach me with not coming, Miss Revel ?"
he began.
" You know the reason.”
“There is no reason,” she returned, with a little bitterness.
“ That is no reason at all. You asked what
you
knew
you
never could have; you were foolish 1-or were you kind? Per.
haps you only thought of my happiness, to ask. But you
might have known-surely, no one could have known better
than yourself—how utterly impossible it was. You promised
never to allude to it again.”
Dr. Chacomb waved his hand. Nothing more strongly
marked the difference between the man now and the man of
four years ago than the attitude in which he stood, the air
with which he listened, the gesture with which he received
the young lady's appeal. Everything betrayed the man of
self-possession, of experience, of reserve—the man accustomed
to converse on equal terms with those whom a former gene
ration called persons of quality. Now, anybody can be a
gentleman of Bloomsbury, of Camberwell, or even of Islington,
but it requires some adaptability to put on the air of the
middle-aged gentleman of Belgravia. As for the young geu.

self he found himself expressing sentiments that smacked of
Bohemia in the language of Bohemia; four years ago, the
gifts and graces of life were like the latter letters of the
alphabet to the algebra lecturer, his unknown quantities. He
is polished now: the same man still, but with the outward
veneer of self-control. What does it matter, perhaps, how
selfish, how cruel, how licentious your disposition may be,
provided the veneer is thick enough to prevent anybody finding
it out? And if even your wife never discovers the faults that
lie seething beneath, if her only complaint of you is that you
show_being at heart a Blue Beard for philandering, a Nero
for cruelty, and a Louis Quatorze for selfishness-a certain
lack sympathy, a strange reserve as to things holy and
good, why, civilization has done something. Success had
civilized the doctor.
He waved his hand with a gentle sweep of deprecation.
“Nay," he said, “I hardly promised never to open the
subject again. On the contrary, I came to open it to-night.”

“I believe you, Dr. Chacomb. You are a true friend.”

“ At least he hated him," said Marion. “ There is no
delusion there."
“ Yes, he hated him ; he hates his memory still. But that
is nothing; it is all part of his madness. Forget Chauncey
Chacomb, Miss Revel! The poor lunatic never did your

>>
father any harm, save in thought. He is quite innocuous ;
and if you were to go and see him, he would probably sit
down and cry."
“I could not bear to see him."
“But never mind Chauncey Chacomb; I came here to-
night on a different errand. I came to ask you, Miss Revel,
once more how long you are going to mourn over a lost
love."
“Always, Dr. Chacomb."
" It is not as if you had been married. Even then a
widowhood of four years in one so young would have been a
great deal to give."
There was an innate coarseness of feeling in the man that
success and veneer could not wholly hide, and which made
itself felt in such speeches as these. You know how vases of
a debased period still proclaim the vulgarity of their form,
however they are painted or gilded. Dr. Joseph Chacomb
considered Marion's obstinacy as something conventional and
affected, like the prolongation of her mourning by a widow
who ought rather to rejoice over her emancipation. What
was the good of it? Fish swim in the sea as good as those
which lie in the fishmonger's window. If Gerald was gone,
there were other lovers to be had, notably himself. It irri-
tated him, this constancy. And yet had be been asked to
give up Marion, had he been told that there were plenty of
girls as good as Marion in the world, he would have laughed
at the impossibility of finding one that could be to him what
Marion might be. He really loved her. Perhaps, too, there
was a little pity in his feeling towards Marion. She had been
so happy, and was now so poor. Quite selfish men very often
nurse the luxury of pity with great enjoyment, and even en-
deavour, when possible, to combine relief to the unfortunate
with more enjoyment for themselves. If, for instance, Dr.
Chacomb had come across Jephthah's daughter lamenting
among the mountains, he would have been moved to the
deepest pity by her beauty and her distress combined; while
ugly virgins in basketfuls might have wept without attract-
ing his sympathy. Most likely, after a little consideration,
he would have proposed to remove the cause of her tears by
an immediate elopement and secret marriage at the nearest
sacred grove or high-place of Baal.
“A very great deal to give," he went on. “You are young,
but you will not always be young. You have given already

I was
to the memory of that poor boy the best years of your
life.
Be reasonable, Marion."
“I try to be reasonable ; but it must be in my own way.”
“I came to see you to-night,” he went on," in order to
make one more appeal to your common sense. See, now,” he
said, with a little dropping in his voice—it was remarkable
that he did not take her hand as he had taken Adie's—“see,
Marion, you do not absolutely hate me.”
“ Indeed, I do not hate you in the least. Quite the con-
trary. I am always very glad to see you.”
“ There it is, then. Half the battle is won if you have
overcome your dislike to me. I know that when
you
first
made my acquaintance, appearances were against me.
horribly poor ; I was desperately in debt; and I had fallen
into coarse habits. All that is altered now. There is nothing
to prevent any lady from marrying me.”
She shook her head and answered nothing. It was the
second time, and she knew what would follow.
“Then it is surely something that I am getting rich more
rapidly than I could ever have hoped or expected. There is
no profession in which money accumulates faster than mine,
once you make a start. I've made a splendid start.”
“I'm very glad indeed—for your sake.”
"Be glad for your own, Marion. I wish I was a younger
and a more eloquent man, to persuade you the better. Be
glad for your own; I want you for my wife. In all the world
I don't think I have a single friend—not a man, woman, or
child to whom I can tell whatever I have on my mind.
When you are struggling, it doesn't matter; but when you
are rich and comfortable, you want a companion. It is not
good-Scripture warrant-for a man to be alone. When I
sit at home, after a dinner that a duchess-yes, a duchess-
would enjoy, I cannot drink a bottle of port as I used to four
years ago, because I must consider my nerves for the next
day's work. I hardly can smoke now. I don't care to read.
And thus it is that I want a wife to talk to me. Be my wife,
Marion.”
She shook her head again silently.
“I will be kind to you; I will indeed. You shall never
hear a harsh word from me. I will consider your wisies in
everything; you shall have the direction and ordering of the
whole house. I shall be contented to make money for you to
spend, provided I can only see you my wife.”

me,
He began to tick off on his fingers the special advantages
the might derive from a union with himself.
“Look at yourself, now-toiling and moiling for a miserable
pittance, and putting money into other people's hands. What
have
you had to eat to-day? Next to nothing. Adie told
You have actually suffered privation-you. What will
your work lead to ? More misery, more starvation, more
wretchedness for you and your sister. I offer to take you-
and her out of it all."
He ticked this off as a telling point, and went on again
after a moment's consideration. The man was tremendously
in earnest; but each sentence jarred upon the girl's nature,
and made compliance with his wish the more impossible.
“Adie, now. Do you think it right and proper that she
should be living in this style, brought up as she was ? She
is twenty years of age, as beautiful as Helen of Troy, and full
of longings for the good things of the world. Remember that
it will be your own fault if she continues to go on like this.
Why, I've known girls, out of desperation"-he stopped for
a moment—" do all sorts of things. Marion, think of Adie
before you give me up.".
Tick the second. Then he played what he thought a
stronger card.
“There is your brother Fred. He has been loafing about
town for four years, living on your exertions. Now I tell you
candidly and honestly that he will never do any work at all.
He does not want any. I know the London loafer. Every
day makes him fonder of the billiard tables, and less inclined
to work. Fred couldn't do any work if he had any to do; it
is impossible for him now, even if it was possible for him four
years ago. You will have to go on working for him as well
as for your sister. You will see him descend lower and lower
He is already at a tolerably low level. You will watch the last
pretence of trying for work disappear, and the last scruple at
depending upon your exertions; you will see the very last
flickering spark of his honour die.”
“ Dr. Chacomb ?"
It was a good blow, and he repeated it, thinking he would
drive the nail home.
“ You will see the last flickerings of his honour die out bit
by bit. He will lose all that you have admired in him. Well
if he does not bring disgrace upon your name. I offer you relief
from this infliction. I will myself provide for your brother."

The girl made him no reply, but her head sank lower.
“ Gerald is dead,” he went on—" of that be very certain.
Gerald is either dead or he has forgotten you, and his father
and the past, all of us together. Do you think that he would
not have written had he been alive? Do you still believe that
on the word of a madman, accepting a wild statement which
he never even tried to question or to prove, he would have
stayed away for four years, and made no sign? Why, any-
thing might happen. His father's life-Chauncey has got
heart disease-hangs upon a thread ; the estates might come
to me.
You might have married some one else. Nonsense!
Gerald is dead, or Gerald has ceased to think about you."
* If he has ceased to think about me, that is no reason
why I should cease to think about him," said Marion. “If
he is dead, let me mourn for him still.”
“ No, Marion.' He lowered his voice, and his eyes, under
the rolls of fat eyelids, assumed a softer light. “No, Marion,
mourn to more. You have had enough of misery and sorrow;
let the dead bury the dead. The memory
of
your
father's
death must not cloud the whole of your life. There has been
too much mourning. Come back to the world, and take your
place among the ladies of the world, the sweetest and best of
them all. I swear there is no one like you, Marion—no one
among the countesses and people—wherever I go. Come out
of this dreary and starving den, where you lie hidden and
forgotten. Good God! to think that you should dream of
going on here, and like this, for ever !”
“Not for ever," said Marion—"not for ever. There is an
end appointed
“ Yes, and it is appointed by me,” said the doctor, with an
earnestness which perhaps redeemed the audacity of the
statement. “Be my wife, Marion, and all shall be well with
you. I am hungering and thirsting for you. Come to me,
and I will make you happy. Come to me, and your sister
shall be happy. Come to me, and I will rid you of that idle,
good-for-nothing rascal, your brother."
As he spoke, the door opened, and the idle rascal himself
appeared. He had a cigar in his mouth, and stood for a
moment looking at the doctor, as if uncertain what to say.
He lifted his hat, took the cigar from his lips, and stepped in
with an air of easy dignity, such as might belong to Alcibiades
in his early days of success, wealth, and an easy conscience.
The doctor saw with admiration how handsome the young

man was, with what a fearless confidence he held his heail,
how clear and honest was the look in his eyes, how frank and
gallant was the pose of his figure. He was well dressed, too,
and wore a hat of the newest and glossiest. It was not till
after he got home that Dr. Chacomb was able to put it to
himself with indignation how, while his sisters were starving,
their brother was so fat and well-looking; how he could afford
cigars whose perfume spoke of nothing less than sixpence
a-piece; and how an idler and a loafer had the impudence to
look so independent.
“ You will rid my sister of the idle rascal, her brother,” said
Mr. Frederick Revel, quietly. “It is not the first time, sir,
that you have volunteered your advice; but I hope~ I believe,
it is the first time that you have openly insulted my sister by
abusing her brother. Leave the room, sir !"
It is one of the easiest things in the world to say; but
unless the words take effect instantly, the order has to be
repeated.
Dr. Chacomb looked at the young man as if he had not
spoken; or, rather, he looked through him, fixing his eyes
thoughtfully on a sketch upon the wall behind him.
“ Leave the room, Dr. Chacomb, unless you wish to go
through the window.”
“Fred !" cried Marion. "Dr. Chacomb for Heaven's sake!”
“ Miss Revel,” said the latter, “I will call and see you
again, when we shall not be interrupted. There will be no
going through the window, so far as I am concerned.”
“Understand, sir," cried Fred, fiercely-no one, not even
the laziest of lazzaroni, likes to be called an idle rascal —" that
· I object to your coming to this house at all.”
“I thought,” said the doctor, with a smile,“ that the
lodgings were taken, and-and, in fact, paid for by the exer-
tions of your sister. Perhaps I was wrong,"
“I object to your presence here; I will not have it.
My
sisters are under my care and protection.”
He looked for the moment as if it really was by the labour
of his hands that they were housed and maintained.
“Your care and protection ?” Dr. Chacomb shook his head
slowly. “They have done great things for the young ladies.
They provide your sisters with good lodgings, companionship
of their own class, plentiful food, and abundance of pocket
money"
The young man interrupted him with an impatient gesture.

“Your sisters ought to be, and are, no doubt, infinitely
obliged to you.
Mr. Frederick Revel, do not talk nonsense.
You must try bounce with other people. Remember, sir, the
time will come when even the self-sacrifice of a sister will fail
you, when the devotion that has kept you in idleness so long
will be tired out, and when your own petty tricks to keep up
the appearance of a gentleman will break down. Miss Revel,
you will not forget what I said. You have but to order me,
and I will free you of the burden”-he spoke very slowly,
shaking his finger at Fred" of this idle, good-for-nothing,
spendthrift brother of yours."
Marion held out her hand. Frederick threw himself into
a chair, with a futile effort to preserve his dignity.
“Do not," Marion murmured—“do not be hard on poor
Fred. We are as we are—what God made

CHAPTER XV.
The starving poet whom Pope in England, Boileau, Saint
Amant, and Regnier in France, have held up to the derision
of posterity, lived in a garret, sometimes sharing his pallet
(whatever a pallet may be) with a fellow in starving aspira-
tion. Many an unfortunate young gentleman, with a turn
for imitative scribbling and a capacity for idleness, has
imagined that to be uncomfortably poor and to live in a
garret are necessary conditions of the poetic life in its em.
bryo. This belief sweetens the water of affliction, and spreads
the crust of poverty with Sicilian honey. It is, therefore,
useful. Chatterton, Savage, Béranger, Mürger—the name is
legion of those who have lived at the top of the house in their
youth, though not all have survived that period and come
down. But there comes a time when the imagination takes
sober tints, and expectation of success changes into certainty
of defeat. Then the poet curses his garret, with all that
thereto appertains——the narrow limits of its four walls, the
stairs which lead to it, the wind which blows down the
chimney, the wretched furniture which helps to make it un-
lovely, the prospect from the chimney tops, his own bad luck
in being born a bard.
Mr. Richard Carew-whose character might be gathered
from the simple fact that his friends always called him Dicky

147
and nothing else, so that had there been a thousand Richards
in the field, or rather at the public-house bar, there would
have been but one Dicky-was arrived at the time in the life
of a genius when the early hopes have been blighted, and
disappointment has been accepted. He is thirty years of age,
and certainly as poor as when he began, perhaps poorer,
because his wardrobe is more scanty. He has been in the
profession for ten years, during which time the heartless
world has allowed him to remain in the garret where first he
slung his hammock. He has now—the bitterest blow of all-
come to disbelieve in his own genius. He has left off trying.
That is fatal. So long as you continue to write there is hope
-qui scribit laborat; glimpses of true art are caught by him
who is always copying or endeavouring to draw, however
thin be the vein and Minerva unwilling; felicities of expres-
sion come of their own accord to him who continuously writes,
like a happy combination of colours to him who shakes up
the kaleidoscope long enough. Dicky, however, has for the
last three or four years forgotten the ambition which led him
to abandon the usher's desk at a Devonshire provincial
academy, and change it for the garret of a genius. He has
sold the little library of great authors whom once he studied.
He reads no more except to copy; he writes no more, except
to perform, with as little trouble as may be, the daily task.
The place is in Lowland-street, twj doors from No. 15.
The garret already alluded to is not the apartment one would
choose for luxury. It is long and narrow, with a sloping
roof. It is furnished with a contempt of luxury worthy ol
Diogenes. Although the residence of a literary man, there
are no books in it; and although the home of a genius, there
are no sheets of writing-paper on the one table. Perhaps,
however, he works with his brain. The place is low and
close, in spite of the chimney, which acts as a ventilator. It
contains a chair or two, a chest of drawers, a table, and an
iron bedstead, whose sheets and pillows are crying aloud for

room is lying on his back in the bed, with his hands joined
under his head, and his eyes wide open.
“I suppose,” he growls, “ that the longer I stay iu beda
the hungrier I shall get. Why can't a man sleep it off ?”
He got out of bed with an air of disgust, and began to
dress. Dicky Carew boasted a shock crop of red hair, a face
which would have been a figure-head of health but for the

redness of his nose, and a profusion of whiskers which stood
out on either cheek, imparting to what Nature intended for
the emblem of meekness the look of extreme ferocity.
If it were fair, which it certainly is not, to reveal the secrets
of a gentleman's toilet, one might illustrate the simple severity
of Mr. Carew's manner by one or two striking particulars.
Some children of the present luxurious generation, for instance,
would be too proud to wash their only pocket handkerchief
with their own hands. Dicky was not. He whistled, indeed,
over his task, with the ease and freedom which a happy con-
science imparts to an habitual duty. It might even have
been objected that he spent more time in washing the linen
than in washing himself.
“The consumption of soap is awful,” he murmured, looking
at the wasted cake. “I must really get to the Museum early
to-morrow"--a non sequitur at first sight as profound as the
celebrated typical case of Stoney Stratford, except to the
initiated few.
A daily inspection of his wardrobe was necessitated by
reason of its extreme scantiness; for Dicky, like Diogenes,
St. Francis, or St. Anthony, scorned to spend money on
raiment and fine linen. Still, it is known to all that seams
will separate in which we have too long placed our trust;
buttons will fail on which, forgetful of the mortality of perish.
able things, we have relied too confidently; edges in con-
spicuous places will fray and fringe.
He looked first at the heels of his boots, and groaned
aloud; they were worn to their junction with the upper
leathers. The thought forced itself upon his mind that in a
day or two it would be absolutely necessary to have them
heeled, or even to reject them altogether.
“I've read of a Frenchman,” he said, “who discovered that
his boots wore out on the pavements of Paris as fast under a
Republic as an Empire. I believe the free institutions of
England are more fatal than either to the heels of boots.
Where can I get the money for new heels ? I wish there
was another Revolution."
He observed that his trousers showed signs of unforeseen
decay about the knees, and his heart sank.
“ Show me,” he said, almost fiercely, “the capitalist who
can afford two new pairs of second-hand machine-made
reach-me-downs in a single winter. Where is he, I wav :
Produce him.”

His coat, which was originally a black walking coat of
fashionable cut, had been for some months slowly turning
green. Dicky laid it over a chair where it could catch the full
effect of the sunshine, and retired a few steps to watch the
effect.
“It's beautiful,” he said, “regarded as an effort of Nature
in her most sympathetic mood, and as something to talk
about for people who've got what art critics call the 'vivid
passion of sight.' The coat is better altogether than Joseph's.
išo such depth of light and shadow could be got out of a coat
of many colours. You want a single shade, such as green,
growing out of an originally black ground, but in different
pradations; a touch of green on a foundation of black, in
places where the nap gets rubbed off between the shoulders-
those Museum chairs do wear the shoulders shamefully;
where it buttons across the chest, a pale green with a lustrous
shimmer ; where it's simply shiny, the right cuff for example,
it's like a piece of imitation Bohemian glass; the deeper
artistic feeling comes out in the folds of the tail as it hangs
gracefully from the figure. If all the world were artists ; if
everybody had the æsthetic eye of a -a-Nicolas Poussin, one
would wear that coat with pleasure and pride. As it is, I
should like to have a new one, and I can't get it.”
He investigated his pockets one after the other. There
was a penny in one, some loose tobacco in another, a pipe in
a third, a pencil with some paper for notes in a fourth.
“I have heard-or did I read it once when I used to read
books ?-of a man who found a half-sovereign in his waist-
coat pocket. Perhaps-no, there's no half-sovereign there.
As for breakfast, I must go without. I shall be able to raise
a couple of shillings from old Lilliecrip, I dare say. That
will carry me through the day. Eleven o'clock, Lilliecrip at
twelve, writing till three-nothing to eat till half-past, even
if I do get the two shillings.
“ Now if I had only not gone to the Harmonic last night-
only not gune—my head would have been clearer this morn-
ing, and there would have been five shillings in my pocket
instead of a penny. What's the good of a penny ?”
He took it out and held it
up
disconsolately.
“ A bronze penny. In the good old days, a penny had its
value; it was a good lump of copper ; you could buy things
with it. England has never been merry England since
copper pennies went out."

The clock chimed the half-hour. He took his bat.
"I may as well go," he said. “ There is not much to
make one linger in this retreat.”
He twirled his hat thoughtfully.
“What a hat for a gentleman and a genius! It was a
Lincoln and Bennett once, and figured on the stage. I believe
Toole played in it. Ah, it looked very different in its youth,
I dare say. It was glossy and black, for certain; now it's
shiny and brown. It used to be brushed regularly, no doubt;
now it's a very dangerous thing to brush it. I am sure it
must have had a stiff brim both before and behind ; now it's
so limp that it can't be taken off except from the top, like a
priest's biretta. It was once of fashionable build-Lord!
Lord! who would think so now? I should date that hat, I
think, at 1860, or thereabouts.”
He put it on his head, a little to one side—which gives, as
every one knows, from the commander-in-chief to yesterday's
recruit, a smart and even a rakish air ; put up his note-book,
felt for his pencil and keys, took from the corner a coloured
cane-quite a gentlemanly cane, which was the pride of his
heart, and which he handled as delicately as a Life Guards-
man on a Sunday afternoon-and went downstairs.
On the second floor he stopped, looked doubtful, shook
his head, and tapped at the door. A voice replied, and he
entered.
“ You needn't trouble to ask me this morning, Mr. Carew,"
said a querulous voice; “I've got no money to lend, or to
give, or to throw away.”
The voice came from an easy-chair by the fireside, where
a very old woman sat propped up with pillows.
My dear madam,” said Dicky, with the sweetest manner
in the world, “I am sure I never thought of borrowing even
a sixpence of you; I am only anxious to repay you the small
sums which let me see"-he produced his note-book-"it
was-how much was it?"
“Three pound four and tenpence."
“Let us say, between friends, and to make it round money,
three pounds five," said Dicky, making a careful note of it.
“My aunt from Westmoreland is coming to town, I expect,
in a day or two. She will"
“I don't believe you've got an aunt in Westmoreland at
all,” returned the lady in the chair. “ Whenever you owa
me money it's your aunt in Westmoreland.”

“My dear madam," Dick replied, with unction, “ig
it possible you mistrust me, your old friend, Richard
Carew? You must be unwell; you suffer this morning, poor
dear. Let me shake up the pillows." He crossed the room
delicately, and adjusted the cushions of the great chair in
which the old woman sat propped. “ Poor dear soul !
yet there's the look of youth in her eyes still.”
“Go away, do," said the old woman. “My granddaughter
told me when she went to rehearsal this morning not to lend
you another sixpence if you was to beg for it on 1 your
bended
knees.”
“I did not come to borrow," said Mr. Carew.

not deny—come, now, deny it if you can—that your eyes

Perhaps they did, Mr. Carew, perhaps they did,” she re-
plied, twinkling and mollified.

me, I played with the infant Roscius_ at Drury Lane: I was
the Player Queen to his Hamlet. Eyes ? Ay, to be sure.
Why not? Fellows were fellows, then, too."
They were,” said Dicky; " I've read of them. Gad,
ma'am, I was born too late. Those hands, too. What deli-
cacy in the shaping of the taper fingers ! Blood shown in the
almond nails—"
“ Very likely,” said the old lady, looking complacently at
her withered old fingers. “My mother was on the stage
before me.”
“Ah! Possibly-who knows?—Royal blood; pearly nails;
pink and rosy palm. Don't think I only come to borrow
money, ma'am. When hollow hearts-you remember Byron ?”
“I used to know him.”

once or twice already, be lying ready for the borrower's

Outside the door he winked and smiled, and shook his head
a great many ways.

I've had out of her. Memory seems going at last. On Sunday
it was four pounds eight and sixpence. She's forgotten one

“Do you"
pound three, as near as I calculate it. Now, that's all clear
gain.”
On the ground floor he tapped again. There was no
answer, so he opened the door uninvited, and looked in. A
comely woman of forty-five was busily ironing, crooning a
tune all to herself the while. She looked up in his face with
a pleasure which was quite unaffected and real.
Why, Mr. Carew,” she said, “I thought you were out
and about hours ago. I haven't seen you, not these
three days."
“I have been composing, Mrs. Medlar," he replied, "since
daybreak."
He pzessed his hand upon his forehead and sighed heavily.
“Lor! and poetry too, I dare say.”
“Poetry it was," said the mendacious one.
"-Mrs. Medlar sat down before the fire with the
hot iron in her hand, occasionally tapping it with the point
of her finger, lest it should take advantage of the position to
get cold—“do you feel that it exhausts you very much,
Mr. Carew? I have heard now, from a gentleman that used
to deal at my husband's shop-poet for a tooth-powder and
perfumery in quite a large way of business, he was—that
what with the rhymes, and the names, and the ideas, it was
sometimes enough to make him feel as if he must take a little
something, or drop.”
Mr. Carew staggered, but caught the back of a chair for
support.
“Those were the lower flights,” he said, in a sinking voice.
“Efforts like mine, Mrs. Medlar, are attended with more
trying consequences. At this moment, I feel, I really do
feel, as if I had not even breakfasted. Now you'll laugh at
that, I suppose.'
This statement, at least, was true.
"Poetry seems like ironing, almost," said the lady. “You
work on and on, never thinking, and all of a sudden dow)
you drop. I was just feeling a little faintish myself wher
you
knocked.”
Dicky groaned.
“ Those who lead public opinion must suffer," he said.
“ There are martyrs to literature of whom the world knows
nothing."
“ Poor dear !" said Mrs. Medlar. “I know what it is to
work, and get the reputation, and that, and all the while no

;
one thinking of your poor insides. I've seen my own brother
come home from leading a West-end funeral as limp as that
thread paper, and as green as a cucumber. He was one of
them as wants constant support, little and good. The honour
and glory of the funerals was not enough, he used to say, to
make up for the fatigues and the long waiting. Some of
them took biscuits in their pockets, but he'd never give in to
it-he had that feeling for the look of things. The sinkin',
he used to say, gave him the real mournful look."
Dicky looked round the room. It was a comfortable room,
combining the requisites of kitchen, dining-room, and salon;
for Mrs. Medlar was a widow with a property of her own, and
of an orderly and saving disposition. But it was not the
furniture-for with this Mr. Carew was already tolerably
familiar—which attracted his attention so much as the shelves
above the sideboard. On the lowest of these was a plate, half
covered with a basin; and on this his eyes were riveted.
"Excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs. Medlar," he said,
with a winning smile of perfectly disinterested curiosity;
"but is there-do I see in that plate-sausages ? Really, now,
they are sausages. Do you know, my dear soul, that I feel
as if a fried sausage, well browned and crisp, was the one
thing that I want at this moment to pull myself together."
“Then," said Mrs. Medlar, rising with alacrity, “why
didn't you say so at once? A sausage you shall have, and
two if
you
like.”
“Generous heart !" muttered Dicky, taking a seat, and
stroking his chin while he gently wagged his head. “O,
woman, at the hour of tea, a ministering angel she. My own
lines, Mrs. Medlar. I will finish the whole poem when I have
time, and dedicate it to you."
“If it was only the hour of tea, Mr. Carew.”
By this time the sausages were in the frying-pan. • Only
the hour of tea.” Evidently her words had a meaning not on
the surface.
Ministering angel! If you were Mrs. Carew, it should
never be anything but the hour of tea all day long."
She turned the sausages and looked round at him with a
smile. Mrs. Medlar's face was a compound of good-nature
and shrewdness. She knew pretty well what her literary
friend wanted, and she was resolved to keep a tight hold of
it for herself-namely, her little income. She knew, too, that
Mr. Carew was at best but a humble member of the pro

Session; she could not but compare his worn and seedy raiment
with the gorgeous apparel in which her late husband rejoiced ;
she saw very well that Dicky was often partially, and even
sometimes wholly, intoxicated; she had, on one lamentable
occasion, helped him to bed with her own hands. Now the
defunct had never returned the worse for liquor, except on
proper and expected occasions, such as an Odd Fellows' feast.
It was quite certain, again, that Dicky had no money in the
bank. All her notions of things right, things respectable,
things becoming, were upset by the bebaviour of this Bohe-
mian. And yet she liked him. He came at irregular intervals
and made love to her, borrowing half-crowns which he never
repaid ; he made the most solemn protestations of affection
when he was in distress, and in moments-literally moments
-of affluence he forgot to tap at her door at dewy morn or
balmy eve, and left her as neglected as Horace's Lydia. And
yet she liked him: it did her good to have the vagabond with
her and to scold him; it soothed her to hear his tale of love,
the only thing in which she believed him. He came generally
in the evening when he had no money, and therefore nowhere
else to go, and sat drinking whatever she gave him-con-
tentedly, it must be owned; for Dicky's tastes were catholic,
and so long as the liquid had any, even the least, intoxicating
qualities, he was happy in consuming it. They tell a story of
à Lincolnshire farmer who was accustomed to get drunk
every night off brandy and water, and who paid a visit to a
Somersetshire cousin. To his astonishment, the cider offered
for the evening refreshment produced no effect; and after the
twentieth tumbler he was heard to moan, “This is weary,
weary work.” Dicky Carew would never have found any
weariness, provided the right conclusion the state of drunken-
ness, in fact-might be seen in the dim future. But yet the
widow liked him.
“ Tea!” she repeated, dishing up.
“ If I were to offer you
either tea or mild ale at this moment, which would you take ?”
“Generally, I should say tea," said the poet; “but after
my labours of this morning, which have made me nervous, it
would be better for me to take mild ale."
She gave him a shilling, and pointed to a jug. He dis-
appeared, and presently returned with a comfortable head of
foam upon the vessel. She noticed, with a quiet smile, that
he neglected to give her back the change. It was a forgetful
way he had.

He sat down to the sausages while his hostess cut his bread.
A pound of sausages, as every man knows who has lived in
chambers and had dealings with Mr. Tucker or Mr. Prosser,
consists of six. Mrs. Medlar had fried four. These rapidly
disappeared; but instead of grace after meat, Dicky's eyes
wandered from the empty dish to the two remaining sausages,
looking as innocent as babies and as attractive as infant pig
in their clean white skins. It was a mute appeal, but it was
unsuccessful; for Mrs. Medlar, to place herself beyond tempta-
tion, put them away on the top shelf.
Now, Mr. Carew, take your beer. Leave me just one
glass for my own dinner, and then you may go away.”
He took the jug with both hands, and slowly tilted it up-
wards. When it finally left his lips-it was always a subject
of regret with Dicky that he was obliged to take breath twice
in a quart—it was empty. He anticipated any reproaches
that might fall from the widow's lips by seizing his hat with
one hand, and her own fingers with the other.
“Affectionate and self-denying nature," he murmured,
* when we are married-'
“Married, indeed!" said Mrs. Medlar, trying to snatch her
hand away, and wounded in her tenderest feelings at the
absorption of all the beer. “Married, indeed! When will
that be?”
“The days," he continued, "shall be one everlasting round
of sausages, beer, frying-pans, and ironing. You resemble
Diana when you fry, and recall the statues of Juno when you
iron. And when you drink beer, I am reminded of Venus,
who was born of the foam.”
What he meant was not clearly comprehended by Mrs.
Medlar ; but it was intended, and therefore was taken, for a
compliment.
“ If you meant it,” she said; “ but there, you don't. You
tell the same tale to a dozen women. As for flattery, I believe
you could flatter a donkey's hind leg off. I like a man to be
real, I do."
“Flattery! O, Mrs. Medlar-may I say, Almina ?"—this
was her baptismal name. “ Almina ! . When hollow hearts
shall wear a mask, will break your own to see; Then dearest,
pray, your conscience ask, if that takes after me. I wrote
the lines this morning, thinking of you; and yet you talk of
dattery. But farewell; when a few more moons have worked
their baleful vill upon this fragile form and laid it in the dust,

Carew;
you, as well as the nation, my Almina, will know what you
have lost. For the sausages,” he added, in a tragic voice,
pulling his hat as hard over his eyes as the limpness of the
brim would allow—" for the sausages and the beer, madam,
I thank thee.”
Ah," she said to herself when he was gone,
“it's all very
well, Mr. but
you don't get over me this way. Before
we go to the altar, if ever we do go, I shall make the lawyer
tie me up fast and make no mistake. Let me keep my own
to myself, and then we'll see about marrying. I believe he's
artful enough to make love to one of the young ladies at
No. 15, where he goes every day. He'd better not; if he
does, I'll County Court him. He's good company, too. Pity
he drinks. But, Lord, after all, it would be a poor tale to
drag round with a feller that can't keep out of the public,
and only because he's good company.".
The object of her thoughts, refreshed and strengthened,
was on his way to No. 15.
“It was providential,” he said, “ quite providential, that I
did not get up when I woke up first. At the very best it
would have been tea and bread-and-butter with Mrs. Medlar,
and now it's been sausages and beer.”
Arriving immediately at No. 15, he assumed a businesslike
air, straightening his back and throwing his head well up.
He proceeded slowly up the stairs to the second floor, at
which he knocked, and entered with quite a new manner.
Dicky had several at command. With Mrs. Medlar he was
the hard-worked, sentimental, struggling man of genius;
with the employer to whom he gave a part of every day, he
was the careful and mechanical amanuensis; with Marion
Revel, whom he adored at a distance, he was the melancholy
and disappointed student; with Adie and Winifred, he was
the dashing and high-spirited young bachelor; with Fred he
put on the semblance of a Lothario and man of fashion in
disguise-his seediness was temporary, his pecuniary em-
barrassments were the result of reckless expenditure, the
humility of his position was merely parenthetical; with his
companions of the British Museum and the evening harmonic
meeting he was a jovial, daredevil fellow, whose spirits were
always at fever-heat, likely to stick at nothing, who considered
himself the greatest of living writers, though as yet he had
failed to convince the world of the fact, and who looked
forward to a proud and glorious future. In none of these

157
disguises could he succeed in deceiving a single person except
bimself, on account of his unfortunate habit of getting drunk
whenever he possessed or could borrow the necessary money.
And when, after the usual amount of gin-and-water, Dicky's
brain grew clear, but his power over it weak, so that fiction
gave way to reality, he appeared in a uniform, simple, and
consistent character: its fidelity of colouring in the less attrac-
tive details grew sometimes monotonous, and an excess of repe-
tition was even irksome to his audience: for he then showed
himself what he actually was, a good-for-nothing scamp who
had once dreamed great things, and failed to accomplish even
small things. He had grievances in the shape of coups manqués
-splendid dreams which had come to nothing. He lamented
the past, wept over the present, and groaned at the prospect
of the future. Dicky's friends began by laughing at him ;
they ended by finding him a bore. He had, it is true, one or
two redeeming points : he was generous, provided his gene-
rosity was not exercised so far as to cause him to give up
present enjoyment; he was kind-hearted, inasmuch as, if he
were to marry Mrs. Medlar, he would spend her money but
not ill-treat her; and he had a touch of humour of a pleasant
if a common type.
His income, an extremely precarious one, was derived from
two or three sources. He contributed paragraphs, literally
at a penny a line, to the Weekly Intelligence, a paper with an
immense circulation, whose proprietor had narrow views as
to the marketable value of literary merit. This paper was
remarkable for the bold and startling views it advocated on
the subject of religious reform, as well as for a rooted anti-
pathy to the monarchical and aristocratic institutions of the
country. He was also connected with a small weekly sheet
called the Christian Clerk, which was at once Anglican,
Evangelical, and Conservative. For this paper he wrote
short articles of an improving and constitutional tendency.
These he got from the works of a few forgotten divines of the
last century preserved in the British Museum. And from
the two sources together, taking one week with another, he
probably contrived to make as much as seventeen skillings a
week. As his lodging only cost him four shillings and
sixpence, that left him twelve and sixpence for living, luxuries,
and the comforts of life. But he had another resource.

certain Mr. Lilliecrip, of eccentric manners and retiring
customs. Dicky Carew went daily, excepting Saturdays, to
Mr. Lilliecrip's lodgings, and there, closeted with the tenant
from twelve to half-past two or three, wrote at his dictation,
What he wrote, or what he did there, he was bound, under
the most tremendous oaths, and penalties almost Masonic,
never to reveal. For the services thus rendered he received
the honorarium of fifteen shillings weekly. This, therefore,
brought his weekly income available for la nourriture to
twenty-seven shillings and sixpence. He never bought any
clothes unless he was absolutely obliged; and as a gentleman
can always get enough to eat, counting breakfast, dinner,
and supper, for eighteenpence a day as a maximum, it follows
that Dicky had exactly seventeen shillings a week to spend
in drink. And he nobly spent it all. He drank in the
morning, at noon, and at night. He drank whenever he
could. He had been three years with Mr. Lilliecrip, and
during the whole of that time that gentleman had never once
offered him, Dicky used to reflect with indignation, even so
much as a glass of pale ale.
“ You are late," said Mr. Lilliecrip, looking at his watch;
"a quarter of an hour late, sir, and time presses. Let us
begin at once.”
CHAPTER XVI.
“You are late, Mr. Carew," said Mr. Lilliecrip, severely;
a whole quarter of an hour late."
Dicky's employer was sitting at a table, a pile of manu-
scripts before him, which he was annotating and correcting.
He lifted his head, showing a face perfectly pale and colour-
less. It was a long face, and there was plenty of it, because
the cheeks and chin were hairless, while on the lip was a
heavy white moustache. His hair was long and silvery
white; his features were of a kind you do not easily forget,
being straight and regular ; his forehead was high, but
narrow; the upper part of his nose had that very delicate
carving which goes with persons of strong artistic tendencies,
but little sympathy; his eyes were clear and bright, but
rather shifty. It was a face still extremely handsome, though
its owner was well on the shady side of sixty, and might in
youth, when the expression would be a little different, hava

159
been of wonderful beauty. But it was a face of which
Dicky, at least, was heartily weary. Its changeless set regu-
larity, in which not a wrinkle or a crow's-foot but seemed in
its appointed place, was a kind of nightmare to him. Нө
hated this man, who was his chief support; he loathed this
daily task of sitting at the table and writing, without being
allowed to say a word himself, or to ask a question, at his
master's dictation; he kicked against the decrees of Fate
which bound him to Mr. Lilliecrip's rooms; he envied those
happier brethren who were able to lounge all day in the
reading-room of the Museum. But though he dared not
rebel openly, in secret he nursed daring plans of revenge, and
would imagine, while he was writing, little dramas, in which
Mr. Lilliecrip and himself were the only figures. The former
was at his mercy; he should implore for pardon-Dicky
never clearly made out in his own mind how the situation
was to be worked up to—and should be spurned with con.
tumely. He should pray for a day's grace, and should be
reminded bitterly, but with overwhelming dignity, of his
lond: “ The bond and no more-give me the bond." He
should be dismissed into misery with the mocking laugh of
revenge. There was a story which Dicky had once read, of
a man who, for some unexplained reason of his own, hounded
down and persecuted another, following him from one scene
of distress to another, and thence to a worse, with an insatiable
thirst of revenge. This story Dicky appropriated to himself,
and used to rehearse it mentally while he wrote. His
imagination was as active as his brain was lazy; and while
his fingers moved mechanically, whole dramas were working
themselves out in his mind, consisting entirely of separate
tableaux without any connecting plot.
Come," said Mr. Lilliecrip, “ let us go on.”
Dicky took up his pen, adjusted the blotting pad, and waited.
Mr. Lilliecrip slowly rose, and began to walk up and down
the room with hands behind his back. Dicky recommenced
the melodrama of revenge where he had left it off the day
before; but his eye, as mild as that of
milch cow, only
showed habitual attention to the words for which he waited,
while his fingers expressed by their attitude an eagerness to
begin, almost bordering on enthusiasm.

it disclosed a shirt front of irreproachable fit and brilliant
whiteness, set with small diamond studs ; his neck was adorned
with a collar, in which was a tiny black ribbon in the neatest
of bows; his hands were small and white—the hands of a
gentleman. As he passed at each turn before the looking
glass on the mantelshelf, he stopped and looked at himself
with the complacency of self-satisfaction. His figure was
tall, thin, and stooping; his expression was cold, self-con-
tained, and repellent of familiarity; his step was firm and
elastic.
“Where did I leave off yesterday ?” he said. “Let me
consider.”
“ We were with William the Fourth, sir," said his secretary.
“ With William the Fourth. I was engaged on that part
of my personal recollections which are concerned with William
the Fourth. Yes, yes."
He looked in the glass, and carefully brushed off a tiny
speck of dust which had settled on his nose. Then he resumed
his walk, thinking. Dicky sat motionless, pen in hand. Once,
two years before, he had ventured to blow his nose during a
period of silence, but had been so pointedly invited to disturb
Mr. Lilliecrip outside, and on his way up, rather than in the
room, that he dared no longer so much as to cough.
For fourteen long years this man had never left the two
rooms in which he lived; for fourteen years he had lived a
perfectly lonely and solitary life. There was but one man,
besides his secretary, with whom he sometimes exchanged a
word--Mr. Khyl Owen-who went for him, under promises
of strictest secrecy, to a certain lawyer at monthly periods for
money. He spent every evening of his self-tormenting life,
and almost the whole day, absolutely alone; and he chose
for his retreat a shabby genteel second floor in the heart of
London. Why?
And yet he was not unhappy. The sturdy health he enjoyed,
the clearness of his eye, the steadiness of his nerves, the cold-
ness of his manner, showed that he was happy in his own way.
Why had he left the world ? He was no self-starving ascetic;
that was clear from the appearance of a kitchener complete
in all its parts, with a bright array of stewpans, pots, and
culinary apparatus, for which his servant, a woman, brought
him every morning, before he was up, and set out in readiness
for him, a basket with the day's provisions. In the evening
she came again, and put his dishes in the cupboard out of his

sight for him. His bookshelves contained half a dozen works
on cookery; the rest were all French novels, chiefly new ones ;
and with these and the periodicals, the Hermit found enough
to read. His day was uniform, and perhaps monotonous : he
took breakfast at ten; at twelve his secretary worked with
him till half-past two or three; till six or so he was busy
preparing his own dinner, to which he devoted his whole
mind. After eating it and taking a glass or two of claret, his
evening was free for reading. He was, it will be seen, a
i recluse of quite a different stamp from those of history. Nor
was he without other amusements. A chess table stood in
the window, on which he would work out problems and send
them to papers.
He had a piano, on which he discoursed
with sufficient skill, but without pretensions to artistic cul-
tivation, and he amused himself sometimes with making
water-colour sketches. The subjects of these--as Dicky knew,
having often seen them on the table-were all variations of
a single theme. They represented military life in various
phases. There were the awkward squad, the church parade,
the regimental steeplechase, the garrison ball, the mess-room,
the billiard table; and there was besides a picture which
Mr. Lilliecrip painted again and again. The treatment varied
and the figures, but the background was always the same-
cold, snow, and ice; a handful of men, sometimes one man
alone, wrapped in great coats and armed, creeping warily to
trench work; among them always one tall and handsome
young man, in whom Dicky recognized his employer, the
mysterious Hermit of Lowland-street.
A battle-piece hung upon the wall; over the mantelshelf
was a sword; these were further proofs that the solitary had
beon in the army. Why, then, had he taken a hatred to the
world and left it ?
Perhaps he did not hate it: the papers and periodicals
proved that he took an interest in what went on. The latest
Army List on the table showed that he followed the promotion
of his old officers; and what was the meaning of those piles of
manuscript which he was perpetually reading, dictating, and
correcting? And yet he hid himself, so jealously hid himself
that high and close wire blinds were adjusted to the windows
to prevent his face being visible to the street or the opposite
houses. He appeared to deny himself in nothing. A box of
cigars, of a choice brand, stood on his sideboard; a row of
pipes were in the rack; with them a jar, the end of whosa

being—the holding of tobacco-was accomplished, and the
room had a fine and constant perfume of smoking. There
was a spirit case; and once, the door of the sideboard having
been left open, Dicky caught sight of a pile of bottles, some
of them with silver tops.
“Champagne!” he murmured, with bated breath. It was
a drink which he often dreamed of, but had never tasted, even
in its humbler forms. And if the man was so rich as to
afford all these luxuries, why did he live in Lowland-street ?
Why did he live alone ? And why, Dicky thought with indig-
nation and sorrow, why did he give a paltry fifteen shillings
a week to his secretary?
“I was at William the Fourth-yes-ascended the throne
1830, and died 1837. Of course. Are you ready?"
"Quite ready, sir."
“ The first time I saw the Duke of Clarence was in the
year 1818, when I was myself a child of eight. I was in the
Park with my mother, an old friend and sincere well-wisher
of the royal and gallant sailor. He took me in his arms on
being told who I was; pressing me to his breast, his royal
highness, who was remarkably fond of children, said: 'A
damned fine child-a monstrous great boy—a chip of the old
block. I congratulate you, Lady
; on your son.' As he
put me down I felt a tear fall upon my cheek—one of the few
That William the Fourth was ever known to shed. I did not
know then that my father and he had been fellow-midshipmen
many years before. The Duke of Clarence never forgot an
old comrade.”
Dicky wrote down this interesting and illustrative anecdote
with a sense of greatness being thrust upon him. He was in
the
presence of a man who had been in the arms of royalty.
He instinctively gathered up his feet under the chair, so as to
hide the state of his heels, which were really not fit for the
companion of kings to see, and listened for more.
“The next time was in the year '36. His Majesty was
pleased to send for me, being informed that I was in the
neighbourhood of Windsor. I found him on the slopes, and
he conversed with me for half an hour, chiefly on questions
connected with the state of the army, a subject in which he
was supposed to take little interest. Opposed as I was to his
Majesty's rigid conservatism, I felt myself obliged to ask per-
mission to state my views at length. This he granted, and
dismissed me, after hearing them, with every mark of gracious

for a
condescension. I feel bound to say that on this, as on every
other occasion, I found William the Fourth most affable,
clear-headed, and intelligent; and I bear witness the more
readily to this effect, because detractors have sneered at his
Majesty's abilities: these were, in reality, of no common
order. 'I had at one time the idea of writing a political history
of the reign of William the Fourth, but was deterred by the
private nature of much of the information which I should
have used.
History is based upon lies, and it is impossible to get at
the truth. That is only known to the diplomatist, who never
talks : it dies with him. When I was in Vienna, Metternich
confessed to me the whole secret history of the campaign of
1815, which I shall write as soon as I find time. Who would
have guessed that Waterloo was a put-up thing?
“Wellington I knew well. He was very fond of entertaining
me, during long evening talks, with stories about Napoleon's
generals. His opinion of them greatly varied. Marmont, he
said, was a devil of a fellow. Massena kept him awake at
night. Soult never made him forget to say
his
prayers
week. ‘Gad!' he used to say, even you would have had
your work cut out with Soult.' He thought a great deal more
perhaps than I really deserved of my personal courage and
military genius. It was generous of him.
"Talleyrand was excessively fond of boiled pork, broad
beans, and pease pudding. He told me once, dining at the
Austrian Embassy, that he could have wished to be an
Englishman, in order to enjoy the oftener what he considered
our national food. It is not generally known that he ordered
it to be served every day, when beans were in season.
“Sir Robert Peel, Lord George Bentinck, Bulwer Lytton,
Lord Melbourne, and I, were once taking supper after a late
debate. After midnight, we set ourselves to foretelling the
future, a thing which the military diplomatist alone can do
with certainty. It is now thirty years ago, and I remember,
though I do not boast of it, that I foretold exactly the war
between Germany and France, being only out a trifle in the
year: I placed that too soon. Bentinck, who was really a man
of the highest genius, prophesied that very same evening the
escape of the prisoner of Ham and the beginning of the
end for Louis Philippe. Could Ezekiel himself have done
more?
“When these men died, England had no great men left

mies in comparison with the school to which they belonged.
The great art of the diplomatist, according to their traditions,
was to know the exact moment to invent- to invent with
freedom and facility, and to invent with a truthful face. I
have often heard poor Lord George declare that an evening
with Austrian and French diplomatists was like a short
campaign ; everything depended upon the accurate gauge
of your adversary's truth. Have you taken that down cor-
rectly, Mr. Carew po

bourne.'
Dicky obeyed, and-his thoughts wandering-proceeded
to write without catching the meaning of the words. The
drama in his mind meanwhile was going on. “Spare me,
Carew—spare me ! You have the secret of my life ; you
have in your power the honour of a house; you can blight a
noble name.
Be merciful as you are strong.".
This was the masterpiece of Dick's imagination, and a part
of the duologue with which he amused his weary occupation.
He was writing something quite different, but no doubt it
was almost as great nonsense.
"There was a time, old man, when you spurned the humble
amanuensis. He came up thirsty; you had champagne in
the cupboard, and there was a refreshing tap at the nearest
corner, but you offered him neither ale nor wine. His boots
were down at heel, and you had not the humane generosity
to present him with a new pair; he was hard up, and you
knew it, and never raised his pay. Old man, I'll have my
bond !”
A cry was heard, which reached from St. James's
Palace to the lonely smoking-room of the club where the
disappointed peer sat brooding: 'Long live our youthful
Queen! He sprang to his feet and uttered a cry of grati-
tude. Is that down ? Take care; these are among the most
precious of my
recollections."
He spoke in a slow and deliberate manner throughout, so
at his secretary might easily follow.
“I was reading over what you wrote yesterday, and I find
that your inadvertence allowed me to make a statement which
is ridiculous. You actually permitted me—you, my private
secretary-to state that Beau Brummell, Count d'Orsay, and

you do not pay proper attention to accuracy. Had I not
detected that mistake my enemies would have certainly ac-
cused me of inaccuracy, and perhaps the very authenticity
of
my
recollections would have been impugned. I looked for
better things, Mr. Carew."
Dicky saw his anticipations of a rise in salary vanish and
become the shadow of a hope. It was hard on him, because
he was afraid of interrupting Mr. Lilliecrip in the full flow
of reminiscence, and he certainly had described a banquet in
which, he being the host, the late Prince Consort, Beau
Brummell, Count d'Orsay, and other distinguished personages
had figured as his guests.
“Would you like me, sir, to take the memoirs away with
me, and revise them by the help of the Annual Register ?"
Certainly not, sir. You will understand that you have no
right to breathe a word as to these memoirs.
do so, remember that I shall hear of it. You will then lose,
not only your present employment, but any future honorarium
which I may think of bestowing upon you."
This Hermit, it will have been perceived, was engaged in
the preparation of Personal Reminiscences. In order to avoid
the raising of expectations doomed to be disappointed, it
may be mentioned at once that his personal reminiscences
were a series—an immense long series-of personal lies,
figments, and imaginations, of which the world had
never seen the like. He had not been in contact with any of
the great men whose names he used so freely; he had never
spoken to one of themı; but he wanted to do something that
would live after him, and he was gratifying the vanity of a
morbid mind by compiling a gigantic work of pretended
memoirs. He proposed to bequeath these to the British
Museum, with an injunction that the packet was not to be
opened for seventy-five years. The man was preparing a
lie, which with its dullness, beaviness, and stupidity was
likely to weigh heavily on posterity, unless these very quali.
ties caused the imposture to be detected.
Mr. Lilliecrip sat down again, and passed his white band
across his forehead.

“ I am fatigued to-day, I think. My memory is sluggish.
Tell me, Mr. Carew, without mentioning names—the world
is nothing more to me, and I care not to hear its names-
what people think of me, or what that small part of London
in which you move thinks. What is said about me?"
Here was an astonishing thing for the Hermit to ask. For
more than three years Dicky had worked with him, and had
never exchanged a word save on necessary subjects.
“What do they say? Do they talk about me?"
Dicky remembered that the conversation, only the night
before, had turned exclusively upon the Hermit: had he
been of an entirely truthful nature, which unhappily was not
the case, he would have repeated for Mr. Lilliecrip's informa-
tion the speech he made on the occasion. It was as follows:
he delivered it with much freedom of utterance, being then in
the first stage only of intoxication, standing before the fire,
and waving a pipe in his right hand :-
“Gentlemen, with regard to my esteemed friend, whom you
call the Hermit of Lowland-street, I am not, as many
of
you
are aware, allowed to reveal the important secrets which my
mysterious employer has been good enough to intrust to my
He is, however, as you may imagine, no mystery to
me. Is he rich ? is he nobly born? is he generous ? is he
princely in his disposition? I say nothing. I answer neither
Yes nor No. What is the reason for his strange retirement ?
Gentlemen, I must not tell you. It was only this morning,
in the splendidly furnished suite of chambers, externally
humble, where we transact our business--chambers in which
everything is as magnificently appointed as in Windsor Castle,
my
noble friend's ancestral halls-"
“He is a swell, then," said a listener. “By Jove, he must
have done something very bad.”
“ It was only this morning be said to me, Carew, if there
were any other man in the world to whom I could confide my
history, I would not give you this trouble. I feel that you
are my only true friend, and I fear I inflict too much upon
you. He had the goodness to say that
“Wouldn't it be better, Dicky, if he were to ask you for the
measure of your feet, and buy you a new pair of boots ?”
Dicky took no notice of this personal allusion to his poverty.
“ He went on to say that what he offered me now was
nothing, simply nothing, compared with what he was going to
give when - But I am speaking too freely. As for the
care.
or in

167
ridiculous honorarium which-pah! gentlemen, I blow it away
like this cloud."
Later on in the evening, Dicky, growing truthful under the
influence of gin-and-water, wept as he confessed, amid the
smiles of his friends, the mean and curmudgeon-like spirit of
the Hermit, and the degrading task of writing from dictation
which was his daily lot. It was curious that at no stage of
intoxication would he confess the nature of his employer's
papers.
However, Dicky did not, in answer to the question of his
master, think fit to communicate the substance of his speech.
“They do talk, I suppose,” said Mr. Lilliecrip. “It is not
à usual thing for a man to immure himself in four dingy
walls, and deny himself society, is it?"
“They talk, sir: they will talk, you know—even quite
common people."
Dicky was a little embarrassed.
“What do they say, then ?”
"Well, really, sir, wild talk, mostly. It would offend you,
perhaps.”
“Offend me? Do you really suppose- Come, Mr.
Carew, what do people say of me?"
They don't know what to say about you. Some think
you are the rightful Sir Roger Tichborne in hiding for some-
thing done in the Bush."
“Good. Go on."
“ Some say you are the real beir to a crown, and paid to
keep yourself out of the way.
"That is better."
“ Most believe that you are a murderer in hiding, and
there's more than one has given information of you to the
police, in hope of getting a reward. I have heard of people
consulting old newspapers of fourteen years ago to find out
who was watched by the police then, and they have stood me
drinks, sir-dozens of drinks-in order to find out any little
hint that may help them.”
“This is interesting,” said the Hermit. “A cheap way of
getting popularity and notoriety, too."
“They call you the Hermit of Lowland-street, and there's
a man connected with the Daily Firework wants to make an
article out of you.'
“ Tell him he'd better not,” said the Recluse. “ Tell him,
if he does, I'll find out all about him-his debts and his sins,

his weak places and his discreditable doings--and I'll ruin
him. Tell him that.”
He actually impressed Dicky with so deep a sense of power
in reserve, that he accepted this threat as quite within his
reach, and wept on-
“Some think you must have forged a will, and are living
on the proceeds ; or else that you are a-
“Bah!" said the Solitary. “It is stupid. What does it
matter what they say? About yourself now, Mr. Carew ?"
Dicky's heart beat. Here, then, was the long-looked-for
opportunity. Now for the increase of salary.
“I was about to venture, sir, to speak of myself. Three
years is a good spell at fifteen shillings a week”
“ You were about to say that you were sorry the work was
not worth more than half; and you would have been right,
Mr. Carew, quite right.”
This was a damper.
What I was about to say was, that your appearance is
discreditable, and that I shall advance you the money to
purchase a new suit, to be stopped out of your pay at the rate
of five shillings a week. That is all, Mr. Carew.'
He placed a packet with money in his hands, and nodded
dismissal.
Stay—stay; there was another thing. I hear now and
then a pleasing voice singing in the room below me to the
piano. I am absolutely careless about the world, but you may
tell me anything you know about the voice. No, sir-no gush;
no names. I want nothing about the history of these people
quite commonplace and vulgar people, in a commonplace and
vulgar street. Answer me without unnecessary words. Rich
or poor?"
« Poor. Were rich."
“Is the owner of the voice young and pretty, or old lad—".
Young and pretty. Twenty."
“How many in family ?”
“Two sisters. Ladies. Unmarried. One is an artist."
“That will do, Mr. Carew—that will do. To-morrow, if
you please, be more punctual. Remember what I say, that if
in your drinking bouts—I know your habits, sir—you let out
what
you do here, you will repent it in such sober earnest as
you little dream of.”
Dicky retired humbly. With regard to the money, his first
thought was naturally to spend it in a wild and rollicking

169
carouse; but better thoughts prevailed. How if Mr. Lilliecrip
found him out ? How if, in the blindness of his wrath, he
should carry into execution his threats, and make him repent?
“To be sure," Dicky reflected, taking comfort, “I am a soft-
hearted man, and I repent very easily.”
Strange," said the Hermit, “how that voice haunts me.
For the first time these fourteen years I want to see another
face. What is coming over me ?"
As he spoke, the voice began again to a simple accompani.
ment of the piano, singing a simple ballad to an ancient tune.
It was Adie, taking one of the few pleasures left to her, to sing
and play while Marion painted.
He stood still and listened. Presently it ceased, and he
caught the low ripple of girlish laughter, and the voices of
girls talking. His heart beat and his knees trembled.
“I am a fool,” he said. “I am fooled by that idiot, Carew.
He takes some vulgar little milliner animal for a lady, and a
rosy cheek for beauty.”
He spent the rest of the day over his dinner.
In the evening his man of business, Mr. Owen, knocked at
his door. Mr. Lilliecrip was sitting by the fire in the soft
light of a moderator lamp. He was in evening dress: this
Hermit, had he donned the friar's serge and lived in those
miserable quarters on the river Coquet whereof the ballad
sings, would have made it a rule to change the simple gown
and the

for black coat and white tie in the evening. He
was playing with a cup of coffee, and lazily thinking of taking

master he finished the coffee.
Pray excuse me a moment, Mr. Owen," he said, with great
politeness, " and take a chair."
Mr. Owen placed a chair in the middle of the room, and sat
himself down, with his feet under it, in such a position that
he could not be accused of curiously prying into anything
while the owner was not in the room. Mr. Lilliecrip, how-
ever, returned immediately, wearing a velvet jacket and a
smoking cap.
“Always change your evening coat, Mr. Owen,
smoking; the tobacco will linger about the cloth.”
Mr. Owen grunted. The advice is superfluous to a man
who has but one coat.
“I have been for the money as usual,” he said.
" Here it
is—thirty-three, five, seven, Count it."

The Solitary counted it, and dropped it in his pocket.
: Messrs. Crackett and Charges want to see you. They say
there is an opportunity for advancing your interests."
“I told them to send no messages, and to write me no
letters. I will not be worried with investments."
“That's all, then," said Mr. Owen, rising abruptly.
“One moment, Owen-your advice, if you please. There's
a girl downstairs."
« Two,” said the schoolmaster—" three, in fact, counting
my Winifred, and I don't see why she shouldn't be counted.”
“ Nor I, I am sure.
Count her, by all means. One of the
three is pretty, I am told—not that I care, of course ; not
that it matters to me."
“They are all three pretty, and as good as gold”.
« There is one that sings.
“They all three sing. What is that to you ?"
Mr. Rhyl Owen was gruff of speech with Mr. Lilliecrip, the
result of fourteen years' occasional communication with that
gentleman.
“If he's not polite with you, he'll bully you," said Mr.
Owen, thinking about him. “He is a cur that licks your
hand one minute and bites it the next."
“What are the girls to you, Mr. Lilliecrip ?”.
“I am sometimes a little lonely. Do you

up here, and sit with me, read with me, talk to me in the
evening?"

master replied, with great decision.
“I would pay her, you know."
“Mr. Lilliecrip, two of them are ladies, and the other earns
her bread in a better way than talking to old fools.”
“You are rude to-night. Am I not fit company for them,
do you mean ?”
Mr. Owen was silent.
“Come, sir, tell me what you do mean."
“I mean, Mr. Lilliecrip, that neither of the young ladies
shall come up here if I can prevent it. They are real ladies,
born and bred. As for that, my Winifred should not come
bere either.”
“Well, well, Owen, I cannot afford to quarrel with you, or
else I should have to find some one else to go out for me.
Perhaps you are right; people might talk if a young lady

came to my rooms alone, though I am surely grey enough
and old enough."
“Old enough, certainly,” said Mr. Owen, drily. "The
young lady's brother lives in the house, too. You had better
speak to him about it."
“Ah !” Mr. Lilliecrip changed colour, but very slightly;
“is he—is be a gentleman, too? Lowland-street seems to be
suffering from an invasion of ladies and gentlemen."
“Oh, yes-he's a gentleman, and a fire-eater too. Lord,
Mr. Lilliecrip, put it out of your thoughts. Why, he'd murder
you, that young gentleman would, so fierce as he is, if he'd

must first know who and what you are, Mr. Lilliecrip, and
why you have shut yourself up.”
i Ånd a pretty girl?”.
“They are both beautiful girls; and one is a lovely creature.
God bless her!” said Mr. Owen, getting up to go.
When Mr. Lilliecrip was left alone, he began to ponder
over his cigar. After fourteen years of solitude, the thought
of a beautiful girl being in the same house, the possibility
that she might enliven his room by her presence, agitated
him. How should he get to know this beautiful girl?
“It is strange,” he said ; “ I cannot understand. Fourteen
years of peace and content, and to-night-all from a voice
and a few words; one would think I was only beginning the
prison. Could it be possible for me to leave the place and
go out again ?” He rose, and walked up and down the room,
his face working with the emotion of some disturbing memory.
“No, never!" he cried; “never! I will stay here till I die !"
CHAPTER XVII.
THE April mornings are sunlit at six, even in the heart of
London, and there is a fine painting light for those who are
able to get up for it. The early morning was Marion's time
of peace and quiet labour; she would be alone. How great
a blessing it is to be alone for an hour or two in the day can
only, I suppose, be appreciated by women who live together.
It is one of the many evils of poverty that the poor have no
solitude possible. As the social ladder descends, the necessity
of a life in common becomes more marked. The suburban
villa has its three sitting-rooms for a family of half a dozen ;

..
but the ladies of the “ lower middle class” have to sleep, eat,
read, work, and play in the same room.
In the early morning, when the air is clear and bright,
Marion took fresh courage, and clothed herself with new faith
and hope. Above all, she worked : that soul is never quite
unhappy which can take a healthy pleasure in work for its
own sake. Marion was, for the first time, after four years of
copying, engaged upon an original picture. She was ambitious,
as most young painters are. She did not yet fully understand
that a work of art must be a copy of Nature itself, and not
a reminiscence or a reflection ; and her picture had the fault
of being drawn from the inspiration of other masters. There
are plenty of such pictures in every Royal Academy-you
find a familiar touch here, and another there; you are reminded
of one master here, and another there. Nature is at second
hand, the light hardly fits the season; the flowers do not fit
with each other; the primrose and the nightshade are painted
blossoming side by side; and yet, for some subtle grace and
secret charm of their own, the pictures are bought and loved.
It was so with Marion. She had chosen an Italian subject,
who had never been in Italy; she had put in Italian flowers,
who knew not an Italian summer; country figures, who had
never seen a contadina ; an Italian sky, who had never been
out of England; a dress which was never worn under the
canopy of heaven; a light wbich never shone on earth or
ocean; and yet, for one redeeming touch it bad, the picture
was warm with life and feeling. She had taken a scene from
Browning's “Pippa passes," a poem which--if its author
had only for once been able to wed melodious verse to the
sweetest poetical thought; if he had only tried, just for once,
to write lines which should not make the cheeks of those that
read them to ache, the front teeth of those who declaim them
to splinter and fly, the ears of those that hear them to crack
-would have been a thing to rest himself upon
for ever, and
receive the applause of the world. To the gods it seemed
otherwise. Browning, who might have led us like Hamelin
the piper, has chosen the worse part. He will be so deeply
wise that he cannot express his thought; he will be so full of
profundities that he requires a million of lines to express them
in; he will leave music and melody to Swinburne; he will
leave grace and sweetness to Tennyson; and in fifty years'
time, who will read Browning ? Let us return to our sheep
Marion had chosen the place where Pippa passes singing :-

The hill-side's dew pearled;
The lark's on the wing,

Oh, strong poet of the densest tympanum, to write those
tbird and fourth lines-
“ The hill-side's dew pearled !"
Was there ever such a stuttering collocation of syllables to
confound the reader and utterly destroy a sweet little lyric?
Pippa was Adrienne, Marion's model. She was passing in
the bright early morning, singing as she went, unconscious
of her words, and dangling her grapes before her; a figure
full of health, youth, and beauty ; Adrienne with the least pos.
sible darkening of the eyebrows and the hair; not an Italian
face at all; sweet-lipped Adie, tall, delicate, graceful-not a
silk-weaver, not Pippa, not a workwoman, not the heroine of
Browning's noble dream; an English girl, in a bright clear
sunshine, with strong shadows, which lay black under the
vine-leaves and behind the stones, and set off her sweetness
as a crystal mounted in an ebony setting; and behind the
unconscious girl a face and the back of a bead—the face of a
man who catches the words. They strike his ear with a
force the girl knows nothing of; the glamour of a devilish
passion falls from him, and he sees the awful thing—too
ſate-in its true light. In the head of the woman that looks
to him you may, if you can, imagine the wonder that is in
her unseen face, and the horror of the awaking. Pippa sings
her
song
and passes-
« God's in His Heaven,
All's right with the world.”
The picture was nearly finished; the principal figure-a
half figure—was completed; the heads were worked up; only
the flowers and accessories were as yet to be filled in.
Marion worked contentedly from half-past five to eight at
her canvas.
She was not unhappy, provided there was money
to give her two children enough to eat: it was all she worked
If she dreamed of anything better, it seemed a long
way off. She was their natural protector: to her they were
the two children always, helpless, not quite to be trusted ; a

little perverse- at least, one of them—but always lovable,
always to be treated with a fond consideration.
At eight
Adie appeared, and began to make the breakfast. This was
the happiest time that the girls had. In the evening there
was always the drop of bitterness in the cup, the discontent
of comparison, the absence of their brother. In the morning
they were alone, for Fred seldom rose till nine or ten, and
they could talk. Presently Marion, keeping silence on the
doctor's proposals, began to talk, as usual, of money matters.
“ Five shillings, Adie, dear,” she said, giving her that
.amcunt. "It is not a great deal for a long day's work
copying, is it? But it is as much as Mr. Burls would give
After all, I dare say it is more than one deserves. Why
do they always pay women so much worse than men ?”
“Because they are not strong enough to knock the cheats
dowr and beat them, as men would do,” said Adie, vindictively.
She took the money, and dropped it into her purse, where
Dr. Chacomb’s five pounds were lying: the accusing jingle of
the coins reminded her unpleasantly of her promise, and
struck her soul with a note of remorse. It was as if she had
sold herself to deceive her sister.
“It is enough, at any rate," she said, “ for to-day. You
shall have some dinner when you come home, dear.
-dinner-tea; you shall have some steak, and I will get you a
pint of claret, if-if-oh, if Fred does not want it all. You
want a little wine so badly, dear.”
“Let Fred have two shillings, Adie, and I will do without
the claret. Besides, it is ridiculous for us to talk about wine,
with our fortunes at this low ebb."
“Marion, you are looking pale. Do not work so hard ;
things will get right somehow-I am sure they will. Fred
says he has always felt certain they will.”
Marion shook her head. She was not hopeful this morning;
perhaps because the sky had clouded over since she left off
work for breakfast.
“Fred will get a situation,” Adie went on, trying to talk
cheerfully, and working the talk round, somehow, to a point.
“ That is, if he gets friends to back him up. The
poor boy

it seems as if I can do nothing at all. I might teach French,

only accomplishment. I cannot play well enough to teach
music, and I know nothing else---nothing. My dear, I am
horribly helpless and selfish. I let you work day after day
for us, and never seem to do anything.'
“Adie,” Marion patted her cheek, “I do nut want you to
do anything."
Ada sighed.
“Marion," she whispered, laying her arm on her sister's
neck, “Marion, tell me, if you saw a way—if any one told
you of a way, would you not like to escape out of all this
dreadful misery and poverty ? Think of yesterday, and our
starving. Think of my having to go and beg Mr. Owen to
give me something to eat. And Fred coming home at night
smoking an expensive cigar, with no money left of all he took
from you the day before. Oh, the shame of it!"
There were times when Adie's view of Fred's conduct was
harsher than Marion's.
“Let us face the present," said Marion, conscious of what
her sister meant. “See, dear, I shall take the pictures to
Mr. Hermann. He always buys what I bring him, though he
does not give much. Mr. Burls said that if he had any money
he would have given four guineas a head. Mr. Hermann ought
at least to give me a guinea each-that makes five guineas,
and then we will have a little claret to do us both good.”
It seemed a very small matter to Adie—this chance of five
guineas—in the face of all the possibilities opened up by the
doctor.
“But, Marion, suppose a way were to lie open unto us?
Suppose-0, Marion, you who work so hard for us all, -hat
if we could get back to something like the old life again, and
be at rest ?"
Marion looked at her inquiringly. She knew, by a sudden
intuition, and by the flushed cheeks and drooping eyelashes,
that her sister had been talking to the doctor, and about
herself.
“If the way were not impossible, Adie."
“Oh, what could be impossible? Marion, dear, you know
what I am thinking of. It seems such a simple thing. And
think what it means for you and me and Fred. Only try to
think. Servants to wait upon us again; ladies and gentle-
men to talk to; dress—proper dress—to wear; money to
spend. Oh, Marion, how can you say it is impossible? It
would not be to me."

Marion heard her sister with a heavy heart.
What did Dr. Chacomb
say
to
you! ?”
“He told me he loved you; and he asked me to speak to
you myself. I promised I would, Marion; was I wrong?”
Marion caressed the fair cheek that looked up to her.
“Don't talk to him again about it, my dear. Try to realise
only that it is impossible, and that we must face the present.
Have patience and a little hope."
"Sometimes I have hope. Sometimes I think Fred is right,
and we shall all three go back to take our proper place like
disinherited princes and princesses; and sometimes, Marion
- it is too selfish, when you do everything for us—sometimes
I think you might do more. Don't say it is impossible, dear.
I have been lying awake half the night thinking it all over."
“My poor child," said Marion, taking Adie's face in her
hands, “my poor child ! it is so hard that you should be un-
happy."
“And you, dear; is it not hard for you too? Is it quite
impossible, Marion? See, dear”-she spoke hurriedly, as if
the subject was too much for her—"see, dear, here we starve
and are miserable; with him we should at least be warm and
comfortable, and have no anxiety-think of that. Think of
waking up every morning without feeling that there will be
no dinner the next day unless we work for it; think of not
having to find money for Fred's extravagances; think of being
able to wear decent things; think of the change we should
have in our lives. He is kind, Marion; I am sure he is kind.
To be sure, he is not very young; but what of that? He
does not want your love, he
says; he only wants you to marry
him, and then he will try to get your love afterwards."
“My dear, could I marry any one unless I loved him first ?"
Why not? I would. If Dr. Chacomb had come to me
instead of to you, and asked me to marry him, I should have
jumped for joy. Love! What is all the nonsense people talk
about love? I cannot understand it. I want to be well dressed
and rich-that is the real happiness.

told him so last night. I think he is kind, too; but it is.
impossible, Adie. Do not say anything more about it. Put
it quite out of your thoughts, and let us try to make the best
of the little we have."
“But we have nothing," said Adie, with her musical laugh,

" nothing at all. Marion, I have often read about the duty
of being contented with little; but not even the books which
are the hardest about duty, and make it the most difficult to
get to Heaven, ever say anything about the duty of being
contented with nothing. Be reasonable, dear Marion, and
discontented.”
It was after breakfast that this conversation took place.
The girls always took their breakfast first, the head of the
family appearing later.
As Adie finished her philosophical remarks, Fred appeared,
fully equipped for his journey into the City." His way there
might have seemed, to any who saw him start, a circuitous
route, for on reaching Oxford-street he invariably turned west.
It does not do, however, to be always guided by appearances.
He may have “ fetched a compass,
," like St. Paul, and worked
round by way of Battersea. His equanimity, disturbed by the
doctor the evening before, was completely restored. After all,
he was—and he knew it well enough-an idle rascal. He never
had done anything, and he hoped to pass wholly through life
without doing anything. Besides, Fred's anger was like a fire
of chips—it exhausted itself, and was quickly spent. Storms
in shallow lakes quickly subside. This morning he was fresh,
and even radiant.
Marion's artistic instincts furnished, perhaps, one of the
reasons why she never grew tired of this idle and good-for-
nothing brother. She loved him for his beauty and his grace.
It was always a pleasure for her eyes to rest upon the lines
of his form. His face, which to a man seemed wanting in
depth, was to her as full of depth and possible emotion as the
illimitable sea. She made perpetual excuse for him; she
cheerfully gave him all she could; she made him her type of
that divine beauty which, man or woman, the best of us dream
of and long after. Her face lit up when he entered the room
and kissed her in his lordly, off-hand way.
“A lovely morning, Marion. Are you going far ? Adie,
sew a button on my glove for me, please. Will you come for
a walk this afternoon? I can be back at two o'clock for you."
He went to the window, and looked out. A cloud crossed
his face.
“Marion, I think that, considering the state of our finances
and how unlucky we have been of late, it is hardly a time for
charity.”
• What do you mean, Fred ?"
2

WITH HARP AND CROIN.
Marion was getting together her portfolio.
“I mean that the woman I have seen you talking to once
or twice is hanging about in the street, intending no doubt
to waylay you directly you leave the place. Now, Marion,
please remember charity begins at home. We cannot well
afford out-door relief just now. No doubt it is extremely
creditable and respectable to have a pensioner-even such a
disreputable pensioner as that."
Marion's hands shook a little; but she steadied herself.
“I dare say she will not want any money, Fred. Now I
am ready. Give me good luck, Adie, dear.'
Fred watched her from the window.
“ There are the usual children hanging about her skirts,"
he said, impatiently. “Really, I think Marion considers
herself a mother in Israel. If there is a child in trouble, or
a woman in distress, Marion must be consulted. Why cannot
we live unknown, and not talked about? I fully expect Marion
will be reported in a daily paper for a philanthropist.”
Presently he saw the woman he had noticed cross the street.
"I thought so,” he said, impatiently. “Upon my word,
you know, Adie, it's too ridiculous. Here we are, almost
starving, and Marion throwing the money away upon street
beggars! She has crossed over-I knew she would—and is
begging of Marion. Now they are talking at the corner. Now
they have gone off together. Who is the woman, Adie ?”
s I don't know. I asked once, but was told not to ask any
more-some poor woman who knows Marion.”
“I shall make it my business," said Fred, pompously, “ to
inquire. I am the head of the family, and I will not have
secrets kept from me."
“ Don't be a goose, Fred. You are no more the head of
the family than I am. As if anything you could say, or I
either, would turn Marion an inch from her own path. Poor
Marion !"
“I wish I could see the way to persuade her to make
money,” said her brother. “Look at this canvas—she spends
half her time over a thing like that!" It was her unfinished
painting. “What will she do with it? Who will buy it?
And when I proposed to her to make a steady income by
giving lessons, she refused. Just the same the other day,
when I saw an advertisement that would have suited me
admirably: 'A gentleman by birth and education wanted to
advance about twelve hundred pounds in a sleeping partner-

hundred per cent. by way of profits. Think of it, you know
-nothing to do but to draw twelve hundred a year or so!
I showed it to Marion, and asked her to sell out her little
fortune and lend it to me. She refused. She said nothing
wouiù induce her to part with the money, not even to make
my fortune with it.”
“Yes, Marion told me about it. You see, Fred, if you
had
lost the money--which you most likely would have done-
where should we be ? Now, if everything else fails, we always
have the fifty pounds a year to fall back upon.”
“Just like women,” Fred growled; "they never understand
the simplest rules of investment. I could make that miser-
able fifty into five thousand if I had it!”
“O, Fred, you will never make your own fortune or ours
either, poor boy! Sit down and have your tea.”
He complied with the invitation. Adie sat opposite, and
talked.
“Such a chance, Fred, too, as Marion has missed. Oh,
such a chance! We shall never have another like it-never !”
“What chance, Adie ?"
His face flushed, as hers had done, at the mere thought of
being rich.
Fred,” she put on her most solemn tones, “a rich man
wants to marry Marion !”
“ A rich man?”
“And to provide for you, and to take care of me. But she
has refused him—twice.'
“ Who is it?”
" It is Dr. Chacomb."
“I would rather she married the Devil!” he said, hotly.
* Don't swear, Fred.”
“I would. Do you know that he has insulted me that
he insulted me last night even ? He called memwell, never
mind! Marion shall never have my permission to marry Dr.
Chacomb."
“ You are a goose, Fred; you really are.
You cannot
really think that either of us is going to ask your permission
to do anything we want to do. Be sensible, if you can.
Play at being the head of the family, as you call it, outside,
where perhaps they don't know that Marion works for all
and provides for all-poor Marion !"

than I can. And if anything happened to Marion- Well,
let me tell you about it, without any more heroics! Dr. Cha-
comb is a very
kind-hearted man. I should live with him
and Marion. We should have à carriage, and a box at the
Opera, and"
“Dreams, Adie! The man has no money. He lives on
what he can borrow from his cousin!”
“ But he has money, I tell you. He is rich. He is a suc-
cessful physician, and the founder of the Royal Hospital for
Gout. Why, he makes five thousand pounds a year, he tells
me. O, Fred, what a brother-in-law, if Marion would only
see it!”
Fred became thoughtful.
“ Does he do all that? I know how to find out. There's
a chemist fellow comes to our billiard-rooms--not a gentle-
man, you know—who knows all about doctors and that class
of people”-Fred always spoke of persons who earned their
livelihood as " that class of people.” “Now I think of it,
Chacomb did have a respectable appearance last night when
he came here. I don't like him, Adie. Hang it! you can't
like a man who calls you an idle- Well, but if he has this
large income, and if he will take care of you and look after
me, I shall not let any prejudice of mine stand in the way.
I withdraw my opposition, Adie."
“ That's very good of you, Fred,” Adie laughed.
“I do not forget,” the young man went on," the house to
which I belong, whose head I am. It has always been usual
for the representative of the name to have a voice in the
alliances contracted by the members of the family."
“That's very grand, my dear brother; and it is a great
blessing to feel that we have a head with a proper sense of
dignity. If
you had arms as well— No, Fred, I won't tease.
But Marion won't have him.”
“Adie, suppose-I only say suppose—the doctor were to
shift his proposal to the younger sister. What would you say?"
The girl reddened.
“I told Marion that I should jump for joy. But I don't
think I should. I like Dr. Chacomb very much Ido, indeed;
but I don't think I could marry him when it came actually to
the point. However, that is not to the point. I am quite

sure that he will not ask me, and I am also quite sure that he
is as rich as he says he is. Besides, Fred, if poor
Gerald
never comes home again, he is the heir to Chacomb."
Fred whistled.
“So he is, so he is. Adie, we must try and bring it off if
we can. My dear child, fancy going back to Comb Leigh,
the masters of Chacomb!”
“Oh, the delight! Fred, fancy sitting by the dear old
beach and hearing the waves beat against the rocks again !
Oh, think of the cliff, and the garden, and the flowers. You
and I would live in the rosary: we would walk about as we
used to do, and lie on the grass and eat strawberries, and
have piles-piles of roses in the drawing-room every day, and
all the new music. I should wear white all the summer.”
“And in the season we would come to town,” said her
brother, flushing with enthusiasm.
“Yes; and you would give me a pony carriage, wouldn't
you ?” Then she burst into a laugh that ended in a sob.
“But it's no good. We are here-nous voici plantésmin
Lowland-street. Marion will not have him, and we grow
poorer every day."
Their faces dropped, and the sunlight of imagination dis-
appeared behind a cloud.
Quoth Fred, after a little pause-
“ Have you got any money, Adie ?”
“ Marion gave me five shillings, and-and-Fred, don't be
ingry, but Dr. Chacomb offered me five pounds when he
heard that we had no money-all in gold-and I took them.
Here they are."
She spread out the sovereigns, with Marion's poor five
shillings, on the table, and looked up at her brother in a
little doubt.
He knitted his brows with the gravity of Epictetus the
moralist.
“That was wrong, child. That was very wrong.
Women
never seem to have the same sense of honour as men.
You ought not to have taken the money.
Remember that
men never take money of each other, unless they win it at
billiards, cards, or betting. Then, of course, it is a different
thing. I could not myself, for instance, poor as we are, accept
money
of
any one-even offered me by my best friend."
This was very noble, and Adie felt proud of a brother dis-
tinguished by sentiments so honourable.

Then his eyes fell again on the money. It lay glittering
on the table, representing a really large area of enjoyment.
“Five pounds," he said. “I wonder how long it is since I
had five pounds ? Not since I was at Oxford, I believe. Look
bere, Adie, what are you going to do with it all?”
“It is for housekeeping.”
“ Yes, you must take care not to have any more money
from Dr. Chacomb. I will make a note of the amount.”
He took out his pocket-book, and entered it, date and all,
with solicitude.
Adie looked guiltily on.
“Oh, I wish I hadn't taken it! I will tell Marion when
she comes home, and we will send it back. Fred, it was very
wrong
of me.”
“N-no,” said her brother, “I don't think that is necessary.
Adie, it just occurs to me that I owe a little bill at the Sheaf
for billiards and things; and there is my account at the
tobacconist's; and I want a new pair of gloves, and my
boots
are giving out. There is a sovereign, too-a debt of honour-
which I ought to pay; and I should like to buy something
for you—it is a long time since I gave you anything, my dear
sister; and—and I think it would be best to pay off all these
things at once.”
He laid his hands upon the whole heap of money, and kept
them there.
“O, Fred, not all!”
The girl's look, and the one of entreaty, spoke a whole
volume of woman's endurance and man's selfishness.
“Four pounds will do, Adie. That leaves you, you see,
one pound five shillings, counting what Marion gave you-
more than a whole week's housekeeping in advance, Better
say nothing to Marion about the money; and tell Dr. Chacomb,
with my compliments, that I am going to repay his small
temporary loan with interest—when I get a post.
He dropped the sovereigns in his waistcoat pocket and
went away, leaving Adie rather sick at heart, and perhaps a
little confused between the delicate distinctions of the code
of honour which permitted her brother to borrow without
repaying, but forbade his taking what was offered.
>>
The woman waiting for Marion crossed the street when she
left the house, and stood before her. She was a woman who
might be of any age from five and thirty to fifty, with a face

which was pretty once, and eyes which formerly might have
been bright. She was thin, careworn, and poorly dressed.
As she stood waiting her lips moved-she was talking to
herself. As Fred had remarked, her appearance, whether
regarded as a pensioner or not, was disreputable.
Marion turned pale when the creature confronted hor.
“You promised me you would not molest me. You
pro-
mised I should never see you at all,” she cried. Why can
you not write, as you engaged to do, to the post-office ? How
dare
you come to my very door ?”
“I saw him,” she replied, “at the window. What a
handsome boy it is! Ah me, where did he get his curls from ?
Where did he get his dimpled chin and his bright eyes ?
Tell me that, Marion Revel.”
“ Remember, if you break your contract—if you venture to
speak to either of them, if you let them suspect who and what
you are-I will help you no more, and you may do your very
“ Tell me how she is," asked the woman. “I did not see her."
“ Adrienne is well and happy-at least, as happy as our
poverty will allow.”
“I have not caught a glimpse of her for three months. I
hoped that to-day she would put her pretty face at the
window just for me to see it again. Oh me, oh me! Last
Christmas Day it was I saw her coming home from church
with a girl-quite a girl of the lower classes. Such a difference
as there was between Adrienne, as tall and straight as a
poplar, with a face like a countess—where did she get her
face and figure from ? tell me that—and the little chit with
her, all dimples and curls and chubby cheeks! Such a con-
trast; a beautiful contrast for me to look at! Marion Revel,
you never could have had such a figure, not when you were
at your very best, four years ago; and now you've gone off
sadly, poor thing! All your good looks gone, like It's
dreadful to think how care and trouble spoil a woman's figure.
That's where men have the great advantage over us women.
Why, if it had not been for all my troubles, I should have

“ Our sins make our troubles,” said Marion.
“Do they? Then, Marion Revel, you must have been a
greater sinner than anybody would think.”

“ Money, of course. What else can I want ?”
“ I have no money.
I sent you ten shillings last week. I
cannot afford to give you more than five shillings a week. If
I give you more, it is robbing them.”
* And if it is robbing them, it is all in the family, Marion."
Marion shuddered.
“ There are others besides them to consider. Look at that
finger.” She held out her left-hand ring. " What does that
mean? Turn over in your mind what that means, and let
me know what you are going to do."
“Where is the money gone that I gave you last week ?
Tell me the truth."
“Yes, there is no reason why I should tell you any lies
about it. It is all spent except twopence. And the rent to
pay. How is it spent? It is spent on myself. What did I
buy with it? I bought bloaters and bread for the boy to

“I have only sixpence.”.
" Then give me that, and send me some more."
Marion took out her
purse.
“The purse would pawn for eightpence," said the woman.
« Give me that too."
“No, I shall not. Here is the sixpence."
“And you talk about heing poor! Why, the things you've
got on you could put in for at least thirty shillings. There's
the malachite cross, that's good for three-and-six. There's
the jacket; why, any one would lend you ten shillings on the
jacket. There's your gloves—real kid; well, they is patched

Revel, it's disgraceful if you don't give me more than six-
pence, with a whole fortune on your back. I thought your

“How dare you name my father ?” cried Marion, roused to
frenzy by the dreadful importunity of the woman.
" How
dare you let the name of Captain Revel pass your lips ? Now
do your worst, if you dare. Go up and tell that innocent girl

who and what you are. Make her more unhappy than she is
-it is the utmost that you can do. Do this if you please;
The beggar began to whimper and cry, using the corner of
her shawl in lieu of 1 pocket handkerchief to mop up ima-
ginary tears.
“You're the only friend I've got in the world," she
moaned, “and you throw me over because you are afraid I
shall tell. Is it likely I should tell ? Do you think I am
going to give up five shillings a week ? Marion Revel, is
it likely, I ask you? And the boy ill at home, and crying
for food, and I've got no money. Oh! oh! oh!"
“What shall I do? What am I to do with you ?” cried
the poor girl, in despair. “Is there no work for women in
the world???
“It depends," the other replied. “For such as you there
is work and pay; for such as me there is only work and star-
vation. I can make cardboard boxes, and get two and two-
pence, bar stoppages, for twelve hours' work. That is all I
can do. Just now there are too many of us wanting to make
cardboard boxes, and I can't even get that; so I must come
to you and beg. Get me some more money, Marion Revel ?”
“If I do, you will only ask for more again when that is
gone.
“Yes, I shall. I shall go on begging till I die. I wish 1
was dead. I wish I was laid in my workhouse grave and
all my troubles over. But what would become of the
boy?"
99
Marion sighed heavily.
“I will try and get you some money. If I can, I will
bring it myself this afternoon. If I fail, you must try some-
thing else.
“I might go on the parish—that would be a fitting end to
it all. Sometimes I think I will go and steal something.
Marion Revel, I can hurt you in more ways than you think
of if I like. I can do worse than tell them the truth. I can
go before a magistrate for petty larceny, and give my real
name and history. Mind you,
I never lost
my
real
name;
I
can bear it still if I like. So can the boy-little Rickety Jem.
How would
you
like that?”
The woman passed from whining to threatening, and back
again. She was uncertain in her behaviour. She alternated

between the burden of her misery, which made her whine,
and the feeling of the hold she possessed over the girl, which
made her threaten. Either weapon was equally efficacious;
for the blow which she could inflict was not upon Marion, but
upon the other two.
“I can do no more," Marion said. Go
away
and leave
You have made me unhappy enough. I have told you
what I will try to do, and what I shall do if you dare to injure
those who are dear to me.
Now go.”
The woman pulled her shawl closer round her and flitted
away. When she got round the nearest corner, she looked
about her. There was, of course, a public-house in the street.
There are always in London two things in full view—a public-
house and a church. The population may be broadly divided
into two great classes of those who worship at the former and
at the latter place. The woman belonged to those who wor-
shipped at the bar. She made sure that Marion was not
looking after her, and crept into the place that is open all day
long, a pit for those who like to tumble in. A moment after-
wards she came out, wiping her mouth; but she bore herself
more upright, and faced the world with a brighter air.
This was Marion's secret-the secret she had discovered on
going through her father's papers, the thing she had to keep
away from her brother and sister, and to hide from all the
world. The knowledge of it made her ashamed; the thought
of it weighed her down; the burden of it kept her in the
poverty of misery, when she might have been in the poverty
of simple comfort.
The woman was, as Fred idly put it, her pensioner-not by
choice, but by a dreadful necessity. She had to be kept from
starvation for the sake of the dead man lying in Comb Leigh
churchyard, and for the sake of the two children," who
knew nothing of it. We have to bear our troubles as we can;
but Marion's burden was all the harder because it was so
much heavier than her brother or sister were able to suspect.
;
CHAPTER XVIII,
HAVING no more money, Marion had to walk, carrying her
parcel of paintings. From the Tottenham-court-road to
Waterloo Bridge is a long step; of that, however, she thought
little, provided only she could sell her pictures. The man

she was going to had already bought one or two sketches,
small things, and at a moderately low price. He lived in
Stamford-street, and called himself, on a brass plate, picture
dealer and restorer. He was a German by birth, but had
been long enough in England to speak English fluently, with
only the sweet German accent, so as to interchange a few of
the consonants, such as the labials and dentals, in that
remarkable and pleasing manner peculiar to his countrymen.
His name was Gottfried Hermann, and he was said to be
descended from the children of Israel, which is by itself a
passport to everybody's favour. As for his religious prin-
ciples, they were no doubt deep and genuine, the result of
profound investigation and anxious thought; but as his
daily practices were beyond everything scoundrelly, and his
walk, or rather his creeping, in life was mean, tortuous, and
shady, it would be perhaps superfluous to inquire into his
creed. The Americans—a much more practical people than
ourselves—make it a rule never to ask after the religion of a
stranger. They like, on the other hand, first to make sure
of his honesty. Perhaps we shall some time or other adopt
this, among a few other laudable Transatlantic customs.
In every profession there must be perforce some whose
natural place is about the lowest steps. We have not all of
us learned to climb. To some of us climbing is not agree-
able, to others it does not seem profitable. Mr. Gottfried
Hermann was one of those who stand about the lowest steps
of picture dealing. He was also one to whom that position
was the most pleasant. On the higher levels he would have
found the air too bracing, the wind too keen, the light too
brilliant, the situation too exposed, the sensation to a retiring
and sensitive man suggestive of standing in a pillory. For
his own part, he preferred to work in the dark, or rather in a
sort of twilight of his own creating.
He was a fat, round-faced man of fifty, with a certain
stamp upon his expression which, rightly or wrongly, we are
accustomed to regard as indicative of habitual self-indulgence.
He smoked a great-bowled German pipe, which might hold
half an ounce or so, all day long; and he sat at the front
window of his house in Stamford-street contemplating the
passers-by when he was not studying a picture. There grew
up from the area a thin and skeleton-like vine, which threw
its slender arms across his window, and gave an air of verdure
and Eden-like innocence to his features, as they beamed

behind the sickly leaves in summer. In winter the tree
suggested the similitude of the spider in his web.
This morning, the leaves being not yet out, and only a
green budding visible along the branches, he had the spidery
Look as his flabby face shone through the panes. He was
not alone. A man in the last depths of shabbiness was with
him, standing hat in hand, a suppliant.
“Give me work, Mr. Hermann. I can do it well and
quickly."
“ Tell me about New York first, what you was doing there."
"I was copying there."
“Aba! he was gopying; Zo, what was he gopying ?”
This impudent rascal habitually adopted the use of the
third person in talking to those who asked for work, with the
deliberate intention of insulting his visitors, and an inward
chuckle at the thought that most of them did not know they
were being treated as servants, and were too miserable to
resent it if they did.
“I was with Messrs. Fourbe, Gredin, and Fripon, the
largest picture dealers in America."
“I know them, I know them. Let him sit down and tell
me all he can about their business.”
“There is not much to tell. They had good copies of
pictures made in Rome, Dresden, and Florence, and their
chief business was to have more copies made from them.”
“ And they sold them as originals. Most unbrinzibled."
“No, they were sold as genuine copies by good living
artists, made on the spot. It is a safer business. They used
to have a canvas stretched on the wall, and I and two or
three others copied all day, as quickly as we could. As fast
as the pictures were finished, they were cut out and framed.
Mostly they were sold by auction. I've got a very rapid
hand, sir."
“Goarse,” Mr. Hermann replied. “ Ferry goarse, that
kind of work.”
“You see, sir, copying does not require the fine painting,
Mr. Gredin used to say, that is expected in an original.”
Mr. Hermann shook his head.
“Go away. I give you ten days. Make me a-a

He took a picture that was standing with its face to the
wall, and laid it on the table.

“Is it a gopy or is it an original ?"
“If it was anywhere but here, I should say it was an
original," replied the man. “I know enough of the trade to
be quite sure that it is not an original, or else it would not
be here."
“ Ha! ha! He is right, this fellow. He is right. Let him
go away now, and come back in ten days with the Greuze.”
The man left him, and Mr. Hermann watched him down
the steps.
“Ah, he is poor. He has done someding. I will find out
what. Himmel, here is the pewtiful young lady, Miss Reffel.
I am glad she did not meet that other poor teffel.”
He saw Marion coming up to his door, and went to open
it
himself.
“Gott pless me!” he cried; “it's Miss Reffel. Come, my
tear young lady, come in. What a bleasure to see you, and
what a plessing to know that you are well! Come in, ana
sbow me what
you have prought me. It will be coot; oh, it
will be coot. I know that it will be coot. There—sit down.

look at the bictures while we talk. There's a pewti-
ful thing, now. Give me the liddle barcel—20-yes-zo. What
do you think of that for a real and genuine Linnell—a rare
and pewtiful Linnell ?”
It was a delicious, soft, warm, sunlit scene-a field of stand-
ing corn, with a tree at the right hand, and a wood behind.
Creeping up in the background, a thunder-cloud.
" It is a very nice picture," said Marion; "but it looks to
me like a copy.”
He laid down Marion's parcel unopened, and held the
picture to the light.
“A gopy!” he jerked out, angrily. “A gopy! Why does
she think it is a gopy ?”
"Perhaps I am wrong," Marion replied; "but I should
bave said, on looking at it, that there could be no doubt about
its being a copy. However, if you are sure
“If I am sure!” he echoed. Why, if I am not sure,
who
the teffel can be sure ? I beg your bardon, young lady, but
if ever there was a genuine Linnell—why, there-never mind;
iet us look at the things in the liddle barcel.”
He opened it, and began to turn over the pictures one by
one, talking all the time as he held them to the light.
“I don't want to buy any more bictures. I think I shall

never buy any more so long as I live. There's more bictures
bainted than beoble to buy them. Times are ferry hard, Miss
Reffel.”
“Indeed they are, Mr. Hermann, else I should not be here;
out you must buy mine, if you please, because I want some
money."
“Flowers and fruit. Yes, ferry bretty-ferry bretty inteet.
But no one looks at flowers and fruit now. İt is a real bity
to see a young lady of your talent waste her brecious time
over flowers and fruit. You might as well go to the Zoo-
logical Cardens and baint the monguies. It would be pedder
to baint the monguies. Beoble like monguies, and they don't
like flowers and fruit. One, two, three-three bictures of
beaches and crapes. What shall we say for this boor lów
altogether?"
“I was thinking of a guinea a-piece," said Marion, humbly.
Mr. Hermann held up his hands in a kind of horror.
“A kuinea ?-twenty-one shillings a-piece for liddle things
like those? My tear young lady-oh, tear! oh, tear! It's
ferry difficult to refuse a sweet young bainter like you. Why
am I not a rich man? What shall I say to this young lady?

He emphasized his assertion with many and weighty
gestures of his fat white hands, and much nodding of his
very large head.
“Then what could you give me?” asked Marion.

though he and his English brethren were models of virtue
and honesty)—“suppose they give us forty shillings; that's
the outside figure. I will risk that, Miss Reffel, to oblige you;
and it makes-ja, zo-yoost ten shillings a-piece.”
He took out his purse and counted out three half-sovereigns,
which he pushed over to Marion.
“It seems very little,” she said. Could

“ My tear young lady, you have seen the figures—be
reasonable.”
The sight of the money was a temptation not to be resisted.
She took up the three little gold pieces, and put them in her
purse.
The honest Mr. Hermann went on with his examination of
the other pictures.
“Scene by the seaside-zo; light a little too strong-yes.
A bead-zo.
It was the head of Adrienne. " Where did
you get this face? Did you draw it from vancy, or did you
gopy it? Is it a bortrait ?”

I will give you a kuinea for every one that you baint like it.

make a liddle vortune out of your zister. Bring her here to
me to talk mit me; I should like to see this lovely Fenus,
this young Miss Reffel. Is she a bainter too? Bring her
to me.”
Marion hesitated for a moment, but she took the guinea.
After all, it was money, and she wanted it.
“Zo"-he pushed aside the water-colours.
“ You have forgotten the seaside piece,” said Marion.
It was so—the forgetful Mr. Hermann had pushed this
with the rest into his portfolio.
“Ah, yes—zo; I had forgotten. Let me have this liddle
bictung with the rest, Miss Reffel, because I am so ferry.

“No," said Marion, strictly; "give me a guinea for that

work in that picture.”
“Four days only! and she asks a kuinea-nearly two kuineas

“ Then seventeen. Come, Miss Reffel, come. We are old
friends."
let me have it back; and let me go.”
He took it out, and held it up. It was a pretty little thing
-a reminiscence of Comb Leigh, with the water dancing in
the little cove, the brambles climbing over the rocks, and on
the left the old carpenter cobbling the bottom of the boat,
while his tar-pot sent up its straight, thin column of smoke,
marring where it ascended the clear blue of the sky. It was
more than pretty, as the dealer saw; it had feeling and truth
in it, as well as beauty; it was a picture which, if it had a
good name at the back of it, would be worth thirty or forty
pounds at least.
Mr. Hermann placed it back in his portfolio.
“I suppose I must," he said ; "a young lady always does
what she likes with me. Here is a kuinea, and I shall have
to save and scrabe to make it up. Baint me more heads, Miss
Reffel, of your sister. Baint her in gostume. She would do
for Haidée ; she would do for Marcuerite; she would do for-
mein Gott! how she would do for Codifa. Baint her in dress
and out of dress, and I will gif you a kuinea for efery one,
efery one—a whole kuinea. I will.”
“My sister is not a model, Mr. Hermann.”
“ Then make her a mottel. Why is she not a mottel ?” he
replied, angrily. “If she is ferry poor, and you are ferry
poor, why is she not a mottel? You may as well be a mottel
as starve, I suppose.”
As Mr. Hermann in his younger days had sat in the Life
School himself, he thought strongly on the subject of models.
Moreover, as his wife, his mother, his sisters, and in fact his
whole family, had been in the profession, it was not likely that
he would hear the calling spoken of slightingly.
“I hope we shall not starve,” said Marion.
Mr. Hermann. May I bring you any other pictures, even if
I do not paint my sister's face again ?"

“How could I do that–by painting ?”
“Yes, by bainting; only it must be by bainting things for

and I think you could baint them well. That Linnell was

found it out at once."
“I thought you said it was genuine ?"
“So I did, so I did; but that was only to try you.
Now,
young lady, I will tell you some of the real secrets of the
bicture trade, and then you can make money for yourself. I
am always generous with the
young
ladies. I would do
any-
thing for the young ladies-anything in the wide, wide worlá;
and I am going to put a fortune in your hands—a fortune-
if you can work it properly."
“I am sure I am very grateful.”
“Now, listen; don't inderrupt. That Linnell—how was it
done ? My young man goes to an exhibition, and then to a
private gallery, and then to Ghristie's, and so on-wherever
they have got any Linnells. He is not allowed to sit down
and make a gopy, so he takes the gadalok, and, when nopody
is looging, he draws a tree from this bicture, and a field from
that, and a bit of field flower from another, and then, my
tear, he goes home, my young man does, and he makes å

bainted himself; and then he brings it to me, this gleffer
young man, and if the bicture is well done, and deceives a
stranger, I gif him-I gif him fife pounds for that bicture-
fife pounds, young lady."
“And what do you do with it ?”
“ What do I do with it? I sell it, my tear, I sell it to the
bicture tealers, who sell it to other bicture tealers, and it goes
round the trade, and then about the world. Mein Gott! if
all the calleries in Manchester and America were emptied,
there would be more Linnells and Codmans than fifty men
could baint in fifty years. And such a lot done by my young
men-oh, such a lot! I've got the glefferest young men you
effer saw.
Not this one,” he pointed to the 'Linnell which
lay on the table. “He shall go-he shall go to the teffel ;

afraid he is a young man of bad morals. I think he
trinks."
“What you want me to do,” said Marion, who had grown
very pale, “is, as I understand, to go round the exhibitions
and sale-rooms, take a bit from one picture, and a bit from
another, patch up the whole in a single painting, and call it
after a modern artist."
“That is it, my tear young lady; that is yoost what I want."
“Then, Mr. Hermann," she said, "you are a villain."
“Eh? mein Gott! Miss Reffel!"
He laid down his pipe, and looked at the girl with feigned
surprise.
“I say you are a dishonest, wicked man, Mr. Hermann. I
will have no dealings with you. Give me back my pictures,
and take your money, and let me go. Give me back my
pictures.
She laid her hand on the portfolio.
“Not so fast, Miss Reffel—not so fast. The bictures are
mine; I have bought them. I shall not give them back.”
“Then, Mr. Hermann, I will tell everybody who you are.
I will warn the world against you.”
“ Who will you tell ?” he asked, a shade of anxiety crossing
his face. “Who will you tell, Miss Reffel ?”
“I will tell Mr. Burls, the picture dealer.”
He burst into loud laughter.
“She will tell Purls! Ho! ho! ho! She is going to tell
Purls ! Eh, my tear, how Purls will be astonished ! I
suppose never was a man so astonished as Purls will be
astonished. Purls the honest, Purls the truthful ! Eh.
mein Gott! what a plow it will be to Purls! Go and tell
Purls, my tear; go and tell Purls immediately."
He laughed again. The idea of Mr. Burls being told was
too much for him,
“Go and tell all the tealers, Miss Reffel. Ah, they will be
almost as much astonished as Mr. Purls-good Mr. Purls !
Ho! ho! ho!”
Marion had no reply to make.
"Gome, my pretty young lady-gome, Miss Reffel, do not
be angry about nozings. Sit down again. Most of my
young men go off the same way when they first hear my plan.
Then they get poorer and poorer, and then they gome to me
to get rich. Sit down and listen; only one moment. See,

goddon-brokers want bictures; the New York merchants want
bictures. They can't all have bictures ; they won't have
gopies; but they don't know bictures. Then they go to the
tealers, and the tealers go to each other, and one after the
other they come to Gottfried Hermann. They come to me.
I am the benefactor of the world. Wherefer the English
language is spoken—wherefer there are rich beoble who want
hictures, there you will find the works of my young men.
Without me bictures by modern masters would be so tear,
that they would haf to puy bictures from the liddle sgrubs.
Think of that. By my help the goddon-brokers look at their
walls and say, 'That is a Linnell;' ho! ho! That is an
Eddy;' ha! ha! Here is a Leighdon, and there is a
Roberts. Won't you sit down, Miss Reffel, and listen
quietly? You are such a ferry nice girl, that I should not
like to see you go off in a rage.
“ The best of it is,” he went on, “ that they puy the
bictures because they think it is a goot infestment of their
money. Ho! ho! They leafe them in their last wills and
destamens to their heirs as ferry precious broberty. Ha! ha!
But when they are sent up to Ghristie's, they are sometimes
found out, and the heirs are sold. Ho! ho! ho! what an
infestment of money-eh? It serves them right, because if
they would buy the bictures of young artists like yourself,
Miss Reffel, they would get the falue of their money. They
would-mein Gott, they would. Sit down, young lady, and
Listen to me. Don't go away in a rage."
“I will hear no more," said Marion. “ Find some one else
to work your cheats for you."
“ You will come back, young lady—you will come back.
You will get no one to give you such a goot price for your
bictures as Gottfried Hermann; you will come then, and work
with my young men, and make pewtiful Eddys and Leighdons
and Linnells. Oh, yes; you will come back in a liddle time;
you will come back to your friend, and I bear you no malice,

indeed. 'Good-bye, Miss Reffel. Oh," he cried, as she left
the room,“ do baint your sister for me in oils; baint her as

CHAPTER XIX.
MARION was more than outraged by the proposals of this
unholy alien, this German producer of new and original
pictures—she was humiliated. If you want to humiliate your
enemy beyond endurance, ask him to do something which
shows the
very
small respect in which
you
hold him. To the
frailer vessels of humanity, indeed—those of ornamented
porcelain and coloured glass—it is worse to be asked to do
things dishonourable than it is actually to do them. Men
who negotiate foreign loans, men who bull and bear the stock
market, men who promote bubble companies, 'salt' mines,
draw up prospectuses, advertise sherry, send ships to sea that
are bound to sink, direct bankrupt life insurance associations,
adapt' plays, and abuse their rivals in anonymous criticism,-
all these can bear their heads proudly, and believe themselves
honourable and upright men. Ask them confidentially to
join in cracking a crib, fencing a wipe, or any of the humbler
and less remunerative forms of treachery, and lo! their self-
respect collapses like a pricked balloon. For a discreditable
proposal implies discredit. Marion had borne a great deal
without repining. She worked all day for a miserable pittance;
she saw others reap the fruits of her labours : this was alí
part of the condition of poverty; it did not make her seriously
unhappy. Never before this had she been asked to join in
fraud; never before this had the sweet waters of Hope in her
heart been troubled by such a prophecy as Mr. Hermann's,
that she would come back soon, poorer than ever, and be glad
to take his offer.
Should she ever go back so ruined and lost as to accept the
foul proposal ? Were there, then, such depths of misery as
would drive the unfortunate to give up even the semblance
of honour? Was it hopeless to struggle with the world?
And were all the avenues barred by the middle-man, to rob
and plunder those who must sell or starve ?
Alas, how many have given an answer! Ask of the
middle-man, if he will tell you. Look behind the curtain,
the kindly veil which hides the dreadful features of truth.

mission; they.cheat and plunder him ; they lie to him, and
steal from him; and when his last spark of ambition is
extinct, they make him the instrument of their forgeries. It
is no fiction, but a miserable truth, that Gottfried Hermann
exists and drives a roaring trade, keeping in his pay
who have been starved and cheated by Burls. The middle-
man bars all the avenues.
For the inoment, Marion felt as if she was in the bonds of
a stern necessity which was dragging her downwards, and
there seemed no escape. It was in vain that she fought
against the feeling. It seemed that the man spoke truly of
coming events. She would have to go back and humbly ask
for work—work of any kind, in order that she and hers might
eat a morsel of bread. And there came upon her brain, for
a while, the black pall of despair, when the mind is shrouded
with darkness that can be felt; when the distinction between
good and evil, for which Adam gave up Paradise, is lost again
and the earth seems to be hell; when there is no more hope,
and the voice of God is silent.
She would have to go back. She shuddered at thinking
of his soft and flabby face, his fat white hands, his oily voice.
It came upon her quite suddenly what he meant by asking
her to paint her sister for him-girls do not understand these
things at first. The thought was like a shower bath. She
shook herself together, and dared once more to resolve.
Never, come what might-poverty, disappointment, distress-
never would she go back to that man again.
She had wandered, wrapped in her gloomy thoughts, as far
as the Horse Guards, when this sudden rage seized her.
She crossed the road, and went into St. James's Park. The
sun was shining—it had been shining in the streets, indeed,
but
poor
Marion did not notice it there. Here it fell among
the young leaves of April, and flashed a twinkling, fitful light,
unlike the steady glow upon the foliage of summer, on the
bushes and shrubs putting on their brand-new spring apparel.
Here, too, the wild ducks, who habitually take up their winter
residence, because it is a safe and secluded spot, in St. James's
Park, were reminding each other of important appointments
at the back of the north wind, made eight months before in
those iceless seas where the secret of the Pole is hidden; the
swans were beginning the soft nothings which precede their
brief-lived marriage ties; and the sparrows, who are a prac-
tical folk, as a rule, and always intent on business, were

feeling the soft influence of the season, as well as Marion and
the nursemaids, who had the park to themselves. She turned
to the left, and walked along the banks of the lake, while
calmer and more hopeful thoughts gradually came back to
her. Her hands, which had been tightly locked, unclasped,
and she looked around her. After all, whatever happened,
they were not utterly destitute. She had her fifty pounds a
year, enough to give her some little standpoint from which
to resist the enemy. They were cast down, but not utterly
forsaken; by some means or other she would contrive, and
perhaps— But she checked the rising hope that perhaps
something would turn up. That is only the hope of a helpless
person. However, perhaps her own picture the thing into
which she had thrown all her soul and all her powers—might
somehow advance her. Of course, she never entertained the
least trust in the promises and expectations of her brother. She
was the family bread-winner; he was the family spendthrift.
It was all part of the great Providential design: some families
have an invalid ; some have one of weak intellect; hers had
one who could not work. In fact, it had two; but poor Adie,
who could not make money, had her functions, and kept house
for them all. I feel almost ashamed to add what is so apparent
to all, that Fred's helplessness in no way diminished Marion's
affection for him. It had even ceased to irritate her. She made
a never-ending series of excuses for him; he was her charge;
it was her duty to work for him.
Perhaps it was the soft spring air that brought Marion's
thoughts back to a peaceful channel ; perhaps, too, it was the
sunshine and the warmth that made her think of Gerald,
long lost, and that short love chapter in her life. Some people
like a novel that is all love; I am sure a life ought to be all
love, and especially that love which cannot be written in a
book, the best love of all, which follows the short-lived fever
of passion. The memory of Marion's brief romance left its
enduring mark upon her mind, making her softer, more
womanly, more open to sympathy, more ready to pity and
forgive. That is love's special function. Those who cannot
love are cruel, selfish, and unfeeling, like Narses. Those who
can, very likely have every kind of vice, but they have the
possibilities of affection, which means self-denial. "Joys,"
said Blake, painter and poet, “impregnate." The fruits of
even short-lived happiness are tenderness, thought for others,
and the gracious sacrifice of labour. Among women, those

are best who have been loved and have loved ; among men,
those are best who have staked their happiness upon the faith
and truth of a woman. You stake your love, perhaps, and
lose, but oftener you win; and always you are a gainer for
having dared to stake.
Marion paced the gravel backwards and forwards, thinking
of these things. Presently she became aware of a heavy
step behind her. The step seemed familiar; it drew up to
her, and she saw that it belonged to Dr. Chacomb.
“I saw you,” he said, “as I was on my way to the hospital.
May we have a little talk ?"
“If you will only talk about—if you will only not talk"
said Marion, thinking of the last night's conversation.
The doctor bowed gravely.
“You have only to express a wish, Miss Revel," he said;
“ besides,” he added, airily, “ the time has not come round
yet."
6 The time?”
“Yes. I began to think it possible six months ago. I
asked you then. You said, No. I asked you again last night.
You said, No. I shall ask you again in a little while—"
“And I must say No then. Oh, Dr. Chacomb, do not ask
me again.”
“I must, Miss Revel. If you say No, I shall ask again,
and again after that. I do not despair. You have owned
that you do not dislike me. I trust to time, though a man
can ill afford time at nine and forty. Meanwhile, I am con-
soling myself with hard work."
“I am glad that you are succeeding."
“ Thank you. Trust me, dear Miss Revel, that I shall not
obtrude my suit upon you more than I can help.”
If the man would only not make such speeches! Who
could help being irritated with him ?
Marion turned the conversation,
“Tell me about your hospital."
“Would you be interested to hear about it? Let us sit
down. There is a seat, and I really do think the east winds
at last. Now, what shall I tell you? I had an in-
spiration, as the French say—they are very profane, the French.

..
This statement was not strictly accurate. He should have
said that he had taken money from Chauncey Chacomb, inas-
much as he was receiver of the rents, and accounted to
nobody. A dishonest receiver might have pocketed the
whole. Dr. Chacomb, wiser than the Unjust Steward of the
parable, frankly confessed that he borrowed the money. The
fact of the lender not being consulted was, of course,
consequence.
“I borrowed
money
from
poor Chauncey," he said, “and I
started this hospital. It is now in full swing. Out-patients
in the morning, seen by my assistants; in-patients visited
every day by myself, physician-in-chief; and private patients
received at the institution itself, as well as in Adelaide-street,
Carnarvon-square. The hospital is supported by voluntary
contributions. Some day I will show you the prospectus,
drawn up by the secretary—a clever fellow : I picked him up
cheap—who might have done great things in literature but
for his unfortunate crook of the elbow. As he only crooks it
at night, it does not matter to the hospital; and I take care
to keep him poor."
“And you are now a great physician ?"
“Hum! I should say Yes to anybody but yourself. But
you, Miss Revel, are a sort of touchstone. I like to tell you
the exact truth. I am not a great physician—there are no
great physicians; but I have learned things of late, and I
am as good as any of my brethren—a good deal better than
Dr. Porteous, of Savile-row, who pretends—the pompous old
donkey!—to be the leader in gout. Wait a year or two, till
I have snuffed him out."
He snorted, and looked as angry as a writer whose pet field
has been invaded.
“I am sure you are a good physician.”
“I use new medicines, and they say I am a quack. Quack'
quack! quack! Any man can say that. I do not follow the
English Pharmacopoeia, and I am not too proud to learn
from other people. I chalk out my own line. Medicine in
this country, my dear young lady, is dead; the doctors are
smitten with the disease of stupidity. They neither inquire,
nor invent, nor experiment. They do not dare try a fresh
drug."
Perhaps it is as well not to try things that have no pro-
perties.”

who learned it from theirs, and so on, till we get to the Witch

Witch of Endor, only my old woman never heard of Samuel,
and therefore could not call him up. I would have asked her
to, by gad! like a bird, if I thought Samuel knew anything
about drugs for gout."
“Then you ought to cure everybody," said Marion.
“ No. There is a time for every man when, by the rules of
his constitution, he is bound to die. No doctor can stave off
that day; all he can do is to prolong life till the day comes.
My patients want to be told their time. I pretend to know

“Now, my dear Miss Revel, how can there be ? Is it
likely Pray believe me when I assure you that if I heard
anything about Gerald, even though it were to destroy my
own hopes, I would tell you immediately. But I shall not.
Poor Gerald !”
He shook his head solemnly, and opened the letter.
“Chauncey is quite sane, except upon one or two points.
He is fully persuaded that he murdered your father, and he
has little hallucinations on minor subjects, which are of no
importance."
They were certainly of no importance to Marion, but they
were of considerable importance to Chauncey, inasmuch as
they led him to believe that he had no control over his own
affairs ; that the doctor spent his money for him, ordered his
household for him, gave him a housekeeper and a guardian,
and administered everything for his own behoof and special
advantage.
“ You see,” he added, "I go down as often as I can-about
once a fortnight-to see that the place is kept up.”
“ Dear Comb Leigh !” murmured Marion—" when shall I
see it again ?”
“Whenever you like—whenever you like! Nothing in the
world could give me greater pleasure than to take you to
Chacomb."
“And Mr. Chauncey Chacomb ?"
As if it matters what he thinks about it!"
“ Thank you,” said Marion. “I do not think I can ever
go to Chacomb Hall, after what has happened.”
He was a coarse-grained man, this doctor, she thought.

thing that drove Chauncey so wild at the last. He made me say
that I agreed with him, and thus your father laughed at him.
He has got that picture hanging in his own bed-room now,
and he looks at it every day—the back of it, I mean—with
the hope of bringing out the details. Poor Chauncey! He
never was a good fellow; and I think I like him as well now
that he is known to be cracked as when he was only foolish,
but considered to be of sound mind.”
“ But people—his tenants—consider him of sound mind

“No; they only pretend to. They know well enough that

noticed. The housekeeper—a most worthy, estimable woman
-writes to me to-day, and I will read the letter. I have not
had time to look at it yet.”
“MY DEAREST JOE"—(“I beg your pardon,” he stopped
and choked)—“My dear Dr. Chacomb—It is a fortnight
since you were down here, and I hoped to see you last Satur-
day'-“I could not go," he explained, “ on account of dear
Lady Strongwater's gout, which threatened to fly to the
stomach; I was up with her all night")_“I hoped to see
you last Saturday. Your patient has been going on pretty
well, though full of tantrums, as usual. He has been very
fractious for the last week, but he does not want to see you.
In fact, I think, in his present mood, you hal better not
Last week nothing would suit him but going to the
cliff where the accident took place. I believe he wanted to
roll over himself. I refused to let him go ; so he said he
should wait till midnight, get out of window, and go and
throw himself down where Captain Revel fell. Then I gave
in—had a little party made up of Jem"-(" You remember
Bos'n Jem, Miss Revel")" Charles, the stable-boy, and my.
self. We all set off to walk to the cliff together. Directly
we got outside the gates, he said it was ridiculous, and
marched straight back again. Then he went to the Collection
and cried ; said nobody cared for him.”—“It is one of the
features of hallucination, Miss Revel, that the patient cries if
he is put out.")—“I prescribed port with his dinner, and we
got him comfortably to bed.”-“Very good, very good. A
bottle of port is a fine thing for hallucinations. If you feel
low, wind yourself up. Sound medical maxim.")
“ Poor Mr. Chacomb !"
The doctor seemed to forget that he was reading this in-
teresting epistle aloud, and went on with it.
“In the morning he was quiet, and we had a talk."
Here there was a gap, because the writer had taken another
sheet. The doctor looked at this, changed colour violently,
and crumpled the letter in his band.
“Well," he said, with an effort," there's nothing more-
nothing of importance. My poor cousin is hopelessly gone.
I shall not lock him up, because he can do no harm where he
is, and the treatment I prescribe for him will be best in the
long-run. As it is, as it is—" He shrugged his shoulders.

“Yes,” said Marion; "when Gerald comes home again he
will thank you.”
“ You think,” he began.
“I am sure. Whenever I think of it, I feel the same
assurance. Gerald is coming home. It is impossible that he
should be dead, and that I should not know it.”
“That is superstition."
“I cannot help it. We feel the presence of the living with
us; why should we not feel the fact that they are alive ?
Gerald is alive at this moment; and I think, because I feel it
so much more strongly now than I did a year ago, that he is
coming home.”
“Good-bye, Miss Revel," said the doctor, abruptly. “Put
poor Gerald out of your thoughts, and-if you can put me,
my poor unworthy self, in his place.”
He walked down the gravel path with his heavy tread,
which was so silent on a carpet, and disappeared.
“What a fool I am! Why should I want to read Julia's
letters to Marion without reading them myself first ?”
He took the letter out of the envelope again, and read it.
“MY DEAR JOE"-("Hang her!")—“It is a fortnight"
("I read all that to Marion”)—“And now I have got some-
thing important to tell you. I knew that you would never
marry me, in spite of all your promises; and for the last three
months Chauncey has been urging me to marry him on the
sly. So yesterday we went quietly to the registrar's office,
where I had had the notices put up”—“The deceitful little
devil!")—"and now, if you please, I am Mrs. Chacomb, of
Chacomb Hall, Chacomb."-("The deuce you are!")
Chauncey is very good to me. It is all nonsense to say
he is mad; he is no more mad than you, and he declares he
will prove it.” (“The devil he will !")—“He is a little flighty
at night, and sees faces in the dark—so would any one in

hear in such a quiet place. Dear Joe, you know that I never

CHAPTER XX.
SATURDAY morning was an off-day with Dicky, so far as
Mr. Lilliecrip was concerned. He was wont to spend it at
the British Museum, in preparation of the articles, para-
graphs, and letters which formed his tale of labour for the
Weekly Intelligence and the Christian Clerk. He was awakened
by the street cries, which in London do duty for the dogs of
rural solitudes and the lark of the poets. He rose hastily,
for a thought flashed across him in his dreams, piercing the
innermost marrow of his soul.
“Good heavens!” he gasped, rushing his toilet, so to
speak—"eight o'clock already; and to-morrow is Sunday.
Never mind, I may be in time yet.”
did not, as when we saw him last, waste time in
lamenting or apostrophising the deficiencies of his wardrobe
On the contrary, he huddled everything on as fast as possible,
reduced his curly and abundant locks to something like
smoothness, and hastened downstairs.
At the door of the ancient dame of whom mention has
already been made, he met her granddaughter, Miss Ethel-

reda Vyvyan, commonly known as “Ready Vyvyan" by
those who knew her best, and familiar to public eyes and
Aars in connection with the Royal Hemisphere Theatre,
where she took second parts in burlesques: an accomplished
young lady; one who had a strong, if not a melodious voice,
and who could be trusted to get through a song without
absolutely losing sight of time and tune; who could dance
passably; who looked charming in "page" costume-she
preferred it "full page,” she said; and who was pretty
enough for the simple costume of the theatrical village
maiden with short skirts, silk stockings, and a coquettislı
hat. But she was happiest in a costume à la Henri Quatre,
which displayed more of the figure than womankind in
western Europe have thought necessary since their con-
version to Christianity. “ Popsy,” her grandmother called
her; and what her surname really was, or her Christian
name either, I am sorry to say, I do not know. She was
carrying the breakfast milk upstairs, and looked as fresh and
blooming as if she had not come home after a late
supper at
two o'clock in the morning. Seeing the poet, she set down
her milk, and laughed and clapped her hands.
“How are you, Dicky?" she asked, with a familiarity that
spoke of old and confirmed friendship. “How are you this
morning, old boy ? None the worse for last night ? Let me
look at you: eyelids rather red, cheeks a little twitchy,
tongue a little dry-got a fur upon it, I should think.
You've been going it, Dicky Carew. Coming in to pay poor
old granny her money? Not you."
“ The fact is,” said Dicky, “that I am going into the City
to draw
my
dividends."
“Walker!" was the vulgar rejoinder of this young lady.
She accompanied it with a gesture which we may briefly in-
dicate by saying that it betrayed a complete mastery over her
limbs, and an early training for the ballet. “Walker! How
much do you owe the old lady? Never mind ; you'll pay me
some day, whenever I'm hard up, and it will wait. I've got
lots of money now. I say, Dicky, come and see me to-night.
Better! I'll give you a pit ticket. New piece. Heroine
jumps from the flies into a cascade of real water. 'Heaven
help me, I am lost! Death before dishonour! So_" She
took an imaginary header over the banister, and posed. “Not
one of them, not even Dardie Duncan, had the pluck to take
it, except me; and, bless you, if you've got good eyes, it's as

easy as—as saying you are off to draw your dividends; only
it wouldn't do to miss your tip. Better come, Dicky.”
“I can't,” said Dicky. “I am going to dine this evening
with the Countess of Grasmere, else I should be quite at your
service.”
“ Lord! Now I am going to have supper with Prince
Bithisnozoff, the Russian swell, and a few of his very par-
ticular friends, at the Prætorium, after the curtain drops.
Bet you my supper, Dicky, will be a good deal jollier than
suppose you'll get new heels to your boots
first, and take the swallow-tail out of pawn, for her ladyship's
dinner? Good-bye, Dicky."
She disappeared singing the last burlesque melody. A
moment afterwards she reappeared.
“Dicky, old boy," she cried after his retreating figure, “I
heard you go upstairs last night at half-past one. You only
tumbled down-altogether, that is-once and a half, and
carried your boots and hat quite safely all the way up. I felt
for you, poor fellow! What a dreadful thing to go to bed
sober! Haven't you got a bad headache this morning ?”
Dicky made no reply, but ran down the stairs.
“She's a remarkable girl, Popsy," he said, outside the
house—"a very talented and agreeable girl. I never quite
know whether she is chaffing, or whether she wants me to
marry her. Poor thing! I suppose it's the latter-all girls
do, somehow. Poor Popsy! More broken hearts."
Perhaps it is as well that we do not know always in what
estimation we are held by our friends. Certainly, nothing
was farther from Miss Popsy's thoughts than to marry Dicky
Carew. I heard, indeed, last month that she had gone to
church with a highly respectable young walking gentleman
from the provincial stage, and that they were both going out
to California on a professional engagement. Marry Dicky
Carew, indeed! Popsy knew a great deal better than that.
At the bottom of the stairs, on the ground floor, he passed
the hospitable door of Mrs. Medlar; but he crept softly by on
tiptoe.
“ It is the shrine of material comfort,” he murmured. “ She
is fat, she is fair, she is comfortable; she has still many sum-
mers of buxomness before her; she has at least a hundred and
fifty pounds a year. When I sow my wild oats, I will marry
Mrs. Medlar, and let the others pine away in cold neglect."

him. He spent it, and fourpence, in a coffee-shop, where a
cup of fragrant mixture, whose component parts contained no
beans from sunny Mocha, with a slice of bread and butter,
formed his breakfast. He had but little appetite for a break-
fast, and sighed not for luxuries. Contentment, after all, is a
continual feast. At five minutes to nine he arrived at the
gates of the British Museum. As the clock struck nine, he
passed through them.
Nothing but the strongest sense of duty could induce me to

is too imperative.
be known to some of my readers that there exists in
the British Museum, for the use of readers only, a lavatory
furnished with the customary jack towels, and supplied with
soap. Mr. Carew sought this retreat with a calm, deliberate,
and thoughtful air, as if he were about to remove the dust of
a long walk, prior to study. Arrived there—he was happy in
finding himself the first-he proceeded-oh, Dicky ! Dicky!-
to pick out and appropriate to himself the largest and best
tablet of soap. The careful way in which he did this, the
critical inspection of the soap, the honourable sense which led
him to take but one, and leave the rest for his friends, all
pointed to habit. This was too true. Among a certain body
of advanced thinkers, moral philosophers whose code was
based upon a broader view of right than most can boast, there
had grown up, little by little, a custom of avoiding the small
and annoying expense of buying soap by taking what was put
out in the lavatory. They annexed for themselves what was
meant for mankind. They substituted the particular for the
general. By long habit they had grown inured to the cus-
tom, so that it had now none of the stings of conscious sin;
and though they never spoke of it among themselves, they had
come to regard the soap as a grateful but silent testimonial
of regard from England to her men of genius. They may
have been, and doubtless were, men of the keenest and most
delicate sense of honour in other things; but there are, as
everybody knows, secrets in every profession. Go to! We
waste our breath in proclaiming the sins of other trades, but
carry on our own. Let the publican put quassia in the beer,
cocculus Indicus in the stout, fusel-oil and potato spirit in
the sherry ; let the grocer sand the sugar; let the parson play
at heing a priest; let Mr. Burls and his crew go on selling
copies for originals; and let the obscure literary hack appro

priate the soap in the lavatory, as he appropriates his "

abolished, but its former tenants have only migrated. When

go somewhere else. Pope's poets and pamphleteers are dis-
persed at night; but in the day you may find them all in that
vast circular apartment, where light, pens, ink, blotting-
paper, and warmth everything but air—are given, with the
noblest library in the world, without money and without
price, to those who like to use them. Far be it from me to
defend Dicky's custom. I only record it. The librarians
lament the loss of engravings from the books, which are cut
out and sold by the more needy among the readers for one
penny apiece. But the daily loss of the soap has never yet,
to my knowledge, formed the subject of a paragraph in the
annual report, a complaint posted up in the room, or a parlia-
mentary commission.
Mr. Carew wrapped his soap in paper, and deposited it
in his coat pocket. Then he repaired to the reading-room
and began his work.
His labours-for he had postponed everything to the last
day-were of a divided nature. The mission of the Weekly
Intelligence was to show up the aristocracy in their true colours,
to paint the bloatedness of our prelates, and to represent
faithfully the down-troddenness of the British workman. It
was also devoted to the purpose of hiding from the workman
who bought the paper the fact that he is in these latter days
falling into such a condition of mind and body as no class
of artizans have ever before experienced, inasmuch as he is
incapable of combining except for the purpose of getting
higher wages and lower hours, that he has ceased to take an
intelligent interest in his work, that he lives for himself alone,
and that he drinks away all that he can spare from a half-
starved household. To conceal these home-truths, and to
reveal the other falsehoods, was the raison d'être of the Weekly
Intelligence. Dicky, who was on the staff, was entrusted with
the easy work of showing up the vices of the great.
On the other hand, the Christian Clerk was a paper of an
altogether different tendency. Its object was to circulate
among the Church congregations. It aimed at being the
friend of churchwardens, and the companion of all Anglican
vestrymen. It had no theological bias, but prostrated itself

before everything that wore a white tie, and could use the
letters M.A. For licentiate persons it had small respect.
Dicky was an old and valued cervant on the staff of this
organ. He was regarded by the elitor as an unfortunate and
misunderstood man of genius. There was scholarship in his
papers, lucidity and strength in his arguments, and a certain
solid style, he would say, which one might look for in vain
among other ecclesiastical papers.
Dicky began vigorously to look for material for the Weekly
Intelligence. He took down half a dozen old volumes of the
Gentleman's Magazine, all thumbed and worn by the exploring
fingers of countless predecessors.
He had his paper ready at his right hand, and pen in hand
to note anything that occurred. For some time the search
was fruitless. His rapid eye ran up and down the columns
without finding anything.
“I seem to know them all by heart,” he groaned. It's
disgusting to see how men find them out.”
Then he took down another half-dozen, and began a new
search. After a little he found something that seemed to
suit his purpose, and began to write.
“In the yellow and faded pages of an old magazine”—Dicky
always began his little anecdote paragraph this way—“we
discover the following curious and interesting pieces of
information.”
And so on. By dint of going through a dozen volumes of
Sylvanus Urban, he managed to pick out what amounted to
nearly a column and a half of small type. There was a riddle,
the wording of which he altered a little ; there was a short
account of a gentleman's seat, showing that it was one of the
oldest mansions in England, to which Dicky added that its
owners were the most profligate ; there was a notice on the
York Assizes, where no fewer than five and twenty were left
for execution, two being respited—the indignant writer called
attention to the fact that the judges were gentlemen ; there
was a report of an action in the West Indies, in which Dicky
remarked that the common sailors, who did the fighting, got
no mention. And so on, all being flat, stale, and unprofitable;
for Dicky was long past the time when he used to try to put
things pleasantly, and his réchauffés were served up week by
week, without the slightest disguise.
The Weekly Intelligence finished, Mr. Carew turned his
attention to the Christian Clerk.

This was a more important business. He was engaged
apon a series of brief papers on the ecclesiastical questions of
the day, and it behoved him to exercise considerable care to
steer clear of theological difficulties. As Dicky's only prin
ciple in literature was to steal everything he wrote, and never
to read without an eye to plagiarism, it was first of all ne-
cessary to discover safe ecclesiastical material. He found
this among the pamphlets of the last century, a corpus
of good work too often neglected by the starveling small fry
of literature. If by any remarks of mine I can turn the petty
plagiarist into a new, fruitful, and wholesome preserve, I shal?
be glad to indicate to him the road by which Dicky Carew
might-alas, that I must write the word might !—have risen
to literary distinction. Dicky was the original discoverer-he
kept the discovery to himself-of the pamphlet. He loved it
of all ages, but he loved it most for practical purposes a
hundred years old; for then it was sure to possess some of
the graces of modern writing. He would transfer anything
he pleased simply by copying it out. Now, in earlier work
there was often a passage, a turn of thought, or a phrase, too
majestic in its roundness, or too involved, for the modern
scribe. In such cases, Dicky had all the trouble of taking the
idea and writing it over again himself. But the pamphlet
kept for fifty or a hundred years in the wood, so to speak,
acquired a fullness, a mellowness, and a delicacy of flavour
quite unknown in the ephemeral productions of the day. He
felt safe even with pamphlets thirty years old. They were
quite sure to have been written by a man whose age would
be somewhere about forty, so that the probability was very
much in favour of his having gone to a world where pla-
giarisms are not sharply looked after-where, indeed, such
things are impossible. Armed with one of these, Dicky boldly
dipped his pen in the ink, and copied whole paragraphs,
regardless of possible consequences.
On this day he wrote a careful and elaborate argument,
from the Anglican point of view-i.e., from a modern pamphlet
dated about the year 1843—in favour of Church Establish-
ments. The writer of the pamphlet from which he cribbed,
one of the Oxford movement of that date, had not yet become
convinced of the desirability of Church freedom with a view
to reducing the laity to Church discipline, and therefore
advocated Church and State. His successors have learned
hetter Nor had he yet, as those of the following generation

have done, taught himself that overweening respect for
authority which enables the Ritualist to see a friend and
certain protector in Rome. Therefore he talked about the
“ errors” of the Roman Catholic Church. Dicky modernized
his work to suit what he understood to be the latest phase of
thought. At the close of his argument he allowed himself a
few phrases of a really eloquent piety, with texts which he
found at the end of the pamphlet. They were of the kind he
liked-sonorous, well rounded, eminently Christian, and
dogmatic. When Dicky folded up his papers in two parcels
that evening, addressing one to the printer of the Weekly
Intelligence and the other to the printer of the Christian Clerk,
he felt that he had done a good day's work, and earned the
humble stipend which he was receiving for labours of such
great importance. The one envelope was full of blasphemy
against all authority, divine or worldly; the other was, as
hotel advertisers say, “replete with the sweetest, the most
sentimental, the most pious adhesion to all constituted
authority, and especially to the Anglican bishops.
It was then five o'clock, and it must not be supposed that
the day's work had been conducted entirely without refresh-
ment. Not so. A select circle, comprising half a dozen of
the choicer spirits, were wont to meet at one, and after the
simple dinner of a chop or a sausage, with half a pint of
stout, discuss the more abstruse literary topics over pipes
and gin-and-water. Those who were in funds sometimes
carried on these Tusculan disputations with such ardour, and
Bo long, as to be too late to return to the Museum, in which
case they would find their mss. and the books from which
they had last been stealing kept for them the next morning
by their friends the attendants.
They were a seedy and generally a morose crew. Dicky
alone among them preserved a cheerfulness which was mostly
due to his splendid constitution. They were engaged in
copying for scholars, in compiling for third-rate publishers,
in inventing blood and thunder stories for the lowest perio-
dicals, or, like Dicky himself, in writing for the papers which
appeal to the class just removed from pauperdom. How
they drifted into the calling of “letters” it is hard to say.
Perhaps one or two of them had been gentlemen, and had
been scholars. Possibly most of them had deserted the lower
ranks of clerks, or begun, like Dicky, as ushers in commercial
academies. Not one of them deserved better pay or higher

consideration than he got; not one had a right to complain
that he served a hard master, because all were such bad
servants.
Among these friends Dicky drank a modest allowance-
three glasses—and returned to his duties. It was the thirr
which inspired him with the happy thought of adding th
final clauses of pious ejaculation above referred to. Perhap
it was the same glass which confused the keenness of his vision
to a certain extent, and made it possible for him to commit
the most fatal mistake of his life ; for when he addressed the
manuscript, folded and neatly tied up, by an inadvertence
that he was destined to regret all his life, he sent off the
packet destined for the radical and even atheistic Weekly
Intelligence to the mild and religious Christian Clerk, while
that intended for the Clerk was addressed to the Intelligence,
He then made the best of his way to the offices of Clerk
and Intelligence, which were in two neighbouring streets, left
his copy, marked "immediate," for the printer, and then
began to think what he could do with himself till seven, the
earliest hour possible for the commencement of a “night.”
Dicky especially disliked walking, because it wore out the
heels of his boots, and yet he generally found himself con.
demned to pace the stony-hearted streets alone with his
thoughts for nearly two hours every day, the time between
the closing of the Museum and the commencement of the
symposium. To be alone with their thoughts is to some men
a perennial source of happiness. To Dicky it was exactly the

resources, you come, after a time, to regard it as a necessary
evil, like a humpback or a stiff leg, and cease to think of it in

nuisance. Provided Mrs. Spenser confined her applications
for help to herself, Marion hardly minded. It was but so

chief thing she feared was that some time or other this excit.
able lady would break her promise, and invade their lodgings,
where Adie might see her.
Mrs. Spenser, desperately poor, as has been shown, lived
in about the most ignoble neighbourhood in all London,
always excepting certain portions of Pentonville. It was in
Sun-court, St. Giles's, a place where every room held a family,
and many rooms held more than one family each. She lived
there with her son, called, by reason of a St. Vitus's dance
which possessed the boy, and impelled him to kick out at odd
times, to the discomfiture and indignation of passers-by,
Rickety Jem. She had one room for herself and her son, and
they slept in opposite corners. Try, if you can, to realize the
degradation of a woman who had indeed once been a lady,
when she had one room for herself and her boy of fourteen.
The infamies and miseries of poverty can all be summed up
in this. Nothing—not even insufficiency of food, insufficiency
of clothes, or abject dependence-is so great an evil as the
enforced huddling together in one room of a whole family. It
is too horrible to tell of, too horrible to think of.
Yet the people in Sun-court were not exceptionally vicious
or wicked.
There are courts—one I know of, only a few
yards north of Mecklenburgh-square - where a decently
dressed man who ventured to pass through in the daytime
would be infallibly set upon and robbed, and where if a
policeman dares to show his burly form he is saluted with
Aower-pots rained upon him from the windows, with other
casual manifestations of an unpopularity that belongs to a
class rather than to an individual. In Sun-court anybody
might pass through at any hour with impunity. The police-
man was looked on as not a friend exactly, but as a necessary
evil. The inhabitants were harmless, except in one particular,
that they were poor. When people are poor, however, they
are dangerous. It is a fact well known to modern legislators,
just as it was known to Julius Cæsar, that a well-fed man is
contented with the order of things. That is why, if a member
of Parliament shows signs of making himself disagreable, he
is presented with something good in the shape of a commis-

from gentlemen at the Metropolitan railway stations. It wag
a miserable and precarious livelihood. She was a miserable
and a discontented woman. She held herself aloof from her
neighbours, on the plea that she was a lady. She tried, but
ineffectually, to keep the boy separated from the other boys
in the street, on the ground that his father was a gentleman.
The people in the court called her Lady Spenser-a title
which she accepted with a kind of gratitude.
How long does it take to reduce a lady to the lowest dregs ?
how long a gentleman to the level of the habitual criminal ?
It is a question one hardly dares to ask. We may pass from
one stratum of life to another with greater ease than we like
to think of. The descent of Avernus is steeper than we imagine.
The difference between those who wear respectable clothes and
those who do not is less than we are pleased to think. Thou.
sands have found it easy to step across the gulf, and once
across, all must perforce stay there. For the heaven of re-
spectability is like Abraham's bosom, as described by Josephus
Finasmuch as, if you once get out of it, you can never get
back again.
It was not Marion's first visit to this dreadful den. She
had been there once, a year before this. Then it was a bitter
frost, and the depth of winter. She went to the place, resolved
to tell the woman that she could do no more for her: it was
when her resources had dwindled down to her fifty pounds
year. She thought it would be an injury to her own two
helpless ones to do anything further for this wretched crea-
ture, who repaid her kindness with ingratitude, and threatened
as often as she begged. But when she saw the miserablo
tenant of the room wrapped in a single blanket, without a
fire, without a penny, trying to forget hunger in sleep, while
her boy ran about the iron-bound streets crying his Echoes and
his cigar-lights, her heart melted, and she refrained from
saying what she meant to say. Since then, through fair
weather or foul, whether she earned much money or little, the
woman had her share of it. She was alternately defiant and
humble. She threatened still, and begged. She was intempe-
rate. She had not improved at all, and she was always a bitter
grief and burden to Marion ; but she could not be cast off.
It was a greater moral shock than the poor girl had ever
known, to see this woman when they came to London—to
know what she had been, and to see what she was. But the
first visit to her lodging formed an epoch in her mind, because

it revealed to her some of the dreadful things which lie un.
beeded at one's feet. For the first time in her life she found
herself face to face with a hopeless misery which she could
do next to nothing to alleviate, and that little at the expense
of those who were also dependent upon her. And yet the
woman had a claim too.
A lady-was it possible that she could ever have been a
lady? What remains of ladyhood, what traces of the delicate
blossoms which are nurtured by gentle breeding, could be
discerned in this poor fallen creature? Surely none, save in
her speech, which was soft and clear, and not yet disfigured
by the toads, snakes, efts, and other dreadful things which
fell from the mouths of her neighbours. That was all. The
current of her thoughts—like a river whose inouth gets silted
up, and so forms broad and malarious lagoons-had lost all
settled purpose, if it ever had any, and was now dispersed in
the marshy flats of food-providing. If this was certain, she
began to think of the day's luxuries—now the maximum of
gin obtainable. She looked for nothing more; she hoped for
nothing more. When she looked back, which was seldom,
she was tormented with Dante's worst sorrow, the remem-
brance of former happiness. She had no hope for the future,
because she never looked forward. As for the present, she
knew now of only three evils in the world—cold, hunger, and
pain: she acknowledged two delights—warmth, and the
imaginary paradise of intoxication. She was a ruined and
hopeless woman. But such as she was—a miserable outcast,
a creature lost to virtue, an unrepentant Magdalene-she
bad a claim
upon
Marion.
Marion found her working at her cardboxes. There was
no carpet, no blind or curtain, and no furniture except a table
and a chair. Mrs. Spenser had the table covered with the
materials, which she was cutting and shaping with wonderful
dexterity. Her features in repose were haggard, but regular.
She had once, assuredly, been beautiful. A mattress lay in
the corner, the sunlight upon it streaming through the dirty,
panes of glass, and falling full on the face of a boy who lay.

upon
his back. He was a sharp-faced, bright-eyed boy,
nearly fourteen years of age; but he looked very much younger,
because he was so small and thin. He was dressed in the
merest rags. By his side lay a blanket. He was barefooted,
his cheeks were hollow and wasted, his skin had the flush
and brightness which belong to consumption, and he had a
hacking cough.

Tell me
“Is this your-your son ?” said Marion, with some hesita-
tion.
" That is my son,” Mrs. Spenser answered. " Don't inter-
rupt me; I've got some work come in, and I am in an indus-
trious mood. I've promised Jem some tea by and by. You
can't sit down, Marion Revel, because I've only got one chair,
which I want. Tell me what you think of my boy.
who he is like. Is he like me, do you think? Look up,
Jem, and show the lady your face.”
Jem turned his face obediently. Marion stooped, with a
shudder, and patted his cheek. The boy was exactly like her
sister Adie.
“Have you brought me some money, Marion Revel? If
you have, put it on the table. You are a wonderful girl to
come here at all. I wish I could get on without your help.
I'm in a better temper than I was this morning. Don't be
angry
with
me,
will you? And don't think about what I say
when I lose my head. I could not hurt her, you know.”
She was changed since the morning, and spoke with a cer-
tain softness pleasant to hear.
“I can spare you ten shillings. Will that do pº
“It isn't much, but it must do."
“There's the rent, mother," said Jem, with a sharpness
beyond his years. “Don't you forget the rent.”
As he spoke, a St. Vitus's trembling of the limbs seized
him, which explained at once why everybody called him
Rickety Jem.
He half rose from the mattress, in evident pain.
“It is the cab that ran over him yesterday," said his
mother. “Lie down again, my boy."
“I was going to get you the gin, mother.”
Mrs. Spenser did not blush for shame; but she laughed,
which was her only equivalent.
“Presently, my son. He knows his mother's ways,” she
explained. “I told you all about them long ago, Marion
Revel. You can't say I ever hide anything from you."
Alas, no !”
“Nor much from the boy. You shall hear. Jem, my
beauty, who was your mother ?”
"A lady she was; and much good that is to us."
He seemed to separate the mother who was a lady from
the mother who was not.
“Much good indeed. It does not prevent her from making
cardboxes for a living. Who was your father, Jem ?”

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
“A gentleman he was. And much good that is to us."
Marion started.
“Don't be afraid, Marion Revel; the boy has nothing to
do with you or yours. What else was he, Jem ?"
“A villain ; and mother was a fool to run away with him."
6 What will
you do to him when you meet him ?”
“Kill him if I can," said the boy, viciously. “Rip him
up, and cut him down, cos he's done all the mischief.”
“ There,” said his mother; “some day or other I shall
meet the boy's father—no matter when, because I can wait.
Then my boy Jem will be tall and strong. He will remember
the little catechism I taught him. You'll remember it
always, Jem, won't you ?”
She went on working her deft fingers, manipulating the
card, and cutting the bright-coloured paper with swift activity
while she talked.
“You'll remember when you meet him-he is a tall and
handsome man-very tall and very handsome, careful about
his hands, dresses expensively. He has got a face something
like
yours, Jem, when
your
face isn't like mine. You will be
sure to know him. Get him in a secret place, and murder
him. Tell him what it was for. Ask him if he remembers
Carry-ask him if he tried to find out what became of his
Carry; and then murder him. Marion Revel, this is good
training, isn't it? It is all I am able to give him. His name,
Jem, is Lillingworth. He was a captain once, in the army.
Now you know all about it."
Oh, it is too dreadful!" said Marion. “Jem, you know
your mother is not in earnest."
She is, though,” said Jem, nodding his head—“real good
earnest. She makes me say that patter every day. Lord! I
know all about Captain Lillingworth. He's my father, and
I've got to kill him.”
"No, no; it's only make-believe, Jem. Do you not know
it is wicked to talk about killing any one ?”
“Wicked !” said his mother" as if he knows anything
about religion! Do you think I could teach him religion-I?'
“Have you never been to church, Jem ?”
He shook his head.
“Not such a fool as that,” he said ; one of the boys was
nabbed last Sunday for just looking inside. Got locked up
all night, he did, and never done nothink.”
“ Have you never been to school, Jem ?”

He shook his head again.
“ One of the boys says we shall all have to go soon, and
get whacked.”
Can
you
read?”
Yes, I can read some, but not much. I can read the bill
for the Echo. See, I can write a little, too." He took a
piece of chalk out of his pocket. “There”—be traced on the
door the letters ECHO, only the C was turned backwards
“ that spells
• Echo.' I've made it wrong somehow.
Never mind, all the boys mostly can write 'cept me, and I'm
learning myself.”
“Does he know nothing at all, this poor boy?” asked
Marion.
“Nothing,” said his mother—"nothing. Best that he
should know nothing. We have been thrown upon
the streets
together, he and I. Let him live in the streets all his life.
We shall both die there."
“One of the boys knows a hymn,” said Jem, after thinking
the matter over.
“ He learned it to me. I can say it all
a'most :
• Adama Neeve was made of clay,
Such was his petty cree-'
I forget-yes, ‘his petty cree.'” (Perbaps he meant pedigree.)
And in the garden he could play

'Cos he knocked the apples down.'
There's more, only I've forgotten it since the cab ran over me.”
“Don't look at the boy that way, Marion Revel,” cried
his mother, stopping her work for a moment. “ And what
are you crying for? He's all right.'
The boy proved upon the spot that he was all right by a
violent fit of coughing, followed by a terrible shaking of his
limbs, which seemed dislocated for the moment by the energy
of St. Vitus.
“We've had a bad winter, and a long winter, too—that's
given him a cough ; and then came the cab. But we shall
get on now, sha'n't we, Jem, my pretty ?”
Jem nodded and winked, trying to look jolly ; then he
shivered, and pulled the blanket round his neck. From

6. It is too dreadful !" Marion murmured. " What can I
do for you—what can I do ?”
“ It is not so dreadful as it looks. So long as the weather
is warm, I don't mind so much ; and Jem is a good boy, too
-aint
you,
Jem? When he's well he'll bring home some-
times a couple of shillings a day, won't you, Jem ?”
“ Once I brought home three shillin's.”
“So you did, Jem ; so you did.”
" That was when I held the gentleman's horse, and he gave
me half-a-crown and thought it was a penny.”
“I spent it all,” Mrs. Spenser explained, defiantly. “Jem
had none of that windfall, poor
lad.”
“One of the boys—” Jem began again.
“You must do something for the boy,” Marion said. “Per-
haps I shall be able—"
“Marion Revel, you let my boy alone, and I will let your
brother and sister alone--that is a bargain. If I choose
that the boy shall grow up as he is growing up, that is my
business; we shall be revenged so, somehow, on his father.
I am a miserable woman, and he is a gutter boy. Some
day we shall find him out.”
“Do not think of revenge. What good will revenge do ?”
"You are a fool, Marion Revel!” the woman replied, in
her clear silvery tones and her quiet manner. Revenge is
what I dream of. Every day that I wake in this den, and
feel myself lower than I was yesterday, I think more and more
of revenge. I want to make him suffer as he has made me
suffer. I want to curse him through his son.
He'll feel that,
if he can feel anything, when he sees him.”
Then Jem had another attack of cougbing.
“One of the boys—" he began again, but choked.
“Let the man come here,” Mrs. Spenser said. “Let him
come here and look at the boy. Let him see us both; let him
think what I am, and what I used to be before he came, with
his handsome face; and then let us two, Jem and me, haunt
him and follow him about wherever he
“ All right,” said Jem, whose notions of a vendetta were as
yet imperfectly developed. “All right, mother. Rip him up
and cut him down.”

furniture, I shall sell that for drink when the fit comes upon
me. I have got enough money now, and Jem shall have
Home tea to-night.”
“And shrimps, mother. Let's have shrimps."
Yes, and shrimps and bread and butter. That's what
Jem shall get. I shall have gin.'
She had preserved throughout the same defiant air. When
she saw the tears in Marion's eyes, she became more defiant
still. When the girl patted her boy's cheek, she had a pang
of jealousy; when she took her money, she laughed with a
little triumph. She was never quite certain whether to regard
Marion as an enemy or a friend, but leaned to the former.
“Let me come again to see Jem.”
“ You may see him any day you like; all you have to do is
to go down Holborn, where he hawks the Echo and his cigar-
lights. Ask any boy there for Rickety Jem.”
“I'm Rickety Jem," said the lad, with pride.
Don't you see he is ill? Don't you notice his cough
and his bright eyes? And look how thin his cheek is,” said
Marion.
The mother tossed her work aside, and took the boy's head
in her hands.
“Don't try to frighten me, Marion Revel. The boy's going
to get strong and well. They are growing pains he has, and
the winter's made him weak. Is not that so, Jem? Why,
I feel him getting stronger every day.”
“All right, mother,” said Jem. One of the boys said as
another boy said as I wasn't going to be long for this world.
Then we all laughed.”
Marion Revel. You will bring bad luck on my
boy and me. You ought to, I'm sure.
What can one of
your name bring me, except misery?”
“Won't you let me come again to see the boy ?”
“No-yes. Come if you like. What does it matter?
After all, you are a good woman, Marion Revel.” Her voice
sank a little, but she raised it again. “It's a pity you're fallen
off in your looks, because you were once a very pretty girl-
a very pretty girl indeed. And now your figure is quite gone,
Marion.” She had resumed her place at the table, and her
fingers were nervously playing with her cardboard and scissors.
“Sixteen years ago, now you must have been eleven, and
the others were seven and five. They were both like their
mother, I remember, but you were like your father. A grave

little girl you were, full of queer sayings. Oh, Marion, do
you remember the questions you used to ask—such questions,
which not even your father could answer ?”
The tears came into her eyes as she recalled the old days
and her voice became unsteady. She waited a moment, and
then went on, in a clear and deliberate tone-
“I used to lie awake at night and think of the other two,
Marion; but I don't dare think of them any more-it drives
me mad only to see either of them at your window. Not to
see them at all, and to think of them still, would have driven
me mad then; but I had my boy here to nurse, and that kept
me in my senses. God knows it would have been better for
me to have lost them quite. Sometimes I used to wonder
what I did it for. Now I have long left off wondering or
thinking why I was so wicked and so foolish. But once I
used to think a good deal about it. It was after he left me-
left me like a flower he had put in his but on-hole one day
and thrown aside the next. He was a cruel and a selfish man;
he made me repent the very day I did it. He never spared
a woman in his passion; he used to boast that to my very face,
when it was too late ; he used to give me the shameful history
of all the women he had led astray.”
Do not think of him," said Marion.
“ Years ago, when Jem was a little baby, I used to think
of him every day and every night. I used to curse him. One
of my prayers was heard—just think of that, because I
learned by accident that he disgraced himself, and was
obliged to leave the army. That was something, but not
enough. No, I want to see him lose all the money that gets
him the things that he loves, and go down to the grave in
miserable poverty like this. He likes luxury of any kind :
let him make his dinner off a crust of bread, and his supper
off a red herring on lucky days. Then I shall be satisfied.
No," she added, “it is not true, I shall never be satisfied,
because I never could forget what I lost. Oh, Marion! Oh,
the days gone by! Oh, the happy, peaceful days when I was
loved and trusted, and my children put their arms round my
neck and said their prayers.”
“God will forgive," whispered Marion.
“But will he forgive ? No: it is impossible. I haven't
done any harm to God,” she said, wildly. “I could face Him.
It is the other. How could I ever bear to look at him again ?"
“He has long since forgiven every sin against himself

223
because his own are forgiven. Oh, believe it, and let your poor
heart be softened.”
Marion bent her face and touched those guilty cheeks with
her own pure lips. The woman shrank back with a little
cry, and covered her face again with her hands. It is hard
to follow the current of a mind like that of this poor creature.
For the first time, Marion seemed to have roused in her some
sense of human regret, if not repentance. She was not, then,
utterly insensible. I believe that prison chaplains and
matrons tell the same story. There is no man or woman so
hardened but that there is some weak point. Marion had
found the weak point. A little sympathy, a little patience,
silence on certain points connected with the past-these
things seemed to touch her.
But what hope, what future, was there possible, even if
the better nature were thoroughly awakened ?
She sat silent at the table, and then she began again with
the pasteboard and the scissors; then she spoke in a whisper,
like the far-off murmur of a shell-
“I don't think,” she said, not looking up—“I don't think
there is a single woman in all the world except you, Marion,
who would do what you are doing. Oh, how hard they are,
all of them, and unforgiving ! Not but what it's right, and
what we ought to expect, Marion. You must not bring
yourself to any harm through me. Would they like it if they
were to find out ? Do you think you ought to come here?
Remember everything. Make your heart hard against me,
my poor girl. I am only a drag upon you. I take away
your money as fast as you get it; and you arz afraid that I
shall say or do something to frighten the other two. Do you
think you ought to come here ?"
The soft, dreamy voice ceased. Then there came a change
in her face, swift and sudden; but Marion could not see it,
any more than she could see the suspicions in her brain.
"Let me come again, for the boy's sake. It is dreadful to
see him so ill and so ignorant. Let me come and teach him
something."
Mrs. Spenser dashed the hair from her face, and sprang to
her feet, standing on the mattress where her boy lay-large-
eyed, wondering, expectant from long experience of a row-
like a tigress over her cub.
“No, no!" she cried. “Leave my boy alone. You ought
to hate him · you ought to wish him dead; you ought to

loathe his sight. Marion Revel, why do you come here at
all? What right have you in this house? Go away, and
wait till I ask you for more money. I shall work no longer.
Why should I work for twelve hours a day to earn two and
twopence ? Go you, and make money to keep me and the
boy, as well as those other two helpless creatures. Go away,
before I do you a mischief. Jem, you miserable son of a
miserable mother, take this shilling and crawl out and get the
gin. Now, Marion Revel, what do you say to that ?"
CHAPTER XXII.
The sunny nature, as we call it, is one so greatly lauded
and envied that it goes to one's heart to criticize it. Never-
theless, the truth is that “sunniness” very often comes from
sheer insensibility, and a dislike to disagreeable things. I
fear that the sweet good temper always shown by Fred
Revel, and his affectionate behaviour to his sisters, took
their origin in these natural causes. He had small capacity
for sympathy, a profound inability to calculate the chances
of the future, and was impressed to so high a degree with a
sense of the beauty of things beautiful, that it was, with
him, almost a disease. Naturally, therefore, it cost him no
effort to regard his sisters with affection, especially the
younger, whose beauty he could see was a thing quite rare
and unapproachable.
He thus made up in a measure for his laziness by his
affection. He repaid devotion by gentle words, and even
When he was at home which was not often-he
was at the orders of his sisters. He had been known to
spare Marion a journey to Burls's shop; he would sometimes
lie on the sofa and read to them; on Sunday he had occasion-
ally gone to church with them; and on Sunday evenings, when
Winifred Owen always came upstairs to have tea with his
sisters, he stayed with them, helped in the preparation of the
simple banquet, sang with Adie afterwards, and comported
himself with all the steadiness of a Sunday-school teacher.
Unfortunately, these loving natures are like bindweed,
convolvulus, or clematis, inasmuch as they are apt to spread
the tendrils of affection in unexpected directions—other, in
fact, than those of sisterly affection. It was not enough that
the young man should be loved by his sisters—that is a kind
caresses.

225
of affection which does not satisfy; he craved for the deeper
and fuller stream of passion. He found it with Winifred
Owen; and at this period of the history their love passages
had already gone a very great deal farther than even Mr.
Owen, jealous for his daughter, suspected. It is not, there-
fore, surprising to hear that, when Winifred's work at the
telegraph office was finished, it often happened to her to find
Fred Revel waiting to take her home.
The same thing happened to many of the young ladies in
the department, and was indeed so common an occurrence as
to excite no other feeling with those who went home unac-
companied than that of envy. None of these telegraph
clerks, however, were waited for by persons of their own sex.
It was also remarked that the gentleman who came for
Winifred Owen possessed personal attractions of a higher
order than most of the cavaliers in waiting. The girls of
her Majesty's telegraph department are not, it must be
understood, given to the dangerous practice of casual and
meaningless flirtation. You will not meet them at theatres
with gentlemen who hail from the Temple, nor are they to be
accosted in Westbourne-grove by invincible young City men.
Not at all: their behaviour is as circumspect as their position
is respectable. There is no line of work in which a girl's
reputation is safer than in the telegraph offices. Add to
this, if you please, that her Majesty's Government—which is
piling up pyramids of material for repentance in making
contracts for work, which ought to be done at first hand,
with people who get their profit out of the underpaid women
in their employ-has not yet, happily, applied the dire and
dreadful rule of supply and demand to the telegraph service.
The girls are honestly paid and fairly worked, and they are
not bullied like the poor girls in shops ; so that they retain
their self-respect.
Of course it was the one piece of folly wanting to fill
Fred's cup that he should fall in love. Perhaps, if he had
done it a year or two before this, when his indolence was
not as confirmed as a bodily blemish, it might have been
good for him. In a healthy state of education we shall
train up the boys to fall in love as a duty at two or three
and twenty. As it is, those of our youth who permit them-
selves this natural emotion at so early an age are the uncal-
culating and the sanguine, like Fred Revel.
How handsome he was, as he waited for the girl clerks to

come out, and watched for Winifred among them! As yet,
their wooing had the subtle charm of secrecy; and Fred
belonged to the girl, though she alone knew it, by ties that
could not be broken.
Her pulse beat higher with pride as she took his arm, and
walked with him down the unfashionable street of Newgate.
She loved him. It is assuredly not the first time that a
woman has given her heart to a man whom she knows to be
-soften it-deficient in the more robust virtues. The
worthless ne'er-do-well has for her some secret charm of
manner which the world fails to detect. Was not Mrs.
Medlar in love with Dicky Carew ? Was not Bluebeard
idolized by every one of his wives in turn? Did not Acte,
the sweet and pure-minded Christian, love Nero, the Anti-
Christ? As if we wanted examples ! Winifred loved this
handsome and indolent young Absolom, who, for his part,
loved the bright-eyed little telegraph girl as much as it was
in his nature to love anybody.
“We must be more careful, Winifred," said Fred, in his
airy manner. “ You know what they say—I mean in the
lower classes, of course-about keeping company? What an
expression! They will think in Lowland-street that we are
keeping company, will they not?”
Winifred had heard the expression employed in her own
department.
They have not the chance," said Winifred, squeezing his
arm ; we are too clever for them, because we always part at
the corner of Tottenham-court-road.”
“Not to-night, my love," he replied. “I have got some
money ; let us have a drive in a hansom through the
parks."
“Fred, dear," she said, timidly, "I should like it so much-
oh! so much! but would it be quite right? Do you think
we ought? You know yesterday poor Adie had no dinner,
because there was no money.”
He was silent for a moment, and something like a blush
crossed his face.
I did not know," he said. 6 We will walk."
They walked, and he talked.
“I wish your father liked me, Winifred. It is a bore,
cousidering everything. I met him on the stairs this morn-
ing, and he stopped to say, with a long face, ' Young man,
the soul of the sluggard desireth, but hath nothing. Have

you found any work yet?' Any work, you know; as if I was
a common clerk or a railway porter.”
“Well, but, Fred”-Winifred was jealous for her father-
“what else should he say? You do want work,
do
you
not?"
“Say? Anything. But then, Winifred, you do not under.
stand—how should you ?” He laid his hand upon hers.
“What a pretty little band it is! I think I shall never get
tired of it-and mine, isn't it?"
All
yours, Fred, dear.”
“Let me buy it a new pair of gloves.”
To be sure, Winifred's gloves were a good deal worn, and
showed signs of frequent repair. I do sincerely believe that
her character will be greatly raised when I state that she had
the courage to refuse a new pair, on the same ground as she
had refused the drive-the plea of poverty.
Then, Winifred, if I must not give you anything, let us
go somewhere where we can have a quiet talk together.”
It was, as has been stated a chapter or two back, in the
sweet spring month of April, when the sign of the zodiac-
whatever the zodiac may be—is Gemini, the twins, as we call
them, but the older astronomers named the Maid and the Man
-that is to say, it was the acknowledged season of love. Over
in the west-for it was seven o'clock—the sun was going
down behind a lurid mass of sapphire, smoke, and blood-red
cloud. Fred hurried his companion away from the tumult of
Holborn into the quiet retreat of Lincoln's Inn-fields. Ho
opened the gate of the gardens with a key, to which he
certainly had no right, and took Winifred into the quiet
gardens, where the lilac was bursting into bloom, the trim
lawns were fragrant from an afternoon shower, and the tulips
were gorgeous in their short-lived splendour: a Cockney
garden, if you please, but pleasant and sweet to the girl.
“Let us walk up and down here,'
,” said her companion.
“ It is always quiet and undisturbed, and we can talk.”
The gardens were quite deserted—there was no one to listen
to them, no one to see them, no one tu disturb them. An ideal
place for a London idyll. Winifred's lover walked beside her,
as beautiful as Apollo'; his head thrown back with a careless
grace that you may see in the early portraits of Byron, his
eyes flashing, his lips, like Adie's—half parted, the very type
and ideal, to outward seeming, of early manhood, full of noble
thoughts and lofty aims. He looked strong and resolute,
because he was dreaming great things as he walked. He was

;
to marry
on a Royal Road to greatness—such greatness as means
wealth and comfort; and was marching along it in imaginary
state and splendour, with Winifred beside him.
She did not share his dreams, this simple girl who was in
love with him, but she looked up at him with eyes that drank
in long draughts of admiration. Heavens! that such a hero-
so brave, so handsome, going to be so good—should see anything
in her, the telegraph girl, to love; and what—what must be
the nobleness of the man who could so stoop beneath him as
her ? Yes, to marry her. Winifred was married ;
Fred Revel was married; they were actually married to each
other. They went to the parish church one Sunday morning-
Mr. Owen never went to any church at all, but stayed at home,
to read either Plutarch or the Book of Proverbs—where the
banns had been put up among half a hundred others, and
were married; and no one, not a soul, knew anything about
it. It was just before her father's warning, which, like many
a prophetic announcement, came too late to be of any use ;
and the words never ceased to ring in her brain.
"He's a worthless chap, my girl.”
Winifred,” Fred began, bending his gracious head with.
such a sweet condescension as the king who reigned in
Shushan from India to Ethiopia might have observed to that
fair Jewess Esther after her twelvemonth's washing in oil of
myrrh and sweet perfumes, or as Solomon bestowed upon
the nameless nymph whose lips were as a thread of scarlet-
“Winifred, my darling, do you think, like all the rest, that.
because I have done nothing yet, I can do nothing ?”
The girl shook her head at these assuring words. Of course
she did not.
“And suppose-suppose, Winifred—that I were to come
to you with such a position as would be worthy of you—"
“Fred, I am only a telegraph girl, but, oh, so proud of you
“ The wife takes her husband's position,” he replied, with
the grandest air. Had he been the Earl of Burleigh, his
condescension could not have been greater. As my wife you
will be, not Mrs. Revel, but Madame la Comtesse. Would
you like that? For I intend to resume the title which my
tather dropped as soon as we get back into our old position.'
“But-but-oh, I am not fit to be a great lady.”
“You will learn, Winifred-you will easily learn. Marion
and Adie will teach you. You are quick and clever. I shall
not be ashamed of my wife"
u !""

"To be your wife before all the world !” she gasped. "It
takes away my breath."
“Sit down,” he said, " and let us talk about it calmly.”
He placed her on a garden seat, and sat by her, taking her
hands in his. It was as yet all too much happiness for the
girl, who with him could only breathe and feel.
“They call me idle, I know,” he said, thinking over
Dr. Chacomb's accusing speech. “They think I am good
for nothing but loafing about and playing billiards. It is
not true, Winifred. Adie will tell you, if you ask her, that
I am always thinking about what I shall do. Why, I am
ready to do anything-anything that a gentleman may do,
and never afterwards be ashamed of. They shall see they
shall see what I will do."
Winifred was wholly carried away by the infection of his
ideas.
“Adie is right,” she cried. “She always says you have
the noblest of hearts."
“Adie is the best girl in all the world. Now, Winifred,
dear, I am going to tell you a great secret.”
“What is it, Fred ?"
“Do not laugh, and do not tell
When I was in
France with Lord Rodney Benbow, I was told by a woman
from Algiers, an Arab woman, that there were to be great
troubles before me, but that after three or four years all
would be smooth. Then my father died suddenly-killed by
a fall, and then all our troubles began. As for Adie and
myself, we have always felt that we should pull round
somehow.”
“But do you believe what a fortune-teller says ?”
Winifred had been brought up in a healthy contempt for
the petty supernatural.
No—that is, I believe we shall get out of the hole we are
in somehow. Of course, I do not believe what a fortune-
teller says”—but he did—"and I have plenty of irons in the
fire. I will tell you: first, I have put down my name at the
Colonial Office; then I have applied for a nomination to the
Foreign Office. If these do not come to anything I have
promised a man I know—not a gentleman-a bonus of ten
per cent. on any good thing he gets me. Unfortunately, all
the secretaryships are given to men who can put capital in
the company. Besides this, Dicky Carew thinks he knows a
paper where they would like a man to send West-end things
any one.

to them." Fred spoke as if he belonged without a doubt to the
highest stratum. “Out of all this something will come, surely.
What would you like best? They might make me governor
of some small West Indian island to begin with. Should
you like that?
His Excellency Sir Frederick Revel, K.C.B.,
Governor of the Starboard Islands, accompanied by Lady
Revel, has returned to England on furlough, and yesterday dined
with the Queen at Osborne.' That would read well, wouldn't.
it? Or they might make me secretary of legation at Vienna.
Society is not so good at Vienna as it used to be, I fear, but
we need not be too particular; and it is a place where we
could make ourselves comfortable. Or perhaps you would
prefer being attached to the embassy at Paris? There may
be a better chance for a diplomatist, especially one of French
descent, in Paris."
“Oh, Fred!"—the prospect was altogether too dazzling,
and she gasped, “I can never become a great lady-never !
I shall only make people laugh at you, for marrying such a
simple girl. How will you like to have ladies laughing at
my want of manner ?”
“I have thought of all that,” he replied, as if the thing
were quite settled, and nothing left but to arrange the details
“I have thought of all that. Before we leave town, you
shall live for a few weeks with a family who will form you.
Your taste in dress is already perfect-almost as perfect as
Adie's; and yours is a style of beauty which can bear orna-
ment, which hers can do without. I think you would look
very well with a diamond spray in your hair. I saw one the
other day in Bond-street which I thought would just do for
my pretty little girl. I mean some day to deck you up in all
the dainty things that money will buy. Then, if you like,
you shall learn some accomplishments--playing, singing,
languages—all the little trifles that women pick up so easily.'
He spoke as if they came by nature, or were to be learned in
a week or two. “ The chief business is, of course, the culti-
vation of manner and style. You must be, above all things,
chic. We should have to sink the school and the connection
with the-eh?—the Government department."
Fred, I could never learn to be ashamed of my
father."
“ Ashamed ? no, I suppose not. Only it will not do when
we are in society to put the fact of the school in the fore-
ground. A countess, you know, may be the daughter of
anybody, but she does not generally tell all the world about it.”

Winifred was silent. This kind of talk jarred upon her.
“And now that we are united, Winifred,” the Prince went
on, in a lordly way—“ now that I have married you and made
you happy, you will take pains to fit yourself for the position
you will occupy, will you not ?”
“Yes, Fred," she answered him, humbly. "I will try all
I can; only you must tell me what to do. Perhaps Adie
will help me.
“But remember, dear, it must be a profound secret. I do
not want anybody, not even Adie, to know anything about it.
I can meet you in the evening, when you leave the office, and
we can walk home together and talk; but no one need know
till we are able to tell them till I am able to take you away
altogether.”
Oh, let me tell my father, Fred-poor father! And he
loves me so !”
Certainly not-on no account. I would rather
you
told
Adie even. Only wait a little while, dear child, and we will
tell all the world. Wait just a little. They must give me
something good, with all my interest.”_At the moment he
pictured to himself the whole of the Upper House tumul-
tuously pressing his claims on dispensers of official sinecures.
“Why, a commissionership in the Poor Law is worth about
a thousand a year, and nothing to do for it. I should not be
at all surprised if Rodney got me that.”
“ Arc you quite sure, Fred ?" (Winifred remembered what
her father had told her. She blushed to remember that it
came through a waiter). Are you quite sure that Lord
Rodney is your
friend?"
“Sure, Winifred? Why, we were friends at Oxford, and
we got rusticated for the same thing. Then we were to have
gone to Egypt together, only I did not get so far. Friends!
why, Rodney would do anything for me-anything in the
world.”
It was an idée fixe with the young man that his one
acquaintance in the world who had position had also un.
bounded influence, and was exercising it for him day and night.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Owen’s information was perfectly
correct. Lord Rodney, who had as yet no influence whatever,
was tired of constantly lending money to a man who seemed
incapable of doing anything for himself. He resolved-and
his resolution was arrived at, unluckily, just before this very
evening—to give Fred Revel no more money.

“ Come, Winifred,” he said, “ there is no one here ; put
your arms on my neck, so. Now kiss
me,
and
say you love me."
She did as she was told.
“ And I have made you happy ?”
Yes, very happy. Ob, Fred, Fred !" she burst out crying-
"you will leave off going to billiard-tables, and-and-work,
and be good to your sisters, will you not?”
He was moved by her tears, but very angry at her words.
Work! Leave off billiards ! Trifles of this kind, when he
was glowing with the prospect of future greatness !
“That shows the kind of thing people say of me,” he replied.
“Well, there is nothing to be done but to leave the beastly
hole where we are now, and go somewhere else. I shall see
Rodney to-morrow, and tell him that he must get to work in
earnest for me.”
“Forgive me, Fred."
“I forgive you, my dear,” he said, magnanimously; “but
I do not forgive people who try to set you against me. There,
let us have no more tears. Come, my dear, you are married
to me now, and you must believe in me, you know.”
Yes, Fred.”
Winifred was very humble as they left the garden. She
clung to her lover's arm, because her eyes were full of tears,
and her brain was turning round and round. He was silent
too, because, as will happen in every fool's paradise, a word of
the girl had knocked over his palace walls about his ears. It
was as if the sun was suddenly hidden behind the clouds.
Was Lord Rodney his friend?
If not, then he had nothing to hope from any one.
Would he give up billiards, and work and be good to his
sisters?
Two of the four sovereigns he had taken from Adrienne
were in his pocket still. Where were the other two ? And
what about the debt-the debt of which his sisters knew
nothing?
They partrd sadly at Tottenham-court-road, with a silent
shake of the hand. The young man walked along Oxford-
street, moody and miserable. Presently he came to a door at
which his feet stopped of their own accord, and without any
volition on his part. Then they turned to the right, went up
certain steps, and entered a room where three or four men
were playing billiards,
The marker nodded familiarly. As Fred. took down his
cue, he whispered to him--

233
did;
“ The bill falls due in a day or two."
“Renew it, then, as you did for me last time.”
“Can't, Mr. Revel-can't. The other party wants his
money.”
Fred made no answer. He replaced the cue, and presently
left the billiard-room, to wander backwards and forwards in
the street.
Work? He could not work.
Winifred went home. Her father was out, and she sat
down, trying to think over what had happened. She was as
sad as her lover. Was this right? Was this the way in which
young ladies should be wooed, won, and married ? Why, he
had made sure, to begin with, that she loved him. So she
but it seemed strange that he should assume it from the
very
first. And he had ordered matters his own way, without
a word of remonstrance from her. She had begun the wifely
obedience while yet a maid.
“He is a worthless chap."
Her husband! Husband of a fortnight-married in St.
Andrew's, Holborn.
Her father's words rang in her brain with a dreadful
pertinacity. She knew that they were true. In her heart she
knew that all these fine promises would end in nothing. She
foresaw the unhappiness she might be bringing upon herself.
And yet, like Marion, towards whom Fred might sin seventy
times seven and still be forgiven, she loved him none the less.
For it was the strange property in the boy's character that
all women who knew him loved him, and all men who knew
him liked him; and yet all, somehow, despised him.
She loved him; that was all. She went to her bed-room at
the back, and prayed for him. She gave him what she had-
her prayers and her love.
When her father came home at nine o'clock, he found
Winifred bright and cheerful. The simple family supper was
on the table, and the lamp was lit.
Winifred was rather silent..
At ten she put her work together. It was her wont to
leave her father to smoke his pipe by himself.
"Father,” she whispered, kissing the rugged and wrinkled

“ You said he was worthless. You meant that he could do
no work, you know.”
“ Winifred !” he started up in his chair, took both her hands,
and looked at her. She tried to lift her eyes, but could not.
“No, father, no,” she sobbed; “ ask me no questions.”
He drew her to his knees, and held her as he had held her
many thousands of times, when she was a little thing, and be
was father and mother both to her. His left arm was round
her waist, and her bead was on his shoulder, and he was
soothing and patting her cheek.
“My child, my daughter, my own Winifred !” he said,
“ tell me what you like what you like, my dear. Forget
what I said. No doubt I am a fool, and he is full of good
qualities—as good as he is handsome; and nobody could be
handsomer than he is. Only remember, my dear, what I have
taught you. A virtuous woman-her price is above rubies.
Be good, my child. Promise me—no, promise me nothing;
only be good, my child.”
She left him presently, but the schoolmaster had no sleep
that night. His passionate Welsh nature was on fire with
indignation against the handsome boy who had stolen away
his child's heart. He walked up and down the room; he lay
down, but could find no rest.
“If he does her any harm,” he said; “if he plays his game
of gentleman with my girl-1_”
In the morning, he was quite grave and silent during
breakfast, making no observations at all out of Solomon's
Proverbs. Winifred gave him his tea, with downcast eyes.
When she rose to go to her work, she said, hesitatingly-
Father, you do not think the worse of any man because
he is
poor,
do
you ?"
He shook his head and brightened up, seeing his oppor-
tunity
“A good name," he replied, " is rather to be chosen than
great riches; and loving favour rather than silver and gold.
Winifred, find me, if you can, a single question that Solomon
does not answer.
Go to your office, my dear, and don't fret.
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.'” When she
had gone, his face clouded again. “I wish,” he said, “ that
the passages about fools and folly were not so fresh in any
mind to-day. Solomon had a wonderful eye for a fool— The
father of a fool hath no joy.' To be sure, I shall only be his
father-in-law."

Then the clock struck nine, and he went into the school
and caned Candy Secundus. Invigorated by his anxiety, he
inflicted upon that culprit a most astonishing punishment;
inscmuch that when he went home, his mother drew the
in forence of greater criminality than was absolutely the case,
and gave the unfortunate boy a second caning before he went
to bed, to enforce and underline the lesson. To Candy Se-
rundus, therefore—it is a remarkable instance how men and
women live unconsciously for each other–Fred's wedding
brought two chapters of Lamentations, forming both a
morning and an evening lesson.
CHAPTER XXIII.
It is not an easy thing for a physician to get away from
patients, even at the beginning of the London season. But
it was absolutely necessary for Dr. Chacomb to see his unfor-
tunate cousin after this new misfortune which had befallen
him. For his own part, he took the blow with the serenity
of one who had received many buffets from fortune. If there
should be a child, farewell to his heirship. If the woman
played her cards well, farewell to his rule at Chacomb. In
any case, it was a serious check on his projects; for he
meditated great improvements on the estate. Taking the
position of a country gentleman, just as the heir presumptive
to an earldom might almost consider himself a peer, he gave
his attention to questions affecting land, contracts with
tenants, drainage, high farming, and other things. He
talked over these subjects with authority, as one personally
interested, and, in fact, enjoyed the additional importance
accruing to him as the future possessor of a goodly heritage.
No light owned by Dr. Joseph Chacomb was at this period
allowed to burn under a bushel, or, indeed, to burn at all
save at such times as might be beneficial to himself. He
owed, in fact, everything to the Chacomb estate. An adven-
turer, a shady general practitioner, a projector of companies
which, if they were floated, always came to wreck, a haunter
of tenth-rate clubs, where very questionable gentlewen asso-
ciated to drink and tell stories, he found suddenly, ready to
his hand, the rents of his cousin's property: He corrowed-
who could resist the temptation of borrowing? He founded
with great pains his Royal Hospital for Gout, on which he

mounted the ladder of professional reputation. He left his
old companions—the bond of friendship among the impecu-
nious is like that among savages, uncertain and liable to
sudden tempests of suspicion. He put off the habits and
language of their class; changed his channel of thought;
cultivated those manners which make the man; and became
-a gentleman.
It required careful observation and long familiarity now
to distinguish any trace of his twenty years' vagabondage in
the polished doctor. He even became an author, and pub-
lished that treatise of his “On Gout and its Cognate Diseases”
which is still the standard work on the subject, although
Dr. Porteous, of Savile-row, always declared that it was
translated from the French-a language which Joseph
Chacomb had learned in its purity in the Quartier Latin.
He had a solid-looking house in Adelaide-street, Carnarvon-
square; he had a professional carriage, with the Chacomb
arms, and the soberest of liveries ; he had a large medical
and general library; he had a servant—the prince of servants
-a man whose manners proclaimed him born to be a master
of a college ; he had a circle of acquaintance, creditable in
themselves, and likely to advance his reputation; he gave
dinner parties, at which he told admirable stories. All these
things were done and established. Chauncey Chacomb might
develop into a Brigham Young in the matter of wives without
affecting the doctor's position, credit, and prosperity. All
this was his by right-subject, of course, to the few thousands
he had borrowed. He was unmistakably chief physician of
the hospital, he had undoubtedly composed a great work, and
his doors were besieged by clients.
If there was an air of mystery about the doctor's antece-
dents, that helped him. Joe Chacomb the adventurer was
gone and forgotten. In the new doctor, who sprang suddenly
into reputation, people saw a man who was reputed to belong
to an excellent Devonshire family, to be the heir of a large
; property, and who had spent the greater part of his life abroad
in the pursuit of science--one who had avelled muck, and
observed a great deal. Dr. Porteous went so far, indeed, as
to hint that perhaps he had travelled in the Isle of Portland,
but that did no harm.
His prospects and professional name could not be hurt by
Chauncey's conduct. What the doctor felt was a mixture
of chagrin that he had been outwitted, pity for his cousin,

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
237
and anger with himself for not looking after things more
closely.
Outwitted by his own creature--the woman he had sent
down because he could trust her; a woman whom he had
known for twenty years, and whom he had employed as the
first matron of the new hospital until he thought she would
be more useful as housekeeper to Chauncey!
“ It will be worse for her in the end," he said. “I know
her. She will find it grand at first to order the people about;
then she will feel dull because no one will call upon her; then
her temper will break out—Julia always had the devil's own
temper; and then-poor Chauncey! It's a deuced annoying
business.”
Chauncey, too, whose muddled brain was growing every
day feebler and less able to bear excitement; who followed.
him about like some tamo pet when he went to Chacomb;
who was only to be trusted because he was harmless-what
would be the effect of a nagging and discontented woman
upon him? His health was daily failing-he wanted the
gentlest treatment; and here was a headstrong and self-
willed wife, in whose clutches he would be as a little child.
Joseph Chacomb was a kind-hearted man, albeit there
were certain specks and blemishes, already indicated, on his
character. He felt that Chauncey, now that he was clearly
cracked, and that Gerald was lying dead in some African
swamp, was specially under his own care. Chauncey belonged
to him, and he would not brook any interference in his con-
duct of this interesting case.
Who could help feeling pity for a man so shipwrecked and
afflicted ? particularly when his hallucinations were accom.
panied by a sincere trust and faith in himself, the doctor.
It was a disarrangement of his comfortable plans. Chauncey
would not last long. Far from him the desire to wish his end-
that would be unworthy of a man in his position; but soberly,
in the nature of things, he could not disguise from himself,
he said, the fact that Chauncey could not last long.
And then ?
Chacomb Hall, with Marion.
The doctor was lonely in his grandeur; his evenings were
dull and stupid. Sometimes he even longed for the jolly old
days when he would take his pipe to a club where certain
jovial fellows might be found, and where present insufficiency
of means-an admitted fact not to be disguised- did no;

prevent the flow of cheerfulness. He was not a reading man,
and he had gradually got into the habit of imagining Marion
sitting opposite to him, playing to him, presiding over his
house, acting hostess to his guests.
“She is a lady, by gad!” he would say.
66 Dress her up,
put a little more fulness in her cheeks, give her eyes a look
less anxious, take that droop out of her mouth, and she'd be
a credit to an earl. She's worth fifty of her sister. With
those two in this house, with Chacomb Hall to fall back
upon,
what society is there in London that would not be open
to me? I should get known to—to Cabinet Ministers,
perhaps. I would get a title—Sir Joseph Chacomb, Baronet,
M.D., of Chacomb. It is quite time that a Chacomb should
distinguish himself. Dr. Porteous would go into an apoplexy.
Perhaps there would be a little-eh? a little Joseph, successor
and heir. I should like to have a son ; I should like to bring
him up as I ought to have been brought up myself. What a
splendid boy the son of Joseph Chacomb, properly brought
up, would be !"
It will be seen that the doctor was human in having this
weak side to his character. He could be sentimental; he
liked to dream-being as a rule, the most practical of
creatures of a future consisting wholly of domestic bliss.
“The old lot would laugh,” he said to himself, “ if they
heard me.
What fools men are! When one fellow blusters
against religion, and society, sham morality, and the rest of
it, the other fellows imitate, if not believe him : they bolster
up their miserable make-believe of social revolt by the ex-
ample of the man they think the strongest. Lord, Lord! Joe
Chacomb was the advanced thinker; he was the materialist;
he was the man who believed nothing and feared nothing.
Look at him now; and where are all the rest ? Gone back
to the hearth—Christiani ad focos—sitting as meek as mice
with their wives and children; going to church every Sunday;
churchwardens; attendants at lectures ; moral and religious
parents, acquiescing in the order of things as they are;
forgetful of the old discussions. Do they really forget,
though? Is Paris as if it never existed ? They used to
admire Joe Chacomb, who was afraid of nothing. By gad!
they shall admire me more now, and with better reason.

CHAPTER XXIV.
DR. CHACOMB went down to Devonshire, and arrived at
Chacomb in time for dinner. He did not think it necessary
to announce hi entions. The house looked quiet and
even deserted; the gravel walks were half grown over with
grass; the beds, which ought to have been gay with spring
flowers, were bare; there was no one about the place; the
front door, generally open, was shut. What could it mean?
He walked to the back of the house, and entered by the
stables.
In the hall there was no one ; in the breakfast-room no
one; in the dining-room, drawing-room, and library no one.
He thought of the Collection-room. Chauncey Chacomb
was sitting there in a corner, his head half resting on the
uneven shoulder, his face the image of despondency. He
started to his feet, however, when he saw his cousin, and
rushed to meet him in a kind of rapture.
“ Joe!” he cried—“cousin Joe! Oh, Joe, why were you
not here a fortnight ago ?”
“Why did you not write to me? Come, Chauncey, this
is not the way a bridegroom should look. Cheer up, man;
pluck up spirit, and be happy."
He shook his head dolefully.
"Happy!” he groaned. "Happiness and I parted four
years ago, when I did-you know what. If you'd come a
fortnight ago, you might have prevented it.”
“My dear Chauncey, you are not a child in leading-strings.
Come, sit down, and tell me all about it. Where is she?”
“She's upstairs in her bed-room, with her maid. She's
trying on all the dresses. There are hundreds of them lying
in drawers, just as my lady left them. She's got them now,
with the jewellery, and she spends all her time pulling the
things on and off again. She has sent away every one of the
servants except the two grooms, because they were not civil,
she says. And so here we are in this big house, we three-
she, I, and the little maid, the only one she kept out of the
whole lot. And, Joe, I am afraid.”
“Nonsense, Chauncey; what should you be afraid of?"
But the doctor did not like the look of things.
“I am afraid of being robbed. Look at my Collectiou,
left by itself all night Why, some one might break in and

carry off the very gems of the whole. I want to leave it,
too, to the National Museum just as I have put it together.”
Very good, Chauncey, so you shall. I will charge myself
with that part of your intentions, at any rate. But no one
will steal into your Collection, be sure ; no one knows the
value of these things."
“ That is not all,” he went on, whispering. “I am afraid
of her, Joe—I am desperately afraid of her. When night
comes, I go away and lock myself up in Gerald's room-you
know: the west wing, where there's only one door of com-
munication, and I barricade that for fear she should get in.”
“By Jove!” said the doctor, “this is conjugal felicity,
This is an encouragement for a young bachelor like me to
get married, isn't it?”
“Once in, I feel safe. I've got my pistols loaded, and
there's a chain on the door. They shall never take me alive,
Joe-never !”
“Come, Chauncey, do not talk nonsense.”
“ You I can trust; you would never betray your cousin, if
only for the sake of old kindness, to say nothing of the family
I never regretted telling you, Joe. But oh! if I had
only kept it back from her !”
"Really, Chauncey, I must say, considering what humbug
the whole thing is, it was worse than folly to tell her.”
“It was not my fault, Joe. Why did you send her to me?
It was lonely in the evenings, and I got to sit with her to
escape the--you know—the faces, because I was miserable
and afraid of being left alone. Then we used to have brandy
and water, and she would talk to me. She's a clever woman.
Oh, Joe, what a clever woman she is! And she hid nothing
from me, you know; told me all her life"
Joseph smiled.
“How she had been on the stage, and all. The evenings
were pleasant after she came; and then I told her how lonely
I was, and how miserable ; and one night-oh, Joe !-one
night I told her everything, everything from the beginning.
She heard me right through, and the next day she said that
to make it safe I was to marry her right off. Because, you
see, I was in her power.”
“In her power? Ugh!”
The doctor's disgust that any one besides himself should
bave this man in his power was too great for any
words.
He grunted.

"Go ou, Chauncey. A pretty mess you've made of it for
yourself and me too. Go on."
“She gave me no rest after that. She was at me all day.
She made me tell the story of-you know—till I used to go
into the woods, and shout and scream-I could not help it,
Joe, indeed I could not-in order to get the dreadful thing
out of
my head. Oh, miserable wretch that I am! Why did
the Lord suffer this evil to fall upon me? Why did I hate
the man who never did me any harm at all, but only good ?
Joe, Joe, she went further; she said that if by any one telling,
or any subsequent inquiries being made, I should be taken
to Exeter-Exeter!” he cried, with a pitiful sob in his voice,
“where I've been a county magistrate myself — tried for
murder, and”—he dropped his voice to a whisper-“hanged,
Joe, you, she said, would only be transported for life, as an
accessory and accomplice.'
“Oh, I am to get transportation for life, am I? Good,
Mrs. Chacomb; very good.'
Buy her off, Joe-buy her off. She is dangerous.
“Not she, Chauncey. Don't be afraid. What else dia
she say?"
“She said you sent her down here because you thought she
was your tool, and would do what you told her to do."
“She's a devil!" growled the doctor, moved to pity and
wrath by the sight of his cousin's misery.
Most people
would resent the ill-treatment of a servant, pet, or slave,
always supposed to be their own peculiar property. Chauncey
was Joseph's own property, and here he was actually being
bullied and ill-treated by somebody else!" Chauncey," he
explained," I give you my word of honour that I sent you this
woman because I thought she would be an intelligent, and
kind-hearted housekeeper for you, and because, my dear fellow,
I was afraid to leave you by yourself.”
“Yes; it was very kind of you, Joe. I have not been
myself since that dreadful day. Then she made me marry
her; told me that it was the only escape for me from you;
that she knew how to manage me, and that, Hush, here
she comes.”
The door opened, and the second Mis. Chacomb sailed into
the room, gorgeously attired in silks, which would have looked
more than splendid had they been in the fashion; as it was,
they were twenty years behind it, and so presented a gro-
tesque appearance.


## p. 242 (#248) ############################################

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
“Joe!" she cried—“I beg your pardon, Dr. Chacomb,
My husband always calls you Joe."
“Pray call me Joe, Mrs. Chacomb,” he said, politely.
“We are cousins, you know, now. We are not what we were
once.
Which was true.
We shall have dinner as soon as you are ready, Joe,” she
replied, graciously, but with an obvious uneasiness. “Why
did
you
not
say you were coming ? I am afraid you will faro
badly.”
Aš he left the room, the doctor heard an angry whisper-
6. What have you
told him ?”
“ Nothing-nothing,” replied her hapless lord and master,
relapsing into his usual melancholy taciturnity.
Joseph came down again quickly, and gave his arm to the
ex-housekeeper with much ceremony. He noticed with surprise
that she squeezed it affectionately.
The dinner was wretched—a fowl badly cooked by the little
maid, and potatoes nearly hard. To make up, there was a
bottle of port, which appeared to be a standing part of the
evening meal, put out for the use of Mrs. Chacomb. The
doctor took his share, however.
The conversation languished, and Joseph found it insuffer-
ably dull. The woman at one end of the table, with her airs
and affectations, disgusted him; the man at the other moved
his innernost soul to pity and contempt; the little girl who
waited on them, the only other creature in the big house,
trembled at every movement of her mistress.
“Where are your servants, Mrs. Chacomb?” he asked,
when the girl had left them.
“Gone, Joe,” she replied, with a greater confidence in using
the Christian name than she had shown before dinner. “Gone,
and a good riddance, too."
“Get some more-get some more at once. Chacomb Hali
must not be left to the care of a child."
The woman resented his tone, but said nothing.
They did not adjourn, but sat round the fire after dinner,
in silence.
The clock struck nine; the squire rose solemnly, and shock
hands with his cousin.
“Joe, you are more than welcome here. I am very glad
you have come. Keep on coming. Come as often as you can.'
Then he took a candle and went away.

“My husband's habits are peculiar," said Mrs. Chacomb.
“ At present he occupies the empty wing, Mr. Gerald's wing."
“I see."
Then the little girl brought brandy and cold water, and
asked if there was anything else.
“ You have looked to all the locks and bolts ?"
“ Yes, my lady.”
Mrs. Chacomb had taught her to say “my lady," as a sort
of reminder that she was no longer a housekeeper.
“ Then you may go to bed.”
“ Do you mean to tell me that the poor child sleeps all
alone in the empty servants' room ?”
“No; she sleeps in the little room next to mine, the
dressing-room."
And then the two were left alone in the great empty house,

Julia," said the doctor, “what did you do it for? You
bave really made a great fool of yourself. I expected better
things."
Why does any woman marry a man who is a fool, and
old to boot? Because he is rich.”
“Of course, and because he is cracked, and you thought
you could do what you liked with his money."
“Well, you've been doing what you like with it for four

years."
“I was his cousin; you were, Julia, his housekeeper."
“ Never mind what I was. I am his wife.”
“So I suppose. And what if there was to be a row ?”
Ah, that would be bad, would it not?” she replied, with
a cunning smile. “I should have to confess that
my
husband
is a murderer, and his cousin an accomplice.”
“Julia, don't be a fool. You don't mean to say you
believe"
“I do, though. I believe every word of it.”
“Then leave off believing it, and try to be rational. The
row I mean is quite a different thing. Suppose I was to say,

on his fears; who found out the point in which his lunacy
shows itself, and persuaded him that his hallucinations were
a reality. What should we see then ?”
“I don't know, Joe. It would be an interesting thing to
see.”
“Do you imagine, Julia, that I cannot prove the death of
Captain Revel to have been the purest accident ?"
“What proof have you ?”
“ Read the account of the inquest, if you can get it. If
not, wait till my proof is wanted again."
“I believe it would be awkward, in spite of what you say,
if I were to declare that there is no hallucination at all.”
“Melodramatic, Julia—not awkward at all. Effective but
useless. It reminds me of Sadler's Wells days, when you
were an innocent and jolly young actress, not a scheming
woman, compassing a selfish end by cruel means. Yes, cruel,
Julia. It was a cruel thing to torture him as you did ; and
mark me, if you do it again, if you dare to allude to his miser-
able delusion, you leave Chacomb Hall at once. There, if
you refuse, I take the thing into my own hands, and get a
separation, exposing all the means—the unworthy means-
used to force the poor man into a marriage with you. How
would
you like the servants one after the other giving their
evidence ?”
A random shot, but it told.
She was silent.
“ One more thing, my friend Julia. Whatever power you
had over Chauncey as his housekeeper you have lost by
becoming his wife. You can't give testimony for or against
your husband. It is a cruel and wicked law in most cases.
In yours, my dear creature, it seems a most beneficent
regulation. So, you see, you have been too clever for your
own interests.”
“At all events, I am his wife. And now, Joe, we will
leave all stupid talk about delusions. Chauncey may be mad
or not, just as you like. Meantime, I am the mistress of
Chacomb Hall. I mean to receive the rents, and to have
things exactly as I please.”
“I was coming to that point next," said the doctor. - The
fact is that the news of your marriage forced me to look into
my own rights and powers. You know that I have managed
the Chacomb property for four years. Pray understand at
once that I intend to go on managing everything down here

-and everybody. I am resolved that the Chacomb property
shall be wisely administered, and the present owner shall be
kindly treated. If you attempt to interfere, I will separate
you from your husband on the ground of his lunacy. I
nominated myself before as the trustee of the estates, and if
I meet with opposition I will be nominated by the Court of
Chancery. Be under no false impression of your own import-
ance—you have none. You are of less account now than you
were before your marriage, because then you were a trusted
servant, and you are now-or you may be if you
choose-a
suspected enemy.”.
Pray go on," she said. "I am to be nothing, I suppose.
Nothing at all. You may keep up your own dignity as
before. You will be under my orders, or you will leave
Chacomb Hall.”
“ What are your orders ?”
“ Kindness and care for Chauncey; that the place is kept
up properly; a quiet and decorous life for yourself.”
"And if I refuse ?”
“Separation, and as small an allowance as I can persuado
the lawyers to make you."
“ And Chauncey?"
“In that case, I should get him a keeper of the other sex.”
She poured out some brandy and water, and gave it him
with a cheerful smile.
“ Joe,” she said, “
you
know I would not be such a bad lot
as to round on your cousin, whatever he's done—though how
in the world you can call it a delusion the Lord only knows.
As for your orders, why, you dear old boy, when did I ever
disobey you, except in marrying that poor little undersized
Richard the Third sort of madman ? Let us be friends."
“Only on condition of your carrying out faithfully all I
want,” said the doctor.
“Of course I will," she replied, with a wonderful clearing
up of her face. Some women look so much better when they
are humble and obedient. “ Then let us have no
quarrelling. After all, I do like a masterful man. As for
you, Joe, you always were masterful. I give in. I will do
whatever you like. Shake hands, old fellow, and forget the row."
He shook her ringed and jewelled fingers with more
ceremony than she cared for. A little of the old ease and
familiarity would have been more agreeable to her.
“ We will be friends,” said the doctor,“ so long as"

“Yes, yes, I know. You shall be obeyed. Did I not
always obey you when you hadn't a red cent in your pocket,
and was only Joe Chacomb-rattling Joe-marching about
behind the scenes as if the place belonged to you? Those
were the real jolly times. Oysters and stout-
"Oysters were sixpence a dozen then,” said the doctor,
with a sigh of sympathy. “The wind used indeed to be
tempered to the shorn lamb. How the deuce do medical
students
manage now, I wonder ?”
“You sang a good sony then, Joe.”
“I did," he said, shaking his head.
“Do you remember that night when we had supper after
Boxing Night at the Wells? Lotty Vandeleur-Wicks her
real name was—and I danced after
supper,
for
you
to decide
which danced best. You gave me the prize, I remember.
This was the step.”
She sprang to her feet, gathered up her skirts, and began
to dance after the old-fashioned Columbine manner, which
had, perhaps, certain advantages over modern burlesque
dancing. It was a curious sight, this stout and jolly-looking
woman of forty gravely pirouetting, with her heavy silks
gathered up under her arm. The doctorlooked on and laughed.
“Let me smoke, Ju, and it will be almost like old times.”
He lit a cigar, and they fell back on talk, and reminiscences
of a jeunesse orageuse. At two o'clock in the morning he got

be hypocrites! To think that we can only last ten years or
so, and then have to give up being jolly, and pretend we like
being miserable! Isn't it too bad? And, Joe, Joe, did you
ever think that I should be such a fool, such a great, big,
silly fool, as to marry that—that,"
“My cousin Chauncey, Julia ? I did not think it, nor did

CHAPTER XXV.
MARION was at work before Adie was dressed or Fred had
risen, when a letter was brought her, addressed Marion Revel,
tout court—without, that is, the ordinary gracious prefix of
miss or madam. The writing was slovenly and half educated,
the spelling was loose; but the postmark was Comb Leigh,
and Marion tore it open with a trembling hand. She read
it with bewilderment.
“Marion REVEL” (it began)—“My husband has received
the letter you caused to be sent to him. He wishes me to
say that he will give you nothing. That is all. For my own
part, I beg to assure you, with the most profound respect,
that you can do no harm to him, and that you had better not
try it on. I defy you.—Yours to command,
“ JULIA CHACOMB.
“P.S. -I know all about it.”
There was a second postscript, written in a shaky hand,
outside the envelope-
“She won't let me send you any money. Ask Joseph. -
C. C.”
What did it mean? Marion read and re-read the letter.
Presently Adie appeared.
“Read that extraordinary letter, Adie dear. Tell me what
it means, if you can.”
“ It is from the new Mrs. Chacomb. I met the doclur
yesterday"
“Adie, I hope you remembered your promise not to speak
to him about
“We did not talk about you, dear. I told him about
Fred and the five pounds; and he laughed, and offered to
give me some more."

“ You did not take it?"
“No, Marion, I did not. Then he told me about Chauncey
Chacomb. He has married his housekeeper. I suppose the
name of the lady is Julia. Evidently it is from her. Poor
Mr. Chacomb! He used to be kind to us in his way."
" But what does the letter mean?”
“It means, Marion, I suspect-it means that Fred has
been writing for money."
“Oh, Adie, he would not-he could not!"
“ He could, because he has written at different times to
everybody who would lend him any. My dear Marion, Fred
is one of those lazy lilies who neither can nor will toil and
spin. He only borrows."
“But from Chauncey Chacomb! Oh, it would be impos-
sible for him to borrow of Chauncey Chacomb."
“He wrote once to the doctor, I know, because the doctor
told me so; and he is always writing to Lord Rodney Benbow.”
“Oh, Fred, Fred, what will become of us?" sighed Marion.
She thought of what the doctor had prophesied—that all
the nobleness left in her brother would drop out of him
little by little, till there should be no spark left at all; and
she felt that this was a beginning of the end. What was
she to do?
“It is clear what will become of Fred," said her sister,
who was in a harsh mood towards her brother, in consequence
of the embargo laid upon the four sovereigns. " It is clear
enough that Fred never means to do anything except live
upon his friends. Marion, don't say anything. I am as
fond of
my
brother as you can be, but I am not so blind to
his faults. I told you about the money yesterday. In the
evening there was nothing left; he had paid away the whole
of it in a single day. He does not go into the City at all, as
he pretends; he spends the whole day-think of it, Marion,
the whole day long-in billiard-rooms, playing pool for six-
pences. When he is lucky, he wins ten or fifteen shillings
a day, and sometimes more; with this he goes to a restau-
rant, and dines well. When he is unlucky, he makes you
give him money for dinner, and dines well too."
“Don't, Adie! You are unjust.”
“No, I am true. Whatever we do, Marion—whatever you
do, for I can do nothing-we shall be always brırdened with
the weight of our brother, who is more idle than the shifting
shadows."

Tho door opened, and he came in, fresh from dressing,
radiant, handsome, and graceful.
Marion gave him the letter to read.
“Who is Julia Chacomb ?” he asked, with the least possible
blush.
“Mr. Chacomb is married again—to his housekeeper."
“Oh, I wish I had known it,” said Fred.
“Frederick, is it possible that you have written for money
to Mr. Chauncey Chacomb ?”
“Yes, Marion, I have. He tried to put on a defiant and
even consciously innocent air, but it was a failure; his eyes
dropped before her look. “Yes, Marion, I have."
“Do you often write to people for money ?"
“ Sometimes I do. I write to whomever I think will help
me. I am the head of the house, and I act as I think best in
the interests of us all."
The girls looked at each other-Marion in dismay.
“ Fred, I am in earnest,” she said, after a little.
6 You
are not to write to any one again for money. It is dis-
honourable."
“I am the best judge of that,” he said.
“Then judge so for yourself. Above everything, remember,
once for all, that I will not have any letters written to Chauncey
Chacomb. There are reasons-oh, heaven! are there not
reasons ?—why we can never, never, not in the last extremities
of poverty, apply to Chauncey Chacomb.”
“You talk strangely, Marion," said her brother.
“You talk wisely, Marion,” said her sister.
“You forget, perhaps," continued Frederick, " that I am
the master of my own actions.”
“No, I do not forget. You will do what you think best,
without any interference from us. But one thing I can do—"
“Marion !” cried Adie, alarmed.
Adie, let me say it for once, and have done with it. The
time is come when we must understand each other. Our
father was the most honourable man in all the world—thank
God for it !—and we, Adie and I, try to follow in his steps.
You may stay with us as long as you will do the same. We
shall not grudge you all you want, if we can afford it. We
will give you what we can, and we will spare and save for
you. But I will not, I cannot, keep even my own brother in
the same house with me if I cease to think him—a gentleman."
Fred was perfectly silent.

“Fred, dear," she continued, caressing his head as if he were
a child, “ will you promise me-promise me, my dear—to
write no more such letters ? If we cannot give you quite all
the luxuries you would like, we will give you all we can. The
other day Adie went without food all day, in order that you
might dine well. You took all the money that our only friend
had given hor. To-day you shall have what we have, only
leave us enough to buy something—it matters little what-
to eat. Do what you like, my brother, if you cannot work or
find work to do, but spare us dishonour. Let us keep our
name, at least, from the mouths of people. Surely, this is
but a little thing to ask you."
Fred rose with something like an oath upon his lips; but
it was bravado, not rage. He was not so hardened as not to
feel the justice of his sister's reproaches.
“Let me go, Marion. One would think I was a—a—devil-
a fiend. Is it I who keep you starving? Is it I who keep
you living in this miserable hole, when"
“It is, Fred-you, and nobody else,” said Adie. “Marion
has made nearly three pounds a week for months. With that
and her own income we could all three live in a cottage, where
there was fresh air at least. Out of the three
you
have taken
two. And what have you done with it?"
“Why should I not write to Chauncey Chacomb ? He was
my father's best friend-his only friend. It is his duty to
help us. Marion, you forget yourself strangely when you
lecture me on points of honour. Remember, if you please,
that I have all my life associated with gentlemen and men of
honour. I have—"
“Once more, my brother, understand me clearly. So long
as I can make the money for you I shall not complain,
provided—I will not repeat it.”
He left his breakfast untasted, seized his hat, and went out.
“I am glad you spoke, Marion dear,” said Adie ; “not that
it will do much good, but it shows Fred what we think. My
dear, I will try to get something for myself to do—I will
indeed so as to relieve you a little.”
Marion shook her head, and laughed through
“Poor Adie! I do not think you will do much good, but
you may try. Women's work is not for girls who have no
training and no art. Go and consult my wrinkled little friend,
the schoolmaster. You can get nothing but good advice fron
bim.”

women.
"Why cannot I paint like you, Marion ? It seems so
easy.”
Adie's notions of art were limited. She could understand
colour, as was proved by her dress, but she had no more fecl-
ing for form than generally belongs to her sex. It is strange
that the sense of beauty—the sixth sense—is so deficient in
one-half of the human race. Men very early learned it:
witness the names in that brief chronicle ef antediluvian
Eve's name means breath of life : she is simply the
mother, because poor Adam, who had no means of com-
parison, probably failed to appreciate her beauty at its true
worth. Presently we get other names, which show the birth
and the progress of Art, which is the recognition of beauty.
Adab," the beautiful,” and Zillah," the shadow,” are wives
of the first antediluvians who had a discerning eye. After
Zillah came her daughter Naamah," the lovely," who marks
the period when men first began to be carried out of them-
selves by the radiance of a woman's beauty. The way was
thus prepared for Helen. Philandering is, indeed, of extreme
antiquity; for Lamech, who "slew a young man to his hurt”.
probably out of jealousy-was its inventor. But neither
Naamah, nor Zillah, nor Adah understood, we may be sure,
her own beauty, or the reason of the power she possessed over
men.
Fred Revel went away in a sore and savage frame of mind.
Marion's plain speaking humiliated him-everything that
was true seemed to humiliate him. And, moreover, there
were anxieties and difficultics of which Marion knew nothing-
which, if he dared to tell her, might bring some excuse for his
letter to Chauncey Chacomb. He was in a sore scrape-a far
worse scrape than Marion suspected.
Life look black indeed to the young man, as he turned into
the street that bright spring morning. It was pot only that
he had spent on himself money which might have given com-
fort to his sisters' lives, nor was it that he had written letters
to every man who might help him with money. As for the
former, perhaps he did not know the sacrifices daily made on
nis tehalf, or if he knew, he set the knowledge aside with the
reflection that the condition of things was only temporary,
and would be changed—as soon as he got his appointment;
and as for borrowing money, anybody might do that. To be
sure, in every man's case there is a limit to the borrowing
power; and Fred had arrived at his extreme tether, without

being known, in any single case, to have repaid again. He
borrowed, like Dicky Carew, from everybody—even from that
worthy himself. Unlike Dicky, whose litt's earnings were
always encroached upon by his own habits of lending to
brethren in distress, Fred Revel never lent to any one. What
he got, he spent in fostering the delusion that he belonged to
the wealthy—at least, to the easy class. It was not selfish so
much as foolish. He lived for ever in that fool's paradise
about which we have spoken before. He told himself a thou-
sand times a day that better days were coming, and he looked
for the better days to that most unsteady of supporters, a
patron. Some men are so weak that they cannot place the
real situation before themselves; they live in an atmosphere
of self-deceit of their own making; they veil their figures in
a cloud, which hides the contours and obscures the surround-
ings.
There was one great reason why Fred should not run in a
groove with the rest of the world—he had no money, and he
could not work. That was it: he could not work. He had
never been able to study at school. It was a grand mistake
to send him to Oxford. He cared nothing for reading. Unless
he had work in the open air, he could live but one life-that
of the lazzaroni, who bask in the sun, and let the days slip by.
He ought to have been a sailor.
Modern society takes no account of these unfortunates ;
and yet it is this class which feels most deeply the con-
sequence of man's first disobedience, and his fall. They
are the brethren most to be pitied, for, with them, the
earning of bread by desk labour is torture, mental and
physical. We do not pity them even-we only despise
them. The average workman has no words to express his
contempt for him who cannot work; the structure of society
has no place for him. Perhaps, in a more advanced civiliza-
tion, the disease will be recognized as a somewhat uncommon
but incurable phenomenon, and hospitals will be provided,
with gardens, music, dancing, and art-everything but love-
making, because the disease may be hereditary-for the lazy
ones of the earth. Of course, the accidental possession of
money will not be considered an excuse for keeping out of
the hospital; that, on the other hand, will help to furnish
the less fortunate with the graces of life.
There was, then, a more bitter sting than Marion knew of
when she roused herself to say, for the first time in her life,

253
words of bitterness to this shallow-hearted and feather-
brained brother.
And then there was Winifred to think of.
He walked, with those uneven steps which mark a mind
ill at ease, and with quick, impatient gestures, to his favourite
haunt, the billiard-room. No one was there but the marker,
practising with infinite patience a stroke with which to
astonish the habitual players.
“I want to know," Fred began—"I want to know if you
can do anything for me about that money I borrowed ?"
“Notþing. I told you so at the beginning. That's the
sixth time running I've made this stroke. If he won't renew,
you must pay up.
“I can't pay up."
The marker whistled meaningly, and chalked his cue.
“I have tried, but I do not know what to do. It's thirty-
seven pounds three and tenpence.”
“Thirty-seven, three, ten. Ah! And, counting interest,
say forty; there is always something or other which they
put on. Saul is a devil of a fellow at totting up."
“ You took me to him.'
“I did—that's quite true. I told you he would let you
have money, and he did. At good interest, and on security,
Saul will let anybody have money. He would discount a
bill for the devil himself, with pleasure, if there was a
respectable name at the back. You signed a paper, and took
what he gave you.”.
“Ten pounds and a box of cigars. That was all I got.”
“It doesn't seem much; but there, you know, you would
have it; and you were so certain that you would get your
appointment before this, that you would have taken a
thousand if he'd let you. Come, now, don't blame me.'
“What can he do?” Fred asked, in an anxious tone.
“I don't know. If there is any way of getting his money
back, he will try that way. If there isn't, he'll make it hot
for you some other way. Lord bless you, I knew how it would
happen. I've gone through it all myself, only it was a long
time ago. You must pay up, or he'll put on the screw.'
The speaker was a short, thickset man, whose beard was
grey, and his hair touched with grey—a man well on the
shady side of fifty.
“I saw it all coming from the very beginning, and here it
is. You have got a nice, light touch with the cue, and you

come here for the sixpenny lives. You bounce about your
family; but you've got no money, and know no trade. There
is only one trade
open
“What is that ?” asked the young man, with a flush.
“Mine. I was a gentleman once. Not for very long; but
a gentleman to begin with. My father served his Majesty,
King George III., and carried colours in the l'eninsula. How
did I come down to this? By the very same road that you
are travelling, Mr. Revel; exactly—the very same road.
Young gentlemen who dislike work, and can play billiards,
take to playing for money. Those who play billiards for a
living always end in marking at billiards for a living. Lord
bless you, it's as plain as a pikestaff. Go the round of the
rooms, ask them all to tell you what brought them to it, you
will hear much about the same story.
You wouldn't shake
hands with me now, would you? I don't mind it, my boy,
not a bit. My word, I was a much finer fellow than you
at
one time.'
He sat down, and prepared to reveal his own story with
.considerable enjoyment.
“We wore whiskers then, and no beard-only Cavalry
men wore a moustache. We had long hair brushed in waves.
We had frock coats tight at the waist; high shirt collars
and large neckties. I think I see myself now-going down
Bond-street, with Captain Rook and Lord Deuceace, arm in
arm, as if the pavement belonged to us. They both went to
the dogs worse than me, poor beggars! There, you've read
Thackeray's History of Deuceace, of course. I always wanted
to sit to Thackeray myself, only I never got the chance. I
would have put him up to a tip or two.
“As to being satisfied with my present aristocratic mode
of life, I can't say
I Would I change it? I certainly
would if I could. But there's only one state of life for which
I would change it, and that's a regular allowance-say three
pounds a week, enough for my quiet brandy and water, and
my pipe. After all, it is not so very bad. None of the crew
ever come here ; and if they did, they would not know their
old chum. As for the broken-down ones—that's most of the
set-we never speak when we do meet. We pass on, and
pretend not to know each other. Deuceace went to the bad
altogether, as you know, perhaps I think the turf is worse
than the billiard-table. Here, you see, you only ruin yourself,
Over the races you ruin the poor devils who will bet as well.
Cards are bad, because in the long run you take to playing with

marked packs. That's what Captain Rook came to grief over.
When I last heard of him it was from Charley Fetherstone.
He saw him at the Grand Prix in Paris, with a pari mutuel,
and in the evening came across him in a two-franc hell. Now,
at billiards you may play dark, and that isn't a nice thing for
a gentleman to come to; but, damn it, that's the worst you
can do. No one can say a worse thing of me than that. After
all, as you see, you can always pick up an honest living when
you've forgotten that you are a gentleman.”
Fred groaned. The marker warmed up in his recollections,
and went on :-
Charley Fetherstone has not done so well, though. He
would combine the three: gambled, betted, and played
billiards. A very dashing and brilliant fellow he was; but
somehow it all came to nothing. He should have stuck
to one thing, you see,
like me.
What with being ducked
for a welsher at Hampton, expelled his club for turning up
the king at écarté, and getting known all over London for
dark play, he hadn't a chance in the end. I met him a few
months ago carrying a pair of advertising boards. Think of
that! And Charley once the dandiest young fellow in all New
Bond-street. I was coming along here, with my old briar-
root in my mouth, when I came alongside of him. I saw his
eyes flash, and then he dropped them, and plodded on like
most of the board-carrying lot, noticing nothing. I couldn't
help myself. I had five shillings in my pocket-two half-
crowns--and I slipped one into his hand. Take that, mate,'
I says-rough, you know. "What's this for?' said Charley,
staring at me, with the best bit of acting you ever saw in your
life I never saw you before, mate.' No more you did, old
fellow,' I said ; ' quite so—no more you did. We never clapped
eyes on each other till this blessed minute, did we? That's
why I gave you the half-crown. Better luck to you, Charley
Fetherstone!' He never answered, but he dropped his head,
and went on plodding in the mud. Poor devil! poor devil!"
Fred listened with a swelling heart. Was all the world,
then, going to prophesy disaster ?
Well, young_gentleman, that's all. I've told you your
lines as near as I can read them. You can play billiards, and
vou can't work, and you don't want."
Perhaps he spoke out of pure kindliness, and from a desire
.o warn the young man; perhaps from the cynical depths of
a dark experience.
“What security did you give Saul for the money ?”

“ A bill of sale on my furniture.”
“ Very well, then; let him have the furniture. What does
a young fellow like you want with furniture ? Your chambers
are in the Temple, are they not? Let them clear you out,
and be hanged to them! Go home and put everything
valuable in your pocket. I remember when Dick Latitat,
the lawyer—he's a judge in India now—found out there was
going to be an execution put into his chambers, he moved
everything out at dead of night to a friend who lived opposite,
and in the morning, when the Philistines came, the spoil was
gone. Not that I should advise you to do that, because a
bill of sale is a serious thing. Let them take the lot, and
you'll be easier about it.”
Fred sat down on one of the seats that ran round the
room, and looked blankly before him. A billiard-marker!
Dr. Chacomb had advised him to become an advertising tout.
Such was the opinion of the world about him. He could not
even reply to the marker's prophecy; for it seemed as if
suddenly the very foundations of his life were giving way
beneath him. Where could he get this money? And if he
did not get it, how to break the blow to Marion ? For he
knew well enough the immediate effect of his inability to pay.
He had given, in fact, a bill of sale on the furniture, nomi-
nally his own, in his capacity as “head of the house.”
Come, don't give way,” said his friend.
6. You owe me a
matter of five shillings or so; we will chalk that off, if you're
so hard up as all that. Try and borrow the money. See
Saul, and ask him to make terms."
Fred went away and sought the money-lender. He was a
middle-aged man, dressed in sporting guise. He sat in a
little office, without any sign of office-work except a safe ;
there was a table, and there were chairs. The table was
covered with sporting papers, and Mr. Saul was reading one
of them. His manner was not calculated to prejudice ao
stranger in his favour : it was uneasy, while it affected ease;
it was half familiar and half distant; the manner of one who
is an Ishmaelite in the world-feared and distrusted by the
very men whom he most obliges. It is the penalty of the
profession. Money-lending, the mystery of the hangman,
ind the discharge of the duty of sheriff's officer, may rank
together as the three least desirable of callings.
“True to time, Mr. Revel,” he said. “I expected you in
a day or two. Sit down. Come to discharge your little

account? It is not due yet, though-not for three days.
Let me see.” He consulted a note-book, and opened his safe.
“Here is the account_thirty-nine nineteen and eleven.”
Why don't you say forty at once ? And to think that it
is only six months ago, and all I got was ten pounds!"
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Revel. You took ten pounds in
gold, and a box of most valuable cigars, which you might
have sold for Ah, well, we need not go into that. Shall
I write you a receipt ?”
“No; I have not got any money.
The man looked at him with a feigned surprise.
“No money? That is awkward, for the note will be due
in three days."
“I can't help it. You must give me a little time. Come,
Mr. Saul, you do not want the money to-day or to-morrow.
Give me a month to look about me.”
“ That is not the way to conduct business, Mr. Revel.
The little trifle—it is certainly a very small sum-is wanted
by me imperatively, to make up a large sum due to a friend,
a debt of honour. In fact, I must have it. You gave me a
bill of sale, did you not? Yes. Really, it would be very
disagreeable- Come, Mr. Revel, you will go away and
borrow the noney of some friend, I am sure. I would not
press you if I were not obliged. I tell you what I will do.
Find me a good name, and I will do another bill for you.
I will give you three days yet.” This was a gracious conces-
sion, because three days is the exact space allowed by the
law. “ You shall have three days, and then- But no doubt
we shall have a better account in that time. Anything like
good security, my dear sir, good security-reversion, mort-
yage, post-obits, the name of a good friend—I will oblige you
in any way possible. You shall never call me a hard man.”
There was one chance yet. He would go and see his old
and long-suffering friend, Lord Rodney Benbow. Lord
Rodney's wild oats had long since been sown. He was going
in for political life; he was private secretary to the Earl of
Cromarty; he was proposing to stand for a family borough
in the Conservative interest at the next election; he was
already a most respectable man; and it was not at all his
intention to keep up an intimacy with a man like his former
friend Revel, who was just hovering with uncertain wing on
the outskirts of civilized society. He received him, however
with a show of the old cordiality, and shook hands with Lim.

“ What is it, Revel? Are you in a mess again ?”
“I am always in a mess.”
“ You certainly always are. How much is it this time an
Forty pounds. I borrowed it six months ago. Got ten
pounds and a box of cigars of Saul the money-lender."
“I know the scoundrel well.”
“I gave a bill of sale for it on the furniture.”
“I was not aware that
you had any furniture."
Fred coloured. He had not thought it necessary to inform
his distinguished friend of the exact conditions of his life.
“And now you cannot meet it. Well, let the man clear off
the sticks. I suppose the furniture of your chamber is not
very precious to you." He, like the marker, thought Fred
was living by himself. “He will probably lose by the bargain.
Let him come and take it."
"I thought that perhaps you would—"
“ Lend you the money? My dear fellow, I haven't got it.
Do
you know that I have lent you more than fifty during the
last two years? I don't want to bother you about it, and I
dare say you will be all right some day; but a younger son
bas not too much to spare. Why don't you do something for
yourself ?"
“Did you remember to speak about my application at the
Colonial Office ?"
"I did. It's no good, my boy. They are pestered with
applications. There are seven hundred names down at the
Colonial Office already. They will not give you anything.
You must abandon the notion of a Government appointment

And now,
once. It did not hurt me much to get rusticated, but it
played the deuce with you. Try and see things in their right
light. Give up family tradition and Oxford prejudice, and
take anything. No one whose opinion is worth anything to
you will think twice about what you are.
Fred,
my boy, good-bye. Let the furniture go to the money-lending
fellow; give up billiards and the West-end, and go in for
work, like me. If I can help you, I will. Only let the world
see that you can help yourself.”
Fred mechanically took his hand and left him. It was
dismissal. There was no hope from that quarter, nor from
any other. In three days' time the money-lender woulă
execute his threat and sell them up. Sharp lessons, but they
came, like the admonition to the unfortunates in Tartarus,
too late.
“Discite justitiam moniti, et non temnere divos.”
“Admirable advice !” says Scarron the scoffer; “but what is
the good of it down there?”
Quite so. Fred had learned from the doctor that he was a
lazy vaurien; from Marion that he had disgraced and dis-
honoured himself by writing begging letters; from the bil.
liard-marker that his ultimate profession was undoubtedly to
mark at billiards; and from Lord Rodney Benbow that he
was certainly going downhill. It was quite true; but he had
got lower than anybody knew, and now he was going to be
found out by Marion. All the humiliations he bad ex.
perienced were nothing in comparison with this. Winifred
would know it, too. Adrienne would know it. They woulu

What could he do? How fend off the blow?
Winifred would cry, and believe him when he told her
something in mitigation of the offence; Adie would laugh
bitterly, and smite him with winged words; but this was
nothing compared with the reproach he would read in the
eyes of Marion.
CHAPTER XXVI.
“And now, Adie," said Marion, " let us forget Fred's sins,
poor fellow. See, the picture is finished-actually finished.
I can do no more to it."

many worse pictures in the Exhibition.”
Poor Marion !
If she had shown her sister a poem, Adie would have
assured her, with a gerial smile, that she had seen worse
verses in print; if a tale, that inferior productions had
appeared in the Housemaid's Journal. And then Adie would
have thought that she was conveying a rare and merited
compliment to her sister.
“I do like the face of the girl,” she said—as if, bad as the
thing was, there were some merits. suppose because it is
painted after me. And it all seems so pretty, and you are
very clever, Marion.
"Not that it is the slightest use," she went on, dolefully.
“ You will not be able to sell it, I suppose, unless Burls takes
it of you for a tenth part of what it is worth. Marion, we
are an unlucky family. Sometimes I think we shall never
get out of our degradation.”
“Not degradation, Adie.”

She had lost all faith in her sister's power of success..

“It is very good of Dr. Chacomb,” replied her sister, who
was in a despondent mood—“very good, indeed. But it is no

Perhaps the bad luck will turn, Adie. At all events, is

“I must be. I found out another thing yesterday. Promise.
mr, Marion, if I tell it you, to keep it a secret.”
“ What is it, Adie ?”
“ Winifred Owen is a very pretty girl, Marion."
" Well?”
“And a ladylike girl."
« Yes.”

“And-and-how should you like Winifred Owen to be-
come Winifred Revel ?”
Marion only opened her eyes.
“ You may make up your mind to that event, my dear,”
Adie went on, with the calmness of despair. “ It will be
quite a marriage of romance. He has nothing; she has
nothing. They will live upon love, without even a cottage.
What do you think of it ?”
“Poor Winifred,” said Marion. “I will speak to Fred at
once.”
“ No, do not, Marion—let things go on. Now you know
why I am so cross with him this morning.
It does seem
too bad. He ought to be content with dragging his sisters
down, and spare poor little Winifred. It is too late, Marion.
She loves him."
“ How do you know, Adie?”
“Because I can see, my dear; because I have got eyes in
my head; because when girls love people they look in one
way, and only one way, because Winifred is carried away
with his good looks and winning ways. Poor Fred would
win the heart of an icicle if he set about it in earnest."
“It may stimulate him, to be engaged.”
“No, Marion. Nothing will ever stimulate Fred to do any
work. I know my dear Fred. He will just go on for ever
as he is going on now; he will spoil her life as he has
spoiled yours.

marry ? Think of living on year after year, in love with a
man whom you cannot hope to marry. Marion, what is the
matter? Are
you
ill?”
For her sister's cheek paled, and she sat down suddenly,
as if Adie had struck her some sharp blow—which, indeed,
was the case, though she did not know it.
“Poor Fred! He does not tell us any more, as he did at
first, what he does and where he goes. That is the worst
sign. I feel as if we were becoming outcasts. Why are we
alone in the world in having no friends and relations? Where
are your mother's people, Marion ? Where are mine? Whero
are all our French cousins ? Surely the Revolution did not
kill everybody. Did my father have no friends among his
brother-officers who would help us if they were asked ?”
“My dear, have patience."
“Patience! Oh, Marion, I think we have had patience
enough. I hate it—this cramped, miserable life. I have no

more patience with it at all. Our hopes are bound by a
fraction or so, more or less. We live from day to day; we
tremble at shadows; and we are wretched because poor Fred
spends a few shillings on himself.”
Then the doctor came, and the topic was necessarily
changed.
He planted himself in front of the picture, and began to
criticize it.
“I am not really," he said, a judge of pictures at all. I
only pretend to be, like the rest of the world. This, however,
seems to me a pretty painting. I never saw a dress like that;
but then painters put any dress they like on their models. I
never saw a sky like that— light that never shone on earth
or ocean'—but then I never saw lights like those in Turner's
pictures. “So much the worse for you,' Turner used to say,
when any one objected to his light that he didn't see the
colour. The flowers look faithful, and the leaves seem as if
they were shaking in the breeze. How do you make things
look as if they were alive? Miss Revel, you are an artist. I
am not a critic, and so I can tell the truth. There is genius
in the picture. Now 'let us take it away. I have got the
frame ready, and it must go in to-day or to-morrow. As for
the face, it's yours, Miss Adie : that is another way of saying
that it is so beautiful that no one ever will believe it can be
true to life.”
“ That is right, Dr. Chacomb. Say something more to me,
just to put me in a good humour. I want a little coaxing
and petting this morning."
“It's a lovely face, Miss Adie,” he went on. "Your sister
has caught the laugh in it. That's the prettiest thing of all
in your face, that it always seems to laugh. Perhaps it is
your eyes that laugh. You ought to be the happiest girl in
the world.”
“ Isn't he delightful, Marion? I know I ought to be,
Dr. Chacomb. I've got the 'makings,' as Fred says, of any
amount of happiness—tons of happiness; but who could be
narpy in such a frock as this ? And, oh! if you could only
see my boots. Now you have said something pleasant to me,
go on with Marion's picture.”
“Well, then, I have spoken about it to a patient and friend
of mine, an R.A., and got you such little influence at work as
may be useful when it comes to hanging. I did not say the
picture was by a lady, because the R.A.s don't like ladies,

Even Ruskin says that women cannot paint. Did you ever
hear how a lady first became a student of the Academy?
She sent a drawing in under an assumed name; no one knew
anything about the artist; it was accepted, made some noise,
and then they found out. But they could not turn it out
again, of course. That was some years ago, in the year '60,
and plenty of ladies have been admitted since then.'
And
you
think
your friend's interest will help ?”
“ I hope so.
You see, there are so many pictures by
Academicians, and so many by well-known men. When theso
are all provided for, the new and unknown painters have gut
to take their chance. And for most of them it's a mers coss-
up. Some must be taken. Yours is a good deal better than
many that are taken; but, pardon me, there are many of the
rejected which would show well even by the side of this pic-
ture. There, you see, interest comes in.”
" And if it is taken ?”
“Then it shall be sold; then you will have commissions in
plenty; then
you shall see your way to a comfortable-per.
haps a large-income every year; then, my dear young ladies,
you shall say farewell to Lowland-street, and rejoice the world
to which you belong.”
“ Dr. Chacomb," exclaimed Adie, with enthusiasm, “I love
you; upon my word, I adore you. You never come here
without raising our spirits and giving us hope. You are not
mocking us ? You really think that one may reasonably
look forward to something this year-say a journey in a van
to Epping Forest with the ladies and gentlemen of Elephant-
row—they went all together last year, and came home at
midnight. Or perhaps one may pray—it's no use praying
for anything unless it is reasonably probable—for a new dress
for both of us; or what do you say, Marion, to hoping-just
tempting Providence by a prayer, you know-that we may
see our way to take lodgings where we may behold a field
and a tree ?!?
“Really," said the doctor, "you may hope all these things.
And if you will permit me-
“I will permit you anything, doctor, if Marion's picture
gets into the Academy."
“ You hear ?" And the doctor called Marion to witness.
“ She permits me anything. That means a visit to the dresse
maker's at least."
So he went away, carrying the picture with him.

“My dear," said Adie, “it is such a pity-oh! such :
terrible pity!"
“What is a terrible pity ?”
“That it cannot be, Marion. The doctor is the best friend
we have; and, Marion, he is a friend out of love to you. Do
you think he looks for no reward at all ?"
They were interrupted again. This time their visitor was
a tall, thin man, with stooping shoulders, very long white
hair, and a curiously pale face. They had never seen him
before, but from Dicky Carew's description they knew their
vizitor for the famous Hermit of Lowland-street.
They knew him by his tall and stately figure, by his hand-
some face, by his cold air, and by the studied carelessness of
his dress. It was noon, and he was attired in morning
costume of the latest fashion. He wore gloves, and had a
flower in his button-hole; he carried a new hat, and but for
his white, colourless cheek you would have taken him for the
freshest importation possible from New Bond-street.
“Pardon me,” he said. “I have to ask a thousand pardons
for this intrusion. I live over your heads, and it is, perhaps
you know, a great many years since I left my rooms.
no one except my secretary. If I fail in the politeness due
to two most interesting and charming young ladies, you will,
I am sure, be good enough to excuse my gaucherie on the
ground of my recluse habits."
Marion bowed. She took a dislike to the man at once.
Adie would perhaps have laughed, but the solemnity of the
address overawed her.
“I learned accidentally,” he said, looking from one to the
other, " that one of the young ladies is an artist.”
"I am an artist,” said Marion—"or, rather, I try to be an
artist.”
“ Thank you," he said, looking at Adie. “One of the
ladies—perhaps both-plays and sings very charmingly."
“My sister," said Marion,“plays and sings so as to charm
me, at least. I presume you have overheard her, upstairs.
If
you
will let us know what time will least inconvenience
you, we will observe that hour.”
He bowed and smiled.
“It is not to speak of your music that I have broken my
riule,” he said. “I hoped, when I resolved to quit an un-
worthy world, to make no more acquaintance-never to ask,
never to know, if I could help it, any one's name with whom
I see

I might be obliged to converse. I hoped to pass the
remainder of my existence in absolute silence and seclusion."
He waited, to let the preamble take effect.
"That must be very disagreeable," said Adie. "I don't
wonder at your being tired of it. And all the time you have
been locked
up,
did
you
have no one to talk to but Mr. Carew ?”
“My secretary ?” he asked, with a studied elevation of his
eyebrow, as if he had only heard his name once or so-
everything about this man was false, affected, and maniéré.
“In fact, I think I have heard that his name is Carew-an
old Devonshire name, too; an instance of the many survivals,
among the lower classes, of good names.”
“Dear me!” said Adie, in her light, frivolous way. She
was quietly enjoying the spectacle of this visitor, who was as
awkward as an owl in the sunshine. “I should not advise
you to tell Mr. Carew that he belongs to the lower classes.”
Adie,” said her sister, we have not learned yet to what
we owe this visit.''
“Pardon me"/her visitor could not take his eyes off
Adie. “A curious resemblance; the sound of your sister's
voice-are you sisters ?”
“Yes, we are sisters."
“Ah! it is not with you,” he said to Marion. “I was
struck at first, but that is nothing. I am forced out of my
solitude by a pressing want, in which you may help me.”
“ Do you want to talk to somebody?” asked Adie.
that the unworthy world is actually going to be forgiven ?”
The young lady, whose face and voice reminded him of
some old acquaintance, and who treated his solemn airs with
no more respect than if he had been a quite common creature,
disconcerted him hugely.
"Do not speak to me," he replied, “ of the world; I hate
it-I hate it."
“The world,” Adie went on, “is a large ball or sphere,
flattened at the poles, something in the shape of an orange.
It rotates upon its axis once in every twenty-four hours, and
revolves round the sun, which is the centre of the planetary
system which we ignorantly call the universe."
My dear Adie !" Marion cried.
“Geography, my dear Marion—it is so in all the books,
The world is a very large thing, and it must be a very big
heart to hate it."

“That seems very bad,” said Adie. “How did men find

She laid one aside- a simple drawing of a single figure
emerging from a tent, in ice and snow, looking with a wild
expression of terror as he buckled on his sword.

He atched it from her.
“No. I did not know it was there. I will choose one for you.

The face was the same; but it was his face his own face.
She saw that in a minute, in spite of the change which twenty
years had brought to a face once gallant and gay, and still
Landsome.
He passed over the remark in silence.
“If you will kindly," he said, with a resumption of his cold
politeness—"if you will kindly attempt a reproduction, a
pasticcio, of this little unpretending sketch, I shall be happy
indeed. I am so selfish”-he turned to Adie—“that I shall
try to make your charming sister the accomplice in these
innocent pleasures of mine. If I could, by any persuasion,
enlist you in the same cause-
She shook her head.
“I assure you,” she said, “I do not paint at all;
and nono
of my pleasures are innocent-not dove-like, that is, like your
own."
“I mean," he replied, " that if you would sometimes con-
descend to visit the cell of a Solitary, you might cheer the
hours of retirement with the sweetness of your voice. Saul,
you know, had David.”
“ Yes," said Marion, "and threw his javelin at him. My
sister, Mr. Jilliecrip--I think that is
your name-cannot
pay
visits to your rooms, nor can I.”
“Pardon me again.” He smiled, so as to lay bare a whole
row of white teeth. “I find that I am more spoiled for society
than I had anticipated. I should have known that my invi-
tation was contrary to the convenances. Pray forgive me.
Only, perhaps, you will not allow my rudeness to interfere
with
your
usual practice on the piano. Let me, at least, have
the pleasure of hearing you play and sing, as you have been
accustomed to do."
“If you want society," said Adie, in her narve manner, "I
don't see why you are a Hermit. If you remain a Hermit,
that must be because you do not care for society. If you
want cheering up, why not go back to the men you have
found so very, very wicked ?”
“I hate society," said the Solitary.
· Adie, dear, we have no excuse for asking this gentleman
anything about his private affairs. I will try to copy your

result; but I do not promise much."
“I will come down, if I may be allowed, from time to time,

the twin muses, the sisters of singing and painting, Euterpe
and Poly-Polyhymnia, I think, unless it was Proserpine;
but my classical memory is weak."
Marion was annoyed at the man's florid language.
“You may come," she said, shortly. “Indeed, you have
a right. Good morning, sir."

the stairs,

“Do not let him come here when I am out," said Marion.
- Promise me not to go up to his rooms, or to talk to him.
I don't like the man.'
They heard, presently, his footsteps over their heads,
walking backwards and forwards.
The Hermit was in a fever. He had actually seen and
talked to two young ladies, after fourteen years of incarcera-
tion. He was worse than Simon Stylites, who could at least,
if he wished, wink at his fair devotees; he had not even that
.consolation. He read perpetually his yellow French novels
of intrigue, and he fed bis mind upon the distorted unreali.
ties of the Second Empire. But here was reality; and he
trembled now that he met it.
“They are perfectly delicious," he said. “ As for the
younger, I seem to have met her before, somewhere—who is
she like? But the elder girl, with her deep eyes— Ah! if
I could win her, I would—yes, I would give up even my
Hermitage, and go back to-top-he shuddered—“to some
part of the world where no one would know anything about me.”
In his nervousness, he had left all his sketches with Marion.
CHAPTER XXVII.
ADIE left Marion over the sketches, and sought the society
of Mr. Owen. It was a half-holiday, and she knew that she
should find the schoolmaster alone in the deserted school-room.
There, in fact, he was. The sun, shining through the open
windows, made the empty desks and deserted benches look
bright and pleasant. He was sitting at his desk, ensconced
comfortably for the afternoon with Langhorne’s “ Plutarch,”
but he did not look sorry to be disturbed by the girl who so
often came down to talk with him. Plutarch, no doubt an
incomparable author, has no chance, even with an old shool,

master versed in the wisdom of the book of Proverbs, against
the voice and eyes of a pretty girl. The life of Aristides, and
the comparison between him and Cato, are most improving
studies ; but even to an instructor of youth it is more cheerful
to read a page of life.
Therefore Mr. Owen gave his visitor the one chair in the
room, and sat himself down, with crossed legs, on a bench
hefore her. With his matted hair, his seamy and wrinkled
face, his spectacles, and the tips of his short fingers touching
each other, he looked the very effigy of wisdom. The owl-

“And so, Miss Adie, you want my advice about work, do:
you ? Sit down, and let me think.”
“If I could find anything that I could do; but, Mr. Owen,
I am so lamentably ignorant. I know French, to be sure, and
I can play and sing a little ; but that is all. As for history,

Great Mogul.”
“That's because you don't read Plutarch,” said the school.

“ And my geography is worse. I really should not know
whether the
map of America was upside down or not, it is so
long since I looked at it.”
“ There is no upside or downside either to a map. I caned
a boy to-day for not knowing the frontiers of China. To be
sure, I did not know them myself.”
“Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself for caning
the poor boy, Mr. Owen,” said Adie.
“ It is the duty of the boy to know his lessons, and the
duty of the master to awaken bis instincts. It is for example,
• Smite the scorner, and the simple shall beware.' The only
way to do that is by caning him. Draco, you will find, in
Plutarch's Life of Solon, punished everything by death,

there is no greater punishment for the most heinous. As
for the schoolmaster not knowing everything, it is, as every-
body knows, a part of his professional baggage to pretend to
know everything. My dear, if the boys, who are demoniac
by nature, found out a weak point in my knowledge, I should
lose my authority over them. Just look at the range of

as to march with the age-bless you, a schoolmaster is
nowhere who does not march with the age-Euclid, algebra,
and history; the Bible! The wonder is, that the brain stands
it all. But it isn't the amount of knowledge, my dear, that
makes a good schoolmaster feel like going cracked, but the
amount of pretension. Well, we are as honest as we can
afford.”
“I do not want to teach,” said Adie—“I am far too stupid
and too impatient. But there are other ways."
“ There are,” he said, “ fifty other ways. Wait here, and
look at Plutarch, while I go and get a little book of notes.
I made it up two or three years ago, when Winifred was
casting about for a profession. Soinetimes I have thought
about sending it to the papers. You shall hear.
“Now”—he returned with a penny note-book, filled with
figures and references—“I am not going to read you all this,
but only a part. Listen! Axiom First. I've ruled it all
out, like Euclid, in axioms, definitions, and propositions.
Axiom the First-you will have to grant this—No woman
wants to work.''
“Granted,” said Adie. “ That's true, I suppose; nor any
man either."
No; that is the great difference between the sexes. Man
does like work, and woman does not. She likes to sit in
warm corners, and talk. Axiom One's allowed. Axiom
Two: 'If a woman is obliged to work, she likes to work as
little as possible.'”
6. Of course.
“ Axiom Three: "She likes to get as much money as she
can, and to be her own mistress !'
“Yes, I suppose so.”
“We are getting on capitally. Axiom Four : 'A woman
ought to get the just price of her labour.'”
“Of course she ought.”
“She grants everything, this young lady does," said the
philosopher. "She's got a brain fit for Euclid himself.
Axiom Five: There ought to be no difference, provided the
work is the same, between the wages of women and those
of men. That granted too? Very well. We are getting
on famously. These are the introductions to a great science;
but as yet I've only had time to work out one or two propo-
sitions. What a discoverer I might bave been, if I'd only had
the time to work for myself! Fancy reducing all socia:

distinctions to theorems, like Euclid, only more interesting.
First Proposition—this is a startler: All employers of
women ought immediately to be banged by the neck."
“Oh, what a dreadful proposition !"
Adie took the word in its usual, not its Euclidean sense,
and understood Mr. Owen to mean that he wished to intro-
duce a Bill into the Legislature for the sole purpose of
instantly destroying this large and influential class.

he repeated; "without trial, without
jury, without counsel—all on one rope; and I would pull at
the other end."
" Mr. Owen!”—for he looked quite flushed and excited,
and began to stump up and down the school-room, jerking
about his short legs in a really alarming manner.
“ Second Proposition: ‘No woman ought to be allowed
to work for money.''
“ But if they must?”.
“Let me say my say, and then you shall talk. There are
three millions of women earning wages. Sixty thousand are
miliners. Stay, let me read my list.”
He found the place in his book, and read :
«Milliners, 58,460 ; shirtmakers, 26,875; machinists,
10.724; bookbinders, 5,272; florists, 4,260. But the list
oniy accounts for 105,691 ; and I forget now whether it
extends beyond London. Besides these, there are bead-
makers, lace-makers, bonnet-makers, book-folders, boot-
closers, factory girls, shop girls, bandbox-makers, match-
makers, nurses, cigar-makers, and thousands of other trades.
Now, how do they get paid ? Don't answer me.”
He stopped, and tapped his forehead, in reflection.

take contracts. Penal, Miss Adie-imprisonment for life,

“ Dressmaking. That is almost the worst line of any. If
you live in the house you get two or three shillings a week,
and your food; if you live out, you get fifteen shillings and

where even the worst room cannot be got under five shillings
Say two girls live in it together, for economy; there is half-a-
crown for rent. Eating and drinking cannot be got under
eighteenpence a day, because the poor creatures are unable
to buy and cook their own food, but must give a profit to
eating-houses ; that leaves exactly two shillings a week-five
pounds a-year-for keeping up a respectable appearance, and
dressing as the poor things must dress. Why, no servant in
the country, no poor lodging-house maid of all-work, is paid
so badly. My dear, try to think what the girls do. They
work for twelve hours a day, and sometimes more. When
the season is 'over they are turned off. Of course, they have
no share in the profits, although the success of the firm de-
pends on their needles. What right-what right, I say, have
the masters to the great fortunes they make out of the girls ?
The fine ladies never think; and when the girls go wrong-
but there, never mind.

nine shillings in all.. Worse off than the poor creatures in
the shops.

you know that they have to work from five

that they attract gentlemen-paid for degradation.

There is not a man in this country—not a single stupid, illi-

fetching and carrying, earn more than a woman skilled in a
mechanical trade.
“There's a lower depth still, my dear—a lower depth, for
which a judgment ought to fall upon this country, and it will.
It's the Government contracts. They contract for what they
ought to make themselves; they pay the middle-man, to save
themselves the trouble of preventing themselves from being
cheated; they pay a price which they know to be inadequate,
and they look on while the contractor grinds the face of the
poor to fulfil bis bond. Because, my dear, he will have his

profit, that is quite certain; and unless he can cheat the
Government, he will starve his labourer. There are thousands
of women in this country doing Government work, for con-
tractors to make their fortune; and no one to lift up a hand,
and asks that labour for the nation shall be paid a fair and
honest price. A woman working a machine for an army
contract, for twelve hours a day—think of working a machine
twelve hours !--can earn two shillings and twopence-halfpenny
a day; and that less stoppages, it the foreman has a spite.
Six times twelve are seventy-two-seventy-two hours a week
for thirteen shillings and sixpence! Most of them widows,
too, with families of children. There are nearly a million of
widows in this country, and more than half are earning their
own living
“There's philanthropists, now—they talk of teaching women
trades; but why, my dear, why? To get their labour cheaper,
and make the middle-man richer. If philanthropists wanted
to help, they would teach the women to form trades unions."
All this time, Mr. Owen was walking up and down the
room, faster and faster, growing every moment the more
energetic as he denounced the oppressors of womankind.
They are all in league together, I tell you. Woman is to be
the beast of burden because she is the weaker vessel. We
are no better than Australian savages. We treat our women
as they treat theirs—make them do the hardest work, and
take the best pay and the best food for themselves. My dear
Miss Adie, it's shameful, it's intolerable, it's horrible. If I
could make them understand-I mean the fine ladies—the
evils they cause by their apathy, not only to the poor women
with whom they have no sympathy, but with the women o
their own class, for whom they make the path of sin easy.
But there, you don't understand. How should you ?"
“I understand, at least, that women are very badly treated.
But you have not told me of anything that could help me.
What are girls like myself to do, Mr. Owen ?”
"God knows !” he replied, shaking his head. The Lord
only knows what young ladies find to do who have been
brought up to nothing. Some of them go out-for goveruesses
-keeping a governess is the modern way of pretending to
educate the girls as well as the boys, for å tenth part of the
cost; but the examinations all over the country are making
it more and more difficult to find good places, except for girls
who have taken degrees. Some of them try law-copying,

another name for slow starvation; some of theni make preity,
useless things, and send them to places where they pretend
to sell ladies' work. Nobody ever buys anything there, and
after a bit the things come back again, spoiled by being
knocked about a shop.”
“The world seems a much more wicked place than I ever
thought it,” said Adie.
“It is, young lady—it is a great deal more wicked than
any one every thought it. It is so wicked, that the heart of
man cannot conceive its wickedness. There is so much misery
in it, that no one would dare to write it down; there is so
much wrong wanting to be set right, that no one dares stir a
finger for fear of disturbing everything. In this country we
sit and wait, hoping that no one will trouble us; and one
day we shall see some noisy demagogue go up and down the
face of the country, raising such a storm as England has
never seen, for his own selfish and miserable ends."
“Don't frighten me, Mr. Owen,” said Adie, really fright-
ened at the passion which the schoolmaster threw into his
words. “ Tell me, is there nothing at all for me to do ?”
“Some young ladies take to art, like your dear sister, but
they are few; some try writing, but not one in a thousand
makes anything at that; some go on the stage, but there are
not many young ladies on the stage—more's the pity for the
theatre :

Worst line of anything else in the world. The history of
woman's work, Miss Adie, is what I have told you in my
axioms. Women don't want any work to do; they have not
been trained to it; they are not accustomed to unite for
purposes of self-protection; they are the victims of every
dirty-souled draper and man-milliner who is content to get
rich on the profits made by starving his work girls. Pro-
position One, first class, first boy-boy-I beg your pardon-
Miss Adie Revel, what is Proposition One ?”.
“Every employer of women, including the Government,
ought to be hanged immediately."
“Prove that proposition, first-young lady of the first
class.”
“Women are cheated out of their proper pay; skilled
women do not receive wages at the same rate as skilled men,
and they have to work too many hours. Men who oppress
them ought to be punished. The best punishment is caning—"
“ First boy, take care.'

“I mean, hanging. You wouldn't cane me, Mr. Owen,
would you ?”
"Finish the proposition first."
"Well, it is finished, isn't it. So that they all ought to
be hanged.”
Quod erat demonstrandum.”
Say that in English, Mr. Owen.”
“ Quod, which—the pronoun; erat, was-verb, imperfect;
sum, fui, esse—demonstrandum, gerund in di-do-dum, to be
demonstrated. First boy, go up a place. Now the Second
Proposition.
"No woman ought to be allowed to work for money.' But
I cannot prove that. It seems to me that women ought to
be allowed to work for as much as they can get."
“I want to see women working at things which do not
bring in money,” he explained. “And why? Because there
are plenty of men in the world to do the useful things. When
these come to be too few, we shall invent more machines. If
women were prohibited from getting their own living, the
men would have to do all the nasty jobs that they have put
.on the women-boot-work and the like. Boys could do the
things which require lightness of touch, and do them quite
as well, too, as women.
“But you would not let the poor women starve, would you ?”
“No; the State should keep them, and keep them in com-
fort. Ah, it's a pons asinorum in my new Euclid that women
ought not to be allowed to work for money; but it's coming
round to it by degrees. We don't like to see our women culti-
vating the fields, as I am told they do in France. Soon we
shall come not to like to see them at hard work of any kind;
and then the man who is found guilty of ill-treating his girls
will have a bad time of it. Why, I heard the other day of a
woman employed in a white-lead factory, who had to walk
four miles to her work and four miles back, work ten hours,
and earn nine shillings a-week. Her employer was a gentle-
man, of course— they all are. My reform will sweep all such
gentlemen off the face of the earth. Now, first class, atten-
tion : Proposition Three.”
“ . It ought to be penal to make or take contracts. Come,
I know all the beginning, Mr. Owen.”
"Prove it, first boy."
“I can't, please, my master."
“First boy, you will have to go to the bottom of the class.

Listen. When a contract is made, the maker secures his
own profit first; when he has to make a lower offer, he sticks
to his own profit, and screws the loss out of his employés
if he can.
When coal went up fifty per cent. the miners
would have got nothing; only they showed a bold front, so
they got ten per cent. When coal went down, the men got
locked out till they agreed to a reduction of fifteen per cent.
Who wins by that? The masters, whichever way the wind
blows. The women cannot unite, because no one has taught
1:24m how; and so they suffer by every contract that is made,

can't
prevent it.”
“I don't quite understand, and I think I have had enough
of trading for one day. But, Mr. Owen, you have not
answered my question. Tell me what I can do to earn some
money.”
The old schoolmaster took the girl by both her hands, and
looked in her face. It was a face so pretty, and yet, somehow,
so helpless. In every feature it spoke of a want of support.
“My child, you have got, or your sister has got, a little
money. She has her art, she has health and strength; pray
God that you may have to do-nothing. And believe me, it
is the happiest condition for all women on this earth to do
nothing. Stay at home, my dear, and nourish high and
noble thoughts; keep up your courage, and trust in God.”
He led his pupil to the door with the gallantry of a Cas-
tilian, and dismissed her; but the talk had revived old
thoughts in his brain, and ideas that he had long since aban-
doned as impracticable and useless. He sat down and tried
to read Plutarch with his usual calm, but in vain. The
beloved pages of Langhorne had no charm for him. He put
the book down, and began to pace up and down the school-
room, working out one more of those golden dreams of an
impossible future which, while they last, make a man divine.
"I see,” he might have said, had his vision shaped itself into
words, “I see a time when men shall acknowledge that the
truest chance for the world is to cultivate and raise the women.
They shall form associations which shall enable girls to work,
if they must work, for their own profit. Rich people shall
help the girls to found their own co-operative workshops.
The minimum of pay for work done shall be regulated. They
shall have the boy and girl put on an equal footing at school;
the maid and the youth on an equal footing at starting in the
world; and the only superiority shall belong to the married

man who has his family to support. The family shall still be
everything; hut the woman's place in the social circle shall
be sacred. Somehow or other, rich women will understand
then that their own luxury, their vanities and indulgences,
have done more than acything in the world to retard the
progress of their sex; they will see that these are the chief
means by which the lower class of women is kept down, and
the sex is put to rebuke through the temptations of which
the pure and virtuous are the principal cause.
“It is a curious world,” he said, waking from this foolish
dream-“it is a curious and a wicked world. When our Lord
said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged,' and when He bade
the guiltless one to throw the first stone, He meant more
than the people understood. We can none of us separate our-
selves from the sins of the world. We all help to cause them.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Marion turned idly over the sketches her new patron had
left with her. There were some fifty or more water-colours,
executed with great power of drawing and considerable feeling
for colour. But they were nearly all alike. They represented
the Hermit in his youth-the likeness was quite unmis.

takable-in various scenes connected with the army. He wash
riding a race; he was presiding at a convivial gathering; he
was acting on a stage; he was dancing ; he was fighting;
but none of the portraits seemed so exactly characteristic as
the one wbich he had snatched from her hand, showing him-
self-his own actual face-wild with terror amid those dismal
surroundings of cold, misery, and death. Why should a man
paint himself deliberately as a coward ?
Men, however, as Marion might have known, do reveal
their own natures who get to giving secrets to paper. There
was a murderer, some time ago, who came home after perpe-
trating the deed, and wrote on a slip of paper, by way of
rough note for after-entry in a diary, a memorial of his own
crime: “Fine and hot; killed a little girl”—a circumstance
which, if I remember right, so far prejudiced the mob against
him, that they wished then and there to rend him into small
pieces. But Marion was no psychologist; she had never
learned to reason and to analyze, as lawyers say—which is,
being interpreted into English, to impute the worst motives,
and then to try and prove them. Therefore, she wondered.
Presently, turning over the drawings, she came to a head.
There was nothing very much, artistically speaking, to attract
her attention. The head was dressed in the fashion of hair
common twenty-five years ago—not a very pretty fashion.
It was not well painted—not nearly so well as the later
sketches. But Marion looked at it with an astonishment
which took away her breath.
For it was the head of her sister. The same graceful pose,
the same careless parting of the lips, the same contour, the
same eyes. Only the chin and the shape of the head were a
little different. How could the Hermil have got Adie's face
to draw ?
And then she dropped the picture with a sinking heart.
It was not the portrait of Adie, but it was the portrait of-
Mrs. Spenser. Haggard, worn, and wasted as the woman
was now, she yet preserved a likeness to her youth; and here
it was.
Marion tied it up in paper, for fear her sister might
find it, and began to think.
The man, whoever he was, must have known Mrs. Spenscr.
But when ? and under what circumstances ?
“It cannot be,” she said—“he must have seen Adie on the
stairs or somewhere, and drawn her.”
And this, again, was impossible ; because A.die's head was
never dressed like the hair in this picture.

She took it out and looked at it again.
Then she put it back, with a prayer that, if the man had
known Mrs. Spenser, he might never be moved to speak of
her. And she resolved to have as few dealings with him as
possible.
But the accident, which might mean nothing, made her as
uneasy as Robinson Crusoe when he spied the single unac-
companied bare footprint on the sands-surely the finest in-
cident that ever occurred to any novelist.
She began her copying work, Adie being, as we have seen,
in conservation with Mr. Owen.
Presently Dr. Chacomb came back to her, beaming.
“I have shown your picture to my patient,” he said, “and
I think I may congratulate you. He likes it. I will not tell
you all the flattering things he said of you or of it; nor the
faults he found in it. But you may be certain that it will
be taken, and nearly certain that it will be sold. Are you
satisfied ?"
“More than satisfied,” said Marion.
“I have bought you some flowers in Covent-garden on my
way-quite the simplest wild flowers. Here is a rosebud. It
must be a Devonshire nosegay. When shall we get back the
roses to your cheek, Marion ?
Sometimes be called her by her Christian name, and there
was a lowering in the man's voice, as if he was stepping down
from some imaginary platform of pretension. To the world
he was loud-voiced, self-reliant, and ready to advance to the
front.
" The flowers are beautiful”—Marion evaded the question
of her own cheeks—“and we are very much obliged to you,
Dr. Chacomb, for that and everything else.”
“May I sit down and talk for five minutes, before I visit
my gouty patients ? They are all swearing in chorus at every
moment's delay."
“Then go at once, Dr. Chacomb, and relieve the poor
people.”
“In five minutes. Let me have a little five minutes. The
atmosphere of this room is a rest to me. One is out of the
world here, looking at you quietly painting.”
Marion began to feel afraid, and looked it.
“I am not going to make love to you,” said Joseph.
Chacomb. “I like to be with you. So long as you know
that I love you, that is enough. Do you think a woman ever
understands her own power over a man ?”

“I never thought about it.”
“You make me young again. All the old feelings that I
had forgotten come back to me. That is it, Marion. You
freshen up my withered old heart as—what is it the Psalmist
says ?—the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty wilderness.
You are the shadow, and my life is the thirsty wilderness.
But with you all the old thoughts come back, just as if I were
a boy again, singing in the choir of the parish church, only
with a little more vigour.".
“But how can I do all that ?"
“I do not know. It is so. Those worst parts of life, which
the moralist is always lamenting, one, after all, Marion, very
easily forgets. I have been worse than most men, I
suppose,
because I kept it up till forty-five, and the average run of men
knock off at thirty. I had a rackety time for five and twenty
years. London, Paris, and Vienna taught me pretty well all
there was to learn; and I think I started in practice with as
extended a knowledge of human nature as most young phy-
sicians.”
“If you are sorry for what is past, is it not better to think
no more of it ?”
“But I'm not sorry, you see. I enjoyed the whole run.
Hang it, I enjoy everything! I like my present life; I like
pocketing fees, and going about in a carriage to see rich
patients. But I sometimes think I liked the old life better,
when I made a precarious living, and chiefly by borrowing
from Chauncey Chacomb. It's a very pleasant thing to sit
among a lot of good fellows, and talk all night. There's an
excitement about letting the morrow take care of itself. It is
delightful to be out of society, and to please yourself what
you do and how you live. There is a freedom, too, about the
city of Prague which you cannot get anywhere else.”
• What is the city of Prague ?”
“It is the capital of Bohemia."
“ Then you are not sorry, after all, for wasting so many
“Yes, I am. I am confoundedly sorry. Only I liked the
time. If it was not for that, I should not be afraid of meeting
old friends, who might remind one of disagreeable things.
And I dare say I might be able to repent now, which I can-
not, just when I can afford it for the first time in my
life.”
It was not quite the repentance that Marion might have
wished, but she let that pass.

“ Then there is the third kind of life,” he said, “and that
is what I want to lead with you.”
“The five minutes are exceeded, Dr. Chacomb," said
Marion. “Good-bye."
“I had a letter from Mrs. Chauncey Chacomb the second
to-day. She tells me your brother has written for money,
and she has answered the letter. I hope it was not a rude
and vulgar answer.”
“ Fred ought not to have written. There is the answer."
“I shall see her on Saturday. You shall ņever have such
a letter as this again. Chauncey wants to do what he can
for your brother, and smuggled a letter to me. What can
he do ?”
“Nothing," said Marion, shortly. “We want no help from
She knew that Chauncey Chacomb was a prey to hallu-
cination ; but she could not bear that they should turn to
him for help in any, even the direst, necessity. It was enough
for her to know that Chauncey bore her father an insane and
meaningless hatred.

the stairs he found himself face to face with a gentleman who

“Hallo! Joe Dr. Chacomb. Who the deuce would have

“I beg your pardon, Mr.-Mr.—”
“ As if you didn't know me—Dicky Carew. And what a

that you've come out strong in the pill and powder line, and

“I have business of importance, Mr. Carew, and must wish

possible to get by without using violence; and Dicky looked
so genial, so glad to see him, that Joseph Chacomb' became
Joe again.
“ Come, Dicky,” he said, “I am not best pleased to meet
you, because I am out of the old set now, and cannot be as I
was before. You understand that, perfectly ?”
“ Lord bless you !-yes. I understood it in a minute. Can
you, in those togs, be a pal of mine, while I am in these?
Not to be thought of, Joe—I mean Dr. Chacomb. And so
you've got on in the world—that's quite clear. Pride, now-
adays, instead of going before a fall, comes after a rise. When
I rise, Dr. Chacomb, we will be haughty together.”
“I am doing very
well. And
you?
“Life with me," said Dicky, “is stationary. The stream
of Time flow's on without stopping, but brings no change to
me. Perhaps, some day, the world will be sorry to think—"
“What are you doing now? Are you on any good paper ?”
“On two admirable papers, if they only paid better; and
in a Hermit's good graces, if only he valued my services
higher. Doing pretty well, Dr. Chacomb; rising steadily, I
think.”
“Let me look at you,” said the doctor. “ Ah, I see.
The
old story, Dicky. I see it in your eyes and in
your
cheeks
it's telling on your nerves.
Knock it off. Good morning."
“Yes, Joe,” said Dicky, trying to intercept him," I will
consider your advice, which I am sure is based upon the
soundest-
“Good morning, Mr. Carew,” said the doctor, pushing
past.
“ One moment, Dr. Chacomb-one word only. At this
juncture, owing to my aunt in Cumberland not having re-
mitted me my rents, my editor being away on a holiday, and
my publishers being, like myself, in temporary embarrassment,
I should be very much obliged if you would lend me half a
sovereign. The money shall be repaid on Saturday morning,
at half past ten punctually, and at any spot that shall be most
convenient to you to meet me.”
The doctor produced the coin, and handed it to Dicky,
who, directly he touched it, sprang up the steps rapidly.
Seeing Miss Revel's door open, he looked in.
“Good morning, Miss Revel,” he whispered, with a face
like the morning sun for redness and for smiles.

“Is that you, Mr. Carew? Are you going upstairs ?”.
“Yes. Are you quite well, Miss Revel: Ah! And Miss
Adie quite well, too? Ah !"
Then he went a few steps higher up.
He stopped, for a thought struck him.
He turned round, and began to slowly descend the stairs.
Then he sped swiftly, so as to give reflection no chance, for
the nearest public-house.

designed for a man of five and twenty. He had reduced his
white hair to a more practicable length, trimmed his white
moustache after the fashion of the modern youth, wore a pair
of pearl-grey trousers, and a flower in his button-hole. In
fact, he had postponed the morning interview with the secretary
in order to call upon his fellow-lodgers. Dicky, besides this
elderly dandy, looked almost supernaturally shabby. The
Recluse was standing before the glass, still adjusting and
trimming, with the air of a petit crévé. Somehow, too—was
it the effect of a little rouge ?—his cheeks, contrary to their
wont, seemed to have upon them a faint_tinge of colour, a
delicate bloom, very pretty to look at. By craft and mys-
terious art, known only to himself, this lonely dweller in a
cave had made himself look some twenty years younger. He
might now have passed for a man of thirty-five to forty, pre-,
maturely grey.
“I am here, sir," said Dicky, taking up his pen and ad
justing his pad

It was then that he looked up and observed the remarkable
change in his employer's costume.
Mr. Lilliecrip grunted, and tied his neck ribbon again,
catching the full effect of the light upon the downward stroke
of the right hand end.
“Hold your tongue,” he added, tearing off the tie in a
rage, and taking another from a box. “ You have interrupted
me in an inspiration which may never come again. How
dare you speak unless you are spoken to ?”
The inspiration referred to his tie: his secretary understood
him to allude to something about George the Fourth, the Prince
Consort, Washington, or Tippoo Sahib--all of whom seemed
somehow mixed up together in those extraordinary memoirs.
Dicky waited submissively, only letting his imagination
loose on that little drama of revenge of which I have already
spoken. This old buck—this elderly Hermit, dressing himself
in the glass to gratify a perfectly meaningless vanity-how if
he had him at his mercy !
“Had it been myself,” thought the secretary,“ dressing to
partake of the buxom, the ripe, the juicy Medlar hospitality,
or to escort Ready Vyvyan-I know she loves me, poor little
Popsy-to the theatre; or going to meet Winifred Owen on
her way from the telegraph, like Fred Revel; or to take Miss
Marion Revel—the angel-out for a walk, if she'd let me,
which she never would, it would be a different thing. There
might be some sense in my wearing pearl-grey trousers, a
lemon-coloured waistcoat, diamond studs, and a flower in my
button-hole. But for an elderly Hermit, for a miserable
Solitary-pah! it's disgusting; it makes one sick. I should
like to spoil his beauty for a week.”
“Tell me, sir," said Mr. Lilliecrip, turning to him with an
imperative air-“ tell me if this necktie sits properly. What
do you think of the angle? Does it not rather spoil the
perfect regularity of outline of the features ? Give me your
opinion, if you are capable of having one on so important is
matter as dress.”
"I am not a valet," said Dicky, sulkily.
“I forgot-no. You are one of those failures of civilizam

“Were you his valet?” Dicky asked, with a fierceness
which surprised Mr. Lilliecrip, who made no answer, bu

- Now, sir,” said Mr. Lilliecrip, in his coldest voice—"now,
sir, you are late again. I have warned you already, mind.”
The beer was up in Dicky's brain by this time, and he felt,
with a glow of self-respect, that Mr. Lilliecrip had really better
not go too far. When the humblest worm has had two
glasses of beer in the morning, over and above its usual
quantity, that worm will turn and present a warlike front.
ûnder ordinary circumstances, it is a mistake to suppose
that a perfectly sober worm will ever turn. In this case,
Dicky was emboldened by the success of his remark.
“I am ready," he repeated, doggedly. “Go on; go on,

“ Where did I leave off yesterday ?”

Mr. Lilliecrip looked daggers, but answered nothing.
Dicky noticed, however, that his hand trembled, and nerved
himself for war.
The Recluse took a paper, and read it over.
“You have spelt developed, Mr. Carew, with two p's. That
is the French way. I thought you were totally ignorant of

If he had accused him of shabbiness, of intemperate habits,
of extravagance, of unpunctuality, of any ordinary small sins,
he would have borne it patiently. But to be accused of an
illiterate education, it was too much. The lightning played
round Dicky's eyes, and for a moment he was like Achilles
resenting the insults of Agamemnon. Aided, perhaps, like
that illustrious hero, by the goddess, he repressed his wrath,
and answered with a mildness like the thyrsus of Bacchus,
because it concealed a sharp point-

the Second to meet Sir William Walworth at a State dinner
in the Tower ?"
Nothing could justify this speech, not even that second
visit to the house of call. Still Dicky felt, though the glove
was in a manner thrown down, that such an extemporaneous
plunge into English history reflected the greatest credit upon
him. He wagged his head as if more might come, and took
up
his
pen again.
“I am ready, sir,” he repeated, in his mildest manner.
Pray go on.”
Uneducated ! imperfections of an early education ! He,
who had been captain of Biddlecombe Grammar School, and
afterwards assistant master at a commercial academy at
Exeter, until an unpleasantness connected with the master's
daughter, needless to relate, had driven him forth, and sent
him to seek his fortune in London! Imperfections of an
early education! Dicky's feelings were cruelly outraged;
but he repressed himself, and repeated, calmly-
“I am ready, sir.”
Mr. Lilliecrip, who had seated himself opposite his secretary,
looked at him curiously and nervously. The offensive remarks
addressed to him in reference to early kings of English history
appeared, however, to produce no effect, after the first shock,
upon
his calm and cold air. On the contrary, they made
him look colder of aspect. He waited a little, and then went
on, as if nothing had happened
“At one of the Chiswick parties, it matters little in what
year, I had the pleasure of meeting Talleyrand.' Have you

the secretary.

“ Remember!" echoed Dicky. “Ho! ho! ho!”
Not a loud laugh, but an offensively quiet one, as if the
producer was enjoying a joke all to himself.
Mr. Lilliecrip took no kind of notice.

“ • Among other things that I remember was a reply he
made to a young nobleman of ducal rank, who wished to
silence the talk of certain lacqueys. “Young mar.,' he said,
let us listen to
your
betters.'
“Capital,” said Dicky. “Have you forgotten the rest of
the story?"
“ Sir ?"
The voice was as cold as steel; but Dicky was protected with
the armour which goes with Dutch courage, and felt it not.
“ I always want to write down the end of your stories,” he
said. “ Did the noble entertainer at Chiswick kick out
Cardinal Wolsey-I mean Talleyrand? or did the noble scion
of a ducal house kick him out? And what view did Henry
the Eighth take of it ? Were you beheaded on Tower-hill for
laughing at the Cardinal's impudence ?"
“When you have finished your morning's work, sir, we shall
exchange a few words."
“I am ready, sir,” said Dicky, again with the look of
humility. Only he spoiled his submission by a chuckle, and
a soft "Ho! ho! ho! Henry the Eighth !"
"" It is not generally known that the way to eat asparagus'-
there is only one r and no h in that word, Mr. Carew—was
for a long time the subject of much social discussion. I once
dined with Queen Adelaide, after she became a widow, in
private. There was no other guest, and she was good enough
to give me her views on this important point. “I tell you,' she
said, “because I am glad to interchange thoughts with a man
like yourself, who has made all the minutiæ of social life the
subject of his profound study.'
"Did she say all that ?” asked Dicky. “Oh, oh !"
Mr. Lilliecrip pursued his story.
“For my own part,' said the dowager queen, “ I always eat
it with my fingers. She did so in effect, and I imitated her
example.'
Dicky saw no opening for any caustic remark after this
brilliant anecdote, and Mr. Lilliecrip dictated-still in his
cold, impressive manner—two or three more anecdotes, which
were also too vapid to present the slightest opening for any
comment, involving nothing more than an innuendo against
the virtue of a noble lady deceased, and another greatly dis-
honouring a celebrated statesman, also deceased. Then he
took a bundle of papers, and tossed them across the table to
Dicky, ordering him to read them aloud for his correction.

Dicky proceeded to obey mechanically. Presently he ob-
served that his patron was staring straight before him, obvi.
ously not attending. His imagination was in that fine stato
of activity which is peculiar to a condition of chronic nightly
intoxication, gently stimulated by a “hair of the dog that bit
you” in the morning. And he gave it full play, reading in
a sonorous and even melodious tone, while the unconscious
Mr. Lilliecrip sat with his thoughts wandering.
I regret to say that he made nonsense of the invaluable
Memoirs; more than that, as he saw that he was not observed,
he introduced irrelevant and even improbable matter, with
anachronisms of the wildest kind, and anecdotes of his own
invention. Never hal Dicky been so carried away by the
force of his own imagination. Like a pent-up stream, the
waters of fancy gushed and bubbled out, and, like the winter
torrents in a thirsty land, they brought ruin and destruction
with them, instead of fertility and smiling vegetation. Im-
punity emboldened him. Now and then he looked up; but
seeing Mr. Lilliecrip motionless, he proceeded with his fatal
comedy. After reading in this irreverent and burlesque
inanner for a quarter of an hour or so, he might, had he been
looking off the paper at the moment, have remarked a sudden
change in the Hermit's eyes-only for a moment. His lips
twitched, his colour came and went, and then he sat as before
his cold, calm eyes still gazing into space, as if he was
thinking of something far away.
“ The first time I ever saw Peter the Hermit"-Dicky was
reading with a full richness of tone which showed his own
enjoyment of the situation—"the first time I ever saw Peter
the Hermit was on the occasion when the then Dean of West-
minster, against the opinion of the leading clergy, introduced
him to the Abbey to preach a charity sermon for the Crusade.
They collected eighteen marks and a groat, a large sum for
those days. The whole was handed to Peter,
it in
his pocket with a genial wink. After the collection, we dined
together—a quiet dinner at the Ship, for Peter was fond of
whitebait. King Richard was there, Sir Robert Peel, Mr.
Gladstone, Bismarck, Saladin, the Dean, and Bolingbroke.
Nobody else but myself. The conversation turned after
dinner upon gallantry. I was astonished at the freedom with
which the English statesmen expressed their opinions, espe
cially Mr. Gladstone. Peter told some capital stories. I only
remember one, and that, I am sorry to say, I am unable to

repeat. The taste of the age, as is well known, was then
different to our own. Peter was no exception, and Sir Robert
enjoyed a free anecdote. As for Saladin, he broke his chair
with laughing. The secret history of the Crusades has yet to
be written. If I have time, I shall write it.
“ It is not generally known that the Wandering Jew' was
staying in Lowland-street, Tottenham-court-road, about ten
years ago. He had lodgings on the second floor, where he
used to cook his own meals. His name was never uttered to
anybody except myself, and I have promised not to reveal it
unless he gives permission. He was a cheery bird, fond of
singing the Steam Leg,' which was his only song; but he
was a grumbler, and often complained of fatigue. The
knowledge of drinks which he had gathered during his long
peregrinations was extraordinary, and many is the artful
compound he has brewed for me. I have the receipts, and
mean to write them out at the end of my Memoirs. He
always declared dry champagne to be the best and most
wholesome of liquors. After that he placed Allsopp—when
you have it genuine. He did not like quassia in his malt.
I never could get him to tell me whence he drew his supplies ;
but he seemed to have letters of credit on all the banks in the
world. He was a man of innumerable bonnes fortunes. He
loved kidneys for breakfast. He once said to me, after a
night of it, 'Lord a man of your transcendent abilities
ought to do something for the world, if it is only to double
the salary of your secretary, and to offer him an occasional
glass of alen
Enough of this buffoonery, sir," said Mr. Lilliecrip, rising,
with great solemnity. “This is Monday. We will consider
our engagement at an end from this moment. I owe you, I
believe, at the rate of three shillings a visit, the sum of six
shillings. There is the amount. Leave the room !"
For the moment Dicky, who was still in the full flow of
recollections, hardly comprehended the blow. He dropped
the papers, and gazed stupidly in Mr. Lilliecrip's face.
“ You hear me, sir. Leave the room! Not a word of
explanation or apology. Go; and let me see your face
more.
Dicky made haste to seize the six shillings—that was, at
least, something tangible. Then he pulled himself together.
As it was quite clear that he was dismissed, and he saw very
plainly that he had done for himself entirely, he concluded

pot to go without relieving his mind in some degree of nis
real feelings.
“What, because I enlivened the monotony of your rubbish
by substituting some better stories of my own? Come forth,
Hermit of the Dale-don't be unreasonable !"
Mr. Lilliecrip turned paler, if that were possible.
“I have known,” says Dicky, assuming an air of dignity
quite beyond his income," for a long time that the pretended
Memoirs were nothing but falsehoods, which you intended to
palm off upon the world as real Memoirs and recollections.
Why, man, there is not a page in the whole collection but will
confute you as soon as it is printed, if it appears in the next ten
years. And if it is kept dark for fifty, the dense stupidity of
the thing will damn it infallibly. Besides which, my own
self-respect was at stake in being a party to this impudent
forgery."
“Give me back those papers, sir, and leave the room.”
Mr. Lilliecrip trembled visibly as he spoke. Perhaps a
hermitage of fourteen years' duration does not strengthen the
nerves.
"No," said the rebellious secretary, folding them up"I
shall keep these; I mean to show them about. I shall tell
the whole world what a humbug lives in Lowland-street. By
Jove, there are the names of living statesmen among them.
I will go to them, and let them know what is prepariug.
Your name and your pursuits shall be published, sir. You
shall be made notorious. We shall find out who it is has been
living here by himself for fourteen years. And you shall
know what it is to call Richard Carew an illiterate copying

Ho paused, for Mr. Lilliecrip was of a ghastly pallor. Then
Dicky hardened his heart, and went on-

“Now I have you in my power," he said, melodramatically.

It was quite the realization of his dream, and a thing
altogether to be enjoyed,

He placed the roll in his pocket, put on his hat, and took
up the clouded cane of which he was so fond.
“You will see me again, Simon Stylites," he observed, at
the door. “I resign your employment. I shall look in upon
you in a day or two, and report progress. I am going to be
your bugbear. For the present, good morning."
He left the room with a loftiness of bearing which pleased
himself immensely. His soul was in a tumult of pleasure at
the recollection of the many fine things he had said ; nor was
it till some hours afterwards, when the flurry of his spirits
had in a measure subsided, that he began to realize the im.
portance of the salary he had lost.
It was to Mrs. Medlar that he communicated, first of all,
the news of his revolt, and the eloquence with which he had
.conducted the business of the final scene.
“ But
you have lost your salary, and how will you live ?".
This was a new light, in which he had not thought of
regarding the situation.

left either. However in the world could you go to be si
foolish? The usual thing, I suppose a drop of something.
Now, mind, Mr. Carew, you don't marry me unless you take
the pledge."
She offered him no refreshment; she gave him no applause.
It was as if Amadis de Gaul, after his proudest achievement,
when he conquered the giants of Armenia and carried them
away captive to the enchanted Princess of the Island of
Morocco, had been received by the chosen of his heart with
u scoff and a question instead of an accolade or a chaste salute.
Dicky felt the reception deeply.
“For thy sake," he might have said—“for thy sake, Lady
Medlar, have I recovered the self-respect of an honest man.
What if the spirit which prompted the deed was fortified and
encouraged by a draught of Burton-old and mild ?”
Alas! many a notable guest has been lost to the world
through the want of appreciation of those who first hear it.
And there are some women, love they never so madly, who
cannot convert their husbands into heroes.
CHAPTER XXX.
It must be owned that Dicky, face to face with the im-
mediate loss to his income caused by his freedom of speech, felt
next morning a little out of spirits. He did not follow Mrs.
Medlar's advice, and humiliate himself before his enemy, having
an instinctive assurance that it would serve no useful
purpose.
On the contrary, he carried his plunder, the roll of manu-
fiript Memoirs, to the British Museum, to read them, with a
view of doing what mischief he could to the man who had
dared to call him illiterate.
Away from the personal influence of the Hermit, whose cold
and measured manner never failed at the time to impress the
amanuensis with a profound sense of truthfulness, Dicky
found it horrible to realize the prodigiousness of the vast
collection of lies. They were gross, palpable, and foolish lies.
They were slanderous. They betrayed themselves. They were
full of anachronisms; dead and living men were mixed; and
they had not, as some of these anecdotes of social life have,
the spice of ill-nature and epigram wanted to make them
attractive. The Hermit was a poor storyteller. The stories
he told were like those of the very bad French novelists who

lived under the Consulate and First Empire—their works are
nearly all out of print, but you may get hold of them now
and then if you search-who have no other recommendation
than a gush of language without parallel in literature, and
comparable only to the mouth of a main drain. The Hermit
was not only a weak and foolish man-weak on the side of
personal vanity, foolish in shutting himself up because he
had a spite against the world—but he was a man full of
morbid desires and tastes. He courted notoriety. Men have
been known, for the sake of notoriety, to abandon wife and
children, pass as martyrs, and take up the most unhealthy
forms of extreme opinions in a party cry. No one, so far as
I know-except Mr. Greville and my Hermit-ever delibe-
rately contemplated the purchase of immortality by the
production of clap-trap and sensation memoirs.
Dicky read and made notes, thinking best how to turn his
plunder to his own gain and the discomfiture of his enemy.
Mr. Lilliecrip called him illiterate! Ah! And copying clerk.
Good. Pretended that he had no acquaintanee with French
did he? And hut a partial acquaintance with English.
Very rich-very correct indeed. Dicky would be revenged;
but he did not yet quite see his way. Presently the clock
struck one, and he was reminded of the dinner hour.
There are many shady retreats in the neighbourhood of the
British Museum where the weary student may find refresh.
ment—there used to be one, indeed, in the institution itself;
but the authorities, who in the cause of knowledge are
inexorable, discovered that the country people preferred
Banbury cakes to Babylon bulls, veal and ham pies to
mummies and marbles, and so at length removed it.
Among the neighbouring hostelries, the one chosen by Dicky
and his immediate circle of friends owned a sanded floor, a
large fireplace, and half a dozen wooden cribs, with settles,
like those of the Chesire Cheese and the Cock-a device by
which the proprietors persuaded the unthinking that their
steaks and chops had a hidden virtue unknown to places
where the floor is carpeted and the seats are cushioned.
He was still suffering from the excitement natural after a
battle in which barren honour was the only result on which
he could pride himself. He dined alone, although there were
friends in the other boxes. After his chop, he ordered a glass
of the beverage which best he loved, whisky and water hot,
and lighting a pipe—you may smoke in this establishment

began to think how to recover his losses. Fifteen shillings a
week. It was a good deal to lose. It was half his income.
While he smoked, stirred his grog, and meditated, he was
disturbed-agreeably at first-by the entrance of a man he
knew.
He was a very big man, with whiskers which grew all round
his face and stuck out under his chin, leaving that feature
free and clean. This gave him a truculent expression. He
looked all round the room, and spotting his man, who was
no other than Dicky, strode noisily across the floor, and bang-
ing his fist on the table, uttered these remarkable words, in
the deepest bass ever heard-
“You precious scoundrel!”
The other gentlemen in Dicky's walk of life who were dining
at the time naturally took a lively pleasure in the prospect of
a row; there was a general silence, and craning of heads
round the divisions.
“You precious scoundrel !" the stranger repeated. Then,
observing the presence of others, he addressed the company
generally.
“ Gentlemen, I put it to you. You shall judge what a villain
this fellow is. I have engaged him for the last two years on
a paper-a property of my own, gentlemen. You, as literary
men,
will appreciate the care and trouble I have had to nurse
this property. My own child, gentlemen. I invented the
title; I found the capital to start it; I bore the loss for six
months—though I could ill afford it. This double-dyed
blackguard-
“Draw it mild-I say," expostulated one of the hearers
"It isn't parliamentary:
“No, sir, I repeat, this double-dyed blackguard, to whom
I have paid-ah! paid Enormous sums of money-"
"Well,” said Dicky, driven to desperation, it was seven
and six a week. What is it I've done ? Tell me quickly,
can't you ? Play up your pretty pipe, shepherd.”
The big man gnashed his teeth at this allusion to his voice.
“This snake in the grass, gentlemen-but I must tell you
that mine is a Christian paper, and a Church paper. It is no
other than the Christian Clerk and Vestrymen's Bosom Friend."
It is difficult to explain why the countenances of the assem-
oly relaxed, and their faces broadened with smiles. But so it
was.
“ The Christian Clerk-my property, my title. You will

bardly believe, gentlemen, that after being in my employ on
that paper for two years after receiving, as I said, Enormous
sums of money-he sends me last week a collection of in-
famous paragraphs, bringing the clergy into ridicule, attack-
ing the aristocracy, and breathing nothing short of open
infidelity! Would you believe that, gentlemen ? And I
trusted him, gentlemen, and printed it all, without even
reading his proofs.”
There was a universal shout.
Dicky, in a cold perspiration, saw at once-with a fearful
foreboding of what would happen next-what had happened.
He said nothing, but looked mutely round the well-known
faces for sympathy.
He received none. They were all laughing, except the
unlucky proprietor of the paper, who raged in their midst.
There was one other exception. In the box next to Dicky's,
but nearer the door, there sat a bearded gentleman, perhaps
the greatest Bohemian of them all, who, instead of laughing
with the rest, fixed his eyes on the injured editor, and gravely
wagged his head, expressing by this movement his profound
sympathy with the Christian Clerk.
Then Dicky laughed himself, and the merriment was
general. But a worse thing happened. Another man, whose
face was only too well kuown to Mr. Carew, opened the door,
and looked up and down the room. Seeing the person he
was in search of, he darted with a tigerish bound and some-
thing like a yell towards Dicky's table.
“Now, sir,” he cried, in a profound voice, and banging his
fist on the table with a crash that rattled the crockery all
over the room now, sir, what have you got to say to me?"
“Nothing," said Dicky—"only take care of the plates, and
don't destroy the property. They charge a great deal here
for a broken glass."
There was instantly a dead silence.
The man was a very little man indeed, with an immense
head and bearded face, a very ferocious type of man-one
who would have called himself Lucius Junius Brutus in the i
first years of the Revolution, and paraded the streets ba ng
“Death to Tyrants !"
Dicky knew him, too; but he was now reckless.
“Destroy the property ?" echoed the new-comer. “ De-
stroyer of property yourself. Tell me again, what havo you
to say? I will expose you among your friends. Listen, gentle.

There was a grin of universal expectation on every face,
except that of the hairy gentleman above named, who caught
the little man's eye, and shook his head with a sympathizing
gravity.
“The Weekly Intelligence. No doubt many of you here
are subscribers." There was another grin at this hypothesis,
which showed too amiable a confidence in the purchasing
and reading powers of his audienco. « This man here wrote
for me.”
“Are you," asked the proprietor of the Christian Clerk-
are you the editor of that infamous journal ? And do you,
sir”—he turned to Dicky—“ do you dare to say you wrote
for the Christian Clerk at the same time that you wrote for
the Weekly Intelligence? Hypocrite!”
Dicky wagged his head, but answered not.
“ Infamous journal, sir! What do you mean?” cried the
little man.
“I'll make you know, sir; I'll teach you, sir."
As he advanced, the big man retreated, being, indeed, an
egregious coward. But before he left the room he shook his
fist at Dicky.
“You are discharged, sir. You are discharged. Ask for
what I owe you, if you dare."
As he left the room, the sympathetic man of letters rose
and left too. In five minutes he returned, and turned his
grave and thoughtful face upon the other editor.
He was still haranguing the room. He told how he had
trusted in the Radical principles of the man before him ;
how he believed him superior to the trammels of superstition;
how he denounced kings, priests, and nobles, with a cheerful
vigour which raised the circulation of the paper-
“Then you ought to have raised my pay,” said Dicky.
How his own confidence grew to such an extent that he
even allowed the proofs to pass unread; and how-gentle-
men—how on this Sunday morning his attention had been
called by a friend to an article in which the bishops and
clergy of the Church of England were held up to general
admiration as possessing all the virtues.
There was no sympathy with this editor any more than
with the first. He looked upon the grinning faces around
with a disgust too great for words. The bearded and long-

297
haired man near the door preserved a calm and even sad
demeanour when the editor's glance fell upon him, only
raising his hands in deprecation of Dicky's iniquity.
“Now, Mr. Carew," he wound up, “you shall not say I
tried to cheat you; there's your money in full”—he threw
three half-crowns upon the table—"and take your discharge."
He put on his hat with tremendous vigour, and, hurling
. defiant glances right and left, walked swiftly out.
The man who had not laughed went out after him.
Dicky, in the midst of acclamations, rose solemnly,
“It's all true, gentlemen,” he said. “I wrote for both
those papers, and I must have mixed the articles. Anybody
who knows of a vacancy may recommend me.”
“If I hear of any, Dicky, that I can't fill myself, you
shall have the office,” said one of them.
The second clause of the proviso exactly suited the sen-
timents of the rest, who all repeated it, with slightly verbal
alterations. Then the man with the long hair and the
ragged beard came back, with transfigured and radiant
countenance.
He had secured both jobs.
That man, the only one who saw the opportunity and seized
it, is now in comparative affluence. He is the principal
literary prop of the Christian Clerk-whose circulation has
trebled during the late Christian revival-and he has led the
Weekly Intelligence to dazzling heights of revolutionary
audacity, in which even the editor himself sometimes feels
dizzy. Of course his pay is trebled too.
The moral is obvious.
It was with a heavy heart that Dicky turned into the
street when the afternoon séance finished. No occasion for
him to go back to the Museum for the present. The pam-
phlets and the magazines might rest undisturbed. His
occupation was gone, and with it his salary.
Presently he reflected on the cause of the sudden downfall
of his worldly prospects; and he remembered that a third
glass of gin and water was the cause of the fatal exchange
of "copy" for the papers, while an unwonted early visit to
the house of convivial hospitality caused the outbreak with
the Hermit.
Then he met Miss Ethelreda Vyvyan in Holborn, on her
way home from rehearsal. She skipped up, in her artless
and cheerful manner, and slapped him on the shoulder.

“Dicky, my boy, the grandmother is ill-—-poor old girl!
and
you
must pay up.'
“ Pay up, Popsy ?”
“Don't call me Popsy, because it's cheek, and I won't
allow it. I am Ethelreda Vyvyan, of the Royal Hemisphere
Theatre, if you please. But you must pay up, old boy, whether
you call me Popsy or Ready; and it's close upon five pounds.
I'll toss you whether we make it five-ten or a fiver clear
come.”
“ I'm going into the City instantly,” said Mr. Carew, “ to
see my lawyer. He is engaged in selling out some stock
for me.”
“Ah! and going down to Westmorland afterwards to see
your dear old aunt, who sends you such regular supplies, are
you not? Now, Dicky, pay up, and no more humbug between
friends. I wouldn't bother, old man, if I didn't want the
dibs—I wouldn't, really."
“I haven't got any money, Popsy. That's the real truth.”
“Then give me what you have."
“I've got nothing, Popsy, except a pound; and I must
pay
my rent, mustn't I? Your Dicky would have to find a lodging
in the cauld, cauld blast.' Oh! shelter me.”
“Dicky, it's pretty clear you've been going it a little too
free. Now, take my advice, and stop it. You can pay grand-
mother at so much a week, if you like; but no shirking.
Come and see me to-morrow morning, and tell me what you
are going to do.”
Poor Dicky! He was going to do nothing—there was
nothing to do.
Then he began to curse his ill fortune.
Then he advanced a step, and cursed his fatal habit of
drink.
Then he became suddenly and strongly repentant.
And then, giving the rein to these wholesome meditations,
he wandered up and down the street, revolving wholesomely
the evil effects of drink, till he came upon a place where à
card was posted in the window inviting all to enter and tako
the pledge.
Dicky thought of Mrs. Medlar's advice, obeyed the invitae
tion, and, without further consideration, put down tho penny,
and took the oath.
At half past nine that evening there was a knock at Mrs,
Medlar's door.

It was Dicky Carew. He was leaning for support against
the doorpost. His hat was at the back of his head. He
carried the clouded cane, but it was broken. His knees bent
beneath him. He bore the external appearance of one who
bad been drinking, not wisely, but too well.
Mrs. Medlar looked at him with rising wrath.
“What have you got in your hand ?" she asked.
“Itsh pledge," Dicky replied.
" I've come-tell you-

CHAPTER XXXI.
As for the head of the Revel house—the unlucky Fred-he
was spending his three days of grace in a condition of abso-
lute terror and remorse. He saw the hour approaching-he
counted the strokes—when the home, such as it was, of his.
sisters would be literally stripped; and he did not dare to
tell the secret. He sat and listened, pretending to take an
interest in their hopes and plans. He did not dare to tell
his wife-the wife whom he did not dare to own. As always
happens, he repented when it was too late. I do not know
whether his repentance was quite of the kind advocated by
the Christian preacher; but it was deep and real, because he
was extremely sorry. He knew that there was going to be a
mauvais quart d'heure, and he did not at all see his way
clear
to making things pleasant when the furniture was actually
carried off. He foresaw the winged words of Adie, the tears
of Marion; and he dreaded the explanation he should have to
offer to his wife.
For ten pounds and a box of cigars he had bought this
misery. It was the dearest purchase he had ever made.
Frederick Revel was not a young man who preferred evil to
good ; nor had he what is meant when we talk of the vices of
a young man, He did not, for instance, like Mr. Richard
Carew, fall about the stairs on his way to bed. But he loved
the semblance of an easy life, and he desired above all to
keep things smooth. Had he been a prophet in Israel in
those days when the kings liked to have pleasant oracles,
though Rabshakeh, with the Tartan of Esarbanipal, was
already knocking at the gate Gennath, Fred Ravel would have

sat before the king with smiling face and brow of uncloudcd
sweetness, prophesying the most delightful future. For the
sake of keeping things pleasant for himself, he was content
to take Marion's money day by day. In order to make life
more pleasant, he fell in love with Winifred. And not to
disturb the existing pleasantness, he had forborne to consult
his sister when he borrowed the money for which they were
all of them now going to pay.
A contemptible young man? Well, yes--if you please.
The curious thing about life is the way in which these con-
temptible young men sometimes manage to get liked. Every-
body liked Fred. The women liked him for his bonny
face, and that sweet smile of his which came so easily, meant
so little, and yet seemed to mean so much. Men liked him,
too—that is, men of a sympathetic turn-why, it would be
hard to say, but principally because he was always in a good
temper. Fred spoke ill of no man, because he harboured no
malice. He never clashed with any one, because he had no
ambition. He never refused to listen, and never grumbled
at his own lot. Think what it is to be a man who is nobody's
rival, who envies no man, who is in no one's way, and who is
always genial, friendly, and in a good humour. A most con-
temptible young man; but there are plenty of his kind, like
those pretty, fair-weather craft lying at anchor up Haslar
Creek. A young man whose ideas of pleasure would expand
with his available powers of spending and borrowing, but who
would never cease to desire enjoyment of some kind, were it
only that of the Neapolitan beggar—to lie in the shade, and
enjoy the softened reflection of the glaring sun from the
opposite wall. A young man to whom work of any kind is
so distasteful as to be impossible: a man without a backbone.
The day before the fatal morning, he made a little effort
to communicate the trouble that was impending.
It was after breakfast. Marion was engaged upon her
work. Adie was preparing to go marketing. Fred was
walking up and down the room restlessly.
“Marion," he said, “I want forty pounds."
She remembered a former request that she should invest
money in a sleeping partnership.
“ What is it for, Fred ?"
“Never mind what it is for. Will you let me have it?"
“How can I? I have not a quarter of the money.
** Pshaw! always the same story. Have you not fifteen

hundred pounds in the Stocks ? Can you not sell out a
paltry hundred for me when I ask you.
L?”
My poor Fred,” she replied, “ how often am I to tell you
that the income we get from that sum is our only stand-by,
and that nothing—no necessity, however pressing-shall make
me part with it?"
Even then-had he only told her! But he did not dare.
She put on her hat hastily, and went out of the room, on her
constant and never-ending errand of work and money. He
looked after her, and groaned. His last chance of raising
the money was gone.
In the language of certain writers, Fred was not quite bad,
because he was sorry to think of what was coming upon him.
All the rogues who somehow miss general abhorrence may
be defended by much the same plea. The French jury brought
in extenuating circumstances for the man who had murdered
his father and his mother, on the ground that he was an
orphan. We are told that M. Kakistos is not wholly a villain,
because he loves his mother, or because he sheds tears of
repentance before his flogging, or because he has given a
sovereign to convert the natives of Fiji, or because he assures
the chaplain that he is sorry for having murdered his grand-
father, tortured his grandmother, beaten his wife, and starved
his children. Where is the old-fashioned villain, all wicked-
ness, and as hardas nails? Nowhere. I declare that he is extinct
-gone out with cock-fighting, the P. R., the highway robber,
and Jonathan Wild. But plenty of things as bad as those he
used to do are perpetrated by smooth-handed young gentle-
men like Fred Revel.. What he had done was as bad. And
yet he was no vulgar rogue, and would have scorned any
action which might seem to him openly dishonest.
And what would Winifred say?
A man of so gelatinous a nature ought not to have fallen
in love at all. Of course, love is intended to imply intelligent
selection. It involves an average vigour of mind, a certain
amount of determination and pluck-none but the brave, we
know, deserve the fair. It means perseverance,
petit commis who marries on a hundred and twenty pounds

great many lesser things—notably, a proof of the unselfish
nature of the young man, in giving up everything, club-life,
independence, liberty, and the rest, for the sake of a woman
Yes. But Fred, unfortunately, flew in the face of the moral
philosophy of love by slipping into it because it was pleasant,
and by marrying secretly because that was more pleasant.
What is to be done with a man whose only notion of life
is to have and to enjoy? It is fitting that sorrow and vexa-
tion should fall upon him. It is well to read him stern
lessons which he must learn, whether he likes it or not, and
may lay to heart if he chooses; but what about those on whom
his actions bring trouble? There are three women now-at
first there were but two-who will mourn and lament if this
young man come to harm.
He was a worthless chap, said schoolmaster Owen-who
ought to know a worthless chap when he saw one, if ex-
perience is any use. It is not for me to defend him, or to ask
for any sympathy. From his childhood upwards, he had
grasped at pleasure as the only good. He was blinded by his
own passionate desire for enjoyment. He could not see beyond
the present, he could not suffer more than the present pain.
Why people liked him it is impossible to say, except that it
was because he was so sanguine and so light-hearted.
But here is a point of difficulty. He was, being a poor man,
quite useless, and morally inferior. Suppose he had been
rich, what a wealth of good qualities would have covered over
and hidden, so that they could never have been suspected,
these faults which bad fortune brought conspicuously to the
front. He could not work, it is true, having no power of
application ; nor could he refrain from present enjoyment if
it was in any way to be obtained; but these were defects
quite unlikely to be noted in the daily life and conversation
of a wealthy man. On the other hand, he was as handsome
as Apollo; he was physically brave; he was truthful; he was
honest and honourable in such general dealings as required
no money; he had proclivities in the direction of art; he was
of good taste, and as generous as Alcibiades. In fact, Fred
often reminded me of that gallant who, in his turn, seems to
have moulded his character on the well-known model of
Absalom. Probably tradition brought the story of Absalom
to Athens by way of Tyre and Cyprus.
Whence it follows that prosperity, and not adversity at all,
aas uses as sweet as the fire to a bottle of port on a frosty

day. I believe I should myself—but of course we should all
be better, once out of the mire of savagery and over-feeding,
were we free to go our own way, cultivate our taste, and
gratify our sympathies. Lord, make and keep us rich. Amen.
Fred appeared this morning in a state of agitation quite
irregular and previously unknown. For the first time in his
life he was ashamed of himself. He was in the position
of a criminal about to be arrested, to whom escape was
impossible.
He had trifled with his breakfast, and eaten nothing.
Marion, busy with her thoughts, took no notice, and presently
went away on a commercial visit to Mr. Burls. Adie, who
poured out his tea for him, saw there was something wrong,
but forbore till Marion was gone.
Now," she said, when the door was closed upon her sister,
“ what is it, Fred? Tell me."
Nothing," he replied, faintly.
6 Don't talk nonsense. Tell me everything."
“Can you bear to hear everything ?” he asked, in a hollow
voice, not at all feigned.
“I must, I suppose, some time or other,” said his sister.
Come, Fred, dear, don't be a baby. Take your finger out
of your mouth, and let me have a clean breast at once."
Well, hang it, Adie, you might be a little sympathetic.
You know how unlucky I've been.”
I do know that, Fred.” She patted his hand with her
soft and slender fingers, and sank down at his feet in a pretty,
unstudied attitude-all Adie's attitudes were unstudied. "I
do know, Fred. You've been so unlucky as to be born with a
great desire for good things and no money. So have I. I
am exactly like you. Nobody could be more unlucky than
you and I. Let us sympathize together. Poor Marion is not
too lucky either, because she has to work for all three of us.
Let us sympathize with her too."
“Three months ago, Adie, I was hard up," he began,
solemnly.
“Why, my dear boy, what were you yesterday, or four
months ago, or any time since I first knew you? You were
hard up when we were in the nursery together. For goodness
-sake do not look so solemn, Fred, you frighten me.'
“Do let me go on, Adie; it is no laughing matter. I went
to a man named Saul, a money-lender, and asked for an
advance. He came here to see the security.”
65

66
“ What security ?" asked Adie, with quickening appre-
hension.
“The—the furniture, you know.”
“But that is not yours. It is Marion's."
“It is raine and yours, I suppose, as well as Marion's. My
father left no will. At all events, it is too late to ask whose
it is, because he came here and took an inventory. Then he
made me sign a bill of sale"
6 What is that?”
“And gave me ten pounds and a box of cigars. The bill
was dated at three months, and it was for thirty pounds.
Now it has mounted to forty. And, Adie, the bill falls due
to-day."
But, Fred, you have no money. Tell me, can he take
you-oh! Fred, can he take you to prison ?"
“No, but he can take the chairs and things-Hush!”_he
turned very pale—“I hear steps on the stairs. They are
coming up now.”
Adie sprang to her feet, with a sudden horror upon her.
The door opened, and Mr. Saul appeared alone. But there
were two men behind, and a van drew up to the door.
“Now, Mr. Revel,” he said, taking off his hat with a bow
to the young lady, “this is the day, you know, and I suppose
you are ready to meet
your
liabilities."
“No, I am not.”
“Hum! That's awkward. Then you have found a good
name, perhaps ?”
No, I have not."
“Well, you will give me fresh security ?”
66 I have none.'
“Not a single friend to help you? Not any to help this
young lady? Not any other property ?”
“None-nothing. You must do what you please.”
“Ah! Well, I am very sorry, but we must proceed to
remove the furniture. Benjamin, you may come in.”
Two men came in, and without further ceremony began to
put. chairs together and move things about.
“What are they going to do, Fred ?” cried Adie.
“ They are going to take away all our furniture," her
orother replied.
“I am very sorry, young lady-very sorry indeed, to place
you to any inconvenience; but the law, you know the
law."

“ Bat it is not my brother's furniture. It is my sister's,
all of it.”
“ That's awkward too, because he said it was his own.”
The men went on in a swift, businesslike way.
In three
journeys up and down stairs they had nearly dismantled the
room.
Not
my music too,” Adie cried, as a profane hand was
laid
upon
her music stool.
“Everything, Benjamin," said Mr. Saul.
“Everything ?” she asked. “ Are you going to take our
wardrobes ?”
“Everything, Benjamin," said Mr. Saul, addressing his
assistant, and not looking at the girl.
“Oh, stop!” she cried, "stay till my sister comes home.
I think she will be able to pay off the money, or some of it.
Spare our room, at any rate.'
Mr. Saul waved his hand with dignity in the direction of
Fred, as much as to say, “You see the real culprit. I pity,
but cannot help you.”.
In the presence of the men Adig said nothing to her
brother, who walked backwards and forwards with Aushed
cheek and restless step.
“ Can't you stop them at all, Fred ?" she asked.
“ Must
everything go? Oh, what will Marion say?"
He seized his hat and rushed from the room, leaving the
girl alone with the men.
“Show 2.e,” she said, "your authority for taking these
things.”
Saul drew out of his pocket the bill of sale.
“ There is my authority, young lady. I would advise you
not to resist it.”
“Resist it? I resist it? How can I? Will you let me take
one or two of my own things ? They are in the other room.”
Benjamin,” he replied, “ go with the young lady into her
room, and bring me what she wants to take away.'
“ No, sir,” she said, proudly. “If I am to bave the company
of you and your assistants in my own room, I stiail leave you to
do your worst. The worst is to take away everything, is it not?”
“ That is the worst,” said Mr. Saul. - I assure you,
if I
had known that I was advancing money on the security of
furniture used by a young lady, I would have refused the
loan-I would, indeed."
“ That is your worst. Then I will tell you that you are a

cheat, and a thief, and a villain. You gave my brother ten
pounds, and you exact forty. You are a Shylock."
Mr. Saul, who had not expected to meet any one in the
place except Fred, looked a little disconcerted.
By this time the furniture was reduced to the carpet, which
the men began to take up.
“How glad I am,” said Adie, “ that Marion's picture is
gone!”
“Eh? What? Picture ?” Mr. Saul was evidently alarmed.
“Where is the inventory? Why the devil, Benjamin, can't
you tick off things? Where's the picture ?”
Pictures-there-here you are,” said the assistant.
“Now, remember, young lady, if anything has been taken
away, pledged, or lent, or sold, it is fraudulent, and will lead
you and your brother into serious trouble. Benjamin, there's
something about a picture that I don't understand. Go up
to Mr. Revel's bed-room, three-pair back; look into the
cupboard first, and then go out on the roof. Ah! I am a
Shylock, am I? I've had to do with real ladies before now
-not ladies in Lowland-street, with a brother who lives by
billiards-real ladies, and I've always found something put
out upon the roof. Go and look well on the roof, Benjamin.
There you'll find the picture, no doubt. My picture.
“I wish my brother was here to thrash you,” said Adie,
with flashing eyes.
" You cheat him because he is made to
be the prey of such creatures as you;
but
you
would not dare
insult him before his face. When he is gone, you insult me.
Of course, no one expects from a money-lender the smallest
resemblance to a gentleman; but one might expect some
trace of civilization. Costermongers, even, are careful in
their speech when they talk to ladies. Money-lenders, I
suppose, rank below costermongers.”
The words were brave enough, but the girl's heart was
swelling within her. Mr. Saul made no reply, but presently
cursed Benjamin roundly because his visit to the roof pro-
duced nothing.
Then the carpet was taken up, and Adie remembered her
friend the schoolmaster.
He was in school, presiding over his little band of twenty
scholars, divided into two classes. They were the sons of the
small shopkeepers in Lowland-street and its environs-people
too proud to send them to the National Schools, where they
would have learned quite enough for all their wants in life,

and feeling a glow of pride at the reflection that Johnny and
Harry were learning Latin. Rhyl Owen, meantime, taught
the children what he could, in the old-fashioned method of
instruction, accompanied by the quick, old-fashioned method
of stimulant. He was perched on his chair, with his little
legs tucked under it, his long coat sweeping to the floor
like an academical robe, and his puckered face bent over a
battered copy of Cæsar. He was finishing off the grammatical
portion of his lecture, and with one eye on the clock, which
pointed to a quarter before twelve, was beginning a short
address on the character and exploits of his author.
“What is it, Miss Adie?”—becoming suddenly conscious
that the young lady was standing in front of his desk.
Silence, every boy, or I will cane the whole school, from top
to bottom. Fifty lines for Smith-half an hour for Bumpus
-all the school an hour to stay in."
“Come out as soon as you can, Mr. Owen,” she whispered,
with a tremulous voice. " Come out and see-me, we are in
terrible trouble.”
The schoolmaster looked again at the clock. It wanted
eight minutes to twelve. Nothing the parents disliked more
than the dismissal of their boys a moment before the time.
It was so much defrauded of their rights. Fortunately, he
heard a clock somewhere striking the hour.
“We are five minutes slow,” he said.
“ Boys, you may go.
Those I told to stay in just now shall be let off for once.
All took up their books and were off in a moment, except
two.
“There's Candy Secundus and Holybone Primus—kept in
as usual,” he explained. - “Stay, I'll cane them both instead,
and let them go. I sha'n't be a minute working them off.
Come here, you boys, and be caned. You deserve it richly,
Candy Secundus first, because he's the worst."
He grasped his cane and descended to the field of action-
the small space in front of his desk, which acted as a narrow
arena, there being just room, and nothing to spare, for the
caning of a boy. It was also the intellectual gymnasium,
being used for the standing of a class, and such scholastic
evolutiong.
“No,” said the girl. 66 Let them off this time. I am sure
they have done nothing very bad. Go away, boys, as quick
as you can; Mr. Owen is the kindest master in the world,
and lets you off.”

They needed no second invitation, but grinned and dis-
persed themselves. To be sure, a caning more or less mat-
ered little.
The school-room empty, Adie sat down, and gave way to
the tears that her pride kept back before the men above.
Mr. Owen waited patiently, standing before her with the
cane still in his hand, and as if she was a culprit, and he was
about to administer punishment.
“When you are composed, my dear,” he said at length,
shaking the instrument as if he meant to begin as soon 2.8
she was ready.
“I must cry," she said—“I am in such a rage that I must
cry. Oh, Mr. Owen, it is worse than when I asked you to
give me something to eat, and that was bad enough. Fred
has been borrowing money, and they are carrying away all
our furniture."
“How much money?" Mr. Owen asked. “I've got-
don't tell Winifred, because it was meant as a surprise for
her-I've got twenty pounds in the Post-office bank. Will
that be of any use ? Come with me, my dear-no, you stay
here, while I go and see what can be done.”
He found Mr. Saul superintending the reinoval of the
ed-room furniture.
6. What is the amount of the debt?” he asked.
“ More than you can pay, old shaver,” Mr. Saul replied,
with a fine politeness. • Now, don't interrupt by asking
conundrums, but just get out of the way.”
“What the devil do you mean?" the little Welshman cried,
in a boiling rage. “I'm a friend of the family—"
“A pretty family," the creditor began.
“Look here,” said Mr. Owen, turning up the sleeves of
his coat, which were much too long, in case matters should
take an assault-and-battery turn, which he ardently desired.
“Look here-I've asked you a civil question, and got an

There was little doubt, from the fiery and Early Briton-
like expression of his eyes, that he would have done it-
Cadwallader and Caractacus must have been awful warriors
to tackle: one wonders how the Romans worried through
with the job. Mr. Sauel collapsed. That is, he became civil.

enough, I take it. But perhaps you will pay the amount.
It's a matter of above thirty-nine nineteen. Say forty."
That was too much. Mr. Owen groaned aloud.
“ Can't you give us a day or two to look round ?”
Why, you've already had three days. Be reasonable, now.
Benjamin, wake up. Hang it, one would think you were
working by the hour! Now then, sir; there's the case-cash
advanced, bill of sale on the furniture; no money forth-
coming, furniture sold. Is that straight and fair, or isn't it?
If it isn't, pay the money on the nail to me, Mr. Saul, of
Thavie's Inn, and the goods shall all be taken out of the cart
again."
Mr. Owen retreated.
“My dear," he said, “is there no one else to ask ?”
“Of course there is. There is Dr. Chacomb. Oh, even
Marion would not mind my asking his help in such a strait
as this. He will be at the hospital now.”
Mr. Owen had a short interview with the great physician,
who was in the very rush and flow of business. But he came
away with the schoolmaster instantly.
“I know Saul. I've had dealings with him. Here
Hansom! Now then, Mr. Owen, jump in.”
“ Fred Revel is a more worthless rascal than ever I thought
him," said the schoolmaster.
“You know him-yes, you know the family? I have
heard of you, Mr. Owen, and your daughter."
“Yes, I know him," said the schoolmaster, savagely.

“Ah, you would like to punch his reckless young head.
It's no good, my dear sir, not the least good in the world.
He belongs to a tribe on whom kicking would be quite

“I have,” said Mr. Owen. Candy Secundus is a case in
point. And I've often thought that Alcibiades must have
been another. He once boxed a schoolmaster's ears, and does
not appear to have been caned for it, as he should have been
if it had been me.”
“No doubt. I am going to see Mr. Saul, and get the
sticks back again. No experience will teach that boy anyo

Mr. Owen got down at the usurer's office, and bastened back
to comfort Adie.
He found her in the dismantled and empty room. With her,
Marion.
“I could sit down and cry, Marion," she was saying, “if
there was anything to sit down upon. But one cannot cry
standing, it's too ridiculous. It's like the nuns in the picture.
And, besides, it won't bring back our things."
" Where is Fred?” Marion asked.
“I do not know. He ran away, and left me to face the
enemy by myself. Marion, don't say anything to the poor boy."
Adie, as we have seen before, reserved to herself jealously,
the right of reproaching her brother-a right which she
executed in secret, and with discretion.
“What could I say, Adie? The thing is, what are we to
do ?”
“Come downstairs, Miss Marion," said the schoolmaster.
“You shall have Winifred's room, and Winifred and Miss
Adie shall have mine, and I will sleep up here on the floor
till you get your things back.”
“ And Fred ?" asked Marion.
“ Fred may sleep on his floor,” replied Adie. “As he has
done all the mischief, let him have some of the suffering.”
“Mr. Owen,” Marion said, “ how shall we thank you ?”
She took his hand, and looked her thanks with swimming
eyes.
“He wanted to lend us all the money he had in the world,”
Adie cried. “I thank him," throwing her arms round the
little inan's neck. “I thank him-so.

himself from the girl's embrace, and hurried downstairs.
“Adie," Marion began-
“Marion," interrupted her sister, "please, don't look so
solemn. Now listen, and reproach me afterwards. Things
were too serious for thinking about what was proper,
I just sent that dear little man to the Hospital for Gout, and
wold Dr. Chacomb."
Marion sighed.
“Yes, dear-that's just what I did. As Dr. Chacomb does
not want to marry me, there is no pocketing of what they call

If they were to be sold, we should have just think—not a
single thing in the world except what we stand in. Not even
a clean collar to put on.”
But they had another and an unexpected friend, who now
tapped at the door. It was Dicky Carew.
"Miss Marion," he began, in a breathless way, I too
late?”
“What for, Mr. Carew? We have had our furniture seized,
that is all.”
“But it can't be sold at a moment's notice. They had no
business to carry it off at all. I saw them removing the
things in the van, and asked whose they were. Then I hurried
round to my place to get some papers. Please wait a quarter
of an hour if you can.
He left them again, and they heard him run upstairs and
knock at the Hermit's door. He was in his dressing-gown,
reading his valuable Memoirs.
“Mr. Lilliecrip—” Dicky began.
“ You need not make any apologies, Mr. Carew—they are
worthless. Nothing would induce me to employ you any
You have brought me back my papers, I suppose ?”
Apologies be hanged !” he replied. ""I've lost more than
your appointment since I saw you last. That is not what I
came for, Mr. Lilliecrip. And as for the papers of yours in
my possession, what would you give to get them back ?”
“What would you give me, supposing I sold them to you
back again ? Mind, they are worth a great deal. They are
worth all my revenge, because I intended showing them
about. I was going to make you a general laughing-stock.
I was going to take it out of you for my three years' servi.
tude. Now I offer to sell them to you. What will you give ?".
Mr. Lilliecrip gasped for breath.
“Come, now, my jovial Hermit”—Dicky, being quite re-
covered, was able to afford a little geniality.
“ Come, now,
friar of the lonely dell, set the muscatel a-flowing. Ah, stay,
gentle stranger.” Dicky pointed to the cupboard. “There's
no rest like the tap for the Pilgrim of Love."
“You would-ah!-you would like a glass of wine ?”.
"I would, strange as it may appear. Palmer with the
sandal shoon and cockles in thy hair, I would for once taste
of thy hospitality."

*“ Eh?”

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
Mr. Lilliecrip opened the cupboard door. Dicky's wildest
dreams were more than realized, for it was full of bottles with
silver foil.
“ Moselle or champagne, Mr. Carew? Or perhaps you
would prefer sparkling Burgundy ?"
Sparkling Burgundy sounds rich,” said Dicky; “but I
should like a whole bottle of champagne just for once. Come,
holy father, brother cellarer, brother cook, and brother trea-
surer to boot, let us have a bottle of the creamiest and the
driest. I am like Byron, because I can't resist the offer of
champagne. And I am not like Byron, because I was never
offered any before. Corkscrew, aged Ascetic."
Dicky was master of the situation, and he felt it. Besides,
a state of absolute destitution as regards income is not at first
without a certain exhilaration, a gentle stimulus to the spirits.
He took a tumbler, poured out a glass, and drank it off,
with a nod and a smack of the lips.
“'Gad!” he said. “Do you positively mean to tell me that
you mortify the flesh day after day with this”—he poured out
another, and drank it _“ this nectar ? The Pope he leads a
happy life!"-another glass—“ only three tumblers in a
bottle ? I should like another. But no.”
He finished it, and sat on the table, dangling his legs, with
a beaming countenance.
“Come, Solitary of Sahara, what will you give me for this
precious manuscript? Here are your recollections of King
Pharaoh, and how you dined with Rehoboam. Here is a
bolster of about the liveliest lies ever put together. What
shall we say for this lot? Refuse, and they go, with a history
of the Hermit of Lowland-street, supposed by some to be the
Wandering Jew, to the Daily Firework. I shall get the job.
I shall write three columns in leaded type. Buzwing, who
attends our evenings, will do the leader. You will be so shown
up to derision, so illustrated and exemplified by every big
name, from Gyges to Napoleon, that on the whole I think
you will wish you had not quarrelled with your private secre-
tary, and never gone into the hermiting line. Come, what
shall we say ?”
“You have me at a disadvantage,” replied the Hermit,
whose face, during Dicky's harangue, had expressed every
shade of terror and dejection. “I wish to have the papers
back : that is quite true. Your presence is offensive, and I
wish to see you gone ; and I wish also to buy your sileence."

"Buy them all,” said Dicky—“buy them all, rollicking
reveller and lonely tippler. I am in a hurry. Thirty pounds
will buy the lot.”
Mr. Lilliecrip hesitated.
Thirty pounds before I count three, or I go. One."
“ But I-"
“ Two-Th"
“I consent."
Five minutes afterwards, Dicky rushed down the stairs
again, holding in his hand six bank notes, white and crisp,
for five pounds each. Marion was alone in the empty room.
He lost all the bounce he had put on with his late employer
as he opened the door, and came in quite humbly.
“Miss Revel,” he said, stammering, “I am very sorry. I
know something about those money-lenders. I-I-have got
a little money by me-put away in a stocking, you know.
I've brought it to you. Take it, please, and let me fetch all
the sticks back again. It's only thirty pounds.”
“Oh! Mr. Carew. But I cannot.'
“ You must, Miss Revel. You will, I am sure, to oblige
me—no, not to oblige me; for the sake of your sister.”
“But, Mr. Carew, why do you—"
“Because you-oh! it's for your own, Miss Marion. No,
don't turn away. I know well enough what a distance there
is between you and me. Dicky Carew is not blind; he under-
stands more than people think. Suppose he has dared to love
and respect you for three years, he has known all the time it
was nothing but such love and respect as a servant may pay
his mistress. God bless you, Miss Marion !"
“Mr. Carew, I cannot take your money. I cannot, indeed.”
At that moment the door opened, and Mr. Owen appeared
again.
“My dear young lady," he said, “I've got my money.
Mrs. Candy-she's a good soul, though a little short of
temper—advanced it out of the till on my Post-office bank.
book. Here it is—tventy pounds. We can buy back some
of the furniture, at any rate. They have only got the right
to take what will pay for the bill.”
Dicky Carew patted him on the back.
“Good man," he said—“you shall give the boys a half-
holiday for this. Now, Miss Revel, you've got enough to
defy the money-lender and all his malice. Let us go together,
Mr. Owen, and pay off the sharks."

But there was yet another visitor-Dr. Chacomb
He entered in his quiet and self-possessed manner, shook
Marion's hand slightly, and nodded to Carew.
“ You here, Carew? Miss Revel, I am happy to say that
the little difficulties are removed. The man will send back
your things at once; and you will have no further trouble
about the matter."
“We are deeply grateful, Dr. Chacomb."
“Not at all. The rascal abated balf his claim directly he
saw that he had me to deal with. He will place his men at
your disposal, and you will only have to see that everything
is put back exactly as they took it away. Good morning,
Miss Revel; I am going down to Chacomb to-morrow; but
I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you next week.”
“Now,” said Dicky, with fallen face, when he was fairly
gone, “I sha'n't have the pleasure of getting your things
back for you. I've sold my revenge for nothing but a speech.
What a pity! What a pity!"
“ And now," said Mr. Owen, grumbling, “I shall have to
take back this money to Mrs. Candy. Miss Marion, do keep
it for me.”
CHAPTER XXXII.
This was Marion's darkest hour. When the bill of sale
was settled, and the furniture brought back again, she had a
letter brought by a ragged little girl from her disreputable
pensioner, Mrs. Spenser. It was written in her usual strain-
half of command, half of entreaty.
" Come to me at once, as soon as you can. The boy is very
ill."
Marion obeyed the letter. This was a case in which not
even the doctor, a kind of deus ex machina, could interfere in
her behalf. The thing had to be faced by herself. It was
her own secret.
The woman apparently had time, between the sending of
the letter and Marion's arrival, to recover her spirits. She
was sitting at her table as usual, at her work, singing to the
boy, who lay on his mattress, propped up with pillows and a
dundle of clothes. His childish face, with its bright, ques-
zoning eyes, looked profoundly pathetic to Marion: it seemed
as if his intellect had been stopped at the age of six or there-

abouts, when he might have been a child of great mental
promise and vivid imagination.
He had grown thinner in the few days since Marion last
saw him; his cough was worse, and he sank back from time:
to time upon the pillows. The St. Vitus's dance was more
frequent and more violent.
Marion came in unobserved. The boy's mother was singing
an old nursery song with open doors while she worked.
Rickety Jem nodded his head, drummed the floor with his
stick, and tried to join in the chorus.
“Soldier, soldier, will you marry me,
With your musket, fife, and drurn ?
Oh! no, pretty maid, I cannot marry thee,
'Cause I've got no coat to put on.
So she went upstairs to her father's chest.
And she brought him a coat of the very, very best,
And the soldier put it on.
Soldier, soldier, will you marry me,
With your musket, fife, and drum ?
Oh! no, pretty maid, I cannot marry thee,
'Cause I've got no boots to put on.
The boy got up, and tried to brandish his crutch as he
limped up and down in time to the tune. It was a very
feeble effort, for the rickets seized his limbs, and he fell back
again, with a cough that seemed to tear him to pieces, upon
the bed.
Marion remembered the old song—but in a place how
different !-and the singer too.
The boy, recovering from his attack, cried out for more.
just like a child.
66. Soldier, soldier! Go on, mother, finish the song.”
“She went upstairs to her father's chest,
And she brought him boots of the very, very best,
And the soldier put them on.”
“Now the last !” cried the boy, impatient—"when she's
given coat, and bat, and boots, and all.'
“ Soldier, soldier, will you marry me,
With your musket, fife, and drum?
No, pretty maid, I cannot marry thee,
'Cause I've got a wife at home."
The boy drummed on the floor and laughed at this simple
ditty, singing it over and over again in his piping voice.
“You remember that song, Marion, of course," said the
woman, balf defiantly, as she looked round and saw her visitor.

woman.
“ Yes," she said, simply. “How is the boy ?"
“Tell Marion Revel how you feel, Jem, my son.”
“ Better,” said Jem—"aint I, mother?”
“He was very restless last night. That was why I sent
for you.
I want him to have a doctor. This morning his
cough is not so bad as it was. At least, I don't think so."
Rickety Jem looked up in Marion's face with his weird
smile. The likeness to Adie struck her more, as the features
grew thinner and the eyes brighter. She kissed him on the
forehead, and the boy shrank back, half ashamed. Like an
Australian savage, he hardly knew the nature of a kiss.
“He's so thin," said his mother. “ What can I give him
to get his strength up again? Show me your arm, my
boy.”
He drew up his sleeve, and showed an arm about the
thickness of Marion's finger-a thin stalk of an arm, a mere
transparent strip of fragile bone.
“Don't look at me like that, Marion Revel,” said the
“He has had plenty to eat—it isn't that, I
have not spent the money in drink. Nothing at all has come
into the place except tea and milk. The boy has had it all.
It's more than a month since he went out of the house, and
was run over by the cab. He's never been the same child
since. But always the best of boys to his poor mother,
isn't he, Jem? Always the best and most affectionate boy
in all the world.”
Jem laughed.
“ Some of the boys got no mother. Some of the boys got
mothers as beats them. Some of 'em are afraid to go home,
even in the winter. One boy ran away, and went to sea.
“His mind runs on his companions still,” said Marion.
“They've been his friends since he could walk. He knows
nobody else. He has been to no other school.”
Marion sighed.
“When I go out again," the lad went on,“ the boys 'll ask
me where I've been. I shall tell 'em I've been having milk
and eating oranges. Ah! when shall I go out again, mother?
I'm tired of coughing, and the pain in my back won't go."
“Soon, my boy, very soon now," returned his mother;
s when we have some warm weather-when the summer
cómes again.”
Marion's
eyes
filled with tears.
“Let me bring a doctor to see him.”

She had written to Marion expressly to ask for a doctor.
Now she suddenly turned from her purpose.
“What good? I know, Marion Revel, what you think.
It is quite true, and it is coming. I have felt it coming for
four weeks. Lie down, Jem, dear, and have another orange.
If you lie down you will not feel the pain so much. There,
my child, now you will be comfortable. Go to sleep, my
boy-go to sleep, my darling."
The boy complied, and closed his eyes as if asleep.
“He lies like that, quiet and still,” murmured his poor
mother," for hours. It's to make me think he is getting well.
But he is not. Oh! he is not. I know it. And what shall
I do without him, Marion? What shall I do-Hush !-
speak low. It's the great mercy of God, after all, that he
should go-isn't it? I don't mean to me, because there is
no mercy left for me; but for him, for the boy. It's better
that the child of shame and guilt should die, and the sooner
the better. What is before him if he lives ?”
“And for yourself”—Marion took her thin hand in her
own—“for yourself; can you bear to let the child go ?”
“Bear!” she replied, with a great and sorrowful cry.
66 Ask me if I can bear this miserable life? What have I not
borne for fourteen years ? Do you think there is anything
that such a woman as myself cannot bear? Oh! Marion
Revel”—she burst into low and bitter weeping—“he ought
to forgive me; he would forgive me if he knew what my
sufferings have been. Not to take me back-never that; not
to let me kiss my son and my daughter- his children and
mine-never that; not to take his name again, no—not that;
but only to be near him, and to feel that he has quite for-
given me. Your mother will be his wife, Marion, there. She
was a good woman, like yourself. Some people are born
good, and it is no merit of theirs; but if I could only be
bis servant !”
My dear, believe that he has forgiven. Be quite sure of
that; do not doubt. Ask God's forgiveness too.
“That's not what I think of,” she said, truthfully. “It is
of him that I am always thinking.”
“ You must think that the boy will only go before.”
“Where am I to go, mother?” cried the boy, who caught
at the last words. “ Not to the hospital. Don't send me to
the hospital. There was one of the boys went there—him
that used to turn Catherine wheels alongside of the 'buses-

and they cut off his legs, and he never came out again. Died,
he did. Then they cut bim up to see what he was made of.”
“No, not to the hospital,” said Marion—"to a much
better place; to a place where there is always happiness."
“And oranges ?”
“Yes; finer fruit than you ever dreamed of, Jem."
“And lemonade, and milk ?”
“Everything is there; and for anybody. There are fields
and flowers."
“One of the boys came from the country, he did. He's
always talking about fields and flowers.”
“That is it, Jem. You will go to the country-a much
better country than this.”
Mother, why are you crying ? Sha'n't we go together p"
“Yes, boy-yes," she answered. “Where you go, I go.
God sball not separate us, shall he ? Marion," she added,
after a pause, “you will forgive me, won't you? I have
suffered so much that I am not always mistress of myself.
I know how good you are.
There is no one woman in ten
thousand such as you, that would come to see a woman such
as me. Do not think me ungrateful. See, I try to keep
myself from drink. I am always sober now.”
“I do not-only-only-do one thing that I ask you
teach this poor child a single prayer.”
She drooped her head, and answered nothing. Only she
did not refuse.
“Jem,” said Marion,“ you have a Friend whom you cannot
see, but who sees you. Would you like to ask that Friend
to help you ? Listen, and say after me.”
The boy listened, and learned.
“Now you know it-say it aloud. Never doubt that this
great Friend hears. Do not be afraid to
say
it
every morning,
and every evening. Wher. you are in pain, and when you are
awake at night, say it for yourself, and for your mother, and
For me.”
The boy said his prayer.
He understood little enough
what Marion taught him as yet; but he obeyed, being a docile
child, and unaccustomed to such gentle ways as Marion's.
While he prayed, his mother, her bead bowed between her
hands, crouched at the foot of the bed—like a slave, who
longed, but feared, to meet her Lord.

Little to say:
CHAPTER XXXIII.
MR. OWEN spent the remainder of the day lying in wait to
catch the author of the mischief, Mr. Frederick Revel, with
whom he wished to exchange a few words.
He caught him in the evening, as the unhappy young man
was stealing back, expecting to find a "desolated hearth,"
with perhaps his sisters, and his poor little wife, sitting on
the bare boards, weeping.
“ Come with me, Mr. Revel,” he said, leading the way to
the empty school-room, where he took up the position of
vantage, by sitting at his desk-Fred standing before him
like one of his boys. The wrinkled face of the pedagogue
was full of trouble; he stammered and hesitated.
“I've said nothing about it yet,” he began, without
explaining what it was. Fred knew what he meant.
Nothing about it. But I have seen what is going on.
Now, sir, what have you got to say for yourself ?"
Fred shook his head, implying that he had really very
“I told her at the beginning of it all that you were a
worthless chap.” He went on: “She said you were the
soul of honour. I told her you were a lazy chap; she said
you were longing to find work
I told her you were eating
your head off; she said that you were pining away and
getting thin with sorrow at finding nothing to do. That was
a month ago and more. What have you found to do since ?”
“I have been unlucky, Mr. Owen.'
“No, sir!" taking up the cane, and bringing it down,
emphasis gratia, on the desk, with a crash that made the
young man jump in his shoes—"no, sir! you have not been
unlucky, you
have been idle. You have gone on eating your
head off at your ease. You have not tried to find work. You
despise a man who does honest work-you despise ME. Good
heavens! I dare say you despise your own sister. Solomon
says, • The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven
men that can render a reason. You, to despise honest work!
-you who have spent your days in a billiard-room! You
have borrowed money till your old friends will lend you no
more; you have never looked for work at all; and, to crown
all, you have gone to a money-lender-a blackguard money-
lender, who dared to insult me when I asked him a civil

question-and got advances on your sister's furniture.
When the scoundrel came with his bill of sale, and seized
the sticks, where were you ? Ran away-ran away! He
robs his sisters, this man, and runs away; and then he dares
to ask my girl, my Winifred, to marry him!”
The situation was such that the young man did not even
dare to resent this plain speaking. It was true; and, more-
over, the speaker was his own father-in-law.
“ Was it your fault that the furniture was not sold at
once ?
Has your sister Marion got to thank you that it is
all brought back safe ?"
“ Brought back! How ? By whom ?”
“By Dr. Chacomb, if you must know,” growled the school.
master. “ Not but what there were others willing and
anxious to help.”
“I am glad," said the culprit, humbly.
“ You ought to be sorry.
But what have glad and sorry
got to do with the business at all? What are you going to
do about my girl?"
It was a most unfavourable opening for announcing his
marriage. It was as if an Eton scholar, just under the rod
of Dr. Keate, was about to choose that moment for announcing
his passion for the head-master's daughter. The news must
be postponed
It's all true,” he replied—“quite true, and I am-but
what does it matter, as you say, about glad or sorry? I
mean to keep my promise to your daughter-to Winifred.”
“Do you ?” cried the peppery Welshman, in a tremendous
rage. “ Will you ? Here is condescension! Here is an affable
young fellow for you! He brings misery on his sisters; he keeps
them
poor;
he refuses to work, and now he tells me that he is
ready to keep his word with my daughter—the honest daughter
of an honest man. Why, sir, if it depended on me, I would
knock your head off your shoulders. I would refuse to let
Winifred see you any more. I would turn you into the
streets to starve. But it does not deperd on me, unfortunately.
There are your sisters to be considered, and my girl. The devil
of it is, that Winifred loves you; and I can't get over that.
Sooner than grieve my lamb, she should marry a murderer,
if I thought the murderer would love her in return. But
don't think it is an honour you are conferring on our family,
Mr. Revel ; because, I tell you plainly, I looked for better
things for my daughter."

“I
suppose," said Fred, grandly, “ that you wanted her to
marry some miserable little counter-jumper."
“I did. I looked to see her marry an honest man-
counter-jumper or not-who would make his living as God
should order, try and do his duty, and not be ashamed of his
handicraft. It's a poor sort of family pride that sets up one
trade over another. And you—what trade have you got at
all? What are your expectations, sir ?”
“I have none,” said Fred. “I hope, however,"
“You had better give up hoping. You have no expecta-
tions, no money, no friends, no trade, no skill, and you propose
to marry my daughter! Truly, you are the most hopeless
man in all this wide world. Remember that you will have to
show you can keep her first.”
“You do me wrong, Mr. Owen. I give you my word that
I should not be ashamed of any trade. I would do anything,
if only to show you and Marion that I am not so helpless as
you think me. I only want an opportunity.”
“In that case," said the schoolmaster, “the boys meet here
every morning at nine. You shall come here to-morrow, and
work my classes for me. There's
your
chance."
Fred turned pale. It was, to be sure, a chance. But what
an opportunity! Work, in his vague brain, meant, at the
best, a gentlemanly lingering in an office for a few hours in
the day; at the worst, writing at leisure, in an arm-chair, by
a comfortable fire. But work of the kind proposed by Mr.
Owen was too terrible. Assistant, usher, understrapper in a
wretched London academy-teacher of small tradesmen's
sons ! Possibly, considering that Mr. Owen's cane was not
wholly intended for ornament, he would be expected to take
his part in its use.
“Well," said the schoolmaster," what do you say? I give
you an opportunity. You shall work here as my assistant
for a month, without pay. Then I will try and get you a
place in a larger school, where they will give you-well, I
dare say you might get as much as thirty pounds a year to
begin with, board and lodging for ten months in the year
thrown in. You'd be a made man then,” he went on, with a
queer light in his eyes—" wouldn't you? Thirty pounds a
year, and all found. Walk out with the boys on balf-holidays;
look after them in play-hours, and— Eh? why, in a few years,
you might be thinking of marrying my girl. Come, Mr.
Revel, it's the best chance I see for you. You are an Oxford

man, too—though you haven't taken any degree—and that
always counts for something. Do you know Latin ?"
“I-I-yes-of course I do."
Then construe me this piece. Stay a moment. Where's
the translation ?”
He opened a Horace, one of the books that stood for show
on his shelves, and finding a place at random, took down
Francis's translation to keep himself safe with. Out of
Cæsar, Mr. Owen's Latinity was shaky.

“I am rusty. I have forgotten my Latin and Greek.”
“Well, there are other subjects-algebra—Euclid.”
“ I never learned mathematics at Oxford.”
Fred spoke as if mathematical science belonged to a lower
stratum of society than his own.
“ Then we come down to geography and history, arith-
metic, English, writing.”
" It's no use. I can't be a schoolmaster.”
“Mr. Revel, if you want to marry my daughter, you've got
to work. Now go. Make something of yourself, or give up
my Winifred.”
“What am I to do?" he asked, almost piteously.
“ I will tell you.” The schoolmaster bent his face down
within a couple of inches of Fred's, and said, in mysterious
ones," Go abroad.”
" Go abroad?”
Aye, go abroad. The world is wide, and there are places
where they want strong arms. Find them out. Go there,
make your fortune, and then come back here for Winifred.”
Fred made no reply, but left him.
The diplomatic schoolmaster nodded and winked when he
was gone.
“That was a good stroke,” he said. “Now we shall get rid
of him.”
Why should he not go abroad? Anywhere abroad. There
was nothing for him to do in England. He was only a drag
upon his sisters. He could not help his wife. Why not leave
wife and sisters for awhile, and try his fortune somewhere ?
And then his sanguine imagination began to picture an
Arcadian scene of prosperity, plenty, and happiness.
He walked away to St. Martin's, to meet his young wife,
gathering at every step fresh ardour of resolution.

“Winifred,” he began, eagerly, “I have something very
serious to say to you. No, nothing wrong. There has been
a row at Lowland-street; but it is all hushed up now, and
smoothed over. A bill of sale--nothing you would under-
stand-an old debt of mine. That is not it. I have seen your
father.”
“Oh, Fred, did you tell him ?"
“No. I was afraid to tell him after the shindy. He let
me have it, on his own account, for idleness. I will spare
you, my dear," he said, with commendable feeling, the
details of the interview. For your sake, I bore it all. And
the end of it is
“What, my dearest? Oh, tell me tell your wifc."
“The end is, that I must go abroad.”
“ With me, Fred ? Not, and leave me at home?”
“For a time, Winifred, I fear I must. See, dear, it will be
better so. You do not know, my love”-he spoke naturally
and simply--"the dangers I run in London. My dear, a man

was to become a billiard-marker. Your father

appointment. I have been running after shadows all this time.
Now, be brave, my girl, and let me go."
Winifred tried to be brave, but could not.
“ Abroad-across the ocean, somewhere I shall find an
opening. I have made it all out clearly, Winifred. I make
a clearing in the forest, run up a log hut-only a shanty at
first. I live in the woods, planting, sowing, weeding, and all
the rest of it. I shoot the wild game for
my
dinner. And
as soon as I have made a nest-in about a year or so—I shall
write to you to come out too. Think of leaving this dingy
London, and living in the most beautiful climate under the
sun, with the most delicious fruits, no need of money, and no
lack of good things. Above all, away from all this-bah!-
this struggling mass of people, fighting and quarrelling for
their ill-gotten gains."
He spoke enthusiastically, as if he had been all his life
pining for a return to the Saturnian rule.
“But Fred-oh, Fred !-is it real? Will you be able to
do this? Do you think you can really and truly work in a
Keld like a labourer?”
“Out there there is no such thing as gentlemen"-Fred's

“ Fred! as if I could be ashamed !"
“ You must let me go. I will be a burden on Marion no
longer. Who knows what dreadful thing may happen next?”
He was still thinking of the billiard-marker's prophecy. “My
old life is finished, Winifred; let me begin a new."
This man a “worthless chap”? This man as idle as a
gipsy ? This man as prodigal as a Guardsman ? Every pulso
in Winifred's veins cried "No."

went on.

They were at the door of the Lowland-street lodgings.
Fred was in earnest for once. He would be rid of the whole
trouble, and try fresh fields. All weak natures, when any-
thing goes wrong, want to go away, and begin life over again.
Some years ago when there was a crash in the ice, and some
half-dozen men were missing, it was found that a few—those
who knew how to seize an opportunity-had taken advantage-
of the accident to disappear in the flesh, leaving debts, wife,
children, and other impedimenta behind them. Fred pro-
posed' to do exactly the same thing, only he did not intend to
desert his wife.

" You are not going now, Fred; not now—not to-night?”
He held her tight in his arms, kissed her twice, and was
gone.
He walked straight to Dr. Chacomb, told him what he
proposed to do, and asked for the loan of enough money to
pay
his
passage
to any port in the States by the first steamer.

“ There is some stuff in the fellow, after all," said the
doctor. “Of course there is. How could your sisters bare
a brother with no good at all about him ?”
When Fred shook hands with the doctor half an hour later,
his eyes were soft, and his voice a little husky-
“I will send the letter to-night,” said the doctor.
" And-
and-Fred, if I have been a little rude sometimes—that's
right; you forgive me. Write to me when you get out; and
depend upon it that I will look after your wife. Sly dog, sly
dog! You will come home a man. Good-bye, and bon voyage.
Fred's letter was to Marion. He told her what he had
done. He wrote with his heart full of sorrow, and made no
protestations. When she had finished the letter, Marion
came to a postscript which startled her more than all the rest.
"P.S.-Winifred is my wife. I married her two months
ago, and against her will, poor thing! And I made her keep
the secret. Be kind to her, as you have always been the
kindest of sisters to me."
Marion gave the letter to Adie, and crept downstairs to
Winifred's room, where the schoolmaster, listening discon.
solately, heard the sounds of weeping, and sobbing. He
knew, somehow, that they were crying for Fred, and it made
him angry.
Then Marion came and told him all the truth, and would
hear of nothing but an immediate and general amnesty.

drove him away.'
She left her new sister in her father's arms. Winifred
told him all, talking and crying, till she fell asleep, and lay
there, dreaming that she was with her husband, all the
night. Every time she moved, and murmured "Fred," a
pang of rage and jealousy went through Owen's heart; but
he fought it down, and greeted his daughter, when she
awoke, with a cheerful smile.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
“ COME out, Chauncey, or I will do more mischief."
The voice was that of Mrs. Chauncey Chacomb. She was
standing in the great hall of Chacomb, before the single door
which led to the wing known as Gerald's rooms, with which
this door was the only means of communication.

" Come out, Chauncey. It is six o'clock. Come out, and
you shall have port with
your
dinner.”
There was no reply.
“ Chauncey," she went on, “I know you are listening on the
other side. Open the door at once, or I will send Charles:
with a hammer to break it down.”
“ You can't-ho! ho !—you can't. The door opens your
way, and I've barricaded it inside.”
"Joe"-she turned to the doctor, who had arrived, and
was surprised to find that his cousin had locked himself up
for four and twenty hours, and still refused to come out-
“Joe," she was in tears, “it isn't my fault. I have done
nothing to him. How can I help it if he turned rusty ?"
“ Cannot you get in at the window?"
“The ground floor windows are all secured with shutters,
and he has got a pistol, loaded. He says if anybody puts a.
ladder to the first floor window, he will shoot him dead first.
and himself next. Joe, what a fool I was-oh! what a
double fool-to marry this wretched little lunatic !"
“ Try him again. Speak softly to him. If you do not
succeed, I will try. Now, Julia, forget that you are his wife
-make believe to be his housekeeper again.”
She laughed.
“I wish I was. Chauncey-I mean Mr. Chacomb," she
said, in her sweetest tones, “ dinner will be served soon.
Will you have it sent in to you, or will you take it with me?”
“Neither," he replied. "I shall stay here. I've got a
box of sardines and a case of claret. I shall dine off them.”
“This is dreadful,” said the doctor. “ Does he often go on
like this ?”
“No; but for the last week he has been very queer. I've
got four men sleeping in the house, and I think he is
frightened. He thinks they are watching him.”
“Julia, I am disappointed in you. I thought you had'
more tact. Now, we must get him out.”
“I can't. It's no use bullying me, Joe. If I had the
patience of-of Moses and Aaron, I could not help flying out
at him now and then. Is it my fault if he locks himself up:
Can you say that I have ill-treated him ? Have I beater
him ? Have I starved him? Have I asked him for money?"
“Norno,” said Joseph. “I hardly suppose you have.
At least, not much. But there is such a thing as contrasto

“ And I am not. Well, never mind. If it was miserablo
here when I was housekeeper," she went on, “it is fifty times
as miserable now I am the mistress. No one comes to se
me. I go nowhere. I have no money; but that is your doing."
“It is, Julia,” said the doctor, with a smile. “I like to
manage the Chacomb revenues myself. I have brought you
the weekly allowance. When you choose to put the house-
hold on a proper footing, you shall have an increase. That's
enough for the present.
I wonder if a lawyer could force you to give me more ?"
she said, looking discontentedly at the coin.
You had better try. I still preserve a few letters of
yours, Mrs. Chacomb. It will not be difficult to prove thạt
you used your position here to gain an ascendency over the
weak brain of a lunatic, and forced him to marry you on the
vague threat of doing him a mischief. Where will
you
be
then?”
“Don't be cross, Joe. It isn't like your old self. Lord !
I wish the good old days could come back again. Do you
remember me as Perdita the Perfidious, at the Wells? You
were a good fellow then, Joe. You hadn't been spoiled by
getting a fine practice, and going about to see countesses.
You didn't sit down to a finicking pint of claret to your
dinner. You drank all the stout and the port you could lay
your
hand to, in those days. You didn't snap up a pretty
woman then for a word here and a word there. Ah! Joe,
you were a very different man then.”
“I
was,
and
you were a very different woman then. Hang
it, Julia, it's twenty years ago! You are Mrs. Chacomb, of
Chacomb Hall, now—a very grand lady.”
“Very grand indeed! Oh! if I had only known. What
do you think my lord did the other day? Forbade my going
out in the carriage-told the grooms not to take me out.
When I ordered the carriage round, they laughed in my face
Do
you call that being mistress of Chacomb Hall?”
“It was an extreme measure on the part of my cousin,"
said the doctor, twinkling. “I did not think he had so much
pluck. Of course, you acquiesced meekly.”
“No doubt,” said Mrs. Chacomb. "Ju Cathnor always
was a weak, easily-put-upon, wormlike thing in her younger
days, wasn't she, Joe ? Wasn't she?” She danced up to her
old friend with an airy flourish of her hands—a reminiscence
of bygone times. “It's likely she'd acquiesce. I will tell

you what I did, Joe. First, I dressed myself properly. Then
I made my little maid call the grooms to the kitchen, and
give them beer. (Beer is the real magnet for the male feet.
Champagne, as you know, draws the feminine tootsicums.)
Then I stepped out, and got into the carriage, and waited.
In a few minutes my gentlemen came out, and harnessed the
horses for their daily drive-little thinking I was inside.
When we had gone two or three miles, I ordered them to put
down the head, and drive me a good round. You should have
seen their faces. When we got home, I let them have it, both
of them. They won't forget the rough side of my tongue for
a bit. And after dinner I let Chauncey have it."
“Ah! I thought we should get to the bottom of the
barricade some time or other."
“It is not the slightest use in the world,” she pursued,
'nagging Chauncey. You get no fun out of it, and no satis.
faction. He only opens his eyes wide, and stares straight
before him, as if he were looking at ghosts. And it isn't any
good lifting your voice to him: he doesn't even listen. Always
that far-off look."
“I'm glad you don't feel it necessary to lift your hand to
him," said the doctor.
“I've done that, once or twice; but, Lord ! it's boxing the
ears of a man who takes no manner of notice. Many's the
time I've boxed your ears, Joe-when you richly deserved it,
till you've sworn again.”
"Some people swear easily. It's a habit of which I have
broken myself.”
“Ah! the jolly old days, when we went to Richmond on
Sundays, Joe-you, and I, and Jack Well. So I deter-
mined to punish him. I got up and went straight to the
Collection. I took half a dozen things called Roman lamps-
you know the trumpery-and I brought them back with me.
Now, Chauncey,' I said, “I'll teach you to insult your wife.'
Then I put them under my heel, and scrunched them up,
every one.'
“ And then ?"
“ Then Chauncey shrieked as if he'd been killed, and ran
away. It was last night. Since then he hasn't come out, and
I can't persuade him. You heard me try.”
“We must persuade him. Go and fetch-stay."
He went away, and came back with an apostls spoon,
rusty spur, and one or two fragments of pottery.

“Now, we will have a little drama. Threaten to break the
things to pieces.”
She nodded. The time was half-past seven, and the evening
had fallen. The great hall was empty and dark, save for the
two figures and a single candle on the table. It was a long
and lofty place, running the whole length of the house, with
windows at the end. Originally it had been designed by the
builder as a sort of state dining-room. Screens stood hero
and there, and the hall did not communicate directly with
the outer door. But both the outer and the inner door were
open. The two figures moving in the big hall in the twilight
looked weird and spectral.
“Now, Julia.”
Chauncey, will you come to dinner par
No, I will not. Go
away
and leave me.”
“Chauncey, will you come out, for the first time ?".
No answer.
“ Chauncey, will you come out, for the second time?
Chauncey, if I ask you for the third time, it yll be the worse
for you. I have got in my
hands a valuable silver
spoon,
with
a label on it-out of the Collection.”
"My apostle spoon—my apostle spoon !” he moaned,
behind the door.
“That isn't all. I've got a rusty green old spur, which I
can bend with my fingers. Now, Chauncey, if you don't come
out at once, I will bend it and break it into little pieces. It's
only rubbish.”
“The spur of King Canute !" groaned Chauncey.
“And break the apostle spoon into fifty fragments. Oh!
Joseph!"
For at this point of the drama the doctor seized her by the
wrist, with a violence that was perhaps a little over-acting the
part, and made her shriek quite naturally.
“Cousin Chauncey," he said, in his deepest tones," what is
this? Why do I find you locked up and barricaded in this
Then arrived the very luckiest moment in all Joseph Cha-
.comb's life.
For just then a strange face showed itself at the door of
the hall, that inner door whieh led to the outer porch. A
white face-a face bearded like a pard, full of expectancy and
curiosity. Neither of the actors in the little drama saw it.
Finding that he was unperceived, the owner of the face stole
way?"

across the ball softly, and crert behind one of the screens.
Then he listened.
“ Is that
you,
Joe? Is that my cousin Joseph ?”
The voice of Chauncey sounded hollow and faint.
“ It is, Chauncey. Open the door, and come out.”
“Send her away first," he cried. “I only want to see you."
“Go to the dining-room, Julia,” said the doctor. " Wait
for us there. Order dinner. I will bring him out in five
minutes.”
She obeyel, and swept away, brushing the floor with her
long silk train; and the doctor heard her ring the bell.
“At all events,” he said to himself, “we shall have dinner.
Now, Chauncey, make haste, and open the door. I shall be
here till Monday morning, and you may trust yourself
entirely with me, you
know. Open the door, and tell me all
about it.”
There was a great drawing away of boxes, pieces of furni-
ture, chairs, and other things, by means of which Chauncey
Chacomb had effected his barricade. Presently, his steps were:
heard in the space which he had cleared, a chain was taken
down with a clinking, locks and bolts were undone, and the
squire of Chacomb appeared. Marriage had done very little
good for him. When the Cambridge Don, who married late in
life, was asked how he found the state of wedlock, he said that
the breakfasts were better, but the dinners not so good, Chaun.
cey Chacomb would have said, with truth, that everything was.
not so good. As a housekeeper, Mrs. Cathnor had been a pink
and paragon. She kept the servants in order. She kept up the
house. She regulated his expenditure. She looked after his
comfort. She was submissive in appearance, and she ruled in
reality. Now that he had married her, all was changed. She
ruled, and professed to rule. She had dismissed all the old ser-
vants, and could not bring herself to engage a new set. She
had no sense that an old country hall should be kept up with a
certain amount of state. Above all, she had neither fear, respeaming
nor reverence for the master of the place; and sho bullied
him.
He was very miserable to look at. Thin in the face, stoop,
ing, his right shoulder a good deal more raised above the left
than it had been four years ago;
his
eyes
closer together
half shut-with a thousand crows'-feet and wrinkles round
them; and a general look of suspicion on him, which only
cleared away when he saw that his cousin was standing in
the ball alone.

He ran to meet the doctor, with hands outstretched, and
an eagerness that was affecting.
“ Joe,” he cried, with a sort of sob—"cousin Joe, the only
friend I have in the world, since Gerald went away. How
glad I am to see you! How glad I am you came to-night!"
“ Tell me all about it, Chauncey.”
The
way in which the poor creature clung to him struck
the doctor with pity and remorse. Of course, it is understood
by this time that Joe Chacomb's better points were exactly
such as to be brought out into full blossom and fructified, so to
speak, by prosperity and the sense of power. Still, at no time
bad he been a stony-hearted man. Pity is an artistic emotion;
it soothes the avenues to the brain and the more delicate.
sensations, just as soup prepares the way for dinner. Hence,
so many marriages are founded on pity. Amadis the Invin-
cible, Sir Bors the Lady-killer, are not bad fellows at bottom;
it goes to their heart to see fair Melusine grow thin and pale.
“Cousin Chauncey, cheer up," said the doctor. “Let us be-
jolly, man. You can't undo what you have done, but we may
make the best of it. We will go back to the old times, and
have a bottle of port for dinner, shall we?”
Chauncey shook his head.
"I haven't enjoyed my glass of port,” he said, "for four
long years. I must not expect to enjoy it now. Joe, can't.
you persuade her to go away from me ?"
“I might,” said Joe. “Gad! I never thought of that.
But I might. When would you like her to go, Chauncey? I
think she is best in London-everybody is best there. Of
course, I should not let her call upon me, and should give
orders not to admit her.”
“Of course,” said Chauncey. “ So should I, if I could get
rid of ber."
"I will do what I can, Chauncey. Now, why did you barri-
cade yourself?"
“She talks, she scolds, she sings, she-she boxes my ears,
Joe. And whether she talks, or sings, or scolds, it is all the
same; for her voice goes through me like a saw, and makes
me see ten thousand devils. When I hear her at night, the
room is peopled with faces-not all of them Revel's face, only
a good many. Some have Marion's face; so that I am suso
she must be dead.”
“She isn't dead. Nonsense, I saw her yesterday."
“ Joe, how the devil could I see her face with the face
her father unless she was dead ? Now, angrer me that.”

• Upon my word, I can't answer you that, But Marion in
alive, poor girl!"
“Her brother wrote to me last week for money. He said
they were starving. But she wouldn't let me send any. Now
I remember, Marion's name was mentioned. Then she must
have died since then.”
Evidently, the poor man's hallucination was stronger than
ever.
“Come to dinner, Chauncey," said Joe, with a shudder.
'Joe, you won't leave me, will you ? Come and sleep in
Gerald's room.
I will have the little room.
It will be very
comfortable to wake up and hear you snoring. It is quiet
so very quiet, when the faces begin their long procession.
Promise me not to leave me. Oh, I am afraid of her.
Yesterday she broke into the Collection, and broke my
valuable Roman lamps. To-day, she was threatening to
destroy King Canute's spur just as you arrived. She's a
dreadful woman, Joe—oh, a dreadful woman! I never knew
that such women could be found. I have read of them, but I
thought they only lived in novels. Joe, take her up to London
with you—take her right away from me. Let me get rid of
her. Oh, Joe! Joe !—what should I be without
you?
?"
The listener, bending low behind the screen, heard and
marked all this. As the two went arm in arm to the dining-
room, he followed with noiseless step, listening still.
The dinner was as bad as when the doctor last visited Mr.
Chacomb.
“Upon my word, Julia," he said, trying to get his knife
through the joints of a large barn-door fowl—"upon my
word, the state of your larder is too monotonous. We had
tough fowl the last time I was here."
“We have tough fowl every day, I think,” said Chauncey,
humbly.
The listener had followed to the door of the dining-room,
which stood open. The room was lit by four candles only,
which formed an island of light in the midst of a great darkness.
| So dark it seemed to him, that he was standing in the door-
way looking at the party, without the fear of being observed.
Facing him was Chauncey, who sat at the side. At one end
was Mrs. Chacomb, at the other the doctor-the usual order
of things being reversed.
“ Joe,” said Chauncey, quite quietly, laying down his knife
and fork, “ give me a glass of sherry, Joe-thank you. Yes,

thank
you, it is quite clear now. I told you that last night
I had a great vision ; quite a remarkable procession of faces
passed my pillow."
Aye, Chauncey, you did say something about it. You are
like the prophet Joel. Julia, this fowl is disgraceful. Well,
cousin, and what about the vision ? Tell me what it meant ?"
“They came trooping past me in thousands : an endless
file of human faces without bodies—thousands of them, Joe.
Every minute there would be a Captain Revel among them ;
then a Marion Revel—all dead people, you know. One face
I missed among them, and I thanked God, because I knew
that he must be alive; it was the face of my son--my Gerald.
But he is dead too”
“ Chauncey !" cried the doctor, “take another glass of
sherry, and then go on with the wing of your fowl.”
“Chauncey,” said his wife," if you talk like that at dinner,
just when people are trying to be happy and enjoy themselves,
after all the misery you've made me undergo on your account,
I will come round and shake you. I declare I will."
“Manners, Mrs. Chacomb !" said the doctor. “ Ladies in
society do not shake their husbands. Nor do they threaten
to do it.”
She tossed her head, and poured out a glass of claret..
There was no servant in the room, the little maid having
retired to the kitchen, where the grooms were helping her
to dish a very bad pudding.
“Now Gerald is dead, too," resumed the squire; " for I
have just seen him.”
“My poor cousin," said the doctor, “ do be good enough
not to talk in this creepy way. It's not pleasant at dinner.
Take another glass of wine. Did you get the port, Julia ?”
Chauncey, as usual with him, was staring straight before
him; and, as usual, the others took no heed to the direction.
Then he set down the glass which he held in
his hand, and half rose from his chair.
“ Chauncey's worse to-night than I have ever seen him,"
the doctor murmured. “His wife has frightened him out of
the few wits he had left."
“It's strange," the squire said. “The other faces passed
away, but this one remains. Revel only turned his sad eyes
upon me, and disappeared; so did Marion-her eyes are like
her father's. Gerald remains. I see more than his face-I
see his whole body in the twilight. He is pale. He has
of his eyes.

noves. He comes this way. Gerald !-Gerald! My son !
-my son! Speak to me.”
He threw himself forward, with his arms extended, and
fell, face downwards, upon the table, with a fearful cry.
It was echoed by his wife, who turned her head, and saw
the form that her husband had seen—which he thought to
'be a spectre.
“Father,” cried the stranger, “it is no vision. It is your
Ron.'
But his father moved uot.
The doctor was the first of the three to recover. He seized
a light, and threw it upon Gerald's face. Then he, too,
turned very pale-so pale that his friends would not have
known him. Then he put down the candle, and said, very
„softly, as if speaking to himself-
“Gerald come back !"
“It is Gerald,” the stranger replied; "and more than
thankful, my cousin, for the trust my father has in you.”
“You know-what do you know?" asked the doctor.
“I was present just now in the hall. I listened—forgive

“This is real, Chauncey. Your son is real. He who was
dead liveth. I wonder if that's ir. the Bible,” he murmured,
softly—“sounds like it. The prodigal—no, the wanderer
has come home again. Let us kill fatted calves, and drink
-drink old port-wine of Shechem. Sit down, Gerald.

had dinner ?”
Dr. Chacomb was nervous, and talked a little at random.
“ Here is a tough old hen.” He pointed to Mrs. Chacomb
in his agitation of spirit. “Here is your new stepmother."
He pointed to the fowl in the dish. “Sit down, and make
acquaintance, and eat and drink.”
Gerald bowed coldly to Mrs. Chacomb, and sat down. But
he did not eat much, or drink either. The doctor at and

drank for everybody. The squire sat gazing steadfastly at
his son.
“Gerald,” he murmured from time to time, between his
teeth.
Presently he got up suddenly.
“ Joe,” he said, “ give me a sleeping draught. Make me
sleep a ng while. I haven't slept for a fortnight, and I
don't know which are ghosts and which are realities. The
room is full of ghosts now.'
The doctor and Gerald took him to his own wing.
Mrs. Chacomb waited for them for two hours. Then she
rose in a rage, and went to her own room.
marry her.”
Chauncey went to bed and to sleep. The other two sat up
and talked. Gerald told of his travels—how he had been
stricken down by fever in Central Africa, and had been tended
by faithful negroes. The doctor told how he had started the
Hospital for Gout, and was now a prosperous man.
“And my father, Joe ?"
“ Your father's hallucinations are stronger than ever. That
woman I sent down here as housekeeper. She made him
• Was it was it all hallucination ?" asked Gerald.
Every bit. I was there. The man fell off the cliff. I
have told your father so a hundred times, but nothing moves
him. Nothing ever will now."
Gerald sighed.
“I fear I was hasty in going away. However, I have
formed the mode of my life. I am going back again as soon
as I have shaken off a little of this jungle fever."
“ Back again? With all this before you?”
“Yes, my cousin. It is my fate, I suppose. Every man
must work out his fate, eh? You are not four years in Africa
without believing in fate, let me tell you. Do you ever see
the Revels now ?” he asked-quite carelessly, Joseph noticed.
“I must call upon them when I go up to town. That will
be in a few days. You can give me their address, please.”
He did not ask what they were doing, or anything about
them, which was remarkable, the doctor thought,
Then he began to talk about his stepmother.
Next day, Mrs. Chacomb, with a great array of boxes, took
the mid-day train to London. It is sufficient to say that she
lives in considerable comfort and some splendour, but by

herself, in a suburban villa at Dalston. Once a month or 80,
on a Sunday afternoon, Dr. Chacomb drives over to her. She
is a widow now, and entertains her friends with long histories
of the splendours of Chacomb Hall, and her own great doings
with the other county ladies.
When Chauncey awoke it was high noon. He was lying
in Gerald's bed, and by him sat his son, in the flesh-DO
ghost at all.
“Gerald”-his voice was hollow, and sounded far off—“I
have had a miserable time since you went away. Now and
then I know that I am suffering from hallucinations, but
they come again. I know now that it is all a delusion. Think
that it is so. Oh, Gerald, do not believe your father au
murderer, whatever he may think himself! Ask Joe.”
“I do not, sir. Trust me, I do not.”
“Joe will tell you, Gerald. Remember, Joe has saved my
-what little reason I have and my life, too. Always
let Joe do what he likes in this house. Give him
money
if
he wants any. Remember, Gerald, it was Joe who saved
your
father from the madhouse."
Then he thought he should like to get up and see the
Collection. The doctor had pieced together the lamps with
cement, and he saw no change. Nor did he ever, at that
time or afterwards, make the slightest allusion to the second
Mrs. Chacomb: she passed out of his mind like one of his
old dreams.
After a month or two he took to lying down, a habit which
gained upon him. And now I do not think he will ever get up
from his bed any more.

CHAPTER XXXV.
AFTER Marion undertook the Hermit's commission, he
began to exercise his privilege of coming to see how the
pictured progressed every day, showing an almost feverish
anxiety about it. Not that he cared about the copy, which
was his crafty pretext, but the society of the young ladies
filled him with a delight unspeakable, after his long im-
prisonment. It was, to some extent, a return to the world
à very limited and humble part of it. Mr. Lilliecrip was one
of those men who, like La Fontaine and Oliver Goldsmith,
expand and show their sunniest side in the presence of ladies.
He resembled those poets in no other single quality, being,

as has already appeared, as untruthful as a Syrian, as boastful
as a Gascon, as selfish as a Fakir, and as cowardly as a
Fantee. But the pleasure of seeing for half an hour a day
these two girls, of talking to them, hearing the rustle of
their dresses, watching the waves of their hair, breathing the
same atmosphere with them, filled his life now with a delight
quite new to it. He was attracted, too, by some strange
resemblance in Adie's face, manner, and voice to one ho
had known many years before. Fancy an imprisonment
voluntary, but still an imprisonment–for fourteen long
years, during which nothing beautiful in the shape of
womanhood has been near the prisoner. Then imagine
the opening of a door by which, while the captivity is
maintained, its rigour is alleviated by the talk of yourg
ladies. . Then try to think with what a boyish joy, what
beating of the heart, what pleasant excitation of the nerves,
this Recluse would creep nervously down the stairs every
morning, and knock at the door of the room which held
those angels of a better world. He dressed with tho greatest
He manipulated his long white hair, letting it sweep
back from his brow with the flow of an ancient Gallic warrior.
He covered his long fingers with rings. He decorated him-
self with diamond studs. He made up compliments, writing
them out beforehand, and studying how to bring up the
conversation so as to drag them in. He acted over again in
his imagination what he had said in the morning. He eren,
in his ardour, neglected his dinner, and made for two or
three successive days a repast perfectly simple.
The change in his life coincided with the severance of his
connection with Mr. Carew. The rude, low-bred, and pain
fully true words spoken by his secretary gave his nervous
system a great shock. To be sure, Dicky, whose manner was
truculent and even threatening, had abstained from personal
violence, a thing to which Mr. Lilliecrip had an almost
sacerdotal objection; but his criticism put him, for the time,
out, of conceit with the Memoirs.
Men's imaginations take hold of strange forecasts. Mr.
Lilliecrip, obscure in life, pictured to himself a posthumous
glory equal to that of Mr. Pepys, and second only to Saint
Simon. He was, so far, like Chauncey Chacomb, who desired
to be remembered after death as the collector of the Chacomb
Museum. The doctor, on the other hand, was contented with
the good opinion of his contemporaries. Their praise, he was
wont to say, leads to pudding.

WITH HARP AND CROWN.
But what pleasure could a writer of Memoirs feel in work
which even a common scribe and quill-driver like Dicky, his
late secretary, declared was too stupid to be read, too clumsy
not to be detected as an impudent forgery? Undoubtedly,
too, it was a forgery; though, by the practice of long years,
Mr. Lilliecrip had come to regard it as a genuine series of
reminiscences. There are liars who have reached to such a
point that they cannot speak the truth-imaginative liars;
liars of principle, habit, method; liars who like to believe
that they are telling the truth, who build a palace for their
soul and live in it always, adding to it, decorating and im-
proving it. Mr. Lilliecrip was one of these. Just now, after
the rude assault of his secretary, the palace walls seemed too
much knocked about for the place to be habitable, and he felt
like one who has been turned out into the cold.
And so he basked in the sunshine of the first floor. He
appeared every morning as radiant as Tithonus refreshed by
kissing Aurora's rosy fingers. He brought compliments with
him-good old-fashioned compliments with a fine crusted
flavour—these the girls laughed at; flowers, which they liked,
and early fruit—things which no one can ever refuse. And
yet, as he felt with irritation, he made no headway in their
good graces. The man, callous as regards others, was morbidly
sensitive about himself. He felt what was thought of him;
he almost knew what was said of him. If he had overheard
Adie's opinion of him, he could not have been more certain
what it was.
This it was.
" Marion,” said the young observer, “I don't like him. He
was a gentleman once, I suppose; but I don't like him. He
is never real. His compliments are foolish, and his preten-
sions ridiculous. Considered as a Hermit, he is a disappoint-
ment. Hermits ought to have dirty faces and to wear sergu
gowns, with nothing between that and their tender skins, to
punish them for being hermits—the nasty creatures! Mr.
Lilliecrip is dressed like a young gentleman of Regent-street.
Lilliecrip, too-what a name! My dear, he has done some-
thing."
He did not impress her at all. She only laughed at his
magnificent talk, and almost openly mimicked him. He saw
that she criticized him. As he spoke, moved, and dressed
pour l'effet, it was natural that he should be on the watch
perpetually to see what sort of effect was produced. He

liked to walk up and down the room, a habit which his
long years of solitude had given him, just as if he had been
in the Zoological Gardens. At the table by the window
Marion was at work with her water-colours; Adie in her
chair, at work on some of her own devices. Between them
'se walked and talked, generally of himself; but always in a
guarded manner, as if there was something to hide.
“My old friend, Lord Cardigan," he began once, naming
an officer whose exploits the younger generation know only
by hearsay—“my old friend, Lord Cardigan, once advised
me seriously to cultivate Art as an occupation-of course,
not as a profession.'
“ Dear me!” said Adie, in her flippant way.
" That is a
very interesting anecdote. Tell us another, Mr. Lilliecrip;
and then I will try to remember how I once sewed a button
cuff.”
Ah, yes--very good indeed, my dear young lady, very
good. It reminds me of poor D'Orsay's best days."
"Mr. Lilliecrip, what do you go about under false pretences
for ?" asked Adie.
“My dear!" expostulated Marion.
“I mean, of course, why do you live in a wretched house
like this, where the world never comes ?”
“Because the world never comes here," said the Solitary,
with a sigh.
“I am sure I wish it did," Adie went on. “ But the world
is a very pleasant world to those who have money. You have
money, I suppose, Mr. Lilliecrip?"
Money, yes, and—and-rank,” he added, as if the word
dropped out unawares.
Really! are you Sir John Lilliecrip, Baronet, or General
Sir Arthur Lilliecrip, K.C.B., or Baron Lilliecrip, or Earl
Lilliecrip, or the Marquis of Lilliecrip, or His Grace the Duke
of Lilliecrip? You can't be His Royal Highness Prince
Lilliecrip-can you ?”
Mr. Lilliecrip made no answer to this sally, which visibly
disconcerted him.
“Adie, dear," murmured Marion.
But her sister went on.
“Tell me why you wear that ribbon in your batton-holo,
Mr. Lilliecrip?"
He had assumed a slender scarlet ribbon, like that word

“It is nothing," he answered, pretending to hide it. "A
small personal distinction, bestowed upon me in 1848 oy the
Emperor of Austria, on the field of battle.”
“Dear me!” said Adie, who did not believe a word of it.
“ I like to hear about battles. Tell me the history. Did he
make you kneel, and knight you on the spot ?”
He gravely shook his head.
“Pardon me; it is an affair of history. I can hardly, even
to gratify a lady's desire, tell the story without revealing-
revealing what it is best to keep concealed.
“Can you not understand, young ladies," he went on-by
this time he was standing in the window, where a reflection
of the sunlight from an opposite window fell full upon his
face and head, and lit him up with a kind of aureole "can
you not understand, without putting me to the pain of ex-
plaining, and thereby uncovering what it has been my fixed
resolution to conceal, the sad history of a deceived and dis-
appointed life? Suffice it that I found, at the age of
forty-late, you may say—the world a mockery, its pleasures
& vanity, the profession of friendship hollow, the vows of
women false.”
“I cannot understand that at all,” said Adie; “ that is,
speaking for myself. I find the world's pleasures charming,
and I believe women are always true. Marion, dear, can you
understand that the pleasures of the world are vain? You
see, Mr. Lilliecrip, we have known so few of them that it
would not be fair to judge. When I have gone on a little
way farther, say half as far as you, I might possibly agree

you; but at present I can only say that I do not under.
stand it at all. It seems to me siagey to talk in this
way."
Mr. Lilliecrip was staggered. The girl's way of catching
him
up in an elaborated sentence put him out. He leaned
against the window for a moment, and considered.
There was a woman in the street below, staring up at the
window, with haggard look. A woman in rags—a dis-
reputable woman. She came with hurried steps into the
street; but when she arrived at the door of No. 15, she
hesitated, stopped, and crossed over to the other side. Then
she walked up and down, gazing with all her eyes at the
windows of the first floor-those of Marion's lodgings.
It was a bright morning; the sunshine was reflected across
the street upon one of Marion's windows. There, presently,
this unquiet watcher—for she walked up and down, talking

to herself, clenching her hand, and clutching her wretched
shawl round her wasted figure-saw a head appear, clad in
long, white hair, and standing out in the sunshine as if it
were a silver head set in ebony.
When she saw it, she started; then she looked again,
bending forward and straining her eyes, as one who wants to
catch at every vantage point of sight. The head turned a
little, and she saw the full face for a moment;
the figure
straightened itself, and she saw the slope of the shoulders.
Then, like a mad dog, she ran up and down the kerbstone
in misery, with eyes full of rage and terror.
And lastly, as if she had no more control of her limbs,
she shrieked aloud, and running across the street, dashed
open the door-which was, as usual, left ajar—and rushed
the stairs to Marion's room.
“Let me try to make myself clearer," Mr. Lilliecrip was
going on, in those clear, calm tones which convinced Dicky
Carew against his better knowledge that the man was truthful.
“ Vou are both far too young and inexperienced to feel the dis-
appointments of a man who was for twenty years in search of
Wealth and rank; family connections and—if I
may say so-hereditary intellect; accomplishments and-if
1 may be allowed to speak of it-personal distinctions—the
Victoria Cross, the Iron Cross, the Eagle of Russia, the Cross
of Maria Theresa, are a few of my rewards. All these things,
jear to most people, to me were vain. What are they, indeed,
compared with a disappointed heart? In diplomacy, I looked
for truth and honour, and found falsehood and treachery; in
war, I looked for courage and found cowardice; in friendship,
I looked for devotion and found self-interest; in love, I lookea
for fidelity and found betrayal. Everywhere self, everywhere
luxury, everywhere interest, everywhere falsehood. England,
ny native England, where is the ancient virtue gone?”
" That sounds
very pretty,” said Adie.
“ But suppose you
had started like me, without expecting too much. As for
inyself, I look for nice people, and I pray for money in order
to put myself in their way."
There was a step outside the door, which Marion heard,
and, öfting her head, waited for a knock; but none camo.
Had no one spoken, they might have heard a loud, quick
breathing outside. But they could not guess the wild passion
that held the woman there motionless till she could bear it
down low enough to find her voice again.

" It was my leading principle through an active life," went
on this pompous moralist,“ to seek out Virtue. Rarcly have
I found it. At last, after repeated trials and disappointments,
I resolved to quit the world for which I had toiled in vain,
and endeavour to find in solitude such happiness as my
meditations alone might give."
" Meditation and mutton cutlets," said Adie. "I have
heard they go well with claret. It all sounds like a piece of
an old novel.”
“Young lady, forbear to scoff at a man who has seen
Courts, who knows the roar of battle, who has lived in cities,
and who, with all his experience, can proudly say with Bayard
that he is a knight sans peur et sans reproche.”
He delivered himself in measured speech, raising his figure
to the full height of six feet two as he spoke, and folding his
arms with an attitude which spoke volumes. He swelled out,
too, like the frog in the fable, and looked bigger.
Adie felt abashed at the rebuke and at the aspect of the
godlike man. Still, in her frivolous way, she might have
answered, had not the door been flung open. There stood
the woman—the same whom she remembered seeing with
Marion-standing tall, defiant, and threatening. Her eyes
bright blue eyes, the same colour as Adie's—were fixed upon
Mr. Lilliecrip. She neither moved nor spoke for a space.
Only her right arm slowly lifted, as if mechanically, Madame
Rachel, a gipsy woman in a rage, a Hindoo whose husband
has eaten her cakes, an Arab woman who is having an alter-
cation with another lady of the same camp--alone could equal
that gesture of unbounded and unstudied rage. Her lips were
parted; her nostrils dilated; the flush of wrath upon her
sunken cheeks filled them out, and made her look ten yearı
younger.
Marion started from her chair, and placed herself between
the woman and her sister.
“You dare to come here !” she cried—“ here, of all places
in the world ?”
“Hush, Marion Revel!-hush !" the other said.
“ Don't
be afraid. It is not to you I come.
Tell me-tell me -why
is he here? What is that man doing in this room? My God,
what fresh misery is he preparing? Marion Revel, tell me
before I kill him!"
At the voice of the woman, at the name she spoke, Mr.
Lelliecrip seemed to shrink together and collapse. He did

aut change colour, because his ghastly pallor could not well
grow whiter ; but he grew suddenly six inches shorter of
stature, and ten years older. His hair seemed to lose its silky
flow, and fell over his face; his eyes grew crowsfooted, his
cheeks wrinkled, his hands trembled. The youthful coat ho
wore looked like some horrid mockery.
“Tell me what he is doing here, Marion Revel-if not for
your own sake, tell me for hers."
She pointed to Adrienne, who cowered with terror behind
her sister.
“Revel!” murmured the man, with chattering teeth.
"Ay, Revel! You ought to know the name well—no one
better. What have you to do here--and with his daughters ?
Yes, Captain Revel's daughters. And who am I? Do you
remember me? Do I ever cross your thoughts ? Am I
changed? Am I wasted, worn, and miserable?"
“ You are, Carry."
The answer came like a whisper from dry and trembling
lips.
"Carry! Yes, Carry! Marion, do you know now who this
man is ? You do not. I see you do not. Perhaps you cannot
even guess.
But

know-oh!

know what I and

able, wretched victim."
She passed, in her swift way, from lamenting to threatening.
"I told you, Marion, that I should meet him some day. I
prayed for this, and that makes the second prayer answered.
I told you I should have my revenge."
The man who looked on, shivered, shook, and trembled,
trying to stop the torrent of her words.
"“ Come upstairs, Carry. Not here. For God's sake, come
away with me.”
Marion,” the woman went on, “I came to tell you
that
the boy is dying. Better 80-better so. I will have my
revenge by the death-bed of his son."
He shrant: back, as she stepped towards him, with a pitiable
terror and horror.
“I did not know," he murmured—“I did not know who
they were. Miss Revel, I give you my word of honour—".
“ His word of honour! His word of honour! Come with
me. Both the parents shall be at the bedside of their dying
child. That is proper—that is right. The boy shall give you

Marion, bewildered as she was, felt pity for the poor wretch,
so utterly broken down, and at the mercy of this woman.
“Have pity on him," she said. "He is old-and-
and_”
“Marion Revel, you are a fool. Shall I nurse my revenge
for fifteen years, and lose it at last ? Shall I suffer want and
misery, shame and disgrace, and forgive him when I meet
him after all this time ? Come”-she seized him by the arm-
“come!”
Then she turned, and saw Adrienne clinging to her sister,
frightened. Suddenly her whole face changed. She let the
man's arm drop, and, with a bitter cry, threw herself at the
girl's feet.
“No, Marion-suffer me-only this once in all my life.
Never again-oh! me-never again! Both your hands, my
pretty--both your hands, my darling; both your hands for
me to hold and kiss—and kiss. Oh, Adrienne - little Adie-
little, little Adie!-do you remember, Marion? And she never
knew, did she ?-never knew. What shall I say to her—what?
She is as baautiful as the day; she shall be as bappy as a
princess; she shall have every blessing that the Lord has
to give her; and she shall be-she shall be-good.”
She went on like a madwoman, crying, talking, and kissing
Adie's hands all the time. The girl yielded passively. The
tears stood in her eyes ; but they nright have been tears of
surprise, sympathy, or anything. She understood nothing,
and suspected nothing. The miserable Hermit stood irreso-
lute. There was a moment when he might have made his
escape, when Mrs. Spenser was crying over Adie's hands.
He lost that moment, looking at the woman with eyes of fore-
boding. All the uprightness was gone out of the man; he
seemed shrunken into the semblance of a terrified and beaten
When it was too late, and her passion had somewhat
spent itself, he bethought himself of the door, and stealthily
moved in that direction.
Mrs. Spenser sprang from Adie, dashed away the tears
from her eyes, and seized her prisoner once more with a
clutch of steel.
“Marion,” she whispered, quickly, “I have not told her-
never tell her. Make up something. Forgive me. Come,
sir, come-we have something to see together.”
She dragged him, resistless in her wrath, from the room.
“ Marion," said Adie, tremulously, “what is it? What

does it all mean? Who is she, Marion ?" the girl repeated.
“Why did she kiss my hand? Why did she look so wild ?”
But Marion made no reply. Her cheek was pale, and her
lips dry. She knew. She knew without needing to be told,
all that it meant. The man with the silky, white hair-the
man whose face had inspired her with a distrust at first
sight, was he who had brought ruin and wretchedness upon
her father's happiness.
And the woman ?
She soothed her sister as best she could. It was her great
comfort, for herself, that Adie had no suspicion, not the
slightest suspicion, of the truth. She was only frightened
and curious.
"Is she mad, Marion ?"
“ Yes, dear, yes. She will not come back again. Adie,
you are not afraid to be left alone, are you? I must go and
look after that poor creature. Never ask me who she is,
dear. Never speak of her, or think of her again. If you
are nervous, go and sit in Mr. Owen's room. He is in the
school, and you are quite safe there. Don't be frightened,
dear. The poor woman has had a terrible life, and a fearful
punishment for sin. The wretched man was, it appears, her
tempter. Do not think harshly of her, Adie. I must go to
her lodgings,"
Marion found the unfortunate Hermit planted by the
pallet of the boy, just where Mrs. Spenser placed him. His
hands hung down his side; he looked sometimes at the
woman, sometimes at the boy, and sometimes at the wretched
room.
His face brightened when he saw Marion.
Don't let them murder me,” he moaned. “ I will make
expiation; I will pay something every week.”
The mother was attending to the boy, still with her wild
eyes and shaking limbs. She seemed to take no notice of
the man, but if he moved she placed herself at once between
hinn and the door.
Marion turned to the boy. He lay back upon the pillow,
his cheek pale and thin, his frame wasted. Death was
written, so plain that even his mother could see, in his bright
and fixed eyes. lIis lips played with a thin, sweet smile, and
his face wore the intensified, peculiar expression of absolute
vacancy, which yet was not quite idiotic, but even pleasing.
He did not belong to the world--he never had belonged to

the world. There was no tie with humanity, except that with
bis mother, which it would pain the boy to break. There
was no thought of the next world to excite in him the tears
of terror, or those of a grateful trust. He was an infant
still, although of fourteen years, on whom the ills of the
world had passed over innocuously, because he did not know
they were ills. He was that creature whom the Arab has
ever regarded with respect, and the Christian, until the last
few years, with loathing-a boy with half a brain. Nature
had been very kind to him. He was to live for fourteen years
only, and then to die. She gave him the gifts of gentleness,
sympathy, and love.
“ Look at him, Marion," said the poor mother. “Do you
think he is looking easier ?"
“Jem,” said Marion, kneeling beside the child, “ you know
me, don't you? You have seen me here before.”
He smiled. He would have nodded his head, but was too
weak.
“I know," he murmured. “I told you the hymn-
*Adama Neave they turned him out,
'Cos he knocked the apples down.
Mother, give me an orange. I say"-he turned feebly to
Marion—“ don't you wish you was ill? It's jolly to get
oranges all day long, and all night too. I should like to see
the boys again. There's one boy-tell him—"
He stopped and coughed.
“ Yes," said Marion. “ What shall we tell that boy? He
is a friend of yours.
“Tell him," said Jem-the words were ferocious, but the
meek mannrr of utterance redeemed their ferocity—“ tell
him that he owes me for two Globes and an Echo, and if he
won't pay me, I'll cut his liver out. It's twopence altogether."
This seemed to Marion a poor way of starting for the next
world: but the boy's childish face belied his sanguinary
threats.
They watched—the three of them-while he had another fit
of coughing, which seemed to tear him in pieces. Presently
the fit ceased, and he sank back. His mother held his hand,
and began, always with one eye on her prisoner, a sort of
trembling monologue.
“When he was only a day old," she said, “I wished I was
dead, and the child as well, till I felt those little fingers at

my breast. Marion, I never felt so with the other two
not quite so. It was for this boy that I gave up my hus-
band, and my home, and-and-you, little Marion, that I
loved, only not my own. It was for him-for him. Ah!
and he will never know what I gave up. He will never
learn the madness of his mother and the wickedness of his
father."
Mr. Lilliecrip moved uneasily, and in the direction of the
dɔor. A gesture from the woman stopped him, and he
stood at the end of the bed, looking miserably, not at the
boy, but at the woman who had found him out. His dignity
was gone; his figure was bent; his bearing was cowed. It
seemed impossible that so great a change should happen in
so short a time.
“ Look at him, Marion. Look at this miserable creature.
He has not even the common courage to brazen it out. And
it was with him—with him that I ran away from the best
husband in the world, and the dearest children with this.
man. Look at him well. He was handsome, after his kind.
He could do things. He wore his uniform gallantly. He
was not so clever as my husband, and I was not afraid of
him. I was a fool-oh, heavens, what a fool I was !-and
he persuaded me.
My boy,” she went on, after a while, “who was your
mother?”
He was breathing slowly, and with difficulty. The cold
dews rested on his forehead, and his eyes were closed.
She was a lady,” he replied, slowly, and with pain.
“And who was your father?”
He was a gentleman.”
“What else, my boy?”
Ob, hush !” said Marion. “ For pity's sake, spare
him.
The boy is—"

a quiet sleep; and then, perhaps, he will get better. Say,

The man at the foot of the bed trembled in all his limbs.
“He was more than a scoundrel,” said his mother. “ * Plenty
of greater men are scoundrels. He was a coward -a convicted
coward. He was a disgrace to the cloth he bore, and to the
army he belonged to. He refused to go-the only officer in
the service who ever did it-he actually refused-look at him

well, Marion !-to go out on trench duty. They tried to hide
it in the regiment; but I knew it-oh! I learned it. Only
think, Marion, that for this miserable creature I lost my all!"
Marion was wiping the lips and forehead of the dying boy,
and hardly listened to the
poor
frantic woman.
“Jem," she whispered—“Jem, dear boy. Say after me, my
boy. Say, 'Our Father.'”
“That's my father-I'll kill him," the boy replied, in
sullen words. " When I see him, I'll kill him. Mother says
I am to.”
“Say, then— God help and forgive us every one.'
“God help and forgive us every one,” the boy repeated,
dutifully. "What is your name?” he asked, feebly.
“Marion.”
"I'm Rickety Jem. Mother!"
His mother seemed stupefied. She sat stupidly gazing at
her boy, trying by some superhuman effort to realize the full
bearing of things. But she could not. It seemed like some
dreadful nightmare. The years
rolled
away.
She was with
Marion, but Marion was a little girl. She was with this man,
but he was a brave and gallant officer. She was-but no
the dream would go no farther.
“Mother,” said Jem.
His senses swam about him. His
eyes and lips lit up
moment in a smile.
“ One of the boys,” he began.
But he stopped short, laid his cheek on Marion's hand, and
ceased to breathe.
Only Marion noticed that the boy was dead. But in a
minute the mother's heart misgave her, and she stooped to
kiss the boy. Then, with a bitter cry, she fell upon the body,
kissing it a thousand times in her agony.
When Marion looked round again Mr. Lilliecrip was gone.
He had slipped away at the first relaxation of the woman's
watchfulness. He crept noiselessly down the stairs, and he
i fled. The first thing that occurred to him was that he ought
to get a hat; for Mrs. Spenser had dragged him through the
streets hatless, an object of pity and derision to the world.
He had his purse in his pocket. Provided with this necessary,
he turned east, and, with furtive steps and much looking
behind him to see if he was followed, he began a pilgrimage
to some place-he knew not where—where he might be safe.

He marched, with downcast eyes and stooping figure—a
strange figure-drawing the eyes of all after him, through
the crowded streets. He was unused to walk abroad for so
many years that he ran against people, got over crossings by
a kind of miracle, drew upon himself the imprecations of
cabmen and the warnings of policemen. But he kept on. He
was so terrified that he could think of only one thing—the
best way of escape, and only one way-escape to a foreign
country. He would go down to the docks; he would take
the first ship which was going to sail; he would go to
America. Other purpose he had none-only to escape
from
those dreadful eyes of the woman he had wronged, from the
memory of the scene he had just witnessed, from any future
consequences that might arise. We do not, unhappily, repent
of our sins; we only dread the consequences.
Then he found himself at the docks, and further flight
seemed, for the moment, impossible.
He went to a hotel—there are some good hotels at the East-
end of London--and ordered a private room. It was getting
on for evening. He ordered dinner as well. And then he sat
down, and began to think.
“ It was an awkward position," he said—“ most awkward.
I do not know that I can remember a more remarkable situa-
tion in any novel. The old love-she-the old love, and
actually her daughter, with the step-daughter-elements, if
one had only gone a little farther, of an excellent French
novel. Devilish unlucky thing her finding me out! And
most disagreeable business that in her lodgings. However,
it has forced me to leave my retreat. I will go back to the
world. Not London—no, not there. In some place where I
am not known—where there can be no chance of my being
found out again, where the name of Lillingworth has never
been heard."
He rose abruptly, and walked up and down the room.
“ Curse the Criniean war! Curse my own folly in going!
I might have sold out-lots of fellows sold out. I might
have exchanged-lots of fellows exchanged. I might have
come home on urgent private affairs- lots of fellows did.
But I must needs go in for glory. And if I had done--if I
had obeyed orders, I might have been snug, and been a
general with a reputation by this time.
“Poor Carry! she's gone off terribly. Fancy my over
being in love with that little doll. I suppose I must have

devilish afraid Revel would call me out. He didn't. Why
didn't he? He wasn't afraid.
“And that's his daughter!-that splendid beauty; that
glorious girl, with the deep brown eyes, that go through a
man like a gimlet. Gad! and if it had not been for the
cursed woman's interference, she might have been mine. We
would have gone to Italy, she and I together, and practised
Art. We would have lived at Spezzia-ah! I know it. I
was there once with—with one of them, and looked over the
blue waters of the bay, and drank the Chianti wine. Oh,
what a chance to lose !"
He rang the bell.
“Waiter. If you have any curaçoa, give me a small glass.
Dinner at six, if you can.
And a bottle of Piper's Sec, if you
have any. None of your sweet stuff. No, not a pint-a
whole bottle.
“I am devilish low to-night. This curaçoa is not dry
enough, but it is better than nothing. Poor Carry! she's
like a devil to look at. Women are, when they go off in that
shocking way, and neglect their dress.
“ Hang her! Why should I trouble my head about her
at all? What is she to me, or I to her, now? It is all past
and gone. Let me forget the past. I am fifty-five years of
age. I have ten years more of enjoyment before me, and
then ten more of care and misery. I will go to America. If
I don't like it, I will come back to Europe. Waiter, let me
have dinner as soon as you can. I shall sleep here; and
waiter, get me a telegraph form."
He telegraphed to his lawyers; went out to the docks,
hard by;
found a steamer-the Triton-going to sail at twelve
the next morning; returned to his house ; had a good dinner;
bought a novel, and read it with great enjoyment; went to
bed, and dreamed of Marion Revel.
Not a thought of the woman he had ruined, or of the
wrecked boy, his son. The woman was one instrument out
of many which had subserved his selfish purposes. Why
should he feel for her ?
The next day he was steaming down the Pool, on board
the Triton. In his pocket were letters of credit. In his hand
was another novel.

struck him with terror, for that also was the face of Carry.

“Good God !” he cried. “Can I never escapo her ?”
And hurried back to the after-deck. His enjoyment was
gone.
For the young man was Fred Revel, his fellow-passenger.
While Captain Lillingworth-we may as well give him his
real name-was drinking brandy and water, and laughing
over the novel, Mrs. Spenser was wandering up and down the
streets. Not in search of him-he was not in her mind at
all, save as some refrain to a song, or as a song which gets
possession of the brain, and keeps singing itself over and
over again, always in discord with the thoughts that pass
backward and forwards.
Presently she wandered down to the Embankment-uncon-
scious where she was, or how she got there.
She was past thinking-she could only remember. Her
life passed before her in easy stages, beginning with the brief
courtship, when the grave young widower asked her--her, the
girl who thought of nothing but balls—to be his wife, and
made her believe that she was clever.
“I wasn't," she said. “I was only silly-only silly."
Then she thought of her marriage. That took her a long
time, because it was a happy thing to think of. Then she
remembered the life in London, and at Portsmouth, where
her husband got a ship. Then the quiet life in the country,
while he was on the Mediterranean. . Then the birth of the
boy. Then the captain's return, and the coming of the little
girl; and then-then-ah! then!
She was tired. There were no seats. The Embankment
was deserted, because it was a rainy night. She went and
sat down on the steps that overhang the water. The tide
was rushing up through the arches of Waterloo Bridge before
her with a loud swirl and sweep, tearing past the granite wall
by which she sat, foaming against the steps, rushing inland,
as if to escape some pursuer. There were lights beyond the
river, which were reflected in the water; and as she looked
across, there seemed to stand out upon the black water a face
which the poor distracted creature knew too well.
It
gave her a shock at first; but in a minute or two she
grew accustomed to the sight of it.
And then she began to grow rational.
“My boy is dead,” she began, speaking to the phantom.
“I have been very miserable-almost sta ving, except for
your darahter, who is the best woman in all the world.

I did it-never once. Oh! forgive me. I found him out for
what he was the day after I left you. I knew then—but it
was too late—what I had given up. I was so silly-so silly;
and you thought I could understand when you talked about
books. Oh, God! I was so silly! And I got tired and cross
because you would not see how stupid I was! And then he
came, and then-oh, forgive me! Husband-say you forgive
me!”
She stretched out her arms. The waves were flowing over
her feet, but she felt nothing. Something seemed to lift her
from the cold stones on which she sat, and to lay her softly
in the water, which bore her swiftly—the face beckoning her
always-past steps and granite walls, under the dark arches
of the bridges, by barges and steamboats, rolling her over
and over, beating her face and washing her limbs, carrying
her, cold and insensible, to the land where her husband had
long forgiven her.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
The doctor came back to town thoughtful, but not, on the
whole, depressed. It was true that the rightful heir was come
back to his own. That was bad for himself and his succession.
On the other hand, it was by the most blessed-by the most
providential--arrangement of time and circumstance that the
young prince should have arrived in the very nick of time,
while Chauncey's demonstrative gratitude was in open evi-
dence. There was very little fear, after this, that he would
ever have to give an account of his stewardship at all; or,
any account, then such a one as would be best in his owr.
interests. Two courses were open to him. He might simply
declare that the Chacomb revenues had been spent on the
Chacomb estate; or it was an alternative of some moral
importance-he might tell the actual truth. He might say,
“I have received the rents. I have kept a careful and accu-
rate statement of all incomings and outgoings. I have seen
that my cousin was looked after, and the place properly kept
up. I have borrowed four or five thousand for my own pur.
poses, for which I am ready to give interest, and to pay it off
in a reasonable time. And the rest is all lying in the bank,
or invested in the funds, in my name, as the trustee.” No legal

documents; no nasty binding conditions; nothing but the
word of a gentleman and a cousin.
“And, by gad!” he said, after an hour's cogitation in the
train, “ there is nothing in the world like honesty. I will
write to Gerald when I get back to town, and send him the
real statement."
This he eventually did, with such heightening of favourable
details as even the goddess herself, fresh from the well, could
not avoid. The result was as satisfactory as he could wish;
for Gerald in person assured him that he valued his services
to the owner of Chacomb at far more than the small sum
(this remarkable young man called it “the small sum”)
which his father had lent him—the doctor was careful to set
the facts so as to make it appear that everything was done
by permission of the squire, after careful consideration and
that no demand would ever be made upon him for the interest,
Travellers and colonials, when they come home to England,
are apt, as is well known, to be free of money, not rightly
knowing its value or the difficulty of getting it. No doubt
Gerald has learned better by this time.
The accounts which the doctor roughly drew up in his own
mind-he knew the value of a correct statement, from reading
Balzac-formed, when set down, a remarkable record of honest
dealing. There was, first, the sum total of the rents for four
years--a trifle of fifteen thousand pounds. From this sum
was to be deducted the expenses of keeping up Chacomb-
amounting to no more, with the reduced establishment, than
fifteen hundred a year. That left nine thousand pounds.
Now, of this sum he professed to have borrowed four thou-
sand, and invested the rest. He had not, it was certain,
embezzled, defrauded, made use of trust money, or done any
of the things by which men sometimes come to grief, He
had simply being a self-appointed trustee, answerable to no
one, and acting in an inofficial manner-taken the liberty of
borrowing some of the money, and investing the rest to what
he considered the best advantage. And he had prospered
greatly-so greatly that, although to repay the advances he
had taken to start himself on his successful career he would
have to sacrifice nearly all his earnings ; yet he felt that he
could do it, with a sure confidence that a few years more of
work would put him in a position to retire from active
practice. He might, too, and did, charge in his account for
all those journeys undertaken in his cousin's interest.

The moral of this novel, as, no doubt, everybody has found
out—it is absurd to append a moral in set terms—is that
prosperity, and not adversity at all, is needed to develop the
higher virtues of mankind. Some people have foolishly taught
that self-denial and maceration are the only virtues. Rubbish!
The most delicate flowers are fostered by the warmest sun-
shine. Generosity, measured by a sense of justice, prudence,
thrift, common sense all these fair blossoms are produced
by prosperity; and they are nipped by the cursed east winds
of iil-fortune. In the old days, the doctor borrowed, spent,
gave, lent, and scorned the qualities which make collective
man strong. In this his wealthy time, he was actually pro-
posing to charge his cousin all his journeys to Barnstaple and
back. Now the virtue of thrift is very great. It makes Eng.
land what it is. And it is possessed far more largely by the
rich than by the poor.
It is not to be disguised that he was strongly tempted to
evade the moral obligation of truth, and to enact the part of
the unjust steward. Gerald's return was, in itself, an act at
which he might fairly show some indignation. He had so
long been irresponsible, that it was almost intolerable to re-
sign his guardianship. And, besides, he had so accustomed
himself to regard the silence of Gerald as indicating his death,
that the rulings of Providence appeared a personal injury. It
must be marked, as a clear advance in the moral nature of
the doctor, that he shrank from the temptation as a dis-
honour; whereas, in his days of adversity, the unregenerate
times, such a temptation might-one is not quite sure-might
have been considered from the standpoint of risk. But, when
the train rolled in at Waterloo terminus, the doctor's brow
was clear, and his resolution firm. His brow had smoothed
itself out, and he had resumed his ordinary aspect of calm
and thoughtful prosperity.
But there was another person to be considered. How
should he act to Marion ?
He dismissed Gerald and the accounts from his thoughts,
and turned them in the direction of Marion. The doctor had
at least one gift—that of being able to shift his mind. As
with all clear-headed men, bis subjects arranged themselves
in pigeon-holes. Marion and Gerald were together in one,
separate in two others ; Chauncey and his housekeeper to-
Sether in another; Gerald and the future auditing of accounts
iu a third. And so on.

Marion. She had to be told of Gerald's return. Should be
tell her?
It seemed as if a crisis of his fate was approaching. For
four years everything had prospered with him. If he bor-
rowed money, it returned to him with interest wherever he
invested it. If he started a speculation, it succeeded. If he
wrote a book, it sold, and brought him credit. He was
carried for four years along the tide of fortune, almost with.
out effort of his own, save to guide his craft. All around him
he saw the barks of other men—dismasted, rudderless, foun-
dering, even keel uppermost-at best, making slow and un-
certain headway, like a Thames barge when the flow is well-
nigh spent. And now—the heir returned, the girl whom he
had hoped to marry lost to him, and the borrowed money all
to be repaid.
He resolved to see Marion that same evening.
He dined at a restaurant-things looking a little brighter
after dinner—and drove home to Adelaide-street. Among
the letters lying on his table, which he tossed over to be read
the next day, was one which he seized and opened.
"I had forgotten that matter altogether," he said.
The letter was from a well-known artist.
“I am glad to tell you that your protégée's picture is
accepted, and will be, if I can manage it, well hung. Come
to the private view and see it, if you can find time. My
opinion of it is vastly improved. There is force in the con-
ception; and, if some of the drawing is not too firm, it is
correct. I do not think that the young lady will make a
great artist, but she has gifts. The picture will sell. When
you dine with me next, tell me all about her."
“By Jove!" said the doctor. “If the news had only
arrived before Gerald's return. Perhaps it is not yet too
late. Gratitude is a strong passion with women; as for men,
they mostly wonder what it means. I will go at once.”
He went, taking the letter with him, and found Marion alone,
playing in the twilight such old music as she remembered
reminiscences which brought peace to her anxious heart.
She looked up as he entered, with those deep eyes of hers,
which always went straight to the doctor's heart. Adio's
eyes were larger and brighter, but they never moved him
they were too bright and shallow.

“I have brought you news,” he said.
“Is it good news, Dr. Chacomb ?” she asked, with a little
laugh. "It is such a long time since we heard anything
good.'
Yes; it is very good news. I have a letter from
the Academician. May I read it to you? No—take the
letter, and read it yourself. Shall I light your candles ?”
' No, thank you. I like to sit in the twilight. And I can
read it by the light of the street gas.”
She took it to the window; and when she brought it back
to the doctor, he noticed that her eyes were full of tears.
“ Poor Fred !" she murmured. “ If this had happened a
week ago, perhaps he need not have
gone
abroad.”
“Nothing ever happens when it ought,” said the doctor,
thinking over his own affairs. “People and things always
arrive just too late, or just too early. If it's an even chance,
as actuaries tell us, when a thing happens, I don't understand
why it always happens wrong. We must not build too much
upon the picture, Miss Revel. You have got into the Aca-
demy—that is a great thing. We will hope you will sell
your picture, and a great many others. But all the pictures
are not sold.”
“No. I understand. Only”—she turned a face which
looked, in the new light of happiness and hope, beautiful,
even more than with the beauty of youth—"only, let me
hope. Oh, Dr. Chacomb! do you think they will abuse the
picture in the
papers
?"
“That's quite another thing. Art critics are perhaps the
worst people of any that pretend to do work. I've known lots;
and I never knew one—not one-on whom I could depend for
a good judgment of a picture. They get up the slang—that's
easy enough. You have got to find the proper adjectives. If
you criticize a portrait, say it is 'wrought for strength and
brilliancy. Lug in the words arbitrary and self-assertive.

If you criticize a landscape, you must have

for Art. Do not worry your head about what they say. And
as to that, I can get hold of some of them.”
“Oh, but I should like an independent judgment.'
“That is just what you shall have. That is to say, no one's
mind shall be set against you. Remember that the Art critic

two of these gentlemen into the right groove for admiration.'
It always grated on the girl's mind, this constant assump-
tion on the part of Dr. Chacomb that everything in the world
was done for some personal motive. He spoke out of the
depths of his own knowledge of evil; she out of her belief in
good.
“I will leave it all to you,” she said. “How pleased Adie
will be! And, oh! Dr. Chacomb, how grateful I am to you
for all your kindness!"
She half held out her hand, but withdrew it again with a
blush, which the twilight of the room prevented the doctor
from seeing
He was silent for a moment. For a great battle was raging
in his soul.
Marion,” he began presently, and in a strange, hoarse
voice—“I have worked for you, not without hope of a reward.
You know me now. I do not pretend to be what I am not.
My life has been that of most adventurers. Pirates and buc.
caneers in all ages live in much the same way. They fight,
drink, sing, gamble, and make love, those who live outside
the world, and do not work in the usual grooves. I was no
better than any of them—perhaps worse than most. But I
passed through it without harm to my name; and for four
years I have left the ranks, as you know. And I love you."
She made no answer.
This great, strong man, who had as much passion in his
soul as any young fellow of five and twenty, seemed to be
taking possession of her, whether she would or no. She
trembled.
He stood over her, as she sat upon her music stool, his
arms half open, as if for her to fall into them; his face, she
could feel, looking down into hers; his eyes lit with that
strange light of love which she had seen once, and only once,
before, and remembered ever after.
“ Marion !—I feel as if before to-night I only loved you a
little. Now, when I feel that I may lose you altogether, I
love you with all the strength of my heart.

on me!

could watch you, as I have watched you, brave and strong,
working for the others, always contentedly, and not love you u ?
Who could talk with you, day after day, and read in those
eyes of yours their truth and honesty, without loving you ?
Good heavens! could I-I-who know all, go away for years,
and come back, forgetting almost your very existence ?
Marion, love me, too, a little.”
The doctor had his chance, but he threw it away.
Marion
was strangely moved by his sincerity-mesmerized a little,
perhaps, by the impetuous current of his eloquence. She
might perhaps have yielded, and engaged herself to Joseph
Chacomb, but for the unfortunate allusion, covert though it
was, to Gerald's return and Gerald's faithlessness.
She caught his words, and started to her feet, seizing him
by the hand.
“ Dr. Chacomb," she cried,“ tell me what you mean! Why
am I no longer safe? Why do you talk of losing me? Who
is it that has gone away and forgotten? Who-who-who
has come back?"
He did not answer.
She held him tighter; she cried and sobbed hysterically;
she implored him to tell her. As she wept and entreated,
the doctor's face, could one have seen it, exchanged its
passionate eagerness for a look of pity and sympathy, which
suddenly ennobled it. Was all this fidelity to be in vain ?
Was this sweet remembrance of a brief love passage to be
smothered and marred? Was this loving and faithful heart
to be tossed aside like a worthless weed? It seemed too
cruel. His own passion vanished as he saw the quiet, self-
possessed girl shaken out of all reserve by the news that her
lover had returned; his own wrath at the dashing of the cup
from his lip was calmed when he saw her joy, and thought of
her coming misery. For of one thing he was very sure—as
sure as he was that Marion could never love himself-that
Gerald no longer thought of her.

He soothed her, stroking her soft hair with his band, as
one would soothe a child.
"Hush, Marion !-hush, my child! Do not sob, and I will
tell
you
all. Gerald has returned.”
“Oh!-Gerald !–Gerald !-Gerald !" she cried, falling on
her knees in a passion of weeping. “Oh, my love, my sweet-
heart! He has come back to me. Oh, God be thanked !"
“Forgive me,” Joseph Chacomb went on—“I only saw him
last night. He returned unexpectedly. He is at Chacomb
with his father. I came here to-night to ask you once more
If you"
“When will he come to see me?” She cared nothing for
his explanations. She even remembered nothing of his
passionate pleading. She could think of nothing but that
Gerald was returned. “Tell me what he said, and how
he looked, and everything. Sit down, dear Dr. Chacomb.
Let me put your hat on the table for you. You are always so
kind. Will you have candles ? Tell me all about it-exactly
as it happened. Let me picture it all clearly in my own mind.”
“He is well, but has been ill with fever, and looks pale-
older, perhaps, as you would expect; and certainly much
graver. To be sure, there is not much to laugh at in Chacomb
Hall just now. He asked particularly for your address, which
I gave him. He will come to London shortly, and, of course,
will visit
you immediately."
Perhaps he will write,” said Marion. - There may
letter coming for me now.
But then it will be better to see
him. Did he send no message, Dr. Chacomb ? Surely, one
little word.”
“My dear young lady, how was he to know that I should
arrive here to-night; and as for messages, he will bring them
all himself.”
“That is true," Marion replied, thoughtfully. “He will
come here, and we shall talk over the dear old days: of Comb
Leigh and my father; the little cove where my father kept
his boat-did I ever take you for a sail in our own boat,
Dr. Chacomb? She was the neatest little craft, papa used to
say, along all the coast of North Devon. Then there were the
woods, where we used to wander when we were children. In
the spring there were the birds ; in the summer you could
find wild strawberries; and always there was something to
be seen and found. Gerald knew the woods as you would
know a printed book. Oh, what we shall have to recall!

Why, the past four years will seem just like a bad dream, when
he sits here, and we talk about dear, dear Comb Leigh. The
good old days!-they can now come back, can't they? But
we may make some new good days, and they may be better
still.” She stopped, and her eyes filled again with tears.
“ Dr. Chacomb, I am foolish ; förgive me. The

of those things always makes me cry. Adie was too young
: to remember it all so well as I. And how shall I thank you?
What shall I say to you? What can I do to show my grati-

I can do. You were the only friend we had in our trouble.

you, too."

She seemed to have forgotten that, five minutes before, the
man was passionately praying her to forget the past, and to
“Forgive me, Marion,” said the doctor, struck with con.
trition. “Tell Gerald any kind thing you please; but do not
tell him that I tried to win you away from him.”
“Oh, no-oh, no," she laughed and cried. She was folle
foolish in her joy. “All that is past shall be forgotten-all
except kindness and sympathy; those we can never forget,
Gerald and I, never. They will last with us all our lives.
Dr. Chacomb, thank God with me that Gerald is returned.”
“I would rather," thought the doctor afterwards,“ have
considered prayerfully a thanksgiving for the fact that he
could not return any more.”
“Will he come to-morrow? Will he come in the evening,
do you think? Could Fred meet him at the station ? No,
Fred is gone-I forgot that. How shall I meet him ?
What shall I say to him ? Shall Adie be here ?"
“Miss Revel,” said the doctor, solemnly,“ do not let Adie
be present when you see Gerald first. You have never tid
her of your engagement, and how it was broken off—but just
begun. Do not let her be with you. I will take her out in
the afternoon, and bring her home to you in the evening,
after you have seen him. Will you do this ?”
“Will it be best so?" she asked, eagerly. “Do what you
think fittest and best for me, doctor—you are always right.
Parbaps we should meet alone. We shall have much to say.
I shall tell how we have suffered, and what you have done
for us. He will tell me where he has been, and-and--oh!

I do not know what I am saying, I think. It is all so strange
-so strange.”
“ Where is Adie now?"
“She is with Winifred Owen, downstairs, trying to comfort
her. Winifred has lost her lover, too. It was Fred, poor
girl! She has married him secretly."
“Do not tell her yet. Tell her nothing—not even of the
Royal Academy. You shall go with me to the private view,
and see your own picture. Tell Adie that, if she will trust
herself with me, I will take her out to-morrow afternoon.
You can let me give her a new dress, as a reward for the
picture, can you not ?"
She took his hand, and her tears burst out again.
“I pray only that you may be happy, Marion,” said the
doctor, with a softened heart—“there is nothing else for me
to hope for. And, Marion, if not in one way, there is another.
Tell me, if Gerald is not what you hope and expect, if—if—”
“Ah," said Marion, " there is no if. I know Gerald. It
will be long to wait till to-morrow evening; but what is that
compared to the four years we have been parted ?"
“Be brave, my girl,” he murmured.
They shook hands. Her cheek was bright; her eyes were
dancing with happiness; her lips were trembling. Never,
in all the promise of her happy youth, had Marion looked so
beautiful.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
WHEN the great Atlantic liner, the Bismarck, homeward
bound from New York to Hamburg, ran into the little steamer
Triton, outward bound from London to Quebec, and that
famous collision ensued which furnished material for such
long and complicated litigation, it was Fred Revel's lot to be
on board the smaller craft. Once resigned to that unlucky
chance, he had reason to be thankful that when the disaster
occurred he was on deck, and in the bows. The accident, as was
fully demonstrated by the evidence, happened the Lord knows
how. It was a clear, still night at the end of April. The
water was smooth, save for a little choppy sea, which made
Do difference to a ship, and would have mattered little to a
wherry. There was fine starlight, if no moon. The ships
were on an even keel. It was long after the time of “all
lights out,” and some of the passengers on both vessels were

WITH HARP AND CROWN
still lingering on deck, loth to go below and exchange the air
of tue sea for that of the cabin, when the lights showed that
two vessels were nearing each other. Then—but at this
point the evidence was entirely contradictory. The passengers.
and crew of the Bismarck all swore that the Triton suddenly
changed her course, and steered, as if purposely, athwart their
bows. The few who survived from the Triton swore positively
that the big ship put her helm hard a-starboard, and ran
them down, with malice and deliberate intent to destroy.
Fred Revel's evidence to this effect was considered perfectly
worthless. Also, he was unable to write a graphic account
of the calamity, or even to give a verbal description. All he
knew was that they were run down, without—as it seemed
time to steer out of the way; that there was a sudden grind-
ing and crunching of beams, a rush of water, then a cry of
drowning men, a shriek of the women from their cabins—and
that was all. For the Triton went down like a stone, with
all on board.
The disaster happened a few miles off the Cornish coast,
and there was, of course, a rush of correspondents to the place
nearest the scene, to write up the details of the “tragedy,"
and then collect the narratives of the survivors. Of course,
too, there were pictures in the illustrated papers showing the
sinking of the ship—with, in those sold for a penny-scenes
in the ladies' saloon as the ship went down. Of course, there
were letters from correspondents indignant, correspondents
sarcastic, and correspondents calmly philosophical. Heraclitus
and Democritus both have their innings at such articles ; and,
what with the sham tears and the sham derision, we manage to
make the worst out of calamities which give us at first a com-
fortable thrill of horror. One man wrote out an elaborate system,
which occupied a whole column of the Times, and appeared in
leaded type.
He said that sailors had only to provide them-
selves before going to sea each with a life-saving belt, which
might be purchased of Messrs. Catch, Chance, and Co., pro-
vided with a waterproof bag, in which were placed, in separate
compartments, biscuits, preserved meat, cigars, lights, a spirit
lamp and portable tea pot, a pound of best Souchong, a flask
of brandy, a pistol to fire at sharks, a rocket or two, and a
chair to sit down in the water when it was desirable to change
This in case of wreck. As regards passengers,
they would take not only the patent belt sold by Catch,
Chance, and Co., but also the patent gutta percha boat,

manufactured by the same benevolent firm, combining at
once the portmanteau, shaving apparatus, a bed, a mast and
sail, Rob Roy cooking apparatus, and a small carronade for
aring signals. Thus equipped, a whole family, the writer
stated, might get ashore as easily as did the Swiss Family
Robinson in their tubs, which, every one remembers, were
lashed together by planks, Tommy being placed in the centre
to prevent him getting into mischief. Further, with a view
of preventing collisions, there was to be a grand division of
the sea-ships going one way to take the North Atlantic, and
the other way the South, and so on, and so on; with a hundrer
other patent inventions. It was beautiful, and only wanted
sailors to be machines to be perfect. That is where all the
systems break down. There is so much of humanity in things
human. Philanthropists, religionists, social reformers, all the
world of hobby-horse riders, break down through not con-
sidering this great fact. Have we not seen a great cause
shattered, and the strongest Ministry of the day go to pieces,
because its leaders forgot that the nation was made of men,
and that the men are like the butcher's famous beefsteak,
inasmuch as they may be humoured but cannot be drove ?
A grinding up of iron ribs as if they were the bones of a
partridge, a heeling over of the deck, a mighty wave of black
water rushing in from all quarters—that was all Fred Revel
knew of the calamity. The whole of the tragic details, after-
wards graphically described, were lost to him-perhaps because
his berth was forward. He saw and heard nothing of the poor
ladies rushing from their cabins, and falling at the captain's
feet; he saw nothing of the captain himself, standing with
folded arms on the broken bridge. Heroism, cowardice, resig-
nation, faith, despair-all these things, which appeared in the
daily papers, had no place in his memory, when he came to
remember. He could think of nothing but a great horror, the
swift destruction of the ship, and the sudden rush of black
water. It was like a dream.
Everybody owned that the Bismarck, when the mischief
was done, did her duty manfully. She steamed right over
and through the vessel, whose stern she had cut in two, and
kept way on for three hundred yards or so. Then she lowered
the boats, and stopped the engines, being alive to the necessity
of action. She picked up half a dozen sailors, who were float-
ing about, and then the boats, seeing no one else, returned to
the vessel ; and she went on her way, little the worse for the

accident, the captain swearing in undisguised disgust at the
stupidity of the other ship, and chiefly afraid that his licence
might be suspended.
But the boats did not pick up all.
When Fred Revel returned to a consciousness of himself,
and had done fighting his way upwards through the whirling
waters, which rolled and eddied over the sinking Triton ; when
his head emerged above the surface, and he was able, like
Neptune, “ to look out over the main, and raise his head in
majesty above the summit of the waters,” it was a black
prospect that he discovered. Floating near him were two
bars from a deck boat. These he seized with such thankful-
ness as the dying man may hear the respite of his sentence,
and partly resting or them, partly paddling, began to consider
what next to do.
First he kicked off his boots; then, with a little ma-
næuvring, he pulled off his coat, and let it go; then he picked
up two more floating oars, which made four-almost å raft;
and then, while he was binding them all together with a rope
extemporized of his braces and his neck tie-a feeble line, but
sufficient for his purpose and a short voyage, unless bad
weather should come—he tried to realize the position.
He never saw the boats at all. In his evidence at the
inquiry, he declared that, so far as he knew, the Bismarck
neither stopped nor sent out boats. That was not the case;
but it was curious that in a starlight night, and with smooth
water, the boats should not have seen him- perhaps some
current hurried him away. He was not alone either; for
presently there came floating past him, on an empty sheep-
pen—a thing like a crockery crate whose bottom has fallen
out-another human salvage. A crockery crate, as one may
imagine, is not a comfortable craft for even the shortest
voyage in the fairest weather. It travels without any regard -
to keel. It is useless to label it “this side up”: equilibrium
is unstable. If it floats, it makes no pretence to support any
one in an easy position; if it saves a passenger from drown-
ing, it is careless about ducking him. On this coop was cling-
ing a figure, with long arms, convulsively clutching the ribs
of what had been a pen. Now and then it turned over, and
the occupant would be seen, after a few moments of immersion,
clinging on the other side.
Fred hailed him, and then paddled his raft of four oars
towards this other shipwrecked mariner.

man.
“Come,” he said, cheerfully," let us lash your boat to mine,
and make room for two."
The occupant of the coop was apparently too exhausted tn
reply. Fred got him alongside, and managed to pass one oz
the oars through the open bars. This gave an additional
buoyant power to his raft.
Now, then," he said, "you may take your fingers off the
bars, and see if the oars will not keep us both up.'
It was too dark to see the other man's face, but Fred made
out that he was old; for he had very long hair, which shore
in the glistening starlight like silver; with a heavy, long white
moustache. On his back there hung a bag.
The man, without saying a word, shifted his hands from
the bars of the coop, and threw his body athwart the oars.
The feelile raft was not calculated to keep up the whole weight
of his body, and went under.
“Hold up !” Fred cried. “Don't hang on to it that way,
Rest your arm over it—hang it! we can't sit upon the
thing.”
“I was first,” said the new-comer, uttering the most bare-
faced falsehood. “I was first, and the oars belong to me.
You must go and find more oars for yourself. It won't bear
both. Be off, I say."
Fred looked round upon the tranquil waters. There were
no more oars, nor any trace of the ship floating about.
“That's pretty cool," he replied. "But I suppose you are
frightened-don't know what you are saying. However, we
are too heavy. What have you got round your neck ? It's
heavy. If it's nothing to eat, throw it off.”
“I won't throw it off,” said his companion, “It is the
work of
my life. My Memoirs.”
“Damn your memoirs !” cried Fred, in a great rage. He
had got his knife in his right hand, the left holding on to the
raft, and his body floating pretty easily. "Damn your
memoirs ! Do you think I am going to be drowned to save
your mouldy Memoirs ?”
With a dexterous movement he cut the string of the bag,
dragged it from the man's shoulders, and let it drop into the
water.
As they drifted, the bag went with them for a little, gra-
dually dropping astern, and finally disappearing.
The man cried aloud, and made a feeble dash at Fred, as if
he would cast him off the raft.

"No, you don't,” said the younger passenger, coolly.
“ Try it on again, my friend, and off you go, if you were
Jonah himself."
“Don't blaspheme,” the other said, in a hollow voice.
“There's only an oar between you and death.”
“ Four oars and a sheep-pen,” said Fred. “ Look-there
is a light on land. How far can a light be seen ? Three-
four miles. We are only so far from the shore. Pluck up,

choking now and then, when a wavelet dashed in his face.

“That's a staggerer,” said Fred. “Mr. Hermit, whatever
you are, you are a coward. Don't cry and snivel, man. If
we are to die, let us die like gentlemen.”
Oh, I never could think of dying. It's constitutional. I'm

" Come, old boy," said Fred, cheerily. “ It's cold and
dark—it isn't pleasant for either of us.

just for honour's sake, not to be a coward ?”
“ Three miles from land-only three miles—and to float
about here, getting colder and colder, until we die! Young

rich. Only help me to get ashore."
“If you are a soldier, you ought to face death without
crying like a girl over it," said Fred. “I do not know which
way the current is carrying us; but we must hope. It is
about midnight now. When the day breaks, we shall see if
there is any hope.”
For three hours Captain Lillingworth moaned and cried,
lamented and prayed. At intervals Fred remonstrated with
him. It was useless. The man had but one feeling—that
he might be drowned. He was a sensualist, and a coward.
He clung to life. He was religious, too, in the same sense
that the fallen angels are religious-because he trembled
when his thoughts wandered in the direction of his creed.
The night sped on. Fred clung silently to the oars, and
watched the east. His limbs were numb with cold, his
fingers stiff. He began to wonder how long he could con-
tinue to hold on. He ceased to take any further notice of
his companion, who went on moaning and crying unin.
terruptedly.

worth, for his part, was improving the occasion. He told;
how, on the first intimation of the danger, he had rushed
from his cabin, seized the helm, and dashed it hard a-port.
“She swung round, sir, with a will—the gallant craft!
The steersman, as honest an old salt as ever chewed an inch
of pigtail, seemed bewildered. But it was too late—too late!"
Here he paused, and wiped away a tear.
“ Bah! I am a soldier. Let us face death manfully-eh,
gentlemen ? We can but die once. Happy he—you know,
all of you—dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. That means,
I take it, to die in the discharge of duty. Then came the
crash. I cannot bear to think of it. There were three or
four women on board. I seized a child in one hand and a
woman in the other. I saw, just at the last, the captain
standing near to the boat on the bridge. The engineers
came running up the gangway. I endeavoured, in the few
moments which remained, to effect a little organization; but
too late!—the boats were entangled. Well, there was the
end of it. Nothing could have been finer than the behaviour
of the officers. I hope some of them will prove to have been
saved, and will bear me out. The ship struck, gentlemen.
I held the child and the lady; but when I came to myself I
was floating on the surface with my hands upon a spar, and
I saw no one else. Stay, there was the young man below
stairs—not a sailor, poor fellow—and his wits were well-nigh
gone. I rescued him, at least—that is some comfort-and
did my best to cheer him up all night."
There were many more details; in fact, the graphic account
called “The Foundering of the Triton," done into the most
picturesque English in the daily papers, which made so great
a sensation at the time, was mainly due to details supplied
by Captain Lillingworth. How he battled with the terrors
of the night; how he nearly perished in the attempt to save

a whole shipful of passengers and men; how he triumphantly
brought ashore one out of all; how he made the deck of the
sinking ship a field for the display of the most heroic courage
and coolness—all this was fully set forth.
“ This gallant officer," said the special, “does not talk of
his exploits; they are forced from him by questions and
cross-examination. Like all brave men, he is modest as
regards his own achievements. We have yet to learn what
other details will be supplied by those whom the Bismarck
picked up. The young gentleman, Mr. Revel, whose life
Captain Lillingworth was instrumental, under Providence, in
saving, can remember very little of the disaster. We believe
that Captain Lillingworth is already known as no carpet
knight. He served in the Crimea."
The young man, indeed, was of no use to the reporters at
all. When he read Captain Lillingworth's account he only
laughed; and the half-dozen whom the Bismarck picked up
were unable to confirm or contradict it. There were one or
two who were struck by the name, and showed it to each other.
" Arthur Cleveland Lillingworth,” said Colonel Firebrace
to General Pyrgopolinices—" that's the fellow's name. Samo
man, of course.
“I remember him—bad business; hushed up, though.
No one knew outside the regiment, except the chief. Let me
read the story again. Lies, Firebracē, lies. You see his
gallantry rests upon nobody's word but his own.
He never
did anything except lie. Here is a curious coincidence, Fire-
brace. The fellow saved with him was named Revel. Won-
der if it is any relative to the man whose wife he ran away
with. Gad! the fellow was always ready enough to run
away. Old story now-husband in the navy, excellent good
officer; wife pretty woman and a fool-Carry Revel, they
called her. It was a year or so before the Crimean row.
Some of the fellows wanted the colonel to take it up. Wish
he'd gone to the bottom, Firebrace. Upon my soul, I wish
he was at the bottom with the rest!"
The gold medal of the Royal Humane Society was presented
the next year, by common consent of the council, to the
brave and gallant officer who distinguished himself at the
loss of the Triton, Captain Arthur Cleveland Lillingworth,
formerly of the Royal 125th Regiment of Light Infantry,
the Swashbucklers, or Isle of Wight Fusiliers. He was
living in retirement in a small town on the Garonne in France.

On the receipt of the intelligence, the Prefect gave an official
banquet to do honour to their illustrious ally, his old brother-
in-arms, and in memory of the entente cordiale.
Fred, of course, got no medal; and as he seldom read the
papers, he heard nothing about it. Therefore he was saved
from the emotions of envy, malice, or derision. He went
straight back to Lowland-street, arriving there just as the
news of the disaster, with the names of the survivors,
reached the place. Marion and Adie had not begun to weep
for him as a brand snatched from the burning. Winifred
was still at the telegraph office; but the schoolmaster was
sitting at the window reading the graphic account with
mingled feelings.
“I sent him away,” he said. "If he had been drowned,
how could I ever have looked my girl in the face again ?"
And then he saw him hastening along the street, and went
out to be the first to welcome him.
“I know now," he said, his wrinkled old face lighting up
with welcome. “I know now. Winifred told me all. And
so you escaped, and swam ashore, like St. Paul at Malta, did
you? Come in and see them all. I think they have not so
much as heard that you were in danger.”
“I am come back, like a bad half-crown,” said Fred.
“But I have not come back to loaf about again, Mr. Owen,
you may be sure. Where is Winifred ?"
And there was great rejoicing among the three loving
hearts who welcomed back again this resolute pioneer of
industry.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
MARION sat in a sort of stupor when Joseph Chacomb left
her at last, repeating the glad tidings to herself. Gerald
home again! Her thoughts flew back to the day when they
sat together on the cliff, and looked out upon the blue sea,
flecked with the passing clouds. The wind fanned her cheeks
again as they flushed once more at Gerald's burning words.
His hand held hers close, close ; again her heart leaped up
with the unspeakable joy of a woman who loves her lover.
All the present vanished. The twilight wrapped the mean
lodgings of Lowland-street in obscurity, so that the room
looked like the drawing-room of Comb Leigh. The cries of
the children and footsteps of the passers-by fell on her ear

anheeded, or resolved themselves into the dasbing of the
waves upon the mouth of the cove, and the long-ūrawn moan
of the shingle as the waters rolled them up and down. Then
the beating of her heart grew too violent, and she cast her
thoughts back five years before, when she was yet a girl
trembling on the brink of womanhood. Then she roamed
with Gerald about the hillsides, clothed with lofty bracken;
or the woods inland, where wild birds answered their call,
and Gerald hunted strange creatures, unknown except to
those versed in woodcraft. There together they wandered
from morning to eve. And when they came home at sunset,
there was the kindly face to meet them at the gate, with the
voices and laughter of the children.
Far away, that vanished life, yet present still. And always
her thoughts turned again to the evening when Gerald kissed
his last good night upon her lips, her cheek, her forehead,
and her hands, when he drew her trembling to his arms, and
kissed her all over again. Then came the next day—the day
that broke deceitfully with radiant vest, ending in clouds and
the blackness of a deep sorrow.
"Marion, are you asleep? Marion, dear, you are sitting
all alone in jhe dark. Are you ill? Is there anything the
matter ?”
She roused herself, and came back to London.
The room
was shabby and mean; but the glamour of the trance was ou
her, and she was still in Devonshire.
“Is it you, Adie ?” she answered. “Is it you? Come
here, my darling, and let us talk. Do not light the candles.”
Adie sat on the footstool at her sister's feet—the old atti.
tude of love and trust—while Marion petted and caressed her
face.
“Winifred is better to-night,” said Adie. “She has been
telling me all about it, and we have had a great cry. My
dear, poor Fred has been living in an atmosphere of delusion.
He thought he was going to get a good place somewhere
through the interest of his old college friends. He promised
Winifred to give her a great house and make her a fine lady.
Poor Winifred! We will not desert her, Marion, will we ?”
“No-poor Winifred! We will not desert Fred's wife,
Adie. We have not been very happy for the last four years,
have we?"
“Not your fault, Marion. Oh! not your fault, my best of
Marions,” she replied. “And you have forgiven me my

impatience and bad tempers, have you not ? Not your fault,
my dear. You have worked for all, and we have been so
helpless--oh! so helpless and exacting. Now Fred is gone,
and there is only one left for you."
“Yes, dear, and I wish Fred was back again. Adie, I have
had good news.”
Goud, Marion ?"
“Yes; so good—so good that I can hardly believe it true.
My picture is accepted. Dr. Chacomb's friend writes every-
thing that is kind of it. He says that it will sell, and that I
shall do well yet. Are you pleased, dear ?".
“ Pleased ?" Oh, Marion! And we can leave this place.”
She sprang to her feet, because she could no longer keep
still. "We shall actually leave this dreadful place at last-
where we have suffered so much sorrow? Oh! Marion, can
it really be that we shall live properly again ?”
“I hope so, Adie-indeed, I think so. And—and there is
another piece of news; but I will tell you that to-morrow
evening."
“She is engaged to the doctor,” thought Adie. “Is that
good too, Marion ?"
“Ah, yes !” she replied—“very good. Adie, do not ask
me any more about it.”
“ Tell me more, dear, about the picture. Do let us talk
about the future."
She sat down again. In the darkness you could not see
the difference between the two faces. Marion's eyes were
full of tears, and her lips trembled with the great and over-
whelming joy of her soul. Adie, thinking of the new life
that seemed to lie almost within her reach, talked with eyes
aflame, and glowing cheeks. She looked like her brother on
that night when he built his castles in the air in Lincoln's
Inn-fields, and beguiled the heart of pretty Winifred.
'Marion, where shall we live? You do not want to be in
London; we will go back to Devonshire. Not to Comk
Leigh-not there, Marion; it would be too sad—but to some
quiet place by the sea-shore, where we shall find a cottage
just large enough for you, and me, and Winifred. We will
have a garden with roses, like the roses of Comb Leigh.
You shall paint the rocks and boats. We will have a village
girl to wait on us. We will sit in the shade, and talk about
these dingy old rooms, and all we have done and suffered,
And think of being ladies again, among ladies—if there are

any in our Devonshire village! Think of a country church,
and the sweet air! Oh, Marion, it seems too muc): that the
old time should come back again to us."
My dear, the old time is gone. The past lever comes
back again. But we may have happiness agaiu. Sing me
something, Adie--sing me a hymn.'
She sang one of the newest. Most new lymns are
irritating beyond expression with their pretence and their
shallowness; but this was not. Adie sang it because the air
pleased her; but the words fell upon her sister's ear like
rain upon a thirsty soil.
As she sang, Marion sat with clasped bands, thinking.
And to her crept, in the gloom, her new sigter, Winifred.
She stole up the stairs, listening to the hynn. She hesitated,
because she was uncertain; it might be that Marion would
not want her. But love, which casteth out fear, prevailed;
and she timidly came into the open door, and laid her hand
upon Marion's.
Her new charge! Surely the world was full of love to
her. Marion was so happy, that what Winifred meant as a
mute appeal for protection and forgiveness, she took for
sympathy with herself.
“My sister Winifred,” she whispered.
All night she lay awake, till the red morning glowed
through the windows; and then she fell asleep, praising God
in her dreams.
The doctor came next day, in the afternoon, and took Adie
out with him.
“You have not told your sister ?" he whispered to her.
“Gerald will call on you as soon as he comes to town, between
five and six. Ah, Marion, be brave.”
He repeated what he had said the day before, and the
words fell upon her heart like frost upon the flowers of May.
“Be brave." But why? What was there to be brave
about? The doctor bade her be brave when her father opened
his eyes to speak his last broken words of prayer and blessing.
“ Be brave !"
She put the words by; they did not belong to ber. They
might have been spoken years ago, when all this trouble was
coming on them; but not now-surely not now.
The cause
which parted her lover and herself was removed. It was but
a ghastly dream, that hallucination of poor Mr. Chacomb's.

The love that had never died would revive and flourish as if
there had never been any interruption. She would see once
more the light of passion, joy, and hope in the eyes of the
inan she loved ; she would have again his arm about her.
Pity poor Marion. She was only a woman, with all a
woman's desire for the love of one man. She had never
learned to unsex herself. She obeyed the instincts of her
nature in thinking the wedded life the happiest and holiest
lot. She did not hope for anything but the common lot of
humanity. She lived in the dream which all good women
feel, of universal love and sympathy. A most commonplace

nerves.
Half-past four, He would come in an hour.
She put her room in order, making it look as pretty as she
could. She dressed herself—not that she had any choice of
dresses—with an anxiety she had never felt before. She
looked in the glass. The Spenser woman told her the truth
when she said that her figure was gone, and her beauty faded.
She saw a pale, thin cheek, with lines of care and suffering.
She saw a wasted form. She saw eyes that seemed to have
lost the capacity of happiness. What she did not see, and
nobody saw but the doctor and poor Dicky Carew, was the
steady light of steadfast love that burned there, and the seal
of goodness on her forehead, set there by seven and twenty
years of patient duty.
The afternoon seemed strangely silent. She missed the
step of Mr. Lilliecrip overhead-the Hermit disappeared on
the day when Mrs. Spenser had her revenge. Men came and
removed his things, and the rooms were empty. She missed
the anxious expectancy which was associated in her mind -
with her brother. The boys in school, downstairs, made a
soft murmur over their lessons, through the closed doors : it
sounded like the buzz of many bees. When the master's
voice was raised in reproof, it was as if a thrush chirruped ;
and when he caned a criminal, it was like a peacock screaming.
The very street, for some reason of its own, seemed hushed
and quiet. Her nerves were strung beyond the point of being
touched by ordinary things, and she did not notice them.
She tried to do some work, but her fingers would not hold a

pencil. She tried to read, but it was just as when, four years
before, the poet Pope took credit to himself because a nymph
was reading the Essay on Man, inasmuch as the words floated
before her brain, and she saw them not. And then she tried
to play, and soothed her soul with some of the old things
which never tire.
At five o'clock, the boys streamed out of the house, and
began to play in the street—their only playing field—with a
chorus of shouts. Leap-frog and fly-the-garter were “in,"
games which require, to bring out their full flavour, as much
shouting as a Homeric battle. . Marion did not hear them.
She wandered about the room restless. But the boys
screamed so loud that Marion did not hear a cab drive
up
to
the door. But she heard his step upon the stair. Was it
likely that she should forget his step ?
He came in-her Gerald !
As his
eyes
met hers, as his outstretched hand advanced to
take her own, the words of Dr. Chacomb recurred to her with
a force that drew the blood from her cheeks, and made her
pulse stand still-
“Be brave, my girl !"
She was brave. She resolutely pushed away from her this
pressure at her heart, which seemed to stop its beating. She
took the offered hand, which had lost the remembered touch.
She met the calm eyes, which looked as if they had never
been stirred by the magic of love. She greeted him, as if
no words of love had ever passed between them, with the
warmth of an old friendship.
As for love, there was no more any thought of love. His
face told her so much. It was set with a warmth which was
different from the warmth of love.
Marion," he said, taking her hand and holding it.
Did no thought of the past flash across his mind ?
“Gerald," she replied.
Had they been lovers still, they could have said no more.
As they were friends, they could say no less.
She saw that he was older, firmer of step and of face. She
saw that his eyes had changed to her, and were now cold and
hard. His lips had lost their smile. His very head, which
used to bend as if with pleasure when he met her, was stiff
and rigid. She had left a lover; she met a friend.
It came upon her with a suddenness which stunned her.
She turned pale. Her face resumed its worn and wasted

look. The ring of black colour returned to her eyes. Her
happiness died swiftly out of her look.
Gerald saw a thin and prematurely aged woman-
but seven and twenty; and-alas! for the quickness of poor
Marion's perception, which showed her, at first sight, that
love was dead, and so killed the beauty with which she was
prepared to meet him-he saw a wasted figure, a shaking
hand, eyes that were dimmed with tears which even that
brave heart could not wholly keep down, and-woe is me that
I must write it !—the first love-making seemed to him like
some impossible dream, which he had forgotten so long that
it was a pity to begin it again. And what he saw, Marion
read in his
eyes.
This was their meeting. This was the end of her fidelity.
He cared no more to re-open the closed chapter. It was for
her to close it too with what speed and security she might.
She flushed a moment, thinking of Joseph Chacomb. Then
her pride came to her help, and she greeted him with a smile
a thin, worn smile, like a gleam of sunshine in December.
Tell me about yourself, Marion," he said, kindly.
“First, tell me what you have been doing.”
He talked, she listened ; and the effort of listening and
trying to understand, and the tumult of bitter emotion,
hardened her nerves. He told her how he had been wander-
ing on the uplands of Southern Africa; how his resolution at
first was never to come back at all; how he had lived among
the friendly savages, or among the simple Boers, uncorrupted
then by diamond fields ; careless of civilization, with England
like a far-off dream, and only the memory of that last dreadful
interview with his father to trouble him; how, little by little,
the thirst for talk with his own kind drove him back to Cape
Town, and so home again. A simple story of a simple journey,
with no adventures to speak of, no sufferings and privations,
no hopes and no fears.
“I have discovered nothing," he finished, “or next to
nothing. I have returned as I went-empty-handed.
Never mind, now. Tell me about
you
and
yours,
Marion."
'My story is simple. I have been painting, to keep the
house together."
“ And you have succeeded ?"
Involuntarily he cast a glance at the shabby room, the
furniture of which the old furniture from Comb' Leigh
fitted with the street and the house.
.

" I did not succeed—not very well, that is ; but I think, I
hope, that I may succeed now. For I have a picture accepted
at the Royal Academy."
Gerald did not seem much moved by the announcement.
Colonial folk, as you may have observed, are provoking that
way. They will not observe the nice gradations of success. If
you tell an old Colonial friend that you have been discovered
to rank with Tennyson or Browning, he is no more moved
than if you told him that you have been compared with
Tupper. To Gerald it seemed only proper that Marion's
picture should be in the Academy,
“That's right,” he said, cheerily. “And where are Fred
and Adie?"
“ Fred is gone. He tried hard to get something to do,
poor boy; and, as he could not, he has emigrated."
“A very good thing too. England is a bad place for men
who have been brought up to nothing. I am very glad I
went abroad. And little Adie ?”
“ She is not little Adie at all now. She is taller than I am.
If you will stay and have some tea with me, you shall see her.
She will be back again soon.
Gerald had not yet dined, but he stayed. Marion was glad
that he did. She dreaded being left alone.
She made tea for him, Gerald helping in his old brotherly
fashion; laughing, and telling her stories of his travels, in a
pleasant, happy way which recalled the days even before he
went to Brazil. Then he began to talk about Chacomb.
My father is a good deal shaken,” he said. “ You will
have heard about him from the doctor. The old halluci.
nation, which gave us all such a shock once, is still strong
upon him. And this miserable second marriage—but you
know, probably.”
“I know something,” she said, wondering of what stuff
mon were made, that Gerald could talk so coolly of the great
“shock," after all it had done to both. “I know something.
Do not talk about it if it is painful to you."
“Not at all painful.”
And then he began to take up the thread of his father's
history from the funeral of Captain Revel, omitting all men-
tion of the engagement.
Had the man no memory? Was it possible that he had
actually forgotten ?
Gerald had not forgotten. But the kiss which burned

itself into the soul of the girl, and had become a part and
parcel of herself, so that she felt it still upon her cheek like a
brand, had long since gone out of his mind, or only lingered
there as part of a pleasant day. There was an afternoon, and
he kissed a pretty girl. Then came the evening, and he kissed
her again. Then came a dreadful calamity, with the suspicion
of worse disaster behind, and they parted.
Now they met again: he in the bloom and prime of early
manhood, thirty years of age; she faded and worn, the shadow
of her former self—the fruit that had withered on its stalk,
the flower that had never bloomed to its fullest beauty. The
kisses had been forgotten-Marion was a memory only. In
the savage and wandering life that he had led, bodily fatigue
drove out sad thoughts. The long marches and thirsty stretches,
the fierce African sun, the hunting days, the camp
life—all
these had killed and crushed the lingering shoots of tender
love.
And what was there to revive his passion ? The umbra of
what had been ; the shadow of sweet maid Marion; the form
without the light, and life, and laughter; the face without-
ah! but he did not see her eyes-Marion's eyes—or else he
would have loved again.
Eight o'clock struck, and they were still talking, when Adie
came home, with the doctor.
Adie,” said Marion, “I told you I had some good news.
Here is Gerald, come home again.'
She had lit the candles by this time. Gerald rose to greet
his old friend, who had been little schoolgirl Adie.
Heavens! Was this glorious creature, this queen of beauty,
on whose brow sat all the graces, as the poets used to say,
whose lips, and eyes, and dimpled cheeks were a multitudi-
nous smile; whose hair was a coronal of glory-was this little
Adie?
His
eyes lit up as they had not done for her sister. Marion
saw it, with a pang which struck her heart like a knife.
She beckoned the doctor to the window, and murmured,
with dry lips-
“What was that you advised me, yesterday? Did you
know "
“I guessed. I did not know."
“I have been brave. Keep my secret, doctor-dear Dr.
Chacomb, I trust my secret with you. Keep it, and be my
friend, always."

“I will be whatever-good God! Marion, that it should be
possible !-I will be whatever you let me be.”
She touched his fingers with hers. It was a compact.
“We will always be as we are now, and always friends,
dear Dr. Chacomb.”
Then they joined the other two.
Presently the doctor, who had been very silent, went away,
and they all began to talk of him—how good and great he
was; how kind and unselfish. And because two were women,
who believed what they wished to believe, and one was a
stupid Colonial, who was inexperienced in the sin of great
cities—the sin, namely, of selfishness, struggling to the front,
trampling down those that are in your way, and appropriating
to yourself the kudos that belongs to others—they all lauded,
praised, and magnified the name of Joseph the Good, who
had stood by his poor cousin Chauncey, sacrificed his own
time and interests to the good of Chacomb, and been more
than kind to themselves, till admiration of his virtue took
away their breath, and they were fain to stop and admiro
him in silence.
When Gerald took his leave, it was in Adie's face that ho
looked last, with an admiration which Marion, taught by
experience, construed into passion.
“Marion, he is splendid! It is delightful—it is happiness.
Oh, Marion !" cried the younger girl, clasping her sister
round the neck,“ this was good news.”
It was, indeed, good news. Such good news as some people
try to persuade us is the good tidings of the gospel-good
news of sorrow, misery, and impossible salvation.
“ Go to bed, Adie, dear,” said Marion. “I will come pre-
sently." She was longing to be quiet. She yearned for some
place where she would be alone in her sorrow and bitterness
“Go, Adie,” she added, in a voice harsh with impatience,
“I will come-presently."
Adie left her at length; and Marion sat down, and tried to
think.
Let us leave her to herself. There are some sorrows,
besides those of bereavement, which are of a life, and cannot
be told. Why paint the tortures of a man upon the rack?
Why try to show how Marion battled with the
agony
that
rent her, all the night, until gleams of peace came when, in
the reddening east, God made a tender rose of dawn?

CHAPTER XXXIX.
GERALD remained in town. He resumed the old brotherly
relations with Marion, talked about his projects and his
experiences, asked her advice, and, like all the world, assumed
her entire sympathy with him. He came daily, and took
them both for walks and drives. Joseph Chacomb it was who
secretly provided Adie with the means of procuring a
proper" dress or dresses for these excursions. Perhaps it
was not only the pleasure of talking with Marion that
brought him to Lowland-street.
Fred, who, after his dash into virtue and energy, felt the
need of a little rest, resumed his loafing-except the billiards.
The very thought of that prophetic marker filled his soul
with horror. Gerald was good enough to lend him a little
money, with which he entertained himself in the daytime
and his wife in the evening.
Then the Academy opened. Whether Joseph Chacomb
was romancing when he offered to “square" the reviewers, I
do not know. Iincline to think that he was. I love to believe
that there is as little envy, as little camaraderie, as little
malice, as much appreciation, brotherly love, and kindness in
Art as there is in Literature. Let me never cease to find
cause for gratitude to critics, whether of pictures or of books.
No doubt, Joseph Chacomb exaggerated his powers of in-
fluencing Art criticism. However this may be, the fact is
certain that, when of the leaders some had been slashed and
some had been stroked, all the papers with one accord turned
to Marion's picture, and said good things about it. It was
only by reading all the reviews and combining her information
that Marion found out all the faults in her work. Then,
indeed, she learned that it was sketchy, laboured, heavy
in colour, pedantic, frivolous, weak in drawing, unreal in'
light, too real in the light, with so many other contradic-
tions, that she was fairly puzzled. And then the picture
sold, and for a good price; and the great picture dealers,
Messrs. Puffit, Pushem, and Co., men to whom Burls was
humble, and before whom such creatures as Hermann Gott-
fried tried to efface themselves, took her up, and gave her
.commissions.
Marion saw her way at last. It was not the fame of
immortality that awaited her, nor the fortune of a Turner;

382
but it was comfort, ease, and a life of ladyhood that came
within her reach,
She went a good deal to the Academy-partly to look at:
her own picture. Gerald sometimes went with her. They
walked among the thousand gaudy frames where the Don
Quixotes, the boats on the river, the “bits” of Haslemere,
betray the poverty of artists' reading and resource, and
where the unmeaning portraits of commonplace people stare
from the walls; and always, to Marion's solace, a little crowd
gathered round her own picture.
Every stroke in it was dear to her. She remembered the
slow progress, the studies for the drawing, her hesitation
about the colour, her desire to get things right, her anxiety
about the costume. The people saw nothing of all this;
they looked at the sweet face-Adie's face with its insouciant
look, its parted lips, and the light of youth in the careless
eyes: they saw the result.
“It is splendid, Marion,” Gerald whispered. “I like it
better every time I see it. We are proud of you.”
Marion smiled. She was no longer unhappy—only a little
sad and ashamed of herself; and she said to herself what.
the Emperor Alexander said to the Poles-
“ Above all, no dreams.”
" I should like to talk to you,” said Gerald, quietly,
“ where there will be no one to interrupt us.”
It was only ten in the morning, and the Academy was
comparatively empty. He took her into the refreshment
room, where there were two or three people taking breakfast..
“Marion," Gerald began, with great solemnity, and then
stopped.
"Have you ordered, sir ?" asked a waiter.
Gerald glared. Then he remembered, and ordered an ice;
and then he tried to start afresh.
Marion's pulse did not quicken, nor did her cheeks flush.
Whatever Gerald was going to say, there would be nothing
to move her from her tranquillity.
“When I came home, Marion," he said-it was only a
fortnight since that event, but he spoke as if it had been a
year at least" when I came home I intended to stay long.
enough to shake off the fever, and then to get back to Africa
for another spell. Now, you would hardly believe it, I have
changed my mind. I no longer care for African travel. It
seems to me that nothing can be better than life in Englando

I am thirty years of age; my father is feeble ; I ought not
to expect my cousin to go on giving up his time to the care
of Chacomb Hall. I shall stay at home.”
“I am very glad indeed,” said Marion.
“Yes-yes. We have always been brother and sister to
each other, have we not ?"
“Always brother and sister."
“There was a time when it seemed”—(only “seemed,"
-Gerald ?)—"as if we might be something more to each other.
But it is better as it is."
“Better as it is," Marion murmured.
"I am not worthy of you. No one is, for that matter. If
you only knew, Marion, how we all respect and love you!
However, what I want to say is this. My father has never
let the Rosery. Come back there. Forget the trouble that
drove you from the place. You will be able to work there
better than in London. You will be back in the old place
that
you
love. And besides”
" What besides, Gerald? Let me hear everything."
“I have not spoken to her yet. I would not speak to her
without your permission. But-oh! Marion-will you let
be your brother indeed ?"
Marion neither flushed nor turned pale. For a moment
it seemed cruel to mock her; but she put the thought away.
“You mean Adie? Of course, you mean Adie. Gerald,
-she is dear to me. Examine your heart well. Four years
ago—I am not reproaching you—you told another girl that
you loved her.
Now you love her no more. Remember,
Gerald, I am not reproaching you. It is better so, as we
said before. But you have ceased to love her. How do I
know that you may not cease to love my poor
Adie?"
Quietly as the words were said, they went home to Gerald.
"I can say nothing," he replied. “Marion, if the past
could return

long enough for such blunders. They cannot be repaired.”
They cannot,” he said. “ You will believe me when I tell
you that Adie's happiness is dearer to me than my own.”
She laid her hand on his.
“I do believe you, brother Gerald."
And he never knew the effort by which she had enabled
herself to say this honestly. He accepted the sacrifice, as
ne

everybody always accepted Marion's gifts, without asking
what they cost.
“I wish you success, Gerald. And I will think over your
proposal about the Rosery. I think we might afford to live
There-Winifred, Fred, and I. It would be a great change
for us, and almost too great happiness. Let me think it
over.”
It was no longer unhappiness to feel that Gerald had
never loved her, as she once thought—that she could never
love him again. Perhaps she would have been higher than
human had she witnessed without a pang the transference of
his affections to her sister. But she hardened her heart
against the thought, and preserved, to Gerald's eyes, the frank
smile with which she always met him. Lower than human
would he have been had he not remembered something of the
troth which should have been sacred by the memory of the
dead man who sanctioned it. He did remember it, and with
shame. But the past, as Marion said, can never return; and
he was dazzled by the loveliness of her sister. Venus Victrix
laughs at the pale charms of Vesta. One needs to be a
monk to rank St. Cecilia above Phryne.
Gerald had forgotten. It humiliated and pained him to
be reminded, even in terms as gentle as those in which Marion
clothed her plaint. This served him right. It was just that
he should have a glimpse, even a momentary and imperfect
glimpse, of the ruin he had wrought. “Only a woman's hair,"
Swift wrote. Only a woman's heart, which Gerald Chacomb
mocked and wounded. Had he known how deeply, there
would have been small happiness for him in the after-years.
But Marion smiled and passed on her way, no one but Joseph
Chacomb knowing the truth.
She went back to the pictures, Gerald following with a
sense of discontent and shame. Among the visitors was a fat
man, with a large head, a flabby white face, and big white
hands. He had a catalogue, on which he made notes with a
big, square pencil. It was Mr. Hermann Gottfried. He took
off his hat, and bowed politely.
“The pewtiful Miss Reffel," he said, loud enough for all
the world to hear. “The sweet jung bainter. Ach! mein
Gott !-what a bicture! what a bicture! You never painter
zoch a bicture for me-neffer. But I forgif you. Ach i

jung men will make their gobies from you. Where is the
most pewtiful of all young laties that effer was bainted ?
Where is the lofely zister ?"
A week later, they were leaving the old lodgings. Once
more the well-used furniture was to go back to Devonshire,
and to the Rosery. Characey Chacomb, deprived of the
society of his fond and loving wife, and awakened to the fact
that his son was really restored to him, wrote a humble and
contrite letter to Marion. He begged forgiveness for cruel
words and for dreadful suspicions. He asked humbly to
be allowed to see her again at Chacomb Hall. He expressed
his joy at Gerald's engagement.
Since,” he wrote—“since I heard of it, a great thing has
happened to me. I have ceased to see your poor father's face
at night. So that I know now-what my cousin Joseph
always told me —that it was hallucination. Perhaps I shall
forget it, even the memory of it, in time; but I fear not. I
have suffered greatly, Marion ; and if you will all come back
to your old cottage, it will help me to greater peace of mind.
I beg your acceptance of the greatest treasure in all my Col.
lection. It is no less an heirloom than the identical dagger
with which King Edward was stabbed. It was dug up at
Corfe Castle by myself, and identified as of the period by the
Council of the Swanage Archæological Institute. I give it to
you as a pledge of my earnest desire to win back
your
friend-
ship and forgiveness.
The treasure was very much like an old dinner knife,
rusted by lying in damp ground. By holding it so as to catch
the light sideways, Marion once thought she saw the name of
* Rogers, Sheffield,” upon it. But we know that to be an old
firm, and very likely it supplied the Court of the Wessex
King with cutlery.
“ Marion,” said Adie, “let us jump for joy. Let us sing.
Let us dance. We are going back to Comb Leigh. Oh, if
only we could finil everything there just exactly as we left it.
Winifred, we will dance upon the lawn. Think. The wistaria
will be all out in great purple bunches, like lovely grapes ;
and the yellow jessamine-it is too late for that. There will
be the lilacs, and the laburnum, and roses all ready to burst
into flower, directly they see me again.”
Then Mr. Owen crept into the room, looking as unhappy as
if he were about to lose his scholars.

"I shall have no heart left for anything," he said. “What

“ You will have no one to tease you,” said Adie.
will read Plutarch and the Book of Proverbs, and smoke
your pipe all by yourself every evening. There is always ,
compensation, you know. You have often told us so."
“Compensation! what can compensate for losing my
daughter?"
But
you
shall come and see us. Shall be not, Mariou ?”
This was Winifred.
“Nothing can compensate," he said, mournfully. “It is
like the cow's tail. You know that the cow's tail, Miss
Marion, was made to brush off the flies. But it is not long
enough. That's the compensation of things.
When are
you going to be married, Miss Adie? Ah! There's more
trouble. Why can't girls-no, Winifred, my dear, I won't
“I shall miss Adie,” said Marion. “ But I have got
Winifred instead. And we are all proud of Fred now, are
we not, Mr. Owen ?"
“Ay," he replied. “ He's made a man of himself.”
These simple folk believed that Fred had retrieved his
character, and fulfilled entirely the promise of his youth, by
simply embarking on board the Triton, and swimming ashore.
Providence clearly intended him to remain in England. Its
finger—as the clergymen say when they change a lean living
for a fat one—was visible to the naked eye, pointing in the
direction of superior material comfort.
“Poor Fred!" said his wife. “It makes me so happy to
think that he has won back everybody's good opinion. I
always said he was the noblest of men."
He was indeed—as Gerald was the truest.
There was a knock at the door.
It was Dicky Carew. He was attired in an entirely new
suit of black cloth, with a large expanse of white shirt front.
In his left hand he bore a bunch of roses. His face presented
a mixture of pride and shame. Behind him came the portly
person of Mrs. Medlar.
“Miss Revel,” he said, "we hava taken the liberty—allow
mo to present to you my wife, Mrs. Richard Carew, the lato
Mrs. Medlar-learning that you have at last taken the posi.
tion your talents, as well as your birth and social qualities,

wish you, if we may, our most sincere congratulatione and
hicarty hopes for the future, before saying farewell—"
He stopped, choked, laid the roses on the table, and added,
in a broken voice-
“ For ever.”
“I've seen you, Miss Revel, every day aʼmost for three
years and more," said Mrs. Carew, “and all Lowland-street
knows you for the best of good women and the hardest
worked. My husband is one of them that worship the
ground you tread on-there's lots more-but we know our
distance, and we keep it.”
“Perhaps, Mr. Owen," said Mr. Carew, feebly—“perhape
you will bear 'me out in saying that I am not the only one
in this respectable street who kucws and values Miss Marion
Revel.”
“Indeed he can," cried Winifred, seizing Marion's hand.
“There's not one,” said the schoolmaster—“I don't care
where you look, high and low, in ancient and in modern
history—there are no women in Plutarch-you won't find a
woman-I beg your pardon, Miss Marion, a lady—that can
hold a candle to Miss Marion Revel. • She is a tree of life
to them that lay hold upon her; she is like the merchants'
ships-she bringeth good thinge from afar; her price is above
rubies; strength and honour are her clothing, and she shall
rejoice in time to come. Let her own works praise her in
the gates. That's what the wise man said of the good
woman; and he would have said it of Miss Marion Revel if
led only known."
“And so he would," said Mrs. Medlar -we mean Mrs.
Carew_"so he would. Miss Revel, we wish you the best os
happiness, and-Richard, come away; don't you see you've
made me cry? It's always the way with men—and their
stupid compliments."
She nodded at Mr. Owen, as much as to say that his
extracts from the Book of Proverbs were misplaced.
“No-no," said Marion. “But you are too good, all of
you."
“ The best woman in the world,” said Richard.
« I told
them down below in the street that you were all going, and
there is a little crowd assembled to wish you good-bye. Mr.
Owen here, who was going to cane Candy Secundus, has let
him off.”
“I hadn't the heart," said the schoolmaster.

wrong; but I was obliged to forgive him. A wise son heareth
his father's instruction: Candy Secundus never hears any
instruction. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and
a rod for the fool's back."
“ Miss Revel,” Dicky continued, “ there are all the women
you have helped crying because you go away and leave them;
there are the poor girls who looked to you when they were
starving and tempted. You cannot go without saying God
bless you' to them-can you 1 ?
“There's myself, too,” he went on. “ I came because I
couldn't help it, and Mrs. Carew because she wanted to
show that she wasn't jealous.”
“Quite right, Richard," said his wife; "and to show Miss
Revel that it wasn't philandering with her that I was afraid
of.” She transfixed poor Winifred with a look which spoko
volumes. “Go on, my Richard."
“Her Richard !” exclaimed Dicky. “Yes, Miss Revel.

would be a sin to allow quite to drop. So we are going to

“ And-in fact-my energies will be henceforth devoted to

“For a second time," said Mrs. Medlar.

« She will know the reason why !"
Then Fred arrived with cabs to take the luggage, and
experienced persons came to pack up the furniture; and pre-
sently they all drove away, leaving Lowland-street, with its
joys and sorrows, behind them.
CHAPTER XL.
My story draws to an end, and is nearly told. All these
things occurred in the spring of the year
of
grace
1870. In
the summer of that year, as all the world knows, happened
the overthrow of France, accompanied by such a cock-crowing
on the part of the conquerors as may be expected when those
who have been accustomed to defeat suddenly gain the victory.
We have not forgotten, nor are any of us likely to forget, the
honest rejoicing of the Fatherland. Socialism, junkerism,
militarism, press-gagging, press-inspiring, absolutism, peda-
gogism, professorism, terrorism-all the other isms which
make life in Prussia admirable, and Germany a land of sweet-
ness and light-were forgotten in that great scream of rapture
and astonishment which still echoes in our ears. The country
of Geist, with a wonder that it has not yet overcome, saw
itself in dreams the leading power in the world, and a living
proof of the Great Frederick's creed that the God of battles
sides with the bigger army.
The roaring of the cannon beat upon the ears of one listener
in a quiet little Devonshire village, rousing him from an
indolence which seemed invincible to a wrath heroic. Day
after day, as the tidings came to England of more disaster,
Fred Revel bethought him more and more of the French
blood in his veins. He could not sleep. He wandered up
and down, with the news of each morning ringing in his brain.
Day and night the force which drew him with invisible bonds
grew stronger. He pored over the map; he reckoned the
chances ; he talked, dreamed, thought of nothing but the war.
Marion watched him, suspicious; his wife watched him, sus-
pecting nothing, but wondering at the passion which filled her
husband's heart.
One night-it was after the crushing fight of Gravelotte,
when the French might have won, had they been a few
thousands stronger, or had—but they lost, and it was enough
-he spoke.

Thpapers came in the evening, and Fred read the letters
in the Daily News—the paper which first showed the world
what a war correspondent ought to be with flushing cheek
and excited eyes.
“Marion," he said one evening, “ have you read to-day's
news ?”
She knew what was in his mind, and waited.
We are of French descent, Marion.”
• Yes, Fred.”
“We have been soldiers and fighting men from generation
to generation-all but myself."
“Yes, Fred."
“Marion, tell me what you think. Say what I ought to do."
She trembled. It was a heavy responsibility that her
brother threw upon her—the responsibility of his life.
Can
you
bear to leave Winifred ?”
"I can bear anything. Tell me I ought to go.”
She obeyed the voice within her. She arose, went to her
own room, and returned with her father's sword.
Keep it for me, Marion,” he replied. “If I come back,
will claim it as my right. If I never return, give it to
Winifred, for—for the unborn child.”
It was eleven o'clock. He stepped gently into his wife's
room-where she lay asleep, poor girl-and kissed her on the
forehead; but so lightly that it did not awaken her. Then
he made up a small bundle of necessaries, and came back to
bid farewell to Marion.
“Better so," he said. “ Break the news to her to-morrow.
Tell her--10-let her think that I am not so worthless as I
And God bless her-and you, too, Marion !"
Exactly four years before, under such a summer moon,
had taken the same road to catch the night train to town.
Four years! He thought, as he strode along the quiet lanes,
beneath the tall hedges, on whose leaves the moonlight lay in
silver, of all that had happened since then. The misspent
years might have followed his footsteps, accusing. But
Fred's conscience was not so sensitive. He only thought that
the time had been wasted. He only remembered that on one
or two occasions such as that bill of sale business-he had
been imprudent. He did not repent of the past, because it
never occurred to him that, with a few trifling exceptions,
there was anything to repent about. But for the future he
had no fear. He was going to be a soldier. He ought to
bave been a soldier from the first, like his fathers before him.

WITH HARP AND CROWN,
He joined Chanzy, and before many weeks gained his
colours. It was the life for which he was best fitted. In the
movement and continual change of the camp, spite of the
disasters that crushed his cause, he was far happier than he
had been, wasting his sister's substance in riotous living.
His letters home were full of hope and enthusiasm; and the
hearts at Comb Leigh were kept at ease through the infection
of his good spirits.
Suddenly the letters ceased; and Gerald managed to find
out that the Lieutenant Count de Reville-Fred, needless to
say, enlisted under his French name-was among the missing
after one of the battles, which were mostly skirmishes before
Orleans.
Marion went herself in search of him. She sent Winifred
to Chacomb Hall, in charge of Adie, comforted her with
hope, and started alone to look for her brother.
Over the battle-fields and in the camps she sought. She
made her way among the Frenchmen, mad with defeat and
shame; among the jubilant Germans, anxious only now to
have an end of it, and fight no more for the madness of an
Empire tottering to her fall; where the ambulance corps
performed their duties under the protection of the much-
abused Geneva Cross. She searched for Fred as Evangeline
searched for Gabriel, but with a better result.
For she found him.
To be sure, she had not to wander over the whole of
America; and the battle-fields of the Midi did not cover a
greater extent of ground than the county of Yorkshire.
She found him at last, lying in a farmhouse, stricken
grievously, but not unto death. Outside, the grapes hung
in ripe clusters, the corn was reaped, the autumn flowers
blossomed, and the convolvulus clambered about wall and
porch. Nature, in that unfeeling way of hers which I have
already noted, took no notice of the war, and went on with
her flowers, as if there were no weeping women and heart-
broken men. In the shade was a soldier, a German, smoking
a placid pipe, and thinking very likely of Gretchen. Why we
always associate a German soldier with Gretchen, I do not
know. When he clearly understood that the gracious lady
was not intent on slaughter, he informed her that they bad
wounded men in the place French and German. Might sho
see them? The gracious lady might see the door open:
there was nothing to prevent her walking in,

Within the place lay, in half a dozen rooms, pallets filled
with the wouuded. Some—but no, it is too near the end of
the tale. Among them, in one of the smaller rooms, lay her
brother Fred.
His right arm was gone—that was immediately apparent.
His forehead was tied up with a cloth, for it was laid bare to
the bone-perhaps a piece of shell, or a spent shot. He
had an open wound in the leg, and he was raving with fever.
Marion obtained permission to stay there. There were no
nurses in this farmhouse used for a hospital, only a young
army surgeon-a dreamy, expert German, who talked a
brutal materialism and acted the highest Christianity. Him
Marion conquered. She was a very Venus Victrix for
reducing every man to a state of abject reverence and admi.
ration; and in a day she was mistress of the hospital, and
nurse-in-chief to all the poor fellows on the pallets, from
Jacques Bontemps, the Auvergne peasant, to Max Herbst,
from Posen. All knew that she was come after her brother;
but every man felt that, next to him, he was himself the
chief object of her solicitude.
In November, when the yellow leaves of Chacomb Park
were heavy with autumnal des, and the air faint with the
odour of crushed and decaying leaves, Marion brought her
brother home to his wife.
He was scarred. He had only one arm, and that the left.
He was pale and wasted. But he was home again ; and he
was a hero.
Marion brought him once more his father's sword, and said
it in his left hand.
“ Take it, my brother. It is yours.”.
“ Yes, Marion,” he said, humbly. “ I may claim it now,
may I noti"
Winifred buckled it on for him, smiling through her glad
and happy tears.
Fred was a hero. As long as he lives he will enjoy the
honour and respect which men in all ages have agreed to pay
to him who acquits himself manfully in the battles of his
country. No other honour' is equal to this. The poet's
crown and statesman's statue are poor things compared with
the praise and envy bestowed on a gallant fighticg man. It
is better to be Turenne than Colbert. Wellington seems a
greater man than Pitt. Murat in his lifetime was a mora
gallant figure than Talleyrand.

Fred, for all the countryside, was a hero. The women re-
membered how he stood, brave and handsome, at his father's
funeral, the
prop and support of his house. No doubt he
had propped it and supported it during the four years of
exile from Devonshire. What but good was to be expected
of one so handsome ?
A hero And yet it does not seem that his moral nature
was altered. He had been as lazy as Lawrence, and he con-
tinued in his laziness-of course, a man with only the left
arm could not be expected to work. He is just exactly what
he always has been—as indolent, as good-natured, taking i18
keen a delight in merely breathing the air of heaven, as affec-
tionate, as avid of pleasure. Only his pleasures now cost
nothing. He can fish with his left arm. He can sail with
Gerald. He can go to Exeter with his brother-in-law for
such dissipation as that city affords. He cannot, happily,
play billiards. He can ride; he can play with his children;
and he can be the joy and happiness of his wife and sister.
Always a favourite with everybody. Great is amiability, and
it shall prevail.
When Mr. Rhyl Owen comes down once a year to see his
daughter, he allows himself to be overcome with shame at the
folly of his former predictions.
"That man worthless, Winifred ? Why, you ought never
to forgive me. A fool talks folly. What says Solomon ?
Whoso keepeth his mouth and tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles. And again : 'He that is void of wisdom despiseth
his neighbour; but a man of understanding holdeth his
peace.'
And yet, most certainly, had this young man remained in
London, his end would have been like unto that of the pro-
phetic billiard-marker.
And so the end of action has come—the problem of what
each shall do with his life is solved. There will be no more
anxiety for Marion and the rest till the little ones grow up,
į and a new generation begins its own troubles.
At Comb Leigh there is peace, and but little intercourse

fession for gout, but he has received the honour of a baro-

hrough an attack which threatened to fly to the stomach.
D:. Chacomb, who was called in at an early stage, manifested
she very greatest devotion throughout. He sat up for four
nights, without leaving the patient's bedside. He never left
it at all, in fact, till the danger was over, and the great man
safe. Then they knighted him. Of course, Dr. Porteous, of
Savile-row, declared that there never had been the slightest
danger; that the bulletins issued every two hours by his rival
were quite unnecessary ; and that all the racket was got up
by himself, for his own ends. How hateful a passion is envy!
Sir Joseph has never renewed his suit to Marion. He
kuows, indeed, that it would be useless. But there is no one
in the world in whose society he takes such pleasure, with
whom he is less cynical, or more hopeful of his fellow-crea-
tures. Like the wicked man, his eyes swell out with fatness;
but Sir Joseph is a wicked man no longer. Observe that,
like Fred, he has improved with prosperity. He owes not
only his success, but also his present virtue, to the artful
measures which I have had as historian to chronizle, and as
moralist to deplore. All my people, indeed-except Marion,
Adie, and Winifred-have been sinners; and nobody, some-
how, except poor Mrs. Spenser, has been punished for his
sins. My friends, it is only in copybooks that people get
punished in the material manner. There are some sins which
even carry their own reward, in the shape of prosperity, with
them. There are some, on the other hand, which carry their
own punishment. These latter, young candidate for worldly
success, find out and avoid. Fred, you see, who never would
work, any more than the Idle Apprentice, is comfortable and
happy, provided with the best of wives, and kept in affluence
by the painting of his sister. Gerald, who broke every pledge
of love and constancy, never felt any repentance, never knows
how great and glorious a woman ho threw away, never insti.
tutes comparisons between the present and the possible past,
and is perfectly happy with a wife of whom he is beyond
measure fond and proud. The doctor, who found a way to
greatness by paths tortuous and questionable, is on a pinnacle
of fame. Dicky Carew is really eminent in his new walk,
And even the second Mrs. Chacomb has been rewarded for
her bold stroke by a comfortable annuity.
Compensation? Yes. But, like the cow's tail, it does not
reach far enough. These sinners will never repent; they
will never be punished. All that the moral philosopher can

prophesy is that from time to time they may be reminded of
the past, and feel a pang of remorse or shame, sharp in direct
proportion to their present happiness.
Is Marion, the innocent scapegoat of ail the sins and mis-
fortunes of others, the only unhappy one?
No. Happiness—as people who have got everything they
want are fond of telling us-does not depend always on
obtaining what we vehemently desire. There is-only
preachers very seldom know anything about it—a happiness
independent of all human desires, which issues from the
higher, unselfish life. In the years to come, Marion sees a
long life of labour; but it is labour rewarded with some
honour, and sufficient pay. She will not be a great artist,
like Rosa Bonheur; but she will command a sale for her
works. She will not be remembered for ever, like Raffaelle ;
but she will please the better taste of the day, and advance,
by her purity, truth, and sweetness, the highest interests of
Art. Her house will not be lonely, for Winifred and the
children will light it up; with Fred—the lazy, careless Fred,
of whom his wife can never be too proud, or his sister too
fond.
And all shall love her alike. As the children read of
women to be worshipped, they shall think of Marion. When
they grow up, and can understand something of the mystery
and meaning of good works, they shall associate all good
works with Marion. When they hear of those who give and
spend for others, their thoughts will turn to Marion. She
has -as Mr. Owen was fond of saying-she has the fruit of
her own hands : her own works praise her in the gates.
There is a Crown for those who live for others, more glorious
than any wreath of the Nemæan games. Hers is the golden
HARP, with which to celebrate the victory over sorrow and
disappointment-the solution of the problem, insoluble to
the selfish world, the final triumph of Love over Pain.
