THE
MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER;
OR, THE
DAYS OF QUEEN BESS.
CHAPTER I.
By how much unexpected, by so much
We must awake endeavour for defence ;
For courage mounteth with occasion.
King JOAN,
IT was during the hostile period when the con-
tinued inroads of the borderers, whose course was
marked with death and devastation, called for the
utmost vigilance of the government, and rendered
the fortifying and garrisoning of the northern cas-
tles an object of the greatest importance, that lord
William, baron de Mowbray, received from his
sovereign, queen Elizabeth, the commission of
warden of the borders, appointed to controul and
chastise the moss-troopers, whose ravages had risen
to so alarming a height, as to attract the particu-
lar notice of those in power.
Placed in this dangerous but honourable situation,
he conceived if his indispensable duty to execute
the arduous employment entrusted to him with the
greatest promptitude. Accordingly, with all alac-

rity, he strengthened his residence by every means
in his power ; he erected a double wall, cut
trenches, and surrounded the whole by a deep moat,
over which a drawbridge led to a massy iron-cased
gate, and huge portcullis ; around the roof were
erected battlements planted with cannon; and over
these a garrison of three hundred men, selected from
his vassals, and trained by himself to arms, were
appointed to do duty.
The office upon which lord William had now en-
tered accorded but ill with those dreams of family
comfort in which he had hoped to pass the evening
of his days; but light was his repugnance to the
bloody business of the field of battle, when compared
with the heart of his motherless daughter, the beau-
teous and gentle Rosalind, which sickened in her
breast as she dwelt in imagination on the scenes of
blood and rapine to which she must now unavoid-
ably become a witness.
Lord William had scarcely completed his forti-
fications, ere he was called upon, by the voice of
danger, to an exertion of the greatest fortitude.
The clouds of evening were just closing in the
parting day, when the sentinel at the drawbridge
dispatched one of his comrades to the baron, with
information that a moss-trooper, sinking under fa-
tigue and famine, was lying at the foot of the bridge,
and imploring, in terms of the most vehement en-
treaty, to be permitted to see lord William, whose
life, he said, was in imminent danger.
Every moss-trooper was of course the decided

enemy of a man placed in a situation like that in
which lord William now stood—the prime foe, as it
were, of their ravaging bands ; and so strange did
the information appear to him, that he hesitated
for some moments how to reply to it.
Irwin, his first leader, thus addressed him-
“ The instance of an enemy passing over to the
side of his foe is by no means a singular one; it may
be caused by his having deserted, for a length of
time, from his own party, to whom he now fears to
return, dreading the chastisement due to his
crime ; it is also possible that it may be occasioned
by a prepossession for ours; and it is still more
probable, that the hope of future reward and pre-
ferment have been his inducements to this step.
Whatever the motive, a single individual is in-
capable of committing injury within our walls.
Let him, so please your lordship, be searched, to
prove whether he conceal about him
any
instrument
of death, which it may be his desperate purpose
to level at your person ; and this done, let him be
brought before you."
" But should he come merely as a spy upon our
strength?” suggested the wary baron : this is a
supposition which has escaped you."
" That will be easily discovered,” replied the
leader who had before spoken,
" and if such he
appears, we have chains and dungeons, to prevent
his carrying back the information that may be
required of him.”

on hers and my lost father's murderer. Admit
me to your ranks, and for iny own revenge I will .
be a lion in your cause, when opposed to the savage
Allanrod. You know not whom you have to fear
in Alanrod
; more of the demon than the man,
there dwells within him : wild, ungoverned, cruel,
and ferocious are his passions ; dire is his enmity
to England and its sovereign; but still more against
your person, than the nation, or its queen, does
his hatred appear to be directed ; for from the mo-
ment that he learnt the commission to which you
were appointed, he has been collecting forces to
subdue your power. His strength is now all raised;
I have watched him for the completion of my just
revenge, and the present hour alone is yours, to
save yourself from falling into his power, and mine,
to execute my vengeance on him. He is now on
his march towards your castle ; his forces now move
in divisions ; within three miles of your abode,
these divisions are to unite ; and so great are their
numbers, that fatal to you must be the event of the
day, if you once suffer them to gain this union. The
first division Allanrod heads himself. Do you march
out boldly then, and attack it on its way. Entire
victory must be yours, for small is the division he
leads; and their chief being once cut off, his other
forces will lose all spirit to attack your castle. Say
‘ay,' good baron, and the blow that levels Allanrod
shall be my own. I am no hypocrite, and I con-
fess that it is not for England, but against Allanrod,
I fight.”

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, 9
Lord William inquired of the young man, at
what distance from his castle he supposed the first
division of this Allanrod's troops might now be 2
He replied, that he had for some days past been
an unobserved spy of their progress, and that he
conjectured them to be now at the distance of about
thirty miles.—“Thus,” continued he, “according
to the speed they usually proceed at, they will
reach this castle by noon on the day following the
morrow.”
Lord William next demanded of him to point
out the exact route in which they were advancing.
This he readily answered, and particularized the
spots where he supposed the first division, headed by
Allanrod, would halt on that and on the following
night.
To the baron's questions of what had been the
rank, title, or name of Allanrod, before he had taken
upon him those he now bore ? the youth declared
himself unable to reply; and lord William then com-
manded him into safe custody. telling him that he
should deliberate on what use to make of the infor-
mation he had brought him.
Why the freebooter Allanrod should bear a greater
and acknowledged hatred to him, than even to the
government to which he was a rebel, was an enigma
which lord William found himself unable to solve.
He dismissed his attendants, and being left alone
with his leaders, submitted to their judgment the
propriety of following the advice given him by the
deserter from Allanrod's camp. -

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
All the leaders, and in particular Irwin, declared
it their opinion, that the tale of his misfortunes
had worn the appearance of having proceeded from
a heart unacquainted with deceit ; they could
see also, they said, no motive but his hatred to Al-
lanrod for the step he had taken, since in the very
moment he had declared himself on their side, solely
because they were the foes of Allanrod, he had not
endeavoured to impose himself upon them fora friend
to the English cause, which one well schooled in the
lessons of hypocrisy would doubtless have made his
first point of information, as the one most likely
to ingratiate himself into their favour.
The baron coincided in their opinion ; but there
were still two nights and a day before them for action
ere (as the deserter had said) the enemy could gain
the castle ; accordingly he determined to give the
present night to cool reflection upon his pillow,
and not to form his resolution till it was past.
Before he retired to his chamber, he again called
the youth into his presence ; again he heard his tale,
and was still more convinced that it appeared the
tale of nature and of truth ; so forcibly did the
countenance and emotions of Donald (for such
was the young man's name) present themselves as
vouchers for the veracity of his words.
Lord William arose with the dawn, resolved to
march and surprise the division of the enemy
headed by Allanrod, which the youth Donald had
described as the most advanced body in their
quarters that night.


## p. 11 (#31) ##############################################

Donald was again questioned on the strength
of this advanced body; and having positively asserted
that it consisted of not more than eighty men, lord
William resolved to take with him only one hun-
dred and twenty of his own soldiers, in order to
leave his castle in the better security during his
absence.
According to the custom in those days, his one
hundred and twenty companions, with their leaders
or captains, destined for this enterprise, and wholm
he had selected from amongst his best men, were
divided into fifty mounted as cavalry with match-
locks, forty foot with pikes and broad-swords, and
a body of about thirty archers and slingers, who
brought up the rear; these were intended to be
placed in ambush, and to commence the charge with
a shower of arrows on the first onset.
Every thing being prepared for their departure,
it was agreed, as the distance they had to journey
could not exceed fifteen, or at most eighteen miles,
to begin their march under cover of the night,
that they might have a greater chance of keeping
themselves concealed, and bursting upon the enemy
unexpectedly.
During the whole of the day, lord William had
been employed in superintending the preparations
for his march ; towards the approach of evening,
he entered the apartment of his daughter, to bid
her farewell previously to his departure. The
child of woe, he found the beauteous Rosalind
hanging over that lute, of which the tones had

no longer power to sooth her aching breast, where
eternal sorrow had settled its abode ; of the hue of
grief were her garments, like the colour of the for-
tune which had marked her fate; a sable robe
flowing to her feet alone composed her dress,
save the single band of pearls which confined its
folds round her waist; her light brown hair
hung in unrestrained tresses upon her shoulders ;
her blue and heavenly eyes were dimmed with weep-
ing; a faint tinge of the rose's hue still painted her
cheek, just sufficiently to recall to remembrance
how beautiful it had once been; and her neck
of milky whiteness, even, when not contrasted
with her sable robe, gained from it the pureness and
lustre of unfallen snow.
The baron took the hand of his daughter, and lead-
ing her back to the seat from which she had
arisen at his entrance, he placed himself by her
side. A silence of some minutes ensued; but the
eyes of each were eloquent. “ How happy had
been my life, had a daughter been obedient to my
will !” passed in the eyes of lord William ; and
“ How wretched has the exercise of parental
authority made his child !” in those of Rosalind.
“ You have doubtless heard, my Rosalind,” lord
William at last began, “ that the temper of the
times calls me from my castle ; the enterprise upon
which I am now setting out, I am taught to be-
lieve, is one of little hazard to the safety of my
troops or myself ; but the fate of the field is uncer-
tain, and however secure of victory in my opinion,

13
it may be the will of Providence that I shall never
return. Will my daughter vouchsafe a parting
embrace to a father whom she may never again
behold ?”
“ Heaven avert the evil that you mention !” re-
turned Rosalind. " You have been cruel, very,
very cruel to your only child ; but I cannot forget
that you are my father, though you have so severely
used the authority of a parent over a child towards
me.”
“ Should I return in triumph, the conqueror of
my sovereign’s foes wilt thou quit this garb of woe,
cast off these frowns of sorrow, and consent once
more to visit with me that court, of which thy
youth and beauty would be the grace, and to
which my gracious mistress has so oft invited
me to bring thee ?” asked lord William.
“ Do I ever, my father,” returned Rosalind,
reproach you with the miseries that load my
aching heart ?—do I ever breathe a sigh of malice
aimed at your feelings? Never, witness Heaven,
have I done this! be then the reward of my pa-
tient sufferings, that my future days be those of
obscurity!—force me not into busy life, where
my wretchedness would be exposed to the gaze of
every unfeeling eye. Oh, in this one point, 'tis all
that I have left to ask, do not constrain my
feelings !"
Lord William returned a cool reply to the re-
quest of his daughter, and then proceeded to inform
her that she need not be under any dread from the

incursions of the borderers during his absence, for
that he should leave the greater part of his strength
in the castle for her protection.
To life and death Rosalind was equally indiffer-
ent—thus with apathy she heard his declaration.
The first bugle was now sounded, for the body
of men who were that night to march out to
begin accoutring; on its sound, lord William rose
to quit his daughter's chamber; Rosalind rose
also, and throwing her arms round the neck of
her father, she imprinted on his cheek the first kiss
which her lips had for the last four years bestowed
on him.
Even into the eyes of lord William de Mowbray
the tear of parental affection started; he re-
turned her embrace, and would probably have
pronounced a blessing on her head, had he dared
to have blessed where his conduct had fixed a
curse. In unbroken silence he left the apartment.
He repaired to the castle hall, whither Donald
was again summoned to meet him. The youth
came forth, his appearance more composed, and
his strength renovated by the care which had been
bestowed on him. After a short and friendly con-
ference, the baron submitted it to his option,
whether he would join the party then preparing
to march, or whether he would prefer to await
the event of that night's encounter with Allanrod
and his men at the castle.—“Your late hard far-
ing,” said lord William, “has apparently rendered
you unfit for the march ; and were not this the

15
case, consider what you have to dread should you
be taken by Allanrod's party, and submitted to
the tyranny of his chastisement. All this you .
are risking, only to add to my strength one additional
arm, of which I am not in need, as I could increase
my numbers to three hundred, with ease to myself."
Donald thanked the baron for his consideration,
but was resolute in becoming the avenger of his own
wrongs.—" By this hand,” he exclaimed, “must
perish the murderer of my sister and my
father.”
Lord William, finding him earnest in his entrea-
ties, yielded to his prayer ; and an English soldier's
garb was given to him instead of the one which he
now threw off; a sword was girt by his side, a pike
put into his hand, and he was appointed to march
by the side of Irwin.
“ You are very young,” said lord William, who
was present at his equipment, and during that time
more particularly observed his features than he had
before done.
“ I have not yet seen quite twenty summers,”
Donald replied.
As his bonnet was exchanging for a cap corres-
ponding with his English dress, lord William again
addressed him-“I have somewhere met with a
countenance very much like yours, and did I not
know it to be almost an impossibility, I should
think that I had really seen you before ”
“ It is not improbable, my lord, replied Donald,
“ if you have travelled in Scotland ; the scenery
round Tiviotdale is much resorted to by strangers,

and my poor father and I have often been their
guides to its beauties.”
“I have been in Tiviotdale,” returned the baron,
“but it is some years ago, and I do not recollect
the particulars of my visit."
The second bugle was now sounded, and every
one dispersed, in order to be ready at the signal
for marching, which would very shortly be given.
Meanwhile the evening bell tolled, and the usual
guard of the castle was mounted on the ramparts.
The third bugle then sounded, and the two parties
having taken leave of each other, the massy gates
were unlocked, the drawbridge was let down, and
the cavalcade, headed by their chief, sallied forth.
The country lay before them wrapt in the stillness
of night ; no warlike instruments gave notice of
their march-all was secrecy and silence.
CHAPTER II.
What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete stool
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous, and us fools of nature,
So horribly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?
HAMLET.
For a length of time past, the fair Rosalind had
allowed herself no air or exercise but what she took
in an evening on the eastern rampart of the castle,

which led by an easy communication to the apart-
ments appropriated to her use. From this spot
she beheld the departure of her father and his cho-
sen men; she continued to watch the red glare
of their glowing torches, which, reflected on the
steel armour, threw its broad masses of light over
the whole body of men, till a narrow path, wind-
ing between two mountains, concealed them from
her view, and all traces of them, save a faint-
lustre which rose from their torches into the air,
were lost in the gloom of night. Then, reclining
her head on her hand, she leant over the battle-
ments, listening to their footsteps, which, owing
to the stillness of the night, were heard when they
themselves were no longer visible. At length they
died away also, and a solemn stillness prevailed,
broken only at intervals by the sentinels, relieving
each other from their posts, and the iron tongue of
the castle clock, which sounded awfully, by the con-
trast of the stillness in which it was heard.
Night was stealing upon evening, but still Rosa-
lind continued to wander in the air. The moon
was now rising in cloudless majesty, attended by a
sparkling train of glittering stars, and throwing her
silvery honours on the regal brow of Skiddaw,
monarch of the mountains; while an unruffled lake
at its foot, a rival of its glory, appeared like an im-
mense sheet of silver, studded with burnished gems.
Entranced by the scene she was beholding, Rosa-
lind stood wrapt in reflection.—“Why,” she cried,

“is man the only piece of mechanism which this
globe contains of whose nature discord forms a
part ? all above is harmony and peace—'tis but on
earth, where man has a sway, that discord has ex-
istence. The silver moon sails calmly through the
fleecy clouds, which separate obediently to clear her
azure path ; the stars, irregularly scattered through
the firmament, know no hostile jarrings to disturb
their movements or obscure their lustre. 'Tis now
the hour when nature asks repose : hushed are
the songsters of the grove, and every animal seeks
repose, but man-insatiate man alone awakes !
man that should be the brother and the friend of
man, awakes to plan the destruction of his fellow
beings; subject as he is to innumerable infirmities
of mind and body, short as is his own natural ex-
istence, he awakes to curtail a few moments of
his allotted portion of life from his fellow-creature;
Happy those who die, if this it be to live ! Oh,
ye bright orbs, that now reflect your beams on me,
say, do ye contain the dead within your blessed
abodes ?-are ye the resting places whence the de-
parted good look down on suffering mortals, and
waft to them those sighs of pity which communi-
cate fortitude to their bosoms under the trials of
existence? If such ye are, a sainted mother and a
murdered husband havetheir dwelling with you. Oh,
spirits of bliss ! if it be permitted you to administer
consolation to the living, twine your wreaths of
peace around my aching head; shed the balm of
comfort upon my bursting heart ; endue me with

resignation to the will of Omnipotence till the hand
of Death shall release me from anguish, and call
me to the blessed reward of meeting you again.”
Rosalind continued standing with her eyes fixed
on the planets to which her address had been di-
rected, her every thought lost in scenes far distant
from the spot on which she stood, till a faint sound,
which resembled her own name, made her start,
from the trance into which she had fallen, and look
hastily around her. She was at that time standing
on a projecting part of the rampart, which had an
opposite side, that encircled an angle of the castle ;
and upon this she either saw, or fancied she saw,
a dusky figure moving upwards, as if in the act of
rising from the glacis below. A momentary fear
seized her, but she had not been accustomed to
suffer childish apprehensions to subdue her reason,
and she exclaimed—“Who is that ?—what seek
you here 2" .
“It is only I, my lady—only Gertrude coming to
look for you,” returned a voice behind her, which
she instantly recognized to be that of her faithful
attendant—“it is only I my lady; whom did you
think it was 2.”
“I was rather startled by a shadow, I believe,”
replied Rosalind, and casting her eye towards the
spot where the appearance of a figure had before
struck her imagination, nothing but the unbroken
line of the massive wall now met her sight.
If you were startled at only seeing a shadow,
my lady, what must they be that see a real sub-

stantial ghost P” cried Gertrude. “I would not
have been in poor Philip’s place to-night for all the
wealth in the castle. Pray come in, my lady-don't
keep abroad; you don't know how dangerous it
is to stay here ; come in, and I'll tell you all about
it ; I came on purpose to warn you."
“ To warn me! of what, Gertrude ?” asked
Rosalind ; "and who is this Philip, of whom you
speak in terms of so great pity?”
Why, to be sure, my lady, though you do go
very little amongst the inhabitants of the castle,
you must have heard me speak of Philip Watkins ;
he was born in the same village where I was : it is
he that you have heard me say got such a terrible
thorn in his foot when he was getting me a black-
bird's nest; if you don't remember the story, I'll
tell it you again any other time; only it has no-
thing to do with the ghost Philip saw to night."
" Ghost !" echoed Rosalind, casting her eye invo-
luntarily to the spot where she conceived that she
had seen the appearance of a figure.
“Ay, my lady, a dreadful black ghost : did
you
never in
your
life happen to see a ghost yourself ?”
No,” replied Rosalind,“ nor any one else, I
believe who had the courage to convince their
senses of the delusion which they mistook for one."
Oh, my lady,” cried Gertrude, “ don't say so-
pray don't be so wicked; they don't belong to
this world, and should be respected. Old Ambrose
the porter has seen it before, and Simon Williams
saw it from the watchtower last night ; only I

never heard of it till Philip was brought into the
hall to-night in a fit at the sight of it. Pray, don't
stay here, my lady, pray don't ; I dare not keep
with you indeed, if you do, for it was on this side
of the castle that they both saw it walking ;” and
away she ran towards the door in the turret which
led to Rosalind's apartment, still calling upon her
to follow.
Rosalind complied, for the night was far advanced,
although its serenity would perhaps have tempted
her to have walked longer, had she not been inter-
rupted in the manner she had been. The moment
Rosalind was within the turret, Gertrude, who stood
waiting her approach with a lamp in her hand, shut
the door, and having fastened every bolt upon it,
she exclaimed" Thank Heaven we are safe in
the castle, and pray its goodness we may be safe,
now we are in it."
With the utmost good humour, Rosalind chid
her for her weak apprehensions, and endeavoured
by every argument to reason her out of her alarm
;
but the occurrences of the evening were at present
too strongly imprinted on the mind of Gertrude, for
it to be divested of them by the power of words
only, and she proceeded to relate her tale.
“ You must know, my lady” she said, “ that it
is now three evenings ago, as old Ambrose was return-
ing from the village, where he had been on a visit to
his sister-the poor old woman, my lady, at the foot
of the hill, that you may remember broke her leg
the day she was eighty, and that every body thought

must have died of it, and now she is quite finely
again, is not it a wonderful recovery ?”
Yes, it is,” answered Rosalind ; “ but proceed
in your story without interruption.”
“I am only explaining a little as I go on, my
lady,” resumed Gertrude. “ Well, old Ambrose
came hobbling along—he can't walk very fast, since
he has had the rheumatism-looking down on the
ground and picking his way for fear he should
stumble, when, just as he was turning the eastern
angle of the castle moat, he happened to lift
up
his
eyes, and there he saw, oh, mercy on us ! a tall
ghost, all in black from head to foot; and the mo-
ment he saw it, it vanished away from him in a
noise like the hissing of serpents !”
Probably,” said Rosalind,“ the old man's alarm
was occasioned by the shadow of a tree ; and the
motion of its leaves, agitated by the wind, created
the rustling noise he heard.”
No, no, no, no, my lady,” exclaimed Gertrude,
“ he might have been deceived once, but last night
he saw the very same appearance again, on the very
spot where he had seen it before, and it vanished
away from him again, just in the same manner ; this
was about eight o'clock in the evening; and now it
is come out that Simon Williams saw the very same
spectre at midnight, stalking backwards and for-
wards before the eastern rampart, where you were
walking this very night.
night. Heaven be praised I came
and called you away before the dreadful hour
strikes!”

Rosalind was silent; no faith in spirits was
growing in her mind, but the information conveyed
by Gertrude of the appearance of a figure in black
near the rampart seemed so strongly to vouch for
her senses not having deceived her in regard to the
dusky form which she had believed herself to have
seen that night, that she could not immediately
collect her thoughts to reply to Gertrude's account.
Gertrude mistook her silence for alarm, and ex-
claimed—“I wish I had kept it all a secret from
you, my lady, since I see how much it has fright-
ened you; for I know it will be impossible to with-
hold the rest of the story from you, now you
have
heard part of it; and what I have already told you
is nothing to what is to come about poor Philip.”
“I own I am rather surprised by what you
tell
me,” replied Rosalind—" frightened I assure you
I am not. Amidst the calamities which you know
I have suffered, you have always seen that I had
still consolation left me within my own breast ; it
arises from the consciousness that I have never
committed a voluntary fault; this knowledge is my
talisman against all fear. If there be spirits, either
good or evil, permitted to revisit the earth, I still
rely that the virtuous power is the superior, and
that the innocent will not be allowed to suffer for
their
appearance.”
" What a comfort it is to hear religious words
when one is terrified almost out of one's senses !”
exclaimed Gertrude.—“ Heaven bless you! you
talk as well as poor father Anthony did, rest his

soul !-Well, then, you won't be frightened to hear
with what art this black ghost managed to-night to
get into the castle-court, will you, my dear lady?”
“ If it had really been a spirit,” replied Rosalind,
" according to the nature of such aerial beings, it
need not have used the art you describe it to have
practised for introducing itself wherever it wished
to be: but proceed.”
Why you see, my lady,” said Gertrude, “ this
evening, when lord William and his troops left the
castle, many of our men who were not destined to
go upon this expedition, went over the draw-bridge
with their comrades, intending to march a little way
with them; but your father would not allow it, so
they were forced to return back to the castle. All
directly repassed the bridge but old Ambrose and
Philip; they stood chattering, Heaven forgive them
for it! on the other side, when, all on a sudden-
they don't know whence it came, nor whether it
walked, nor whether it flew, but all on a sudden, as
I said before, there stood before them this tall black
spirit, all in armour ; it had one foot upon the draw-
bridge when they first saw it. Poor old Ambrose
fell upon his knees and began to pray: Philip rushed
up to it, for he was terrified enough, as you may
well think, at the idea of what might become of him
if he suffered a ghost to go over the bridge while he
was the sentinel on it ; and was just presenting his
pike at it to prevent its proceeding, when it lifted
up its beaver, and they saw its face ; and oh, my dear
lady, what do you think it was ? the face of a corpse,

pale and emaciated, with a streak of blood down the
left cheek. Philip dropped down in a fit, old Am-
brose was stupified with fright and astonishment,
and the ghost walked over the bridge !"
Gertrude now paused for Rosalind's reply, who
said—“ Is that all you have to tell me ?”
“ All, my dear lady !” exclaimed Gertrude," and
is not that enough? the ghost, you see, has got
within our walls, and who knows what may be the
end of his visit. Poor Philip was brought into
the hall in fits, and is scarcely recovered from them
still, nor can I believe he ever will perfectly, for had
I seen such a dreadful—Oh, Jesus, what's that?”
cried she, interrupting herself in her story.
Only the clock striking midnight,” replied Rosa-
lind. “You see, by your present apprehensions,
how sounds we are the most accustomed to have
the power of startling us, when our minds are weak-
ened by tales of folly or superstition. Thus simply,
I make no doubt, might the ghost cf this night be
accounted for, if reason had been suffered to exert
her influence upon the minds of those who thought
they saw a phantom.”
Gertrude remained incredulous, and would pro-
bably have talked the whole night, of what she
krew nothing but from hearsay, that deceitful in-
telligencer, had not her mistress, by undressing
herself, and getting into bed, given her a signal of
silence for the night; and Gertrude was obliged,
though with great reluctance, to retire to the ad-
joining apartment, where her bed stood, and where

she was compelled either to hold her tongue or
talk to herself: the latter she preferred, probably
for the same reason that boys whistle in a dark night
upon the road, that they may hear no noise but their
own ;
and thus Gertrude fairly talked herself to
sleep.
Rosalind, although free from every apprehension
that agitated the mind of her loquacious attendant,
did not so soon lose reflection in sleep; for although
she had no faith in the supernatural existence of
the black figure that had appeared to Ambrose and
his companions, still she could not forbear making
it. a subject of thought, and attaching to it some
degree of credit, from the similarity of their account
of the phantom, to the sable form which had that
night appeared to her on the eastern rampart.

And now, whilst lord William and his party are
on their march, and his daughter Rosalind locked in
the arms of sleep, we will step back a few years,
for some particulars which are necessary to be
learnt, before we proceed in our story.
The first of the De Mowbray family on whom the

honour of knighthood was bestowed was John ; he
received it in the field, at the hand of Edward
the Third, under which prince he signalized him-
self by his bravery at the famed battle of Cressy, in
which battle the earl of Flanders fell by his hand;
and on his return to England, he was farther
rewarded by being created a baron, and receiving
from the crown the gift of an extensive domain in
Cumberland. …
From this time the family of De Mowbray was
constantly about the court; its character was that
of wariness rather than depth of understanding;
and it was a quality which it so used as to protect
itself from all the storms of court intrigue, and to
hold itself in favour with each succeeding mon-
arch. - -
At the period of the death of Edward the Sixth,
the situation of the De Mowbrays, for the first time,
seemed in a state of doubt: fate appeared undecided
whether to place the crown on the head of the am-
bitious Mary, or that of the placid Jane Grey; and
during this indecision trembled the house of De
Mowbray, who being universally known and acknow-
ledged as adherents, and firm ones too, to the Pro-
testant religion, dreaded the accession of Mary to
the throne; but the wariness of lord William's
father, Thomas, exerted itself with success to re-
establish their safety. . . . .
Convinced that a hasty change from the Protes-
tant to the Catholic religion would not impose on
the keen-sightedness of a princess like Mary—that

though she might appear to tolerate them for such
a change, still the natural fire of her temper might
only be smothered till an oppportunity should
present itself for her to revenge on them the reli-
gious persuasion which she would believe them in
their hearts still to follow; he wisely conceived that
some effort must he made, some step taken, by
which he should purchase her favour, without any
obligation to ideas of religion.
Accordingly, perceiving that Jane was too coldly
received as queen, to be likely long to hold her seat
upon the throne, he kept himself retired from all
public observation of his opinions, till he should see
her established upon it, or Mary in her stead fixed
upon the seat of power; and no sooner had the
unambitious Jane resigned all pretensions to the
sceptre of royalty, than lord Thomas de Mowbray,
with every display of zeal in the cause of the new
monarch, joined the party who arrested the duke of
Northumberland and several of his adherents at
Cambridge; and having assisted in conducting these
objects of Mary's inplacable hatred to the Tower,
and taken steps that it should be understood by her
that he had been thus active in her cause, he con-
tented himself with retiring for the remainder of
her reign into his native county, where he had
the good fortune never to be disturbed by the bigotry.
of the queen, as he believed, and as probably was
the case, in return for the shew of service he had
made to her on her accession to the throne of Eng-
land. -

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, 29
In the same year that was marked by the death
of queen Mary, died also lord Thomas de Mow-
bray, and his successor was his son William, to
whom our readers are already introduced, and who
was then in his twenty-third year. Lord William's
person was rather commanding than handsome ; his
complexion dark, and his eye keen, though it con-
veyed neither the intelligence of a depth of under-
standing, nor a conciliating disposition; his mind was
formed in the true mould of his predecessors, the
nursery of wariness and craft; and with the re-esta-
blishment of the Protestant religion, stepped forth
De Mowbray, vaunting himself not a little on being
the head of a family which had not swerved from
its religious tenets, during the whole period of the
last reign of persecution.
Elizabeth, although possessed of a solid and re-
fined judgment, had a foible, which opened a way
to her heart for lord William de Mowbray; with
her it was a sin in those whom she permitted about
her person, and these with her were intimates,
for confidants she had none, to arrogate to them-
selves the slightest degree of that authority which
she considered, and was resolved to maintain, hers
alone and indivisibly; and lord William possessed
both the art of flattery, and the meanness of lick-
ing the dust she trod on, with an ingenious policy,
that concealed his views, and displayed only his
humble sentiments of adoration and loyalty.
Thus placed amongst the favourites of his queen,
lord William dreamt not of love, his thoughts

being solely placed upon the aggrandizement of his
power and wealth, till Elizabeth recommended to
him to wife Ann Cecil, a woman of exquisite.
beauty and accomplishments, the orphan niece of
her favourite minister, Cecil, afterwards lord Bur-
leigh. To this proposition no man could return a
negative whose heart was disengaged; here was the
double inducement of person and fortune for it to
fix upon, and the queen herself became the nego-
eiator of the marriage : it was solemnized at her
court with the utmost splendour; and after the cere-
mony, she hung upon the bride's neck a chain
of diamonds, adding, that she pledged herself to be-
come the sponsor for their first child, if a female.
Lord William now hugged himself indeed, in the
reflection of the use he had made of that policy
so truly the talent of his family; and Elizabeth, if
ever she perceived the colours of self-interest shin-
ing through the veil of loyalty which he hung over
them, had too good a knowledge of administerial
economy, to confess a discovery which, for the credit
she owed to herself as queen, if confessed, must
rob her of so valuable an assistant at the helm of
State. -
Lady Ann de Mowbray was all gentleness and
virtue; more attached to the solitude of her castle,
its gardens, and adjoining woods, than to the gaities
and festivity of the court.
Lord William's time was divided between his
sovereign and his wife; and Elizabeth was satis-
fied that he had hers and his country's interest too

much at heart, ever to be absent, when either called
upon him for his services.
About a year after her marriage, lady de Mow-
bray became pregnant, and at the accustomary time
she gave birth to a daughter. Again fortune smiled
upon lord William, and he flew to bear the informa-
tion in person to the queen.
Elizabeth reminded him, in the most flattering
terms, of her promise in regard to the child; and
bidding him not delay the christening longer than
was necessary to the health of the mother, as she
was eager to visit Cumberland, which was a new
country to her, sent him back without delay to at-
tend the recovery of his wife.
The baron returned home, where he was busied
not less in assuring himself that every care was
taken of the babe on whose head honours, undreamt
of by its infant brain, were going to be poured, than
in those preparations which he conceived it neces-
sary to have made against the royal visit.
lo the chapel of the castle was erected a canopy
of purple velvet, fringed with gold, under which
the queen alone was to have her place during the
ceremony of the baptism ; and into the most superb
chamber of the castle, was introduced a bed of crim-
son velvet, richly embroidered with the royal arms
in gold and jewels; the hangings of the chamber
were of tapestry, purposely worked for the occa-
sion, and in the centre compartment, opposite to the
foot of the bed, was this device.—“ Rejoice, ye
walls which have entertained her people's blessing,

and her people's pride—ELIZABETH !" The rest of
the apartment was divided into four sections. In
the 'first was depicted Commerce, in the second
Agriculture, in the third Peace, and in the fourth
Plenty; the whole superscribed---" England in
1565."
The infant daughter of de Mowbray having
attained the age of six weeks, and her mother being
sufficiently recovered in strength to attend at the
ceremony of her baptism, lord William set out for
London, whence he intended himself to become a
part of his royal mistress's escort into Cumber-
land. He found the queen prepared to attend his
invitation, and a few days after his arrival she set
out.
Queen Elizabeth was in person extremely pleas-
ing, if not critically beautiful ; and there was besides
a certain majesty in her manner, which made her
look the queen she was ; added to this was an en-
gaging affability in her conduct, that endeared her
to her subjects, and won her the esteem of her
people: no wonder then, that thus extolled through
her kingdom, the homage, the reverence, and the
marks of affection, which she received in every town
and village through which her journey lay, kept her
in excellent good humour and spirits, and brought
her to de Mowbray Castle, prepared to be pleased
with her reception, had it not been equally splen-
did and flattering as she found it.
Her congratulations to lady de Mowbray were of
the most affectionate and complacent nature, her

inquiries after her infant god-daughter the most
flattering to lord William, and her affable conduct
throughout the household such as gained her its
universal adoration.
The day for the baptism being arrived, lord Wil-
liam, in the most adulating terms, ventured to in-
quire of her Majesty, whether the infant, in whose
early fate she was condescending to take so strong
an interest, might be honoured by receiving the
name of her Sovereign? Elizabeth replied to the
question as if she had foreseen that it would be sub-
mitted to her decision; and her reply won the heart
of lady de Mowbray, as strongly as she was already
possessed of lord William's. “No,” she said, “your
daughter's name must not be Elizabeth ; I do not
withhold it from you from any motive of pride, but
out of consideration to your wife. Lady de Mow-
bray never knew but one parent—that one was her
mother; of her she was extremely fond, and being
deprived of her, I know she will derive much
satisfaction from giving the name of her parent to her
daughter; therefore let her be named Rosalind.”
Lord William bowed, and affected gratitude for
her command ; lady de Mowbray felt it with all the
warmth of an affectionate daughter, who really
venerates a lost parent, and wishes to perpetuate
her memory
Lord William had certainly been better pleased
if the queen had waved the compliment which she
had paid to his wife's feelings. The name of Eliza-
beth he would infinitely have preferred; it would

have appeared, though indeed it were only appear-
ance, to have allied his child to her whose name
she would then have borne; the queen, however,
was still her godmother; and to this reflection he
reconciled his mind.
The name of Rosalind was accordingly given to
the child—Elizabeth imprinted the first kiss on her
Christian god-daughter, and put into the hands of
her father a purse of five thousand marks of gold, as
the dower of her nominal child. -
The day was passed in the utmost festivity at the
castle : no brow could wear the frown of care or dis-
pleasure, where a benign sovereign set the example
of smiles; and real happiness gave lustre to the
wine which sparkled in the golden goblets, and in-
fused soul into the revelry that resounded in the hall
of De Mowbray Castle, on the day of fair Rosa-
lind's christening.

queen Elizabeth concluded her advantageous treaty
of commerce with John Basilowitz, great duke of
Muscovy, and lord William's presence was demanded
at court during the negociation.
Lady de Mowbray had not quitted the county
in which her castle stood since the birth of her
daughter, and the baron had been nearly six months
absent from them, when a day of hard-travelling
brought him, at the close of a sultry evening in the
month of September, to a wood within three miles
of the borders of his own estate. He was on horse-
back, attended only by two servants; the blackness
of the clouds foretold a thunder-storm, and he spur-
red on his steed, in the hope of reaching his castle
before the tempest should rise to the violence which
the appearance of the sky threatened: large heat-
drops were already falling, though it could scarcely
be said to rain, and short gusts of wind, rustling be-
tween the trees, announced the elemental war at
hand. -
He urged his horse into a swifter pace, but the
tempest was more rapid in its movements; the
vivid lightning began to stream in forky spires along
the burning sky, and the thunder to roar amongst
the surrounding mountains. Still partial drops of
rain only were falling, and lord William still spurred
on his horse; but suddenly, with a tremendous crash,
a thunderbolt burst nearly over his head, and a
ball of fire, which dropped from it, fell upon a knot
of trees, at the distance of but a few yards from
him; an instant conflagration cmsued, and the wind,

which was rapidly increasing in strength, bore along
the flakes of fire in every direction. Lord William
was himself startled at the sight, but his steed was
terrified beyond the baron's power to govern him.
Darting into the thickest of the forest, the animal
flew with the swiftness of an antelope, carrying his
alarmed rider through almost impenetrable passes,
and wounding his head against the hanging branches
of those trees between the boles of which he flew
with him. Still lord William continued to keep
a firm seat, till a violent flash of lightning again
caused the horse to start out of his path, and with
this motion his rider fell from him -
Lord William lay for some time almost insen-
sible; his head was much bruised, and the pain he
felt in it was violent. On his endeavouring to move,
a still worse discovery took place; he found that he
had broken his leg. His attendants had been sepa-
rated from him ; they must be uncertain where to
seek him; his voice could not be heard at the dis-
tance of a stone’s-throw from him, in the raging
contention of the elements; and his case appeared,
for the present at least, hopeless.
Night had almost assumed her sablest hue, and
none of heaven's luminaries shone forth to alleviate
his distress, save the lightning, which continued
to dart through the atmosphere with unabated fury;
and by its flashes he discovered that he was lying
very near to the brink of a piece of water, which
by its situation he knew to be a small lake to the
southward of his castle; and he felt an immediate

sensation of gratitude arise in his mind, at having
been providentially saved from plunged into it.
His pains increased, but still the roar of nature's
discord gave him no opportunity to call for assist-
ance, and he was also unacquainted whether his
cries were likely to bring him help; for as this lake
was situated at a distance from the high road, it
was a long time since he had visited it, and he
was quite ignorant whether there were any cottages
in its neighbourhood. One only assurance gave
him comfort; this was, that his attendants would
beyond all doubt call numbers to their aid, and not
relax in their search till they had found him.
Thus passed full an hour, and patience urged by
pain, began to lose its virtue. He called aloud for
help, and the thunder, which was now receding in
hollow murmers to the distant mountains, left spaces
of silence for his cries. The lightning also was now
but a faint shadow of its former fierceness, and the
stars were beginning to start from the cleared sky,
whose fullness had before impeded their appearance;
by the faint light which they gave, he discovered
something like a habitation at some distance from
him, and imagined that he could perceive the faint
gleam of a lamp within it, the apparent dimness of
whichseemed to be accounted for by its being placed
at a great distance from the casement.
Again and again he called, the light glided nearer
to the window, and then vanished. He called again
with all the strength he could exert; the door of

the cottage was opened, and a figure appeared at it
with a lamp in its hand. The figure paused, as if
uncertain whether it had been deceived, or had really
heard a voice. Lord William repeated his entrea-
ties for assistance, and the figure, which he quickly
saw to be that of a man, advanced towards him.
In few words, the baron explained to him his
name, and the accident that had befallen him, en-
treating his care and humanity till he could be
conveyed to his own mansion.
The stranger was a man of about fifty-five years
of age, of an open and interesting countenance; his
dress was that of a shepherd, but his manners were
those of higher birth; he looked with the utmost
compassion on lord William, and still forbore to
reply, to his request, or to give him help.
“Will you not serve me?—have you no pity
for my sufferings?” asked the baron.
“Shall I go instantly to your castle, and bring
some of your vassals hither ?” asked the stranger.
“The distance is four miles,” replied lord Wil-
liam, “and should you leave me here, to go upon
that errand, wounded as I am, I may perish in the
damps of the night.”
“I hope not,” returned the stranger: “Heaven
avert it !”
“Cannot you take me into your cottage?” asked
the baron: “you look compassionate, but you

" to bear you to my cottage alone; and you can-
not lend yourself the least assistance with your
limb thus disabled.”
“ Is there no one but yourself in the cottage ?”
inquired lord William.
I'll bring you something to comfort you,” said
the stranger hastily, after a short pause, which ap-
peared to convey a doubt how to answer, and was
moving away.
Oh, for Heaven's sake, do not leave me thus !"
exclaimed de Mowbray ; " I will reward you libe-
rally if you will procure assistance to carry me from
the wet ground to shelter.”
“ I never was paid in my life for an act of huma-
nity,” returned the man ; but I can do no more than
I can."
“Can no assistance be procured ?-is yours
the

“ The only one within two miles,” was the
answer.
“ And you are quite alone in it ?”
“ If I were to bring a boy of eight years old to
help me, I don't believe we together could lift
Fou"
“ If you have only such a boy in your cottage,
pray make the attempt,” returned lord William ;
you know not what I am suffering."
" Nor do you know now much I suffer,” returned
the man; “ It is very contrary to my nature to
hesitate about serving my fellow creatures.' He
paused again; then added—“ However unwillingly,

I must leave you here a few minutes; but, by my
soul! I will return to you as speedily as I can;"
and so saying, he moved hastily towards the cot-
tage.
Lord William followed him with his eyes; he
saw him enter the cottage, and having for a mo-
ment lost sight of the lamp, it again appeared in
an upper apartment; here it remained visible for at
least ten minutes, and then again it vanished, and
was quickly seen below advancing towards the door:
the stranger came out first, the lamp still in his
hand, and close upon his heels trod another man,
wrapped in a long cloak; the latter continued
standing in the door way, and the man who had before
been with lord William came again to him.
“Lord william,” he said, “if I consent to intro-
duce you at this moment into my cottage, will you
swear to me, that whatever you may see within it,
or whomsoever you may see in it, you will never
disclose having seen to the world? These are the
only terms upon which you can enter it.”
The demand was strange, but the torture of the
baron's head and leg was such as urged him to any
promise for the barter of friendly assistance, and he
swore to comply with the stranger's requuest.
“I have one more condition,” said the man,
“that you will suffer me to tie this bandage before
your eyes, which shall be taken off the moment
you are placed on a bed in my cottage: if you con-
sent to this, a word from me will bring the person
whom you see yonder to my assistance in carrying

you to the cottage, and you shall be treated there
with every tenderness due to your sufferings; but if
you attempt to remove it, that moment, heedless
of your wounded state, we drop you upon the
- ground, and further calls upon our assistance are in
vain.”
De Mowbray would probably have complied
again, had not distant lights, and voices calling
loudly on his name, turned his attention from the
terms to which he had been on the point of agree-
ing; and he replied to them with all his strength,
while the stranger by his side exclaimed, in accents
that seemed to proceed from the bottom of his heart
—” Are these your lordship's attendants 2—Hea-
ven be praised that they are at hand I’”
Immediately on the sound of voices, the man who
stood in the doorway of the cottage disappeared,
and the door was closed. In a few moments, lord
William's attendants were by his side, and the
stranger explained to them the mangled state in
which their master lay.
The two men who had been separated from De
Mowbray in the tempest, having in vain sought him
in the wood till nightfall had put a period to their
search, dreading that some fatal accident had be-
fallen him, had proceeded to the village, which was
little more than a mile from the spot where the ball
of fire had fallen; and having here collected toge-
ther a number of the peasantry, to whom they re-
lated their fears for their lord's safety, had returned

into the wood with firebrands, with which they had
separated into different paths in search of him.
A litter was immediately composed of the boughs
of trees; and upon this lord William being ex-
tended, with a bed of moss to rest his broken limb
on, his vassals proceeded with him towards his
castle.
Melancholy was the meeting for lady de Mow-
bray, but she allowed not the idle indulgence of her
own sorrow to unfit her for the attention she owed
to a suffering husband. The surgeon of the house-
hold was instantly by the side of lord William's bed,
and the fracture having been set and bound up, and
the bruises on his head dressed, lady de Mowbray
became his nurse, refused to quit his chamber during
the whole of the night.
Thus did she pass the second, third, and fourth
nights; but with the fifth, the privation of rest to
herself became wholly unnecessary, as lord William's
recovery promised to be as speedy as the nature of
his wounds would permit, the surgeon declaring
him entirely free from danger. -

CHAPTER V.
No wealth had ho-no garland of renown ;
slow pass'd the minutes thro' the livelong day,
*Till from the uplan 1 mead, or thistled down,
lie watch'd the sun's last lustre fade away ; -
And if, perchance, his little heart was gay,
It beat to hear some merry minstrel's note,
Or goatherd carolling his roundelay
On craggy cliffs. MRs. Robinsow.
IN the course of three months, lord William de
Mowbray had recovered the use of his limb, although
he could not yet exercise it with the firmness he had
once been accustomed to do.
Often during his confinement had he reflected
on the strange occurrences which had attended the
evening of his receiving the fracture which now
confined him to his castle. The apparent feeling
of the stranger for his situation, with his reluc-
tance to introduce him into his cottage, furnished
a frequent subject for his thoughts. Lord William
had bound himself by an oath never to have dis-
closed any particulars which he might have seen in
the cottage, had he been conveyed into it; and by
the same sacred promise, he regarded himself to
be bound not to send any one to the cottage upon
the business of scrutiny; for although lord William
did not always pay strict observance to the com-
mands of honour, where the overstepping of their

bounds promised advancement to his own views
or desires, still it was not his nature to trespass
wantonly upon the comforts or secrets of an humble
cottager. What appeared the strangest part of
the mystery was, that the man at first should have
given him to understand that he had only a boy of
eight years old within the cottage, and that, imme-
diately after, a figure of full stature should have
appeared at the door, for whose sake it seemed
probable that the terms of secresy to which he
had been enjoined were made, as the man who had
come to his relief had used no endeavour to conceal
his own countenance, but had mentioned the ban-
dage to be placed before the baron's eyes as the
condition of the other's coming to his assistance.
One of the men who had been lord William's at-
tendants on the night of the tempest, was that Am-
brose who was now grown into years, and the pre-
sent porter of the castle: he was a native of the
neighbouring village, had lived in the service of the
late lord Thomas, and had often been honoured by
being made the companion of lord William's sports
when a boy; hence the distance between master
and servant had not been so rigidly preserved be-
tween the baron and him, as with his other at-
tendants; and contriving one day to have him alone
with him in his apartment, he began his enquiries
thus :-" That cottager whom you found by my
side on the night that I fell from my horse was a
kind civil man : who is he, Ambrose ?- do you know
him?"


## p. 45 (#65) ##############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 45
“Merely by report,” replied Ambrose : “the
nearest cottage to his, and that is at the distance of
about two miles, belongs to an aunt of mine; I have
heard her mention that she had such a neighbour,
and she called him Matthews.” -
“What did she say of him 2" asked lord William.
“Very little so please your lordship,” answered
Ambrose; “they live too far from each other to
have much intercourse.” -
“Has he any family 2—is he married ?” went on
de Mowbray. , -
“He has been,” replied Ambrose, “for I recol-
lect that I have heard my aunt speak of his grand-
son, Edward.”
This was all Ambrose knew ; thus lord William
was obliged to suspend his inquiries. After a pause,
he said—“Take this purse—carry it to Matthews—
tell him that it is sent to him by lord William de
Mowbray, in gratitude for his assistance on the
night which he cannot fail to remember, and that
my services are at his command.”
Ambrose received the purse, and was leaving
the chamber to obey his master's directions.
“Ambrose,” said lord William, “if you should
pass near the cottage of your aunt, step in, and in-
quire if she knows whether the situation of Mat-
thews is such that my farther assistance might be
acceptable to him. There was something in his
countenance that prepossessed me that night in his
favour, and this prepossession is not a little chhanced
by the recollection that he tendered me his help in
the hour of my necessity.”


## p. 46 (#66) ##############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
Ambrose now departed, and the baron impa-
tiently awaited his return; so natural is it to the
mind of man to wish to undraw, if it be but a single
thread of the veil which obscures any occurrence
that has met its knowledge in the guise of mystery.
Ambrose performed his lord's commands, but he
reversed their order in the execution of them, by
going first to the cottage of his aunt. Here the
conversation, as it is natural to conclude, began
with an account of where he was going next, and
upon what errand.—" Ah !" cried dame Tabitha,
“old Matthews is a charming man! so worthy, it
does one's heart good to hear him talk ; and so
sensible, he is as entertaining as a history.”
“Where could a shepherd gain so much learn-
ing ?” inquired Ambrose.
“ He is no shepherd,” cried dame Tabitha ; "he
lives upright on his means.”
“ Indeed ?” said Ambrose ; " and how many
has
he to maintain on what he possesses ?”
Only himself and his grandson,” was the reply;
“a boy of about eight years old, or a little more.
Poor man! he has outlived all his relations, as he
told
me, but this boy: pray the saints he live to
be a blessing to him, and that the good man may
not have to go to his grave without one of kin or
kind to follow him !”
“But as he is neither shepherd nor husbandman,
why does he live in this lonely spot ?” asked Am-
brose.
“May not it be his pleasure to live in solitude ?”
returned the dame ; "he never told me, and what

right have I to question him on his actions 2 He
has lived in the world, as I have found from the
discourse I have had with him; and most likely he
has seen enough of its ways to be weary of them
as I am, and as you will be, before you come to
my years, though you are so fond of gadding to
court with your lord now.” -
Here Ambrose would have chatted away on the
delights of the metropolis, had not Tabitha inter-
rupted him with—“Ay, ay, all very well while you
are young—there's a time for all things; when
you are my age, you'll think as I do. Come, go
your way to Matthews, or you'll not get home
again before midnight.”
Ambrose drank another cup of his aunt's mead,
and departed. -
He trudged on without any adventure for the
first mile : he had still full half another to go, and
had just jumped over a ditch, which led him by
a nearer way through a copse to the cottage of
Matthews than the high road did, when he heard
the sound of voices close by him. He stopped to
listen whence they proceeded, and perceived, at
a short distance from where he stood, Matthews
sitting upon the stump of a tree, with his back
towards him, and his grandson, Edward, on the
ground by his side, and cutting something out of
the branch of a tree, which he soon found the
youth intended for an imitation of a pike.
A cluster of bushes formed a tolerable skreen
between them and Ambrose ; and creeping to
where their foliage was the thickest, he paused a

few moments, with the desire of overhearing what
subject their conversation was upon.
Why should I not be brought up to be a
soldier ?” asked the boy ; “I shall never be happy
till I learn the use of arms.
I know I am too young
to go to battle and fight yet, but I might be learn-
ing how it is done.”
“ Time enough to learn that,” replied Mat-
thews, " when thy strength is equal to its toils and
hardships. What canst thou wish for beyond the
enjoyments of peace and plenty, that thou hast in
life? Is there aught left thee to desire ?”
“Oh yes,” returned the boy, “and I am sure
you can't be angry with me for telling you so,
since you have always charged me never to con-
ccal my thoughts from you. I should like-oh,
how I should like, if the great baron that lives at
the castle yonder would but take me to be one of his
pages !”
“Do you then wish to leave me, Edward ?”
asked the old man.
“Oh no, that I don't,” returned the boy ;
“ but I have heard you say
that
you
understand the
use of arms; perhaps lord William would give
you employment too."
“ No, no, my child,” returned Matthews, “my
days of strength are past; thine are not yet come;
we are both unfit for what thy inexperience longs
us to be practising.”
" Wha! a’n't I fit to be a page? I am almost
nine years old.”

No, Edward,” said Matthews,“
you must not
be the page of the proudest baron in the realm.”
“How oddly you talk ! you are always telling
me how bad it is to be idle, and when I want
employment you oppose my seeking it.”
The old man did not reply.
“Was my father a soldier ?” asked Edward.
“Yes he was,” replied Matthews.
“ And he was your son, and you let him be a sol-
dier? I think, if he was alive, he would have let
me be one too. Did he die in battle ?”
Matthews rose from his seat, and Ambrose di-
rectly sprang from his concealment, and moved up
to him.—“I was on my way to your cottage, sir,"
said he, addressing the old man, “I come from the
baron de Mowbray, who sends you this purse, in
requital for the assistance you rendered him on the
night when his leg was broken by a fall from his
horse.
“I would,” returned Matthews with emphasis,
" that it had been in my power to have afforded
him relief adequate to the feelings of my
heart !”.
He paused, and then proceeded thus :-“I have
taken means to inform myself of lord William's
health, and it gives me extreme satisfaction to learn
his amendment. Return him my most grateful
acknowledgments for his intention in sending me
the purse, but I must decline the acceptance of it.
Say also, that I shall seek a time to thank him more
fulls.”
“Let us go to the castle and thank him," ex-

claimed Edward, “and then perhaps we shall see
the soldiers performing their exercise.”
“Good night, sir,” said Matthews; “I pray you
execute my message punctually;” and having said
this, he took the hand of Edward, and walked
away from Ambrose.
The baron awaited impatiently the return of
his messenger, and when he arrived at the castle, he
was instantly admitted into his lord's apartment.
Ambrose related with exactness all that had
passed between him and his aunt, as also the con-
versation which he had overheard from his covert
behind the bushes, and his subsequent one with
Matthews, and then retired.
When reclined on his pillow, the baron felt a
stronger inclination than ever to gain an expla–
nation of what had appeared mysterious to him on
the night of his accident. From Matthew's words
—“that he should seek a time to thank him more
fully,” he conceived it possible that he might only
be wanting an apt opportunity to explain to him,
what he had witnessed; and he accordingly resolved,
as soon as he was able to go the distance, to call in
person at Matthews's cottage, under pretence of
making his verbal acknowledgments to him.
In about three weeks lord William was able to
put his design into execution, and taking with him
only Ambrose, he set out on his visit to the cottage
by the side of the lake.
It was now the middle of January, the weather
cold and frosty; the baron was on horseback, and

Ambrose walked by his side. At the distance of
about a quarter of a mile from Matthew's cottage,
lord William looking forward, said—“Who is that
comes running towards us ?”
“ It is Matthews's grandson,” replied Ambrose ;
"and see, my lord, he observes us, and quickens his
pace.”
In a few moments they met.—"Oh, sir,” ex-
claimed Edward, addressing Ambrose, “how very
glad I am to meet you ! I was coming to the castle ;
my poor grandfather is taken so ill that he thinks
he is going to die, and I am running to the castle
with a message from him to implore the good baron
to come and visit him. Do you think he will con-
descend to comply with my grandsire's request ?”
“ Set your heart at ease, my boy,” returned the
baron; “ lord William will be at his cottage in a few
minutes—I myself am he.” So saying, the baron
dismounted from his horse, and telling Ambrose
he should walk the rest of the way to the cottage,
directed him to mount and make all possible speed
back to the castle, and return without delay to
Matthews's cottage with the surgeon of his house-
hold.
Ambrose obeyed his directions, and the baron
walked on with Edward.
“ Has your grandfather been ill long ?” asked
lord William.
'Only since yesterday evening; but he says he
is sure he is going to die,” replied the boy, the tears
rolling down his chceks.


## p. 52 (#72) ##############################################

52 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
“You love your grandfather, I see,” said the baron.
“I have never known any body else to love,”
returned Edward ; “I have never known either
friend or relation but him, and should he die, I
have nobody to care for me or to protect me.”
“ Come, come,” said the baron, “do not fear the
worst; he may yet recover, and live many years.”
“Oh no, I fear not,” returned the boy; “when I
left him just now, he trembled and shivered so
much, I scarcely expect to find him alive when I
get back, though I left him sitting over the hearth;
and I had piled all he wood upon it that it would
hold too; but nothing could warm him.”
A very short time brought them to the cottage;
Edward ran in first.—“Oh, he is dead, he is dead!”
exclaimed the youth, and threw himself in anguish
upon the floor, on which the old man had fallen from
his seat during his absence, and on which he now
lay senseless.
“You alarm yourself too much,” said the baron,
who had followed Edward close upon his heels;
“he is not dead—he breathes still.”
“But he will die, I am sure he will,” cried Ed-
ward.
“Let us replace him in his seat,” said lord Wil-
liam, “and endeavour by simple means to keep
life in him, till one shall arrive who better under-
stands the operations of nature.”
They succeeded in placing him on his chair, and
Edward, by the baron's directions, bathed his tem-
ples and the palms of his hands; after some time

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 53
he opened his eyes, and threw them wildly around
without any expression: at length they settled on
lord William. On seeing him, the blood mantled in
his cheeks, his lips moved as if he would have
spoken, but no sound proceeded from them; with
much difficulty he raised his hand, and pointed to-
wards Edward; the tear of supplication stood in
his eye, and he kept it fixed on lord William.
“Is it my protection for that boy you wish to
ask?” said de Mowbray.
Again Matthews struggled with greater violence
than before to speak; the exertion overpowered him
quite, and he sunk back in his chair.
“Now he is dead, and I have no friend left me !”
exclaimed Edward, falling at his feet, and burying
his face between the old man's knees.
Lord William thought as the youth did, but he
forbore to confirm his fears by letting fall his own
suspicions: earnestly did he pray for assistance from
his castle; and as the time passed on, and no signs
of animation were visible in Matthews, he began to
conclude that it would indeed come too late.
From what was just past, it was evident to the
baron that Matthews's motive in sending for him
had been to implore his protection for his grand-
son; but might it not have been possible, he
thought, that if the power of speech had been per-
mitted to him, he might have had some secret of
moment to disclose to him—some discovery to
make—some explanation to convey, relative to the
mystery of that night on which he had before seen

him? It was still possible that the art of physic
might recall the dying embers of his life into a
momentary blaze, before they should be extin-
guished for ever; and his anxiety for the arrival of
the surgeon swelled the minutes into hours. At
length he came, escorted by Ambrose. Matthews
was not yet dead, he pronounced, but the hand of
death was upon him. -
Ambrose and the surgeon conveyed him to his bed
and proper means were used for recalling his senses.
All endeavours for a time proved ineffectual—life was
drawing to its close, and his disorder was merely
the last flickerings of the lamp before it expired for
ever. -
The baron placed himself by the side of the old
man's bed. The medicines which the surgeon had
administered had induced a composure resembling
sleep; his breathings were audible, and his shiver-
ings had ceased. -
“He will never use them again,” said Edward,
the tears streaming down his cheeks, and remo-
ving from the table in the apartment some scattered
papers which lay upon it, and the implements for
writing.
“What are those?” asked the baron, pointing
to the papers. -
“They are,” replied Edward, “verses which he
writes in the night when I am gone to bed; he is
very fond of passing his time in writing, only he
never does so when I am up lest I should be me-
lancholy for want of conversation. He wrote that

William's hands, which he found to contain
AN OIDE TO PVINTER.
Winter bound in icy chains,
Slowly creeps along the plains ;
Naked branches shivering stand,
Withering under his command;
If a single leaf appears
Still bedev'd with Autumn's tears,
The tyrant views, with enviours glance,
The glittering diamonds it sustains;
He breathes around, and nought remains
Of Autumn's richly-tinted stains,
Unless a hidden spray escapes awhile perchance.
Imperious now he sits on high,
Scattering whirlwinds from the sky;
Spreading devastation round,
He skims the earth, and seas profound;
Waves that gently kiss'd the shore,
As they lav'd their golden bed,
Now with thundering fury roar,
Dashing overy mainmast head:
While wash’d from off the shattered deck,
Yet clinging to the buoyant wreck,
The sailor sees, in wild despair,
A foaming billow high in air;
Desponding, yet still firm and brave,
He stems the awful mighty wave;
Till mountains over mountains roll,
From east to west, from pole to pole,
And plunge him deep within a watery grave.
Various troubles now assail
The humble tenant of the vale;
Labour, that gives with every meal
What pampered luxury ne'er can feel-
Labour, that smooths his rugged bed,
And seasons high his oaten bread,

Denics, and rules the world alone.
The polished ploughshare strives in vain
To sever winter's icy chain-
The adamantine soil repels
With sullen firmness every stroke,
With vegetative life it swells,
Yet cannot break the galling yoke.
'Tis night; the sun his light withholds,
While cottag'd industry unfolds
Her simple work-ber evening care-

Thus nature pleads, nor ever pleads in vain;

No sportive matin song of birds,
Ushering in the crimson dawn,
No distant sound of lowing herds,
Awake to life a Winter's morn;
No cowslips gild the dewy lawn,
No ruddy blossoms deck the thorn ;
The modest daisy hides its head,
Beneath its cold and watery bed;
The faunting poppy, pert and gay,
Attendant on a summer's day,
Resigns its soft Lethean power,
And sinks the victim of an hour.
Stagnation reigns in every withering leaf,
And mourning Nature looks absorbed in grief,
That Phæbus sheds bis many-coloured rays,
And on the glittering surface softly plays.
Dissolving quickly then the snow
Falls trembling from the mountain's brow;
And soon no vestiges remain
of all that whitened o'er the plain.
Thus ends the reign of Nature's icy foe;
Whilst, first of gifts that from her bosom flow,
Spring returns with aspect mild,
Violet crown'd her loveliest child :
Now again the ruddy thorn,
Glitters with the dew of morn;
Buzzing round sweet cowslip bells,
Bees suck nectar from their cells.
The vivid Aash from beauty's eye,
When tell-tale love is lurking nigh;
The pleading look, the starting tear,
That parting lovers often wear;
The balmy kiss, the gentle sigh
Escaping, yet it knows not why;
All hail the lovely bloom of opening Spring,
While Cupid's arrows Autter from its wing ,
Give me a heart to enjoy her various charms,
For by her power, misfortune she disarms ;
And hours of tears, and days of grief and pain,
Are lulled when Nature smiles, and Spring resumes her reign.

The lines which lord William had just read bore
evident marks that they proceeded from a mind
which had enjoyed the benefits of education, and
not from that of a rude shepherd, and this convic-
tion made him still more earnest to derive, if possi-
ble, from Matthews, some account of himself, before
his death.
As evening drew in, the surgeon recommended
to the baron to return for the night to his castle,
saying that it was extremely uncertain how long
the existence of Matthews might still be protracted ;
and promising to send for him immediately, if any
material change should take place; but the desire of
fathoming the mystery which appeared connected
with the boy, to whom he was so extraordinarily
called, by his helpless state, to give protection,
prompted him not to quit the spot; and he sent home
Ambrose to account for his absence.
During the night no alteration tock place in old
Matthews; about seven in the morning his respira-
tion became more difficult, and opening his eyes,
he endeavoured to lift himself up in his bed, which
lord William perceiving, lent his assistance to raise
him on his pillow. Matthews turned his eyes upon
him ; a faint smile of pleasure sparkled in them at
the sight of the baron, and he pressed his fevered
hand upon that of de Mowbray, as if to thank him
for his presence.
Edward came to his side ; Matthews recognized
him--the boy understood that he did so, and throw-
ing his arms round his neck, hung weeping upon

him. Matthews held him there some minutes, while
he appeared to be in silent prayer; then disenga-
ging himself from his embrace, he turned his head
towards the baron ; he endeavoured to address him,
although unintelligible words alone proceeded from
his lips, of this he did not himself seem sensible,
but continued to speak. At length—“Protect, pro-
tect him l’’ were distinguishable. On this Mat-
thews paused—“I will protect him,” replied lord.
William, “while he continues worthy of my favour.”
Again Matthews spoke; his agitation appeared vio-
lent; he seemed to be wishing to convey to the
baron an idea how very worthy the boy was of such
favour, but one word only was articulate in all he
spoke, and that was “noble.” But whether the
epithet had been applied by Matthews to his mind,
or to his blood, the baron was undecided, although
he conceived that the old man had endeavoured to
indicate the latter. Anxious still for some clue to
the mystery of that night which had introduced
him to Matthews's acquaintance, he requested the sur-
geon and Edward to leave him for a few moments
alone with the dying man. They complied, and
lord William lost not a moment in advancing the in-
quiry, for the purpose of making which he had re-
quired their absence. Whilst he spoke, he saw the
eyes of Matthews fixed on him ; and when he had
made his demand, they still continued the same ;
he repeated his question, and took the old man's
hand in his, by pressing which he hoped the more
earnestly to engage his attention to what he was

saying. His eyes still continued unmoved; he
breathed a faint sigh, sunk back on his pillow, and
expired.
The baron stamped with his foot upon the floor
and Edward with the surgeon immediately came
up. On hearing the event of the last moments,
expected as the issue of his grandfather's illness had
been by him, still the acuteness of Edward's sorrow
was as violent as if the shock had been sudden; so
true is it, that hope hangs on the last thread of a
valued existence, and does not fly us till that thread
is divided past repair.
At this moment arrived Ambrose, and two other
servants from the castle, with refreshments for their
lord, who directed them to proceed to the village,
and procure proper persons to perform the due
offices to the dead body; and commanded Am-
brose not to leave the cottage till the interment
had taken place, concerning which, he said, he
should in the course of the day issue his orders.
This done, he directed Edward to collect for him
all the papers which had belonged to his late grand-
father ; they composed only a small roll, which the
boy took from a drawer in the chamber ; and the
baron receiving it at his hand, invited Edward to
accompany him to his castle.
Edward entreated to be permitted to remain
with the corpse of his grandsire, till it should be-
come a tenant of the earth; but to this request the
baron replied—“No Edward, that must not be ;
I have promised you my protection, which promise

includes in it my friendship, and, consistently with
these titles, I cannot permit you to pay an attend-
ance inimical to the return of peace to your own
mind.”
Edward again kissed the cold lips of his grandfa-
ther, and bursting into a flood of tears, gave his
hand to lord William, and suffered himself to be
led away by it from that humble cot which had
hitherto been the scene of all his boyish griefs and
joys. Happy age why are thy hours so fleeting 2
why are thy minutes the painful prologues to the
bitter tale of life 2
On their arrival at the castle, the lady de Mow-
bray was just risen, and the breakfast table spread.
Lord William introduced to her his young charge ;
and the little Rosalind, who had just completed
her sixth year, smiled her welcome to the first be-
ing so near her own age whom she had yet seen
admitted an inmate of the castle walls.
The lady de Mowbray, whose gentle soul ex-
panded in tenderness to every child of sorrow,
exerted herself with the most happy art to repel
the flowing tide of grief that streamed down the
cheeks of the youthful Edward; but although she
soothed the anguish of his heart by her motherly
attentions, still she could not prevail on him to
join in their meal; his heart was overcharged with
grief, and at the present moment he loved it as his
best friend, for it filled up every vacancy that his
lost friend had filled before. -
With the first opportunity, lord William exa-

mined the papers he had brought with him from
the cottage, but to his disappointment there was
no information to be gathered from them. Some
contained only lines of poetry, and others essays
on various subjects, which he thought appeared to
have been written for the instruction of Edward.
Not a single word was to be found in them concern-
ing the family, fortunes, or name, of him by whom
they had been written.
At the due time the interment of Matthews took
place; and the sorrow of Edward was again
awakened to its keenest pitch by attending the body
to the grave. But friendless as he had conceived
his case to be, the poor Edward had many con-
solers and many comforters; the peculiarity of his
unfortunate situation, added to his engaging dis-
position, won him the hearts of the whole castle,
as well as those of its lord and lady.
A few days after the funeral, lord William took
occasion to talk apart with Edward; there might
still, he thought, be a clue to the unravelling of
the mystery concerning Matthews within the breast
of the youth himself, although he might be uncon-
scious that the intelligence he might have it in his
power to give was the solution of any dark occur-
rence. For this purpose, leading him one day
into the garden, he thus began —“How old do
you say you are, Edward **
“I shall be nine years old on the first of next
May,” the boy replied.
“And how many years have you lived in the
eottage by the side of the lake?”

" Ever since I can remember: I never lived
any where else till I came to this castle.”
“ And how long had your grandfather lived
there do you know that ?” inquired the baron.
“No, that I don't indeed,” replied the boy.
“He had not always lived ther: then, I suppose?”
lord William said.
“ I dare say not,” returned Edward, “ for I
have heard him talk of London and Scotland, and
many places that he had been in, he said.”
“ He must have found his cottage a very solitary
place, after having been accustomed to the busy
scenes of life ; but I suppose you had visitors ?”
No, never,” replied Edward ;“nobody came to
see us, except by chance any of the peasants round
about the neighbourhood had business with my
grandfather.”
“ Indeed!” returned De Mowbray ;
are you sure nobody ever came to your cottage
as a visitor, either by day or by night
“I never saw any body in the day-time, I am
sure,” answered the youth; “and what should
any body come for in the night ?”
That was what the baron wished to discover, but
the means seemed as far distant as ever. They
walked on some minutes' in silence, lord William
watching the countenance of the youth, but unable
to discover in it the reflection of any sentiment in
his heart which betrayed him acquainted with the
subject at which the baron was hinting.
“Do you remember the night on which I fell
from
my horse near your grandfather's cottage,
and broke my leg ?” asked De Mowbray.

“Oh yes, very well,” replied Edward ; " he told
me of your accident when I awoke in the morn-
ing; and he often made inquiries about you of the
peasants, and was quite pleased to find you were
getting well.”
“ Then you were asleep when it happened, and
knew nothing of his coming out to give me assist-
ance till the next morning ?”
No, nothing: he told me of it then; he said I
had been in bed an hour or two when he heard
your cries."
“ Was he alone when you went to bed ?”
asked the baron.
“Yes,” replied the boy; "you forget, my lord,
that I told you before there never was any body with
us; why did you think there was ?”
“I thought I saw another man besides your
grandfather,” replied the baron, “and guessed it
might have been some unfortunate stragler, from
the bands of the Scottish ravagers, to whom his
humanity had tempted him to give shelter.”
“Indeed you were mistaken,” returned Edward,
“ for I am sure there was nobody in the cottage but
us two
The ingenuousness of the youth convinced the
baron that he was really unacquainted with a third
person having been the inmate of the cottage that
night ; indeed it was natural to suppose, that what-
ever deed had been passing in it at the time that
required secrecy from the world, would have been
concealed from a boy of eight years
of
age.
He
was not sure that it would be right in him ever

to inform the boy of what he knew; the present,
he was certain, was not a time for such communica-
tion ; he therefore discontinued the subject, and
they returned together to the castle.
CHAPTER VI.
We are as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i' th' sun,

Sever AL years passed on, during which Edward
was the universal favourite of the inhabitants of
de Mowbray Castle, and very frequently the play-
fellow of the little Rosalind. -
Wary as was the general conduct of lord Wil-
liam, he had not the judgment to understand that
those intimacies which are contracted in innocence
of heart are more difficult to be broken off than
such as are formed upon passion; thus, while he
considered them as too young to love, he foresaw
no growing mischief in a partiality which he con-
ceived to proceed merely from an equality of years,
and a liking for the same sports and toys.

But young as Edward was, his soul was naturally
of that manly disposition that the ball and kite
would have been looked upon with contempt by
him with any other companion in their exercise
than Rosalind; but with her, although he did not
yet understand the nature of his feelings, every
trivial amusement became of the highest conse-
quence; and an accidental feather which she had
in sport blown along the air, was a treasure worthy
to be hoarded in his breast.
Still Edward found time for the grand passion
of his heart, which was the rival of his sports with
Rosalind, and this was that of endeavouring to
make some proficiency in the use of arms.
The
baron perceived his martial disposition, and took
pleasure in having him instructed in the science he
loved : he was observant of the lessons he received,
and did credit to those who were by turns his tutors.
Lord William often reflected on the mysterious
manner in which Edward had been thrown upon
his protection; sometimes he felt inclined to trust
to him the mystery which had attended the first
night of his introduction to his grandfather; but
this idea was always overruled by the consideration
that such knowledge might fill with anxiety and
melancholy the heart of one whose conduct, during
the time he had been an inmate of De Mowbray Cas-
tle, had been the most deserving.
About the time that Edward had attained his
fourteenth year was the period at which the incur-
sions of the borderers called so strongly for the

67
counter-exertions of the English government, that
the queen commanded the fortifying of all the cas-
tles on the borders of the kingdom, amongst
which that of De Mowbray was one of the principal.
Young as Edward was, he was extremely alert in
attending lord William during the time that the
castle was receiving additional strength from the
architect; and the zeal with which he lent such
assistance as his youth enabled him to give to the
preparations for repelling the foe, added to the ba-
ron's knowledge of his love for arms, induced him
to promise the youth, that in the new troops which
he was about to levy, he should be an active mem-
ber.
. Edward already thought himself a hero of re-
nown; already he saw a gigantic Scotchman
dead at his feet, and his pike smoking with his
blood ; his heart leaped with joy at the idea, not
because he was to become a murderer, but because
he was to become a brave soldier : cruelty was no
inmate of his heart: he would at any time rather
hare gone a mile out of his way than have trodden
on a helpless worm.
When he first saw Rosalind after the promise
made to him by lord William-"Oh, Rosalind,”
he cried, “I never can be sufficiently thankful to
lord William, I am to be a member of his new
troops when they are all raised.”
“ And shall you like that ?” said Rosalind, the
words faltering on her tongue.
“ To be sure I shall,” replied he.“ Oh, what ha-

voc I shall make amongst the foe! It will be glo-
rious!”
“How can you talk so about killing people ?”
asked Rosalind, “What have they done to, you
that you should thus seem to enjoy the idea of
their death?"
Why,” rejoined he, “ are they not the enemies
of our country ?—the enemies of our good queen,
who is the favourer of my protector, and who is,
what I like her still better for, the godmother of
Rosalind ?"
Rosalind smiled, then said—"But should you be
killed yourself ?”
Edward looked at Rosalind, then at the ground,
then again at Rosalind, and for the first time ven-
tured to thank her anxiety for him with a gentle kiss,
which she scarce felt touch her cheek. Lady de
Mowbray entered at the moment; the action did
not escape her, but she did not notice that she had
seen it. Lord William almost immediately fol-
lowed her into the apartment, and Rosalind in-
quired, with an agitation which he did not observe,
when the new troops were to be raised.
Lord William replied—“Oh, some time hence,
when our castle is fortified.”
The words “some time hence,” Rosalind flat-
tered her own wishes by giving the utmost latitude
imaginable to; and composure quickly returned to
her spirits.
Whilst the preparations for repelling the incursions
of the moss-troopers were forwarding with all pos-

!
sible alacrity, amidst the daily labourers at the
castle was an elderly man, a mason by trade, who
having represented himself to lord William as a
widower, the father of a large family of children,
whom he was unable to support by his labour with
any degree of comfort, petitioned employment for
his eldest boy, who he said was about fourteen
years old, and able to assist in carrying stones and
mortar. The baron assented to his petition; and
on the following day appeared amongst the work-
men the boy, whose name was Hubert.
Edward, constant in watching the progress which
was making in fortifying the castle, saw in turn
every workman employed in it, and amongst the
rest Hubert caught his attention. The lad had a
fine countenance, though a cloud of discontent hung
over it; his limbs were well formed, but the scanti-
ness of his clothes had exposed them to many
hardships, of which they bore the marks: shoes
he had none; the soles of his feet seemed of equal
hardness with the flints on which he trod, by the
unconcern with which he moved over them, when
heaviest laden ; uncovered, like his feet, was his
head; and his dark brown hair hung in matted
folds about his face and neck.
Edward eyed him with attention ; and whilst he
looked at him, he drew a comparison between his
own happy situation and the comfortless one of
poor Hubert, exposed to the biting winds of
March, and shivering under burdens too great for
his strength and age. The lad climbed the castle

wall with a stone on his shoulder, and moved out
of Edward's sight.
Towards evening, Edward was again on the ram-
parts; as he was approaching towards an angle
of the castle, he heard a voice say—“Why, you
are cold, boy!”—“Ay, and hungry too !” was
the reply. He turned the angle, and saw Hubert
beating himself with his arms, to produce circulation
in his almost frozen blood. It was already dusk,
the workmen were departing, and amongst them
Hubert almost immediately left the ramparts. On.
the following morning, Edward took with him a
slice of meat upon a cake of bread, and with these
he went in search of Hubert. Before he had de-
livered his present, he met the baron.
“What have you got there, Edward ?” he asked.
What, hungry so soon after breakfast.”
“ I hope you are not angry, my lord ?” replied
Edward. “I hope I have not done wrong ; but it
is to give away.” And he then related his inten-
tion.
Lord William was a character which is very com-
mon in the world at the present day, and most
probably was not singular in those he lived in ; he
was a good man in every respect where it did not
interfere with his own views to be so ; thus he only
chid Edward for apprehending his displeasure for
such a trifling liberty, and was passing on, when
the object of Edward's charity appeared in view,
and lord William stopped to observe him.

“Here, Ilubert,” said the youth, advancing
towards him, “here is a piece of bread and meat
for you.”
“You can't eat it yourself, I suppose," returned
Hubert, without stopping to take it.
“ You draw a very unkind inference from my
action,” replied Edward, not a little hurt ; " and
what I did not expect from you."
Ilubert's father appeared in sight at the moment
Edward spoke.
“Come hither,” said lord William, calling to
hiin ; " yours is an insolent boy, and deserves pu-
nishment : this youth just now offered him some
food, out of compassion to his comfortless appear-
ance, and instead of thanking him, he told him that
he supposed he could not eat it himself.
Pray my lord, forgive him,” said the father.
“I have tried every means in my power to alter his
disposition ; but I cannot, by any method, break
him of speaking exactly what he thinks upon every
occasion. I am sure he did not mean to offend
-he has one of the best hearts in the world ; and
I am certain he is hungry enough too."
Lord William was going to reply, when he was
interrupted by the yelping of a dog behind him.
The mastiff belonging to the castle, had, out of ty-
ranny, hunger it could not be, snatched a bone from
a cur belonging to one of the workmen, whose
apparent ribs eloquently told the hungry state of
his stomach, and who was now bewailing his loss.
Hubert came running up to Edward—“I beg

your pardon, sir, for what I said,” he cried;
pray
will you give me the meat and bread now ?”
The hand in which Edward had at first held it
out to the lad was still extended with it; and as
he did not withdraw it on Hubert's request, the lad
took it into his. “ Thank you gratefully, sir,” he
cried, and running up to the howling cur, laid it
down before him,
What is that for ?” asked lord William.
“ To reward him, my lord,” said the lad, “because
he was run down for being poor.
“ He has one of the best hearts in the world !”
exclaimed Edward, “ and I wish lord William would
let me ask him to dine at the castle.”
Lord William smiled at the earnestness with
which Edward advanced his petition; and with a
caution to the lad not to speak his thoughts again
with the freedom he had just been guilty of, he
gave him his permission to dine with the servants
at the castle that day.
From this time there was a something inexplic-
able almost to himself, unless it could he accounted
for by that reverence which a mind of discernment
naturally feels for a noble and honest heart, which
led Edward to throw himself perpetually in the
way of Hubert; and to him, and him alone, the
lad relaxed in that roughness of temper which he
maintained towards every one else, and which pro-
ceeded from his sense of Edward's benevolent feel-
ings towards him, and from gratitude for the many
favours which he received at his hands.

In the course of about three years, the castle was
in a state of such forwardness, that lord William
began to raise the men, who were to render that
strength a terror to the enemy.
Edward was now on the point of completing his
seventeenth year, and the baron realized the promise
which he had made to him, by giving him the com-
mand of a small body of men, into which number
the surly Hubert, for by this appellation he was
generally known, voluntarily enlisted.
At the close of another twelvemonth, lord Wil-
liam seeing his plans of defence drawing towards a
state of perfectness, and all the levies of men which
he had demanded raised, judged the present an expe-
dient time for going to London, and basking for a
while in that sunshine of favour, which the queen
would doubtless warm him with, in return for his
alert execution of her commands, and which would
render him the envy of the court. Another mo-
tive also impelled him to this journey; his Rosa-
lind, the goddaughter of her queen, had never yet
been introduced to the metropolis: Elizabeth had
never seen her, since she had held her an infant in
her arms; her charms were now beginning to ex-
pand into the most lovely bloom of perfection, and
he hesitated not to conclude, that she would be no
sooner seen, than some exalted alliance would offer
itself to her acceptance, as the possession of her
hand would be deemed a never-failing passport to
the favour of the queen. -

To lady de Mowbray he accordingly imparted
his intention of setting out as soon as the neces-
sary preparations could be made for their journey:
she had never visited the court since she had be-
come a wife, and from causes confined to her own
breast, she felt a reluctance ever to return to it; but
the will of her husband was absolute; and she also
considered it becoming that Rosalind should not
be withheld from a visit to the queen, who had so
frequently asked to see her : she therefore ac-
quiesced in his plan..
To Rosalind, the sensation of leaving home was
a new one, and she knew not whether it inspired
pleasure or pain. There was something too gratify-
ing to the heart of youth, in the idea of being re-
ceived at court as the child of her sovereign, not
to inspire her with some degree of pleasure ; but it
was counterbalanced by the wish that she had a
brother to share her joy, and she wished that
Edward were that brother; but he was to stay at
home, exposed to attacks from the enemy; he
might fall before she should return, and she might
even have no nominal brother to relate her adven-
tures to. These were feelings which she could
not subdue, and with a blush, she whispered them
in her mother's ear. Lady de Mowbray endea-
voured to rally her out of her ideas, but as she
spoke, the tear stole down her own cheek.—“ Why
do you weep, my dearest mother?” said Rosalind.
“ Not at any present unhappiness, believe me,

75
my child," she replied; “thoughts are intrusive
visitors, that will come unbidden: before I die, you
shall know whence they proceed.”
The baroness here broke off the conversation, and
the necessary preparations for their journey pre-
vented Rosalind from dwelling so much on her
mother's words as she otherwise might have done.
To Irwin, his first leader, lord William deputed
the chief command in his absence; and under him,
Edward was appointed to a post of the next import-
ance.
On the morning of their departure, Edward at-
tended them to their horses; the bustle of prepa-
ration had allowed them scarcely a moment to bid
farewell. Rosalind caught one unobserved, as she
passed through the castle-hall, to say—“Take care
of yourself, Edward; do not run heedlessly into dan-
ger, should you have to encounter the foe. If you
should be killed, before I return, I shall wish I
had never known you as she hesitated.
“ As what, dear Rosalind ?” asked the youth.
I "As my brother,” she replied.
“And should I be safe and well at your return,
sliall you be as glad to see me as if I were really
my brother ?” he rejoined.
“Oh yes,” she answered; "but should
but should you have
exposed your life to danger, I shall not love your
memory, though I am sure I shall weep for your
death.”
The baron was already on his horse, and calling to
her to follow; thus not another word passed-Ed-
ward pressed her hand in his, and they parted.

CHAPTER VII.
Thou cam'st on earth, to make the earth my hell.
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy :
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious;
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
Thy age confirm’d, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody.
King RICHARD III.
TABIR reception at court was as flattering as lord
William had predicted it would be; and the charms
of his daughter created all that admiration which
communicates the glow of pleasure to the hearts of
fond parents.
Lord Burleigh, it has already been said, was the
uncle of lady de Mowbray; thrice had he visited
Cumberland since the birth of Rosalind, and at every
visit his conduct had been the most attentive, and
apparently kind, to his niece; still it had been evi-
dent that her acknowledgments of it had not pro-
ceeded from the heart, but were the result of polite-
ness, and that she looked upon him with something
like awe and distrust.
At the period of lord William and his family
visiting the court, the queen was lending her as-
sistance to the Protestants in France, to whom she
had sent many of her troops; and a decisive battle
shortly expected to take place, which would re-
store them to their rights, and put an end to the re-

ligious broils which then agitated the sister king-
dom.
Lord Burleigh paid the same attention to his
neice which he had ever been remarkable for do-
ing since her marriage; and appearing one day in the
utmost good humour, which disposition he seldom
shewed, even if he felt it, gravity being the natural
tone of his temper, Rosalind perceived her mother
collecting, as it were, her strength to speak, and
with a half choked utterance she said—“Where,
my lord, is now my cousin, Harry Cecil 2"
“He is honoured by bearing the arms of Eng-
land in France,” returned lord Burleigh.
Lady de Mowbray sighed, and nothing farther on
the subject passed.
When the family of de Mowbray had been about
two months at the court of queen Elizabeth, and
the had finally asserted the justice of the Protestant
caim, the English troops were recalled from the
Cuntinent; and a day, at a short distance from their.
return, was appointed for them to receive the thanks
of their royal mistress. This day was destined by
the queen for festivity; in the morning she gave
notice that she should receive her warriors in her
drawing-room, and promised to her court a splen-
did ball in the evening.
Lord William de Mowbray, understanding that
ithough the queen had not expressed it, she still
epected it, as a compliment due to the anticipated
plasures of the evening, that such of the nobility
as were invited to share in them should attend her

in the morning, and be present at her reception of
the officers on their return from foreign service, the
lady de Mowbray and her daughter composed part
of the levee, which was very numerously attended.
As god-daughter to the queen, Rosalind always
found the place of pre-eminence yielded to her-
self, and on that morning she and her mother hap-
pened to stand at the right hand of Elizabeth—a
situation which gave them an opportunity of par-
ticularly observing each officer as he approached
the throne. 2 -
To Rosalind, every face which came up to receive
that mark of the royal favour, which was conferred
in the liberty of kissing her majesty's hand, was a
new one ; to her mother, the countenances of some
of the veterans in service were familiar ; and next
to the queen, she became the object of their notice.
Whilst lady de Mowbray was engaged with thest
in conversation, Rosalind's eyes were observing the
succession of claimants for the queen's smile, and
amongst the number, one particularly arrested ner
attention; and the impression he made on \er
senses was almost that of fear.
His figure was so tall, as even to be gigantic ;
his limbs appeared cast in the same mould with
those of Hercules, and his broad shoulders seemed
like those of another Atlas, capable of bearing ano
ther globe; the lines of his face were hard, and hs
penetrating dark eye, beamed with ferocity ratler
than courage; still his countenance was indisu-
tably handsome, and from the necessity of cores-

sing it to be so, the keenness of his features ap-
peared the more dreadful. He seemed at least
forty years of age, and Rosalind thought that he
might probably be more ; but his person was such
as did not betray the full sum of his years. He was
cased in a complete armour of polished steel, stud-
ded at the points with gold; at his back hung a
cloak of tiger skin, intertwined with a crimson scarf,
richly embroidered with gold, to correspond with
the ornaments of his armour; and in his hand he
held a helmet, on the top of which nodded a forest
of black plumes, and which, when placed upon his
head, must have raised him a couple of feet in
height above his companions.
He was announced as lord Rufus de Madgine-
court.
On retiring from the foot of the throne, he cast his
eyes around, as if in search of some face which he
might recognize; they fell on lady de Mowbray, and
he moved up to her. They entered into a conver-
sation which denoted them well acquainted ; and
the firmness of de Madginecourt's voice corres-
ponded with the strength of his form.
Lord William came up to the spot where they
were standing, and after a few introductory sen-
tences had passed between him and lord Rufus, he
said, “My lord, I have a daughter, who must con-
gratulate you on your return, as her father's friend;”

tier; but as his eyes encountered hers, they spark-
led with the fire of admiration, and he exclaimed—
“By Heaven, de Mowbray, all the lilies which the
court of France can boast must droop before this
English rose. Your father and I, lady,” he con-
tinued, addressing Rosalind, “are old friends, and
we must become better acquainted: let this kiss,”
and he imprinted one on her glove as he spoke, “be
the bond of my claiming your hand for the dance
this evening.”
Rosalind had no plea for refusing his request, but
the insufficient one that she should have liked any
other partner better; and timid of a refusal, she
bowed acquiescence.
In the evening, lord Rufus appeared divested of
his armour, and splendidly attired ; his attentions
during the evening to Rosalind were marked, but
she could not help considering them, and she hoped
her idea was a just one, as the effect of vanity, in-
spired by seeing himself the partner of a woman
whose hand was that night the most in request,
from the partiality with, which the queen treated
her, rather than of any preference he felt for her
person.
Rosalind's opinion was by no means a fallacious
one : lord Rufus de Madginecourt was descended
from a family which had for many reigns been of
the first importance in the kingdom ; he was now
himself its head; and as such, in addition to his
being known to be a firm adherent to the interests
of the Protestant cause, and an implacable enemy

of the Jesuits, who were the open foes of Elizabeth,
he had been received at court with a great degree
of partiality by the virgin queen.
Lord Rufus, eminently proud of his family, vain
of his person, and covetous of wealth and honour,
had misconstrued, or rather turned to his own
wishes, the favour of Elizabeth, by suffering him-
self to believe that her partiality for him extended
beyond friendship ; and that while the sons of mon-
archs, nay, even sovereigns themselves, were
denied the participation of her throne, good fortune
pointed to himself as the destined partner of her
exalted situation. -
A man less proud than himself might have per-
ceived that vanity was the only motive from which
the queen invited all the young nobleman of Eng-
land to be continually about her person; he might
have seen that her favours were equal, to the end
that she might not lose the homage of one youth,
whom it flattered the predominant passion of her
breast to believe she held in the chains of adora-
tion, not as a queen, but as a female of superior per-
sonal charms. To believe herself such, and to be-
lieve that others viewed her in the same light, was
the only foible of a queen, otherwise of an unim-
peachable judgment, and conduct; but even while
thus acted upon by the only weakness that had place
in her breast, she had still sufficient wisdom to de-
termine within herself, that this indulgence should
never lead her into repentance, by inducing her to
give up that supremacy, which must have died

away from her, into a hushand's power, had she
ever admitted a partner to her throne.
Blinded thus by a vanity, which had not that com-
mand over itself which the same passion possessed
in the heart of the wary Elizabeth, lord Rufus saw
only the favours which he himself received at the
hands of his sovereign; and believing himself the
only man to whom they were extended, he already
considered himself as the chosen participator of the
English throne.
His false hopes were just risen to their climax,
at the time at which the English troops were sent
into France; and a command of importance, to
which the queen had appointed him, seemed, in
his imagination, to decide the crown of glory his.
Ever haughty and imperious, his conduct was now
more so than it had been before ; he saw that it of.
fended, but he relaxed not of his dignity, self con-
vinced that its enforcement would soon be allowed
as his right. Anxiously did he pant for his re-
turn, to prove it such ; and exultingly did he
triumph on this day, when ranged amongst the
nobles of the court, he looked upon himself as the
all powerful Jove, in whose hand the resistless
thunderbolt of power would soon be grasped.
He knew his person to be good; he had on this
evening given it every advantage of splendid dress
—to him a real advantage, for his height admitted
the richness of his robes as such, when on any
other person they would have looked the very pa-
geantry of folly. Resistless he beheld his appear-

ance, and desiring every part of his conduct to
be alike deserving of approbation from the queen,
he asked the hand of Rosalind for the dance, not
because her beauty and innocence claimed her every
tribute of admiration, not because she was the daugh-
ter of his friend De Mowbray, but because she was
the god-daughter and favourite of the queen.
Lord William was an attentive observer of the
conduct of lord Rufus towards his daughter; he
judged it the opening of a growing passion, in-
spired by her blaze of beauty, and he felt no small
delight in the conquest he conceived her to have
made. -
Rosalind herself feared what her father hoped
and believed ; and never had solitude appeared to
her so irksome as the festivities of that night; she
longed to be walking on the ramparts of the cas:
tle, or indeed to be any where, rather than where
she was ; nay, she almost thought it cruel in herself
to be revelling in an amusement from which her
friend Edward was excluded.
The lady de Mowbray was even more depressed
in spirits than her daughter; her cousin Harry Cecil
had fallen in France; and she could not forbear
paying the tribute of silent sorrow to his memory.

CHAPTER VIII.
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
An age of discord and continual strife
Whereas the contrary bringeth forth bliss,
And is a pattern of celestial peace.
First Part of HENRY WI.
THREE weeks were now only remaining of the
time which had been set apart for the visit of the
De Mowbray family to the court, and lord William
had resolved not to prolong it, as he judged that
a farther absence from his castle, at the very period
when it was first become capable of being rendered
of material service, would wear an appearance of
neglect on his part, which might, in all probabi-
lity, offend his queen. -
It was now the month of May, and short as
had been Rosalind's stay in the metropolis, she
felt anxious to return to the country. Her taste
was purely simple, and she preferred the beauties
of nature to those of art: the rising of the summer
was her favourite season of the year, and she knew
that in London she should see little of its charms.
Towards the close of February, when she had
left the country covered with the desolation that
winter spreads from its withering hands, which open
only to disperse bleak winds, frozen air, and driving
Snows, she had found so many artificial causes

conspiring to soften its rigour in London, and to
change the face of the season, that she dreaded lest
the months of summer should be as much trans-
formed as she had seen those of its opposite season;
and this idea lent its aid to other causes to make
her desirous of returning into Cumberland.
Almost all the youths of the day who frequented
the court, had fluttered round Rosalind's charms
during her residence at it, but none had been suffi-
ciently wounded by their lustre to seek the balm of
possession for their cure: probably more than
one had been withheld from a declaration of their
passion by the watchfulness of lord William, from
whose frown they recoiled, none wishing to lie
under the stigma of a refusal ; and on almost all
he had frowned when they had read his counte-
nance, in order to learn from it his sentiments of
their pretensions to his daughter's hand, since he
had entertained a hope that she had fixed her image
indelibly on the heart of lord Rufus.
On the morning appointed for their departure,
the queen insisted on meeting them at breakfast
early, as that meal was prepared to favour a long
day's journey ; the cold sirloin with its wonted
attendants in those days of ale and mead, graced the
board. Lord Rufus was of the select invited to be
present at their setting out; and the repast being
concluded, a most gracious farewell from the queen
led them to the hall of the palace, from whence lord
Rufus attended them to their horses.
As soon as they were left to the privacy of their

own party, the baron demanded of Rosalind whether
she regretted quitting the metropolis 2 Her answer
was in the negative ; and he then proceeded to ques-
tions which, although enveloped in ambiguous terms,
she understood as inquiries whether her heart was
returning from it as free from chains as he believed
she had taken it thither. Her answers were such
as left him doubtful, and the conversation after some
time took a turn. Lady de Mowbray had not
joined in it; she had merely said, on quitting the
city—“I shall never see London again,” and nei-
ther her husband nor her daughter made any reply
to her observation.
Their journey was pleasant and safe. Towards
the afternoon of one of those days when spring
lavishes her smiles in the richest luxuriance on
the earth, after refreshing showers have given new
vigour to the vegetative world, and called forth
that perfume which the healthy bed of nature ex-
hales, when the sun cast a golden lustre on the glit-
tering drops which hang sparkling on the flowers,
and the birds hail its triumph over the cheerless
rain with their songs, Rosalind's eye caught the
lofty towers of De Mowbray Castle as her horse
bore her slowly up a hill from which its battlements
seemed warring with the clouds. -
To most females of her rank and age the sight
would perhaps, have occasioned a sensation not en-
tirely pleasant.—“Here,” they would have sighed
out, “I shall be immured at least for months, per-
haps for years to come, in solitude; and oh, how

bitterly shall I experience the reverse of this scene
from those of gaiety I have just quitted !" But
exactly the contrary were the feelings of Rosalind :
a quick pulsation throbbed in her heart at the sight,
and she exclaimed aloud-"We shall soon see
Edward now; and oh, how much I have to tell
him !!
They presently descended into a vale, where
the castle disappeared from the sight of Rosalind,
and nothing met her eye but the easy bills which
formed its sloping sides, and which glittered like
a bed of emeralds under the feet of the cattle which
were browsing on their produce. As they again
emerged from the vale, the castle once more be-
came the prominent feature in the landscape ; and
the next to it in attraction was a body of lord de
Mowbray's men who were seen drawn out on a
velvet turf without the castle walls, in the act of
practising the pike exercise, and on whose arms the
declining sun shed its rays of crimson light.
On approaching this body, lord William perceived
at their head his chief leader, Irwin ; and eager to
inquire of him whether any matter of importance
had occurred during his absence, he turned aside
his horse from the road, saying that he would
follow his wife and daughter to the castle.
No sooner had they passed the drawbridge and
entered the first court, than Edward was by their
side, and Rosalind's cheek for the first time suffused
with blood at beholding him: perhaps the blush was
produced by the lesson of love which the different

sensations with which she had beheld every other
man since her absence from home could not have
failed to have taught her.
The lady de Mowbray was a silent spectator of
their pleasure at meeting; she was fatigued with her
journey, and retired almost immediately. to her
chamber.
“Thank Heaven you are safe and well!” said
Rosalind, the moment they were alone.
“Ah, Rosalind !” replied he, “can you think so
kindly of me still, after the many men of rank and
fortune who have no doubt sought from you that
esteem you honour me with ?”
“For shame, Edward !” she returned; “ don't
you know me better than to think I could desert an
old friend for any new acquaintance ?”
“ And have you not seen any one during your
absence,” replied Edward, his eyes sparkling with
pleasure and triumph," whom you have considered
worthy the name of friend, which you honour me
with ?"
“No, indeed, I have not,” she answered;
"friendship must be founded on esteem, and how
can I esteem those, of whose interest in my
happiness I have had no proof but their own words,
equal to one like yourself, from whom I have
received so many of a different nature ? I know
only their actions I know your heart.”
“Do you indeed ?” said Edward, with a sigh,
half-pleased by the confession half-fearing that she
did not know it.

“Yes, I have known many instances of your
goodness of heart,” she said.
“ I have never had an opportunity of doing you
any service in my life : would I had been so fortu-
nate!” he replied;
or rather let me be thankful
that you have never stood in need of the accept-
ance of any at my hands.”
“ But if you have never done me any, have not
I been a witness of those you have conferred on
others ? and do you think me so selfish that I
can only commend such benefits as I receive
myself ? Did not you give all your money to the
poor woman that had her cottage burnt down,
when
you had been hoarding it for almost two
months to buy yourself a new sword with, and the
first too you ever were to have ?”
“That was selfish in me,” replied Edward, “ if
You know the truth."
“ How can you speak so ill of yourself ?” returned
Rosalind, “ when you know such was not the mo-
tive? Was it selfish in you to risk your own life
by jumping into the lake after the poor woman's
child, which had fallen into it on the evening we
went to visit the cottage where you lived with
your grandfather ?”
“Yes, it was indeed,” replied the youth: “ I was
too proud of both those actions for them to deserve
any name but that of selfishness, for I was so sure
they would give you pleasure that the satisfaction I
received from their performance took away all the

merit of my self-denial in the first instance, and
my danger of being drowned in the second.”
The baron now came into the apartment, and
Edward's conversation was immediately directed to
him. The castle had been free from all assaults
during lord William's absence, and the neigh-
bourhood very little infested with ravagers; to this
account Edward added, that the fortifications were
entirely completed, and that every workman had
received his discharge.
Edward supped with the baron and his daughter,
and at an early hour the two latter retired to rest ;
to seek refreshment in sleep from the fatigues of
their journey. Every favourite piece of furniture
appeared to Rosalind an old friend after a long
absence from home ; and on entering her chamber,
she cast her eyes around, to assure herself they
were all in their proper places. Her lute lay on
a table in her closet, and she could scarcely forbear
even then calling forth some of the tones which she
loved to hear it express; but she contented herself
with a promise in her own mind, that it should be
the first thing she did on rising in the morning; and
she then entered her bed, where she slept with a
serene composure which had been unknown to her,
while revelling in the splendour of the court.
On the following morning, lady de Mowbray
was so unwell as not to be able to descend into the
breakfast-room. For some days previously to her
departure from the metropolis, she had complained

91
of unpleasant feelings and faintness, which had
been solely ascribed to her being at that time obliged
to use greater exertions of strength than she was
accustomed to do at De Mowbray Castle, where she
was in the habit of visiting but little. During her
journey, the sensations of which she had sometimes,
though very seldom, complained, were placed to the
same cause ; and the physician still believed that
her present inability to leave her chamber pro-
ceeded from her strength and spirits having been
too much called into action during her absence from
home. But the illness of lady de Mowbray con-
tinued to increase with each succeeding day, and
the art of medicine gave no relief to a frame which
was sinking under nature's debility. In the course
of two months, her approaching dissolution was
80 evident, that the physician ventured to announce
to her family that his skill could not save her.
The baron de Mowbray loved his wife, if not with
the rapture of an impassioned lover, at least with
that affection with which it became him to behold
the mother of his child, and on the receipt of this
intelligence he expressed a sorrow which he really
felt.
The lovely Rosalind, whose gentle nature and
whose sex had allied her more strongly in affection
to her mother, al though she had never been de-
fective in filial duty to her father could scarcely
support life, under the idea of the loss she was doom-
ed to sustain. Incessant tears flowed from her ach-

ing eyes, when she sought the solitude of her
chamber to indulge her grief unobserved ; and when
she returned to the apartment of her mother, her
heart was almost broken with the full tide of gritf
which she struggled to confine within her own
breast.
In a gradual decay of nature, such as was the
case with lady de Mowbray, the animal strength
faints and revives at intervals, like the last efforts
of a dying lamp, and flatters with ungrounded
hope, till a delusive blaze flames forth, the signal
of its power being gone for ever.
A hectic colour had for two successive days tinged
the cheeks of lady de Mowbray; her voice had been
stronger, and she had taken the refreshments which
had been offered to her with a better appetite than
she had done for some wecks before. Rosalind ob-
served the change, and almost ventured to believe
that it was the omen of amendment.
On the evening of the second day, the baroness
was sitting up in her bed supported by pillows,
and by her side sat her ever-watchful daughter. -
“My Rosalind,” said her mother,“ do you not
recollect that on the day previously to our depar-
ture from this castle, on our journey to the court,
you spoke to me of your friendship for Edward,
and hinted to me your apprehensions of never
secing him again? I cndeavoured to rally you
out of your fears, but as I spoke the tear stole
down my own check. You inquired the cause ;

I promised yoà that I would one day make it known
to you; that moment is now at hand, for I feel
that I shall not be lorg with you.
The tears now burst from the eyes of Rosalind,
in spite of her cíforis to subdue them.
“Do not weep, my sweet child,” said the lady
de Mowbray; “death is but a short sleep, into
which you will soon fall too, and then we shall be
reunitcd.” She kissed her daughter, and added-
“ Lt your father le called to me-I have some-
thing yet to say to liim before we part; if I deſer
it, my strength may noi be equal to my inclination.”
Lord Wilian was summoned to the chamber.
He approachai, the bed. Lady de Mowbray ex-
tended to him hier feable hand; he took it in his,
and she spoke thus-" I feel, my husband, that
any time on carth is short; it is still in your power
w ronder the fow moments I have to pass on it
happy ones—perhaps the happiest of my life.”
The baron enércaicd her to speak, declaring
limself devoice to the will of rendering her happy
by any mcans in his power.
“Have I,” she asked, “proved myself to you a
dutiful and stectionate wife ?-have I added com-
fort to the years I have lived with you ?— have I
done any action tliat has made you repent your
union with me?"
" Witacss licavea," exclaimed the baron, “ that
I consider you to have conformed, in every respect,
to the ciracicr of a good wife and an afficionate
mother!"

“Grant me then,” she said, “for the fortitude
I have shewn through life, the petition I urge
to you on my bed of death. De Mowbray, when
I gave my hand to you, my heart was rent from
his with whom Heaven had united it: life is in
me past recall—his spirit has already flown to hap-
pier realms, and it is now no sin to make confession
of the truth. From the hour of infancy until
that day when ripened sense pointed out to us too
keenly the agony of separation, my cousin, Harry
Cecil, was the only heart on which mine had
ever reposed in friendship or esteem. I was an
orphan—so was he—dependent both on my cruel
uncle Burleigh. He knew our love, but he forbade
our union, with threats which, desperate as they
were, I knew him capable of putting into effect.
I was not allowed to speak in my own cause,
and he gave you my hand. Once become a wife,
I resolved to perform, for duty's sake, what I could
not do for love: you had been deceived, though I
had been wronged, and I resolved that my con-
duct should never open your eyes to repentance.
You had not been the aggressor towards me, and
I felt that I owed you good only for the situation
to which you had raised me. I wrote to Harry
Cecil, and charged him never to see me again; I
obtained his promise. The exercise of my duty
towards you, you returned with an affectionate
kindness that gained you my love. This child was
given us to make the bond indissoluble.
The tears of the baroness choked her utterance,

and she fell upon the neck of Rosalind. Lord Wil-
liam stood as one entranced at what he had heard,
and unable to reply. In a few moments she pro-
ceeded thus—“Heaven is my witness of the gra-
titude I have ever felt, that with me a forced mar-
riage has been a happy one ! Witness also is
the same Heaven of the blessings I have implored
upon the head of him who has made it so But
oh, I have known the dread attendant on the idea
of being forced into a tyrant's arms; and the only
pang I now feel, the only care that haunts me as
I tremble on the verge of the grave, the only tie
that makes me wish to linger here, lest my poor
child be ever exposed to such a misery. Soon will
she be, as I was, without a mother to protect her
or to plead in her defence—Pardon me, De Mow-
bray, that I should seem to hint a doubt of your
protection equalling what mine and yours united
have hitherto been; but I well know how men are
urged by pride, how worked on by ambition, and
how little feeling for a woman's love these pas-
sions leave within their hearts. Oh, let not our
child be such a victim!—oh, let me die happy! Say
that you will give my Rosalind to the man of her
heart!”
The baron pressed the hand of his wife in silence;
he felt his pressure returned with a grasp beyond
her present strength, and he foresaw that it was the
grasp of death. Her eyes were already dim, and
her lips white; the exertion of the last half hour had
hastened her scene of life towards its close perhaps

more specdly than it would clse have drawn to it.
Her other arm was wound round the neck of Rosa-
lind. In accents scarcely audible she repeated-
Give, oh give my Rosalind to the man of her
heart !” and with a faint sigh she expired.
The baron immediately called in her attend-
ants; and resting the fainting Rosalind upon his
breast, he led her away from the scene of dcath.
Rosalind's tears would now no longer flow; the
existence which she had so earnestly prayed to have
protracted was fled past recall, and an entire stag-
nation of faculty, which denied her even the relief
of tears, now bound up her feelings. Her at-
tendant, the simple Gertrude, who was the niece of
Ambrosc, and had lately been admitted into her ser-
vice, tried in vain to gain her attention to the words
of comfort which she bestowed on her : but Rosa-
lind heard her not; all sense lay buried in her, and
she was almost as devoid of life as the corpse whose
inanimation she bewailed.
· The baron, like his daughter, sought the soli-
tude of his chamber: but he bewailed their com-
mon loss with a grief less poignant than hers; he
was a worldly man, and the life of her whom he had
just lost was not of sufficient weight in his scale of -
power or advancement to create him any serious
sorrow at her death : he bewailed her as a wife whom
he had loved, not as a privation of which time would
never efface the impression from liis mind. He
dwelt on the confession she had made of her heart's
engagement cre she has known him; he felt that

she deserved every remuneration for her conduct
towards himself, and he believed it an impossi-
bility that it should not be his wish, as well as her
own, to give their “Rosalind to the man of her
heart.”
De Mowbray Castle had, in former times, been
a religious foundation ; hence its chapel was still
extant, and in the use of the family. In this cha-
pel, accordingly, were the remains of lady de Mow-
bray to be deposited—here was to be laid the stone
that would close up all her carthly, honours.
The eighth evening after lier deceasc was ap-
pointed for her interment; the ceremony was per-
formed by torch-light, and the gloom which per-
vaded the scene, tended to string the wretched feel-
ings Rosalind already experienced to a higher pitch
of misery. Leaning, half-dead herself, upon the
arm of her father, she followed that clay which
was still dear to her, even though the life which
had rendered it amiable had forsaken it: the vault-
ed passages which led to the chapel, in the repeti-
tion of the slow steps which paced them, seemed to
send forth murmurs in unison with the moment;
and from the insufficiency of the torches to pro-
duce an even light as they were carried through
thein, their lofty roofs appeared to spread a sable
canopy over the melancholy procession.
As they descended the steps which led from the
last of these winding passages into the chapel, the
organ poured forth its plaintive tones upon their
ears. Rosalind could no longer subdue her emo-

tions, and the tears burst from her eyes, while
groans of agony fell from her lips. Still she re-
tained sufficient strength to support herself, with
the assistance of her father and Edward, from fall-
ing to the ground; but when the earth was thrown
upon the coffin, and even that was hid for ever
from her sight, all her little remaining fortitude
died within her, and she sunk senseless into her
father's arms. -
For a length of time, the spirits of Rosalind
gained little amendment from the state of de-
pression into which her mother's death had thrown
her. Seldom could she be induced to quit her
own apartment, and then it was only to stroll
through the gardens or along the ramparts, attended
by Edward or the baron.
Heavy was the heart of Rosalind, even after rea-
son had chased from her breast the violence of
grief, and reflection began again to exert its powers
in her mind; she felt, inexplicable to herself was
the feeling, but she could not divest herself of it,
that all her happiness had died with her mother.

NEARLY six months had elapsed since the death of
the lady de Mowbray, when on a winter's evening,
which called for the most cheering blaze a wood fire
could emit, the baron, who, from respect to the feel-
ings of his daughter, had spoken but little of his
wife since her decease, produced a casket, in which,
he said, she had told him, a few days previously to
her death, that she had deposited some small lega-
cies, which she wished him to distribute when she
was no more.
On opening it, he found her jewels, inscribed to
her daughter; several trinkets of small value, di-
rected to her favourite servants; and a parcel
superscribed for Edward, which contained a ruby
cross, that lord William recollected to have heard
her say had been given her by lyer cousin Harry

Cecil; and on the paper that enclosed it was writ-
ten—" Accept a mother's gift.”
“ Next my heart will I wear it ! ” exclaimed
Edward, “ for she who gives it has indeed been a
mother to me."
The tears of Rosalind flowed afresh as she looked
upon the ornaments, which brought to her memory
the form of her who had been accustomed to wear
them.
The baron himself did not see them without emo-
tion ; he called in such of the domestics as had be-
quests assigned them; and he had just distributed
the valued legacies, when a shrill horn was heard on
the outside of the castle walls, which was imme-
diately replied to with a louder blast by the sentinel
on the watchtower.
Lord de Mowbray sent out to enquire the cause
the servant returned with information, that a cou-
rier, then waiting at the foot of the drawbridge, had
brought the letter which he delivered into his lord's
hands. The baron broke the seal, and as his eye
passed rapidly over the characters which the paper
contained, pleasure sparkled in it. Turning to the
scrvant, he commanded the courier to be admitted,
and every attention to be shewn him in the castle :
then addressing his daughter, he said—“' My Ro-
salind cannot fail to recollect lord Rufus de Madgine-
court, to whom she gave her hand at the dance he
is travelling, this

and will make my castle his abode for a few days on

his journey towards his own; he will arrive to-mor-
row by the hour of dinner.”
Rosalind certainly did recollect him, and the same
unpleasant feelings which had attended her first
sight of him accompanied his image to her memory
now.
The baron proceeded without delay to give orders
for the reception of lord Rufus : a splendid entertain-
ment he directed to be provided in the castle ; he
commanded his forces also to draw themselves out
on the walls, and salute the entrance of his friend
within them: he then retired to rest, his brai: fill-
ed with floating ideas of his daughter's conquest, his
hopes of which have already been hinted at; and
Rosalind laid her head upon her pillow with the an-
ticipation of something disagreeable, she could not
decide what, arising from the intended visit.
Lord Ruſus passed a more uneasy night than
either, at an inn about twenty miles from De Mow-
bray Castle, where he rested on his journey.
At the time when lord William and his family
returned from the court, it must be remembered that
we left lord Rufus soaring on the wings of pride to-
wards the point which he vainly imagined would en-
sure him the summit of his earthly wishes, by ma-
king him the joint sovereign of his country with
his queen. Blind, we have already said, he had
hitherto been to all the attentions which Elizabeth
had bestowed on the other nobles who resorted to
her court, and clear-sighted only to the favour with
which she had honoured him, which his own vanity

prevented him from seeing as it really was, of an
equal nature with that conferred on other courtiers.
But his eyes had lately been opened, and he had
fallen from the pinnacle of his imagined glory into
the very abyss of madness and despair. Although
he had not been able to distinguish when others
enjoyed equal favour with himself, yet he had be-
come immediately clear-sighted, on one being se-
lected by the queen to be blessed with honours and
countenance superior to himself; and this had oc-
curred within a short space of time to Robert Dudley,
the younger son of the late duke of Northumberland,
whom Flizabeth had created earl of Leicester, and to
whom her partiality was such as could not escape
the dullest perception.
In him lord Rufus saw the downfall of his hopes
—the execrated period of his self-raised expecta-
tions ! All he now desired was that the earl might
in like manner fall the victim of his wishes; and
had he not dreaded the utter ruin of himself, being
the consequence of such a step, he would have put a
period to his rival's hopes in death. Rage, for a
length of time, alone filled his breast, and choked
up the powers of his mind; gradually the natural
policy and cunning of his disposition began again to
assume their sway, and he considered that next to
sharing the throne himself, the succeeding step was
to be second in honour. To this attainment the
road appeared to him easy and open. The queen's
first favourite was her goddaughter, Rosalind de
Mowbray; the father of that goddaughter was his

intimate friend ; thus he conceived that to ask and
to obtain would be the short prelude to the prefer-
ment which he sought.
On this errand was his present journey into Cum-
berland taken. Still the disappointment of the
past rankled more in his breast than the expecta-
tion of the future animated his heart; and there
was even a possibility; though he considered such
a possibility to be the very shadow of a shade, that
the prize he now aimed at obtaining might, by
some unforeseen obstacle, be withheld from his
possession; a second failure of his schemes he
felt his already irritated system very ill suited to
bear up under, and he truly dreaded the event of a
negative.
About an hour before noon on the following day,
the shrill clarion announced the approach of De
Madginecourt's train ; it was instantly replied to
from the castle, and the drawbridge let down.
Lord Rufus was numerously attended, and with
the most condescending smiles to those in arms
who saluted his arrival, he entered the first court
of the castle. Here he dismounted; the bridle of
his horse, while he alighted, was held by his page,
,
a boy of about fourteen years of age, of a most
interesáng person and intelligent countenance,
to whom, on entering the castle hall, he gave
his helmet to bear at his heels.
Here the baron de Mowbray stepped forth to
give his friend welcome, leading in his hand Rosa-
lind, whose native charms gained additional lustre

from the simplicity of her dress, which consisted
only of a long robe of black silk, which flowed to
her feet, and was confined round her neck and waist
with a single string of pearls. Lord Rufus met
her with a smile of ecstacy, while studied adula-
tion flowed from his tongue, with all that ease
which is natural to a man whose intercourse with
refined society has taught him how to make design
appear the involuntary act of nature.
Edward and Irwin were next introduced to his
lordship, on their entrance from the command of
their troops, which had been drawn out upon the
ramparts against his arrival, and the sumptuous
repast was then served up. That every sense
might be alike regaled, the pillared hall rang with
the sounds of various instruments, and the minstrels
sang the tales of valour and of love, the defeat
of France on the plains of Agincourt and on the
hills of Cressey, the contest of the Roses, and the
praises of their present queen; and these were fol-
lowed by love-ballads and romances.
The repast being ended, the health of Rosalind,
proposed by the lips of lord Rufus went round in an
overflowing goblet; and she then left the hall, that
her presence might not prevent the free circula-
tion of the wine, or be a restraint upon the revelry
of the hour.
She retired to her own apartment, to which her
attendant Gertrude soon followed her. Without
any other female, except this simple attendant to
exchange a sentence with, Rosalind had allowed her,

since the death of her mother, a much greater de-
gree of familiarity in her presence, than she would
else have done to a girl in her situation; and Ger-
trude had returned the confidence reposed in her
with the truest affection and esteem for her mistress,
Entering hastily into the apartment, she said—“Joy
to you, my dear lady! I hope I don't offend you
-I beg your pardon with all my heart if I do;
but I must be the first to wish you joy, if all that
is said be true.”
“ What is said, Gertrude?” asked Rosalind.
“ That the noble lord Rufus, about whom
there is all this bustle now in the castle, is come
on purpose to make your ladyship an offer of his
hand,” returned Gertrude.
“ If such is his intention,” replied Rosalind, “I
am sure it is unknown to me; and if such were
the case, do you really think it would be the occa-
sion of joy to me ?”
Why my lady,” rejoined the girl, “ they say
he is the first and richest nobleman in the land ; but
then, to be sure, if one's heart don't go with one's
hand, or is gone anywhere else before, as I
may
say, why then, indeed, that alters the case ; at least,
I am sure if I speak of myself, gold would have no
weight with me, if the other scale were filled with
love."
Rosalind smiled.
Ay, my lady,” went on Gertrude, “I've always
had my guessings: whether right or wrong, I've
always kept them to myself—I say nothing to any

of them below. There are his lordship's attendants
all dying to have a peep at their new lady, as they
call you; they say they have heard your ladyship is
so beautiful! just the wife for a man of his lordships
rank and wealth. I'll believe it when I see it,
thought I ; but I kept my thoughts to myself.”
Rosalind continued silent; Gertrude went prat-
tling on, and at last hinted, pretty plainly, at the
nice couple which, in her opinion her lady and the
charming master Edward would make. º
“I have no thoughts of marriage,” said Rosalind;
it is certain that I shall never give my hand where
my esteem has not preceeded it, and I confess that
Fdward is the enly man, except my father, whom
I have ever yet thought worthy of possessing it.
But then you are to recollect, Gertrude, that my es-
teem may be bestowed without my hand, though
my hand shall never be given without my esteem.”
The goblet had been so freely circulated in the
castle hall, that the baron did not require the pre-
sence of his daughter at the evening repast; and
having understood that she was not desired to pre-
side, she retired at an early hour to bed.
Rosalind's sleep was disturbed, her dreams
various and distressing ; one in particular, during
the influence of which she imagined herself in a
lonely wood, where she met a coffin borne on the
shoulders of skeletons, and the lid of which being
opened, displayed to her sight the mangled body of
Edward,
She awoke, chilled with horror at the recollec-

tion of her dream, and unwilling again to commit
herself to the tormenting power of sleep. Her lamp
was burnt out, a faint light shone through her win-
dow-curtain, and imagining that day was beginning
to dawn, she arose, drew on some of her clothes,
and went to the window : just as she reached it, the
castle clock struck five. She was now convinced
that it could not yet be day-light; she drew aside the
curtain, and perceived the moon floating in silver
splendour through a peaceful sky opposite to her
window. -
She felt a reluctance again to return to bed : thus
stood gazing on that planet which had often before
been the subject of her admiration and reflection.
The season was that of the depth of winter, and
the ground was covered with snow, the surface of
which the biting air had hardened into a sparkling
substance, which being reflected upon by the light
of the moon, appeared as if the earth was sprinkled
with myriads of stars. As her eyes wandered over
the scene before her, they fell on a distant object,
of which the dusky colour attracted her notice by
its contrast to the whiteness of the snow, and
which appeared to be in motion ; a few moments
discovered to her that it was a human figure, and
as it approached nearer, she saw that it was tall, and
wrapped in a dark-coloured cloak. It continued
to advance towards the castle, and, in a short
time, she lost sight of it, as, it turned an angle
of the walls which led to the drawbridge.
. She would probably have thought no more of

what she had seen, supposing it to have been
some person belonging to her father's household
that had been to the village, and was returning by
the advantage of the moonlight to the castle, but in
a few minutes more she heard footsteps on the ram-
part which ran under her window, and on looking
down she saw the same figure moving hastily along,
The sight rather startled her, but she felt con-
vinced that it must be somebody belonging to the
castle; it could be no enemy, or he would not
have gained admittance across the drawbridge from
the sentinel. Still she felt desirous of knowing
who this midnight wanderer could be, and what his
business abroad: there could be only one reason,
she concluded, for his passing along the eastern
rampart, and that must be to gain admittance into
the castle by the postern-gate, and she resolved
to go to it, and ascertain whether her suspicions
were just.
Arrived there, she saw no one in the court be-
low, and observed that the gate was shut; but
almost immediately she saw it glide back on its
hinges, and the muffled figure pass through the por-
tal. It looked round, and then cautiously locked
the door on the inside. This done, it proceeded
across the court; and even now Rosalind would
probably have thought no more of the circumstance,
had not the figure stumbled in its progress, and the
cloak fallen from its shoulders in its effort to re-
cover its balance. It stopped, and turning round
its head, as it again drew the cloak upon it, the light

of the moon fell on its countenance, and Rosalind
discovered the features of lord Rufus de Madgine-
court. -
The discovery surprised her, she could not ac-
count why she should be surprised at any action in
a man's conduct, with whose character she was so
little acquainted as she was with thatof lord Rufus.
He passed out of sight, and she continued at
the window in thought. Sometimes she argued
with herself the possibility of her having been mis-
taken in the countenance which she had believed
herself to have seen ; but truth would not be refu-
ted, her view of him had been too good for a mistake
of this nature, Whether she should mention what
she had seen, was her next point of debate with her
own mind ; and on this she concluded, that as his
actions could by no means concern her, it was her
wisest plan to be silent upon them lest her being
known to have observed them should draw forth
from any lips a reflection upon her having left her
bed at that hour in the morning, -
With true pleasure she hailed the light of day;
and no sooner did the crimson-fringed curtains of
the east announce the rising of the sun, than she
called up Gertrude, and began to attire herself for
appearing in the breakfast-room.
Lord Rufus and she entered it together, he beheld
her with all the studied admiration he had done on
the preceding day, and she looked upon him with
even more dislike than she had at first seen him
with, her unpleasant feelings with regard to him

being now heightened by the concealment which
had attended his entrance into the castle that
morning.
When breakfast was ended, lord William proposed
that they should ride out for an hour or two, and
fly their hawks, to which his guest readily assented,
and their horses were led forth. A milk-white
steed, with gilded trappings, bore the imperious De
. Madginecourt; proudly he neighed on receiving
his rider, and proudly lord Rufus bestrode his fa-
vourite horse. Of a commanding figure and per-
son, lord Rufus never looked to greater advan-
tage than when mounted on horseback; it was
therefore his favourite amusement, for, like all men
whose passions are relax, vanity held a place in his
heart ; and he now triumphantly gave the reins to
his steed, which sprang wildly forward with his
rider, and gave him an opportunity of displaying
to Rosahind, who had attended her father to the
drawbridge of the castle, his skill in the art of
horsemanship.
On their departure, Rosalind returned to the
breakfast apartment, where she had not been many
minutes before a gentle tap upon the door asked
for admittance; she rose, and opened it. The soli-
citor for entrance she found to be the page of lord
Rufus, who advancing into the room with a small
silver box in his hand, said—“Lord Rufus de Madg-
inecourt, my lady, commands me to request your
acceptance of this trinket, as a mark of his esteem
for you.” - -

Rosalind knew not how to reply ; she felt re-
pugnant to accepting any present from a man to
whom her soul was as averse as it was to lord Rufus,
and who she feared might construe her 'acceptance
of his gift into pleasure at receiving it, instead of
seeing it in the only light in which she could induce
berself to take it—that of not hazarding an affront
to a guest of her father by a refusal.
After some moments' hesitation with her own
mind, she coolly said—“Your lord does me un-
merited honour : pray return him my thanks, and
accept that piece of gold for yourself.”
The page put the silver box upon a table, received
his reward from the hand of Rosalind, and, with a
low obeisance, he quitted the room, saying, “ Alwin
is your ladyship’s slave.”
Vexed by the necessity she had been under of
accepting a gift thus forced upon her by a man to
whom it was unpleasant to her feelings to be
placed under the slightest obligation, the box lay
some time untouched ; at last she took it into her
hand, and opening the lid, she found it to be only
the case for a rich diamond necklace, in the cen-
tre of which, encircled by stones of great value, was
a picture ; she examined it, and found it to be the
resemblance of lord Rufus himself.
The discovery which she had dreaded was now
too clearly made, that lord Rufus intended to ask
her in marriage ; no other motive could have autho-
rised the gift she now held in her hand. She look-
ed upon it some time with a disgust heightened by

contrasting with his image the one which her mind
drew to rival it; -hence followed a train of ideas
which wound her senses to the keenest pitch of
feeling, and, unconscious that she spoke, she ex-
claimed aloud "Never shalt thou be the rival of
my Edward !”
A sigh behind her recalled her senses from her-
self to outward objects; she turned hastily round,
and observed Edward on tiptoe leaving the apart-
ment. His eye met hers; he hesitated in his
pace ; confusion glowed on both their countenances.
“I entreat your forgiveness, Rosalind,” stammer-
ed out Edward; “ I did not intend to listen to
what you were saying I did not come into the
room on tiptoe but you were so occupied that my
steps were unnoticed by you, and I could not help
hearing what you said.”
Rosalind blushed still deeper than before, but
she did not speak; and Edward was again moving
slovly out of the apartment.
“ You are not going ?” shesaid. " I have much
to say to you.”
He was by her side in an instant.
“Edward,” she wenton, “ I have always consider-
ed you as my brother; the dying gift of my mo-
ther warrants the name by which I call you; to
whom then ought a sister to disclose her griefs, but
to the brother of her affections ?
Speak out dearest Rosalind," he returned :
“ if you have wrongs, I will redress them if I am
able; if that is not in my power, I will not prove
myself unworthy of your confidence."

Rosalind showed him the contents of the box she
had just received, and explained to him her dread
of what declaration might not follow such a present.
The manly lip of Edward quivered as he repelled
the rising tear: for the first time in his life he felt
the dread of losing Rosalind, at a moment too when
her innocent confession had filled his heart with
joy and gratitude; speak he durst not—had he al-
lowed his tongue the privilege of speech, he could
not have restrained the drops of sorrow that would
have started with it from his eyes.
“ And yet,” said Rosalind, surely I fear too
soon, too vainly. I am my father's only child-her
he calls his darling hope ; surely he will not, by
unkindness, wither in its bud the blossom which
should cheer his age, which I would live to be,
would he henceforward cherish me with the same
affection he has hitherto done."
"Oh, Rosalind,” exclaimed Edward, “ that I
were any thing but what I am!—that I did but
know myself-
“ Are you not good, virtuous and brave ?"
asked Rosalind. “ What more is requisite to make
life happy? If you were a prince, you could not
more excel in those qualities than you now do ;
thus you are a prince already in that which is
most excellent, and best worth loving.'
“ It is not in fathers, my dear Rosalind,” returned
Edward, " to content themselves with such inherit-
ance in sons as philosophers might prize : with
them, especially with men who rank in society as

are the only pre-eminences which they seek in mar-
riage. Lord Rufus has both,”
"And you—"said Rosalind, mournfully.
“Shall ever be much blest in being still
ther," said Edward, interrupting her.
Rosalind burst into tears, and fell on his neck;
for the first time their arms entwined each other.
Edward raised her gently from his shoulder, and as
he led her to a seat, his eye fell on the window,
and he saw Alwin the page, standing in the garden
opposite to it, and looking inquisitively into the
apartment.
Rosalind's eye turned to the spot where she saw
Edward's fixed, and she observed the page.
“ Call the boy in,” she said, “and I will send
back his lord's present by him who brought it. You
shall be present at iny returning it.”
“I entreat you not,” said Edward: “if it be for
your happiness to return it, let it be conveyed back
to him through the medium of Lord William ; do
not put it into the power of that boy, whose pert-
ness and vanity bespeak him a favourite with his
lord, to convey to him a message of his own mould-
ing, upon a subject of this nature.”
“Do you think he had been long at the window?"
asked Rosalind.
Edward understood the modest fear that was
concealed in the question; he endeavoured to evade
an answer, but she understood that the page had

seer her face reclined on Edward's neck.-" Well,

WINTER'S TALE.
Had Rosalind been the only female who was that
day to have sat at her father's table, she would
have made it her excuse for remaining in her own
apartment, as she had aircady given her presence
once to lord Rufus in the banquet-hall; but on this
day the family of a nobleman in the neighbourhood
having been invited to the castle, in which were a
mother and her two daughters, she prepared herself
withoui hesitation, to take her place at the dinner
table.
She did not enter the ball until lord Rufus and
sorne of his companions were already there with her
father; thus she had no opportunity of speaking to
him alone. After some time he moved up to her,

aud whispered in her ear—“From a hint which has
been given to me this morning, I expected to have
seen a new ornament gracing your neck to-day,
Rosalind; or has your modesty, at a first gift, kept
you from wearing it? Methought you would have
been proud of the display.”
This remark confirmed her fears, and she said
—“Pray let me see you in my chamber to-night,
before you retire to your own.”
The baron returned an affirmative nod, and mixed
amongst his guests.
At dinner lord Rufus was, as he had been on the
preceding day, the occupier of the seat adjoining to
that of Rosalind; his eyes were the legible pro-
logues to what his lips were intending shortly to
convey, but the presence of the company restrained
him from more particular attention. After the
feast Rosalind saw him no more, as she retired to
her own chamber on the departure of the guests.
Wrapped in busy thought, she sat waiting the
coming of her father till the clock struck twelve.
She had alreadyenquired for him once, but had found
that he was engaged in conversation with lord Ru-
fus, and the gentlemen who composed his party.
She now sent again to ask concerning him, and
Gertrude brought her information that he and lord
Rufus had retired together into the baron's study. -
The heart of Rosalind beat more anxiously than
before. She could not fail to conclude of what was
their conversation. She dreaded lest her father,
lured by the splendour of de Madginecourt's offer,

might be led into some rash promise, in which her
future happiness might be involved, and she could
hardly forbear sending to request his immediate
presence. ~ -
An hour and a half more passed, and still she
heard they were together. At the expiration of
that time one of the baron's servants called Gertrude
from her mistress's chamber, desiring her to inform
Rosalind, that on account of the lateness of the hour,
his lord must defer seeing her till the morning.
Rosalind, on hearing this message, suffered herself
to be undressed, and Gertrude to draw the curtains
round her; but although reclined upon a bed of
down, sleep refused its balm to her agitated mind.
Alwin had faithfully communicated to his master
Rosalind's manner of receiving his present, and he
had equally taken care to represent to him the full
extent of what he had afterwards witnessed in the
breakfast apartment between her and Edward.
Alwin was the acknowledged favourite of lord
Rufus, and the reason of his being so was, as Ed-
ward had supposed, his artful exercise of qualities
which were useful to a man who possessed de Madg-
inecourt's spirit of intrigue. The boy had, from
almost an infant, been in his service, and proved
himself an apt scholar in those lessons which his
lord had given him, for mixing the meanness of
cunning with the playful childishness natural to his
years, and exercising them to the best advantage,
in gaining such intelligence as suited the favourite

scheme of his master, whatever at the time it hap-
pened to be.
During their morning ride, lord Rufus had com-
municated to De Mowbray his intentions concerning
his daughter, and the present he had that day Sent
to her. Lord William received his proposal with
evident marks of that joy with which it really in-
spired him ; and in answer to De Madginecourt's
question of whether the baron believed her heart to
be disengaged, he had replied that he was certain
it was so. Upon this intelligence, lord Rufus re-
turned triumphant in his own idea to the castle,
and De Mowbray experienced an exultation at the
completion of his desired plan, which he knew not
bow to confine within his own breast.
But this vain suitor and inconsiderate fathcr, who
should have recollected that the heart most inti-
mately concerned in an affair of this important
nature should have been the first consulted, met
with a severe check in their progress towards their
air-built castle, when lord Rufus, requesting to
speak in private with the baron at night, informed
him that Alwin had seen his portrait thrown down
in disdain from the hand of Rosalind, and her
cheek, bedewed with tears, rested on the neck of
Edward.
It was some time ere lord William could be in-
duced to believe that the boy had not been deceived
or was not deceitful in the information which he
had conveyed to his lord, and when convinced that

his report was actually founded in truth, his reply
was, that his daughter had ever lived on terms of
the greatest friendship with the youth Edward, and
that he doubted not but that she was imparting to
his confidential ear the first emotions of her joy.
Lord Rufus was too well acquainted with the his-
tory of the heart not to know what is the nature of
a friendship between two persons of opposite sexes
at the age of Edward and Rosalind, and he repre-
sented his opinion to the baron.
The baron in his heart was not less suspicious of
the truth than was lord Rufus, but not hesitating to
decide that his arguments in favour of De Madgine-
court, backed by his wealth, his rank, and his
passion, would easily turn the girlish affections of
his daughter away from the youth who lived only
by his bounty, he still maintained his first idea of
sisterly friendship to lord Rufus, and they parted
for the night, the baron promising to commune with
his daughter before he saw him in the morning
The baron, as it has been already said, retired
from his conversation with lord Rufus to his own
chamber. The observations of the page Alwin
perplexed him in the regulation of his conduct: º
not less did his daughter's request of seeing him
that night render him at a loss what to expect
from her lips: at all events, he judged it best to
prepare himself for meeting her with a night of
cool reflection, and for that purpose he urged the
lateness of the hour as an excuse for his not seeing
her before he went to bed. - - - - - -

Lord William slept little that night; he feared
that Edward was regarded in a nearer light by his
daughter than that of a nominal brother: now the
idea had once started into his brain, he recollected
many circumstances which confirmed him in be-
lieving it to be a just one, and which, at the time,
had escaped his notice, or at least his reflection.
After much debate with his own mind, he de-
termined to meet his daughter in such a manner as
if it were impossible for him to doubt that what
she had to communicate was her joy and pride at
the conquest which lord De Madginecourt's pre-
sent of his portrait shewed her to have made
of his heart. Should he find her communica-
tion to be of a different nature, he resolved, first
to endeavour to wean her mind from Edward, by
holding him up to her view as an object deroga-
tory to the honour of her affections. Should not
these means succeed in bringing her over to his
fondest hope, there were others left behind of which
he meant as yet to say nothing.
The sleep of lord Rufus was very little disturbed
by the occurrences of the day; he had no real love
for Rosalind, to keep him waking with the reflec-
tion that a rival might be possessing the heart he
coveted ; he doubted not but lord William would
be sufficiently clear-sighted to his own interest to
exert his authority over his daughter in the bestow-
ing of her hand, if he could not command her
affections along with it; and his motive for marry-
ing her was not of that nature which could suffer

any anxiety about the terms in which he receiv-
ed it.
At an early hour in the morning, the baron ens
tered Rosalind's apartment : early as it was, he
found her risen and prepared to receive him. After
the usual salutations of the morning, she took from
her table the present sent her by lord Rufus, and
extending her hand with it towards lord William,
she said—“I have to request of my dear father
that he will return this into the hands of lord Rufus
de Madginecourt with any apology for my not ac-
cepting it which he may deem best suited to the
occasion."
Lord William did not open his hand to receive
it, but spoke thus—“ I commend, my dear Rosa-
lind, the delicate principle upon which you refuse
a giſt of this nature; but you are still to be infor-
ed of the motive from which it springs—lord Rufus
asks your hand in marriage.”
“ My motive for returning it,” replied Rosalind,
" is still as strong as ever ; for lord Rufus, in the
offer of his hand, confers on me an honour I am in-
capable of accepting.”
Incapable ! why incapable ?” exclaimed the
baron, who now expected to hear the name of Ed-
ward advanced as the cause.
“ Because,” answered Rosalind, “ lord de Mad-
gincourt, my dear father, is a man whom as your
friend, I shall always make it my study to treat
with politeness, and, if I can, with friendship; but
were he not your friend, so far from loving him as

a husband, I could not even feel happy in his pre-
sence,
Childish prejudices, my Rosalind ! cried the
baron, “ too weak to inhabit a mind of education
like yours !
You can give him friendship, you say,
as being my friend; will not this induce you to give
him love as my son ?"
“Never!" returned Rosalind : " if he persists
in asking that, I fear I shall forget he is my father's
friend, and repeat the indulgence I was, on that
consideration, willing to allow him.”
“ You are firm in your replies," returned the
baron rather warmly.
“ I have been taught by a fond parent, now no
more," reptied Rosalind, “ that women, like my-
self, have only one period of existence at which our
resolution is not sinful, and may be instrumental to
the happiness of our future lives—it is when we are
called upon to bestow our hearts where we are in-
capable of bestowing the passion that alone renders-
them valuable."
Rosalind's firmness was solely in her words.; the
fears were trickling down her cheeks, and her lips
were pale. The baron maintained silence; the re-
collection of lady de Mowbray which Rosalind had
called forth softened for awhile that pride which
was steeling every feeling of his heart, and inter-
rupted him in the volley of praise which he was go.
ing to pour forth on the wealth and worth of lord.

and he set before her all the arguments which he
had devised during the night, to tempt her into
an acceptance of De Maginecourt's hand.
Rosalind continued to oppose them which the
placid reasonings of the heart; and the progress
of an hour left the baron entangled in the web
of his own sophistry, and unable to support his
pleas—so infallibly does Nature in her pleadings
ever triumph over her foes.
But still, though perplexed in his arguments.
De Mowbray felt himself possessed of a father's
authority, when his eloquence failed him ; but he
judged it the wisest plan not to cxert it too sud.
denly, lest, if a determined air accompanied his
words, if his daughter once decided it cruelty in
him thus to urge her inclination, that decision might
render her desperate, and stamp the utter ruin
of his hopes; he accordingly concluded with re-
questing her to promise him that she would for
the course of one month, endeavour, by every
means in her power, to alter her opinion of lord
Rufus, to reflect on the honour that awaited her
as his wife, and to exert herself for the happi-
ness of a father who sought only her welfare.
Although convinced within herself what would
be the issue of such a compliance, that were
the month a century, her opinion would still be
the same, she consented to this proposal annex-
ing to it only one condition of her own—that as
at the present time she undoubtedly did not regard
lord Rufus as the man whom she could ever consert

to receive as her husband, the present which he had
sent to her must remain in his possession till she
had changed her sentiments concerning him.
With reluctance the baron received it at her
hands, and repaired to the breakfast-table, from
attending him to which Rosalind excused herself.
On the entrance of lord Rufus, the baron met
him with an assumed smile ; and with some com-
ments on the delicacy of feeling natural to a girl of
her years, he told him that it was her wish to be
allowed a month for her decision, which he left lord
Rufus no reason to doubt would be in his favour,
as he informed him that she had not spoken a sin-
gle sentence to him, in their conversation that
morning, relative to Edward, whom he was now
convinced, she regarded only in the light of a friend,
or she would not have passed by so favourable an
opportunity of declaring a warmer esteem for him.
This was one artifice which he used to blind lord
Rufus to his daughter's real sentiments; another
was, that of not returning to him his portrait, but
retaining it in his own hands, and, by his silence
relative to it, leading him to believe it still in
Rosalind's possession.
In compliance with her father's commands, Ro-
salind was constrained to appear as usual at table,
and to receive those attentions from lord Rufus,
which tended only to render him more odious in her
sight. -
No opportunity had occurred for her to see Ed-
ward alone for a single moment, since that morning

when she had so innocently breathed forth the con-
fession of her heart ; but Edward had not required
this avowal to tell him that their sentiments were
the same, though various causes had withheld him
from making a display of his own affection; nor
did Rosalind now want to see him, in order that a
repetition of the same professions might convince
her of his truth and constancy, more than she was
already convinced of them.
Edward was about this time very little seen at
the castle ; a tower of strength had for some time
past been erecting at the foot of a bridge, which
crossed the river running through the neighbouring
village, and which pass, by being ably guarded, it
was believed would materially impede the moss-
troopers in their incursions into the kingdom ; and
the command of this tower had been given by the
baron de Mowbray to Edward.
hat'o him and Rosalind the cause of his removal
Nom the castle appeared obvious : but it gave them
no anxiety ; they loved too truly, and too disinter-
estedly, for either to fear that absence should weaken
the affection of the other.
Rosalind was in doubt whether Edward knew the
terms to which she had been compelled to agree
regarding lord Rufus ; she wished him to know
them ; but no safe method of conveying the intelli-
gence to him presented itself to her relief.
Edward was at this time arrived at his full
growth and strength : in form he was tall, well
proportioned, and active; his person more than

ordinarily handsome, yet manly and commanding :
his hair black, and falling in short curts on his
forehead and neck ; his eyes extremely dark, and
unusually expressive-in these beamed the intelli-
gence of his mind, and on his lips played the good-
humour and benevolence of his heart.
Rosalind united in her person a'! the fascinating
beauties of a Venus and the modest graces of a
Diana ; exquisitely fair, her light brown hair hung
in shining ringlets on her neck, as on a bed of
polished ivory ; her soft blue eyes sparkled with
sensibility; her lips emulated the smooth ruby,
and she spoke only to complete the witchery her
face had begun,
IIl-fated pair ! how little did ye dream, whenye first
felt the glow of affection for each other warm your
youthful hearts, that the innocent passion would
lead you to misery! How little did ye then undar-
stand, that the noblest sensation of the breas rd
snapped from its stem by the withering hand it is
pride, and the purest sources of Nature's happiness
turned from their course by the greedy finger of
avarice!
Oh, Love! passion omnipotent and pre-eminent !
how nobly dost thou display thine own superiority !
-how gloriously assert thine independence! when
amidst a host of contending foes, thou risest still
above their menaces and frowns, unshaken in stabi-
lity; and when enclosed within the thorny circle of
the world's prejudice, still findest a heart's-ease

CHAPTER XI.
Ah me! for aught that ever I could read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.
SHAKESPEARE.
Day crept on after day, and as the expiration of
the fatal month drew nigh, lord Rufus worë on
his countenance a smile of joy and triumph, whilst
on that of De Mowbray was painted a sullenness
which had heretofore been unusual to it.
Lord William fed his friend with a belief, that a
ready affirmative to his proposal would flow from
the lips of his daughter, whilst convinced himself
that her opinion was unaltered. He grieved that it
Nas so; and he grieved still more that his pride
urged him to compel her to enter into an alliance
which she abhorred; but he could not bring him-
self to sacrifice the honour of an union with the
first nobleman in the kingdom, to the whim, as he
regarded it, of a girl, whose opinions he considered
as originating in caprice, and whose inclinations he
doubted not would easily adapt themselves to any
man, once become her husband.
Accordingly the determination of lord Williami
was, that Rosalind should
the wife of lord

Rufus ; and being thus resolved with himself, he
directed all his subtilty to make lord Rufus believe
it her voluntary act, though virgin coyness ren-
dered her cool in the display of her sentiments.
On the day previous to that which concluded the
month of trial, lord William addressed his daughter
with these words —“To-morrow, my Rosalind
expires the time which my indulgence has permitted
to your girlish reserve. I hope that it has been
long enough to teach you to act with discretion in
an affair of which you must see the importance to
your happiness and my own ; not doubting to find
your opinion in concurrence with mine, I shall take
an opportunity of seeing you alone to-morrow
evening.” -
He did not wait for a reply, but immediately
turned from her. Rosalind burst into tears, and
left the room. Her departure was not unob-
served by him; and the cloud with which she
alone seemed to darken his future hopes for the
first time irritated him against her; and the
word “obstinate” fell unintentionally aloud from
his lips. And, alas ! how often does it fall from the
tongue of parents, when daughters cannot accom-
modate their feelings to the convenience for which
fathers wish them to marry
On the following afternoon, when Rosalind left
the castle hall after dinner, Gertrude met her, as
usual, to attend her to her chamber; but on arriv-
ing in the gallery which led to it, Rosalind turned

to the opposite side of the mansion, and with a
slow step proceeded along.
My lady,” said Gertrude, “
you are wrong.
Whither are you going ?”
Into the cedar-chamber, Gertrude,” replied
Rosalind.
“ What, the cedar-chamber where my dear lady
died ?” exclaimed Gertrude; “ sure you won't go
into it this afternoon : consider, nobody has been
into it since the day her sad remains were taken out
of it; it is all hung with black yet, you know, and
indeed I think you had better not go till to-morrow
morning, if you wish to visit it.
“ To-morrow morning, Gertrude,” answered
Rosalind, “ would not suit my purpose in going
into it; it must be to night.”
“To-night! echoed Gertrude. « What then,
you have heard the nonsense that the servants and
people talk ; but sure you can't believe that it is so
my lady?
That what is so ?" asked Rosalind with sur-
prise
" Oh, nothing at all-nothing, if you don't
know.” returned Gertrude.
You have said too much,” replied Rosa-
lind,“ to escape a confession now. What is it
that is said ?"
“ Why, if you insist on knowing, my lady-
nothing more than that an odd kind of a shadow has
sometiines been seen near the door of the cedar-
chamber of late—that's all,” said Gertrude.

If
you mean to hint to me,” returned Rosa-
lind, that my dear mother's spirit haunts the
room in which she breathed her last, oh, may it
be permitted to visit her unhappy daughter!”
Why, my lady, to be sure you would not wish
to see such a sight ?” cried Gertrude,
" What not desire to see my mother, and such
a mother too as mine was! Oh that it were possi-
ble for me to see her now, and to gain comfort from
her lips! But fear not, Gertrude, that my wish
should be accomplished, there is no intercourse be-
tween the living and the dead.”
Sure, my lady, begging pardon for saying so
we hear of ghosts in the Bible, you know.”
“ Not since the revelation of God's will to man
in the person of his Son,” replied Rosalind :
“ before that period, such appearances, we are
told were accidentally permitted on earth, for some
especial purpose of the Creator, but now are no
longer necessary.”
" If it be so, my lady, and I dare say you know
best, because you have had so much good learning,
what a pity it is that, amongst the many other com-
forts the New Testament has "for us poor sinners,
it don't mention that there are to be no more
ghosts! I am sure it would have been a great
happiness for many of us if it had.”
They were now arrived at the cedar-chamber;
the door was not locked, though the apartment was
in disuse. Rosalind entered first, and Gertrude
followed her with a slow and cautious step, which

did not shew her thoroughly convinced of her lady's
doctrine. The room was still cased with black,
and the large knots of sable plumes, which had
been placed upon the bed to grace the funeral
pomp, were still hanging over it. The hour was
that of twilight, and the portion of day which was
admitted by the high and narrow casements such as
rendered the appearance of the whole scene so dark
and melancholily awful, as might have shaken a
stronger mind than Gertrude's with superstitious
fears.

stood close by her, anxiously desiring to look on
every side at once, as if expecting to behold some
object of alarm at every point of view, and yet so
timid as not to be able to raise her eyes from the
ground.

“ I am not going to depart from hence,” said
Rosalind.

will be quite dark; we shan't see our way out of
the gallery into your apartment.”
“ Then go you down whilst there is light to
shew
you your way,” said Rosalind,“ and bring
me up a lamp."
Gertrude would rather have argued upon this

command than have obeyed it; but, however
reluctantly, she was obliged to do the latter. In
a short time, Gertrude returned with a lamp in
each hand, which provision she had made for light-
ing herself down again, lest the want of such a
convenience should have obliged her to have conti-
nued a partaker of the gloom in which her lady, so
unaccountably to her thinking, seemed resolved to
remain. Rosalind saw her intention, and telling
her to inform her father, when he should inquire for
her, where she was, sent her away.
With her eyes fixed on a portrait of her deceased
mother, which hung suspended over the wide and
cheerless chimney piece, Rosalind sat awaiting that
interview with her father on which she believed
the fate of her future days to depend. With re-
flection for her only companion, her memory
strayed back to the days of her happy childhood,
and so crept on through every circumstance of note
in her life to the present. With a mind abstracted
from the world, she dwelt on many days of bliss
that would return no more; the sigh escaped her
lips, and the tear stole down her cheek. Thus,
absorbed in thought, she sat, till a rustling noise
roused her from her reverie.
She started, and looked round her ; the noise
was repeated more gently than before, and seemed
to proceed from behind the black drapery which
covered that end of the room against which stood
the head of the bed: she took up her lamp, and
went to the spot ; the arras was unmoved, and was

hanging equal with the wall in every part. It must
have been the wind, she believed, that had shaken
the hangings; and thus convinced, she felt almost
angry with herself that Gertrude’s prattle should
for a moment have caused her to suppose the noise
she had just heard to have been produced by any
other cause.
As she was returning towards her seat, she heard
a footstep approachng along the gallery, which
she imagined she recognized to be her father's; and
she was not deceived, for in a few moments he
appeared at the door. Entering but a few steps
into the apartment, he said—“Why does my
Rosalind choose this chamber for our conference ?”
Because," replied Rosalind,“ it is the spot
peculiarly sacred to the memory of my mother ; and
at a subject like the one that we are about to dis-
cuss, I would, if possible, have both my parents
present.”
Lord William cast his eyes around the chamber,
with a countenance on which was depicted a mix-
ture of regret and dissatisfaction; he then returned
slowly to the door, and having closed it, he seated
himself on the same couch on which Rosalind was
sitting
Although you have lost one parent,” he said,
can you doubt, my child, that the loss has
diminished to you any of the parental affection I
owe you?”
I hope it has not, my lord,” replied Rosalind ;

a proof of it—to find in your heart that double por-
tion of affection which would have been divided
between you for an only child, had my mother
lived."
“ You know, Rosalind,” rejoined lord William,
“ that my wishes are for your happiness and gran-
deur.”
“ Alas, my father," answered Rosalind, « how
sickly a companion do you give happiness to thrive
under, when you join it with grandeur ! It is the
deadly night-shade twining round a healthy vine to
rob it of its sweets! If you would give me happi-
ness, give it to me in its most enchanting garb
of affectionate tranquility.”
“Lord Rufus," returned the baron,
“ loves
you too well not to grant you every indulgence
which can contribute to your enjoyment of happi-
ness according to your own ideas."
" Oh no, my lord,” replied Rosalind; “ if it
ever becomes his right to be the dealer out of hap-
piness to me, my felicity ends the moment such a
right commences.”
“ You speak too firmly on conjecture and pre-
judice,” answered De Mowbray.
“ What can you oppose to my ideas, that shall
confute them with any degree of certainty ?” asked
Rosalind. Surely it is more reasonable to seek
happiness in humility, than to encounter misery for
the sake of wealth."
“ You allow love, then,” said the baron,

“ If it has,” replied Rosalind, " and that love
be for me, I should be unjust to him, as well as
to myself, in giving him my hand, for I have no
love to return him for his."
“ But you are not incapable of the passion,”
answered the baron, with a satirical smile.
" I am incapable of deceit,” answered Rosalind ;
" and if to esteem one above the rest of his sex-
to feel for him as a brother, when other men pass
unheeded by, is love, I hesitate not to confess it.”
The baron breathed a groan of contempt.
“ But hear this also, my father,” continued Ro-
salind : “ force me not into the arms of lord Rufus,
and I bind myself, by the same indulgence, never
to ask of you to receive the man I love as any
other than my friend, if you shall refuse to call him

Four son.”

" I call him now my dependent,” exclaimed
the baron; “ for I know your minion, though I
have concealed from my knowledge-Edward; he
he whom I raised from beggery and want to my
protection, and whom one instant is enough for me
to crush again! My dependent !”
“ But as your dependent,” cried Rosalind, “ in
the confirmed superiority you hold over him, does
it not become you to be more kind to him than if he
Were your equal, only because he is your depen-
dent?"
“ And is my kindness to extend to making him
my heir ?” roared out the baron.

“ It is not required of you,” replied Rosalind.
“ You have drawn me into speaking of him,
when I meant only to have spoken of myself.
You have said that you would supply to me the
place of my lost parent, by added affection on your
part. You said my happiness was your desire. Send
lord Rufus hence, and I will bind myself, by a
solemn vow, never to become the wife of Edward.”
The baron was going to reply, when a deep sigh
was echoed from the other end of the chamber.
He started up, and seizing the hand of Rosalind, he
exclaimed—“Who is here concealed to overhear
our conversation? Confess, I charge you, who
your hidden witness is!”
“On my sacred word,” replied the trembling
Rosalind,“ there is no one concealed that I am ac-
quainted with-indeed there is not."
After a pause, the baron let go her hand, and
moved towards the spot from whence the sound
had proceeded. The place was nearly the same
where Rosalind had heard the noise before, but
somewhat further removed from the bed. The
baron passed his hand over the arras; no impedi-
ment obstructed its progress. He looked around
and under the bed ; nothing was to be seen or
heard.
“ Did you not hear a voice ?” he asked, return-
ing some steps into the middle of the apartment.
I thought I heard a sigh,” replied Rosalind;
but it was probably the wind that caused it.

137
That corner of the arras was shaken by it before
you came in,”
" Was it ?" said the baron, his countenance be-
coming a little more composed; “I dare say it
must have been so. There can be no one concealed
for I have felt the wall uninterrupted along the
whole side of the chamber."
He again threw his eyes round the room, return-
ed to his seat, and spoke thus :-“ Rosalind, I
should not be the affectionate father I profess my-
self, did I not suffer my parental authority to over-
rule your scruples, where I am convinced the en-
forcement of it is for your eventual good. I am
sorry my child should be so unlike me in her ideas
of propriety and real happiness : I trusted that the
month of deliberation which I gave you would have
been much more than sufficient for opening your
eyes to the good that presents itself to your accept-
ance ; and as I see you still blind to it, it becomes
my duty to treat you as I should be compelled to
do, were you a timid infant shrinking from the
taste of a medicine on which your life and welfare
were depending.”
“ If lord Rufus be the loathsome draught you
mean,” replied Rosalind, “ I have sufficient firm-
ness to declare, that I will not swallow poison at a
father's hand, although he be so prejudiced as to
believe it a wholesome drink."
“ You are now,” said lord William, with a
forced smile, “becoming the very infant which I
spoke of. You conceive the draught to be nau-

seous, and push it from your lips, without courage
to make the experiment of its flavour.”
“ Can you wonder at that, my lord,” asked Ro-
salind,
“when, if the draught prove bitter gall
itself, 'tis drank for life ?”
“ But if those who have studied its powers
tell us that it is desirable," asked the baron, “how
then ?"
“ Ask them if they have tried its effect upon
themselves ?” returned Rosalind." But drop, my
lord, this allegory: plain reasonings best suit a
discussion of interest like this. You are rich your-
self; you stand high in honour; my alliance with
this man cannot make you more prosperous : then
why desire the sacrifice to be made ?”
“ Should I die,” returned the baron, “ would
you not want a protector ?”
“ Should I die,” raturned the baron, “would
you not want a protector ?”
“ The daughter of lord William de Mowbray is
a sufficient protection,” answered Rosalind : “be-
sides, I possess the additional one of my sovereign's
favour."
“ That sovereign may die ; the times may alter,”
said De Mowbray.
May not lord Rufus die too ?” asked Rosalind.
“ He has counted full your years, though you
judge him an equal alliance for your daughter.”
“ The more matured by experience his years,
the higher the honour of his condescension,” re-
turned lord William, " and the more ignoble it

mise."
" Though the heart of your only child, be broken

mother, why art thou not now alive, my mother!"
“ Shame! Shame !" cried the baron ; " thy wish
is blasphemy against a father's affection."
“ I have no father !” sobbed out Rosalind, in a
voice almost choked by contending feelings. If I
had a father, I would not lament a mother's repose
from the cares of life ; but the nature of liim who
was my father is changed; he makes his child the
tool of his ambition, and throws off love for pride."
“ Rosalind,” exclaimed the baron, in a voice
almost as much stifled as her own, but with differ-
ent sensations, degenerate girl, kneel, and
thank thy mother that the semblance of thy voice
to hers spares me my bitterest —"
Oh, do not curse me!" shrieked out Rosalind,
falling at his feet. " How have I erred ? I can-
not change my nature, any more than lord Rufus
can alter his : I do not condemn him, because his is
such as I cannot love: let him not, on that

not.
She rose, and took his hand.
“ You recollect my mother,” she said “or you
could not have compared my voice to hers. I thank
Heaven that you have so strong a recollection of
her! and I will now venture to tell you why I asked
you hither.”
She led him towards the bed ; standing by its
side, she continued thus—" It was on that bed
my mother breathed the sigh of death ; upon your
bosom rested her head; her arm was wound round
my neck, and, in the struggle of departing life,
she clasped me to her face; to imprint upon my
lips her dying kiss : scarcely she breathed; the
tale of her crossed love had worn her strength to its
feeblest extremity. Once more she spoke— Give
my Rosalind to the man of her heart !”
Pride, rage, and affection, were impetuously
tossing in the heart of lord William. In the
tumult of the two former passions, the softer
feeling was overwhelmed, and he burst from the
innocent supplicant, in an ungovernable ecstacy of
rage.
Rosalind fell to the ground, with a faint shriek,
and, at the same instant, a voice exclaimed—“Oh,
spare
her!”
De Mowbray's features fell; the stupor of aston-
ishment seemed for a moment to lock up his every
sense ; then snatching the lamp from the table, he
spare her!

hastened with it towards the arras; but in hiş
haste he hit it against the flowing curtains of the
bed, and it went out.
His passion and disappointment were now be-
yond all bounds. He called aloud for assistance ;
and having with some difficulty, found the chamber
door, he repeated his calls in the gallery. They
were quickly attended to, and several domestics
appeared with lights.
He repeated the search he had made on hearing
the sigh, and with the same ill success : nothing
was to be discovered behind the sable covering
which yet dressed the apartment. Puzzled and
almost alarmed by the occurrence, he rushed out
of the room, and commanded that Rosalind should
be conveyed to her chamber.

CHAPTER XII.
Hail! thou house of death !
And thou, the lovely mistress of these shades,
Whose beauty gilds the more than midnight darkness,
And makes it grateful as the dawn of day!
Oh, take me in a fellow-mourner with thee !
I'll number
groan for
groan,
and fear for tear ;
And when the fountains of thy eyes are dry,
Mine shall supply the stream, and weep for both !
Rowe.
In a state of wretchedness of mind, which it
was almost beyond her strength to bear, Rosalind
continued for some time to traverse her chamber in
silence and solitude, save the presence of Gertrude,
who stood, statue-like, observing her mistress from
one corner of the apartment, and who did not at
all hesitate to conclude that she had seen the dread-
ful shadow in the cedar-chamber, of which the report
was gone abroad in the castle.
In about a couple of hours, a knock at the cham-
ber door called Gertrude to it: it was one of the
baron's servants, who put into her hand a letter
for Rosalind, and departed. The paper contained
these words:

.
Rosalind, you have this evening so far
despised my authority, that it becomes a justice in
me to myself to exert a power over you ; prepare
yourself, therefore, to become the wife of lord
Rufus de Madginecourt, on the fifth day from the
present one. Your father affectionately if you
merit his love,
“ DE MOWBRAY."
i
!
The paper fell from the hands of Rosalind, and
she sunk down upon the bed. Tears would no
longer come to her relief ; the iniquity, the cruelty
of her father's conduct, froze them in their source.
To her his nature appeared entirely altered since
the arrival of lord Rufus : but such was not the
case ; his nature was the same as it ever had been
kind, where it did not interfere with his views to
be so—relentless, where his firmness was to proa
duce him the completion of any desired plan.
An instance of this nature had never yet occurred,
in which Rosalind had been concerned ; thus she
believed that part of his character, which accident
had not yet made her acquainted with, newly
assumed.”
In a short time, she recovered herself sufficiently
to send Gertrude to her father, to request his pre-
sence in her chamber. Gertrude returned, and
brought her intelligence that he was engaged with

his guests, and could not leave them. Rosalind
could not thus calmly bear a refusal to her petition,
and taking up her pen, she wrote to him, request-
ing that as he would not indulge her by visiting her
himself, to inform lord Rufus it was her wish to see
him.
She dispatched her note, and after some time
Gertrude returned again, with information that lord
Rufus was, like himself, engaged, and could not
be interrupted.
Rosalind believed that her father had not commu-
nicated her request to lord Rufus, and in this sup-
position Gertrude confirmed her. +
“My die is then irrevocably cast !” she cried.
“A father dooms his only child to be the victim of
his pride, drags her to the altar, a living sacrifice to
his ambition, and blasphemes the blessing which he
there bestows on her, by fixing an everlasting thorn
in her heart Oh, heavenly powers! will you suf-
for such cruelty to pass without redress.
“Ah, my lady,” said Gertrude, “I never saw
the happiness of poverty before ; but it strikes me
now, that my humble situation in life is a much
happier one than yours; for as my father is only a
poor delver, and I have nothing more to expect
from him than the life he has given me, if he were
to be as cruel to me as the baron is to you, and
would not let me marry the man my heart was set
upon, it would be no loss to me to run away from
him, and please myself; but if you were to do so,

what a great fortune of riches you might loze by
such a step! and I suppose indeed that keeps you
from it.”
“ Oh that there were time allowed me to ask the
intercession of my godmother, my queen!” ex-
claimed Rosalind.
“ But there is not half time enough for that,”
returned Gertrude : “ five days are not enough for
a man to get to London in, let alone the coming
back besides."
“I will not become the wife of lord Rufus "
said Rosalind, “ except force compels me to it!"
" And Mr. Edward has not been to the castle
for a week or more: he is always at the new tower
in the village now. What a thing it is of him to be
absent at this time! surely, my lady, it would but
be right to let him know what is going forward ?”
“Not for me, Gertrude—it would not indeed,"
replied Rosalind.
“ Is that a step,” she added,
with a smile, “ that you would take were you in
my situation ?"
“ That I am sure I would, my lady,” returned
Gertrude ; “ and I can't see the indelicacy, begging
pardon, of a lady's doing it, any more than a poor
girl like me. If you did not fove him, you would
not marry him; and if you do love him well enough
to marry him, why not accept the same service
from him as if he were your husband already ?”
“But I have promised my father not to think of
Eiward in the light of a liusband, if he will not urge
me to accept lord Rufuss one.”

“ But he does urge you, you see, my dear lady;
and I am sure his brow looked as stern as a lion's
when I carried you note to him," answered Ger-
trude.
A pause ensued. Gertrude broke it-" What
a pity it is Mr. Edward is not here to give you
advice, my lady."
“ On no account send to him," replied Rosalind,
" for while you imagine that such a step might
give me relief, it would in reality only add to my
unhappiness. It is enough for me to meet lord
William's scorn myself: let him continue where he
is and avoid it."
The clock now struck eleven, and Rosalind dis-
missed her attendant. Conscious that sleep would
not visit her pillow that night, she continued
wandering about her chamber, till another hour
had passed away. She had not been long alone
before she conceived an inclination it was one of
those which hearts overburdened with grief cannot
explain, yet find imaginary comfort in) to visit her
mother's grave that night, and spend some time by
it. When the midnight hour had sounded, she
opened the door of her chamber, and stepped into
the gallery to listen whether all the family were
retired to rest. Not the sound of a single footstep
pacing the marble hall or lofty passages met her
ear; not the faint flickering of a dying lamp caught
her eye.
With a light in her hand, she moved cautiously
forward, treading gently lest she should herself be

overheard. Arrived at the top of the great stair-
case, she paused: the sounds which she had that
night heard in the cedar-chamber recurred to her
memory, and, in spite of her fortitude, a cold chill
ran through her veins. She resolved to rally her
strength of mind, and the most potent medicine
which presented itself for its revival was the con-
viction that whether it were the voice of a human
being or of supernatural agency which had that
night been heard by her, it was a voice friendly to
herself.
She descended the stairs and crossed the marble
hall, in the immense space of which the single
lamp which she bore in her hand appeared a speck
of light quivering in an universal gloom, impene-
trable to her sight. Hasty were her steps till she
had reached the vaulted passages on its opposite
side; and here the shutting of a distant door
struck upon her heart, and suspended her respira.
tion.
She was approaching towards the apartments
which lord Rufus inhabited in the castle, and the
recollection of her having seen him abroad at the
early hour in the morning which she had once done,
led her to imagine that circumstances might again
bring him from his chamber on this night, and
that it might be the sound of his door she had now
heard.
She shaded her lamp in the folds of her dress,
and looked around to discover if a light was any
abere visible : darkness and silence prevailed on

all sides, and she ventured to proceed. With the
swiftness of an antelope, she flew through the cor-
ridor into which opened the door of lord Rufus's
dressing-room. She had now nothing to fear from
any part of the family ; the succeeding passages
which led to the chapel were unconnected with the
inhabited part of the castle, and seldom resorted
to, except on the Sunday. She reached the chapel
without interruption. She looked around her, for
the most courageous wish to be certain that no
danger lurks near them ; and having assured her-
self that she was alone, she placed her lamp in a
niche of the wall, at a short distance from the
tomb of her parent; and then sunk upon the cold
marble that inclosed her form. Her tears now
came to her relief, and, in fervent prayer, she be-
gan to regain her composure of mind.
A shrill but distant whistle awakened her from
her meditations and devotion. She started up and
took her lamp in her hand. The whistle was
repeated. It sounded from a narrow passage lead-
ing into one of the aisles of the chapel, which
wound into vaults and cells now in disuse, since
the main building had been converted from a reli-
gious purpose into its present state, and which she
believed, opened upon the northern rampart.
Fear seized her : the sound predicted the ap-
proach of some human being, and she knew not
whom or what to suppose it: if she fled, her lamp
might discover her retreat ; if she put it out, she
despaired of retracing her way to the marble hall.

In this dilemma, her heart beating high within
her breast, she was standing, lost in irresolution,
when she heard the fall of approaching footsteps.
Excessive terror urged her : the idea of self-pre-
servation for the moment filled her mind, and,
blowing out her lamp, she stationed herself behind
a massy pillar, where she hoped to escape observa-
tion. Scarcely was her lamp extinguished before
some animate being ran against her with a violence
that almost threw her down, and at the same in-
instant a cold and clammy substance was pressed
against the back of her hand ; all her courage for-
sook her; she shrieked and fainted.
The sounds of " Rosalind-dearest Rosalind !
’tis 1—'tis Edward!” recalled her into life ; and
she found that it was indeed Edward who supported
her in his arms.
“ Rosalind !” he said, “ how is this? Why do
I see you here at this hour of the night ?”
“ I have been at prayer by my mother's grave,
”
replied Rosalind. Oh, Edward, how little did I
imagine that I was you, by the sound of whose
steps I was so much alarmed ! but you were not
alone-it could not have been you who ran against
me when I stood behind the pillar ?”
“ I have a friend with me,” replied Edward,
" but he was by my side when I heard you shrieks,
and flying to your assistance, found you lifeless on
the ground.”
Rosalind turned to observe the friend of whom

he spoke, and recognized in him the countenance
of the so-called surly Hubert.
“ I beg your pardon, lady,” said Hubert,
for myself but for my dog, who I am sure would
ask it for himself of you, if he were able ; for he it
was, no doubt, that created you the alarm of which
you have just been speaking,"
Hubert was standing at some distance from Ed-
ward, and by his side was a large mastiff, which
fixed its eyes on Rosalind, and seemed to be wag-
ging its tail in approbation of his master's apology.
This dog was the same which had attracted
Hubert's compassion, when a cur, on the ramparts
the first day of Edward's introduction to him, and
which, pitying for its poverty, he had since bought
of its master and attached to himself. The dog's
name was Lion.
Convinced, at the sight of the dog, that it had
been his cold nose which had touched the back of
her hand, Rosalind could scarcely forbear a smile
at her late aların'; and being now relieved from the
terror that had before filled her mind, her thoughts
wandered into another channel, and she returned
to Edward the question which he had before ad-
vanced to her—" How is it that I meet you here ?"
Hubert's eye caught that of Edward, and he re-
tired to a greater distance.
When he was out of hearing, Edward spoke
thus : -" I have all this evening been watching for
an opportunity of seeing you. I knew this to be

the day on which your answer to the proposals of
lord Rufus was expected, and—”
“ You were then acquainted with the month
which was given me for consideration ?”'interrupted
Rosalind.
“Oh yes, yes,” returned Edward
;
nothing
has passed during that time in the castle with which
I have not taken means to gain acquaintance,
though I have been seen but little in it; but know-
ing the decision you were to give this day, I could
not forbear making an attempt to see you."
“ But why enter the castle by those dismal
vaults?” asked Rosalind.
" Because I must not be seen in it,” he returned.
The baron has commanded me not to leave the
tower in the village for an instant, on pain of his
most violent displeasure. I see the motive of his
command, and although I endeavour to preserve
the appearance of obeying it, my heart will revolt
from such discipline, and lead me hither by stealth.”
The tears burst from the eyes of Rosalind, and
Edward held her to his breast for some moments
in silence.
Edward spoke first.—“ Hubert is my sincere
friend; gratitude for kindness I have shewn him
has bound him to me; he admitted me by the
entrance from these vaults, which opens upon
the ramparts, some hours ago, and I remained
here whilst he sought an opportunity of inform-
ing you that I was waiting to see you ; but, alas !
he sought you in vain ; you were not in your cham-

ber, but in conference elsewhere with your fa-
ther.”
Oh, that was a dreadful hour !” said Rosa-
lind.
“ At eight o'clock I was obliged to depart to
place the guard for the night at the tower, in order
that my having been absent might not be suspected
by the soldiery, amongst whom are, no doubt, spies
upon me from lord William. That done, I pre-
tended to retire to rest, bụt with the midnight hour
I again stole forth, and found my trusty friend
awaiting my arrival on the rampart. Here it was
my intention to have remained whilst he proceeded
to the chamber of Gertrude, and entreated her to
give you information of my being here, and of my
wish to see you. Guess my surprise, when I
found you in the very place where I most longed to
behold you, and least expected to find you.”
“ And this is now, perhaps,” exclaimed Rosa-
lind, “our last meeting : I have but four days yet
to call my own; the fifth gives me to wretchedness
and to De Madginecourt.”
" Is it thus decreed ?” cried Edward.
God! oh Rosalind ! that I were any thing but what
I am an unknown!-and I would swear the sun
should never rise
upon
that deed !"
“ Vain were the oath, my Edward,” returned
Roslind; “.vain all that you or I can do save me !
What can avail our words, our prayers, with
hearts steeled against pity, like my father's ?”
“ I would not use either,” returned Edward

prayers with the cruel are but edges to their re-
solution, and sharpen their vengeance to cut the
deeper. If I loved thee less than I do, Rosalind,
I could save thee, sweet !
"" What mean you by this riddle ?” asked Ro-
salind. : “ How am I to understand that you love i
me too well to strive for my happiness ?”.., 1
“ Did I not value you too dearly to lower you a
feather's weight in fortune's scale, I might say,
'Give your hand to a dependent, and be the name,
of wife your security against an unjust father's per- |
secution."
Oh, Edward,” cried. Rosalind,“
you speak
of impracticable chimeras: were. I willing to throw
myself into your arms, you know the priest could
not be found who would join the hand of de Mow-
bray's daughter in marriage without his sanction
and especial command.”
Edward struck his hand with violence against
his forehead, and turning his face aside from Rosa-
lind, stood wrapt in thought. He saw the force of
ber remark : wedded they could not be. At tempt-
ing her to fly with him, without the name which
could alone dişunite indelicacy from the act, he
recoiled. Convinced also was he that in this point
all argument would have been lost upon her, had
his heart even leant to the means : thus to become
the wife of lord Rufus appeared her inevitable
fate.
" In spite of my father,” said Rosalind, “I will
see lord Rufus to-morrow; I will set before him

my aversion to an alliance with him ; I will implore
his mercy. If he has a heart, he will not surely
join with a father in an act of cruelty against his
child.”
To this resolution Edward returned only a sigh
of despair.
How swiftly fly the hours which lovers steal to
interchange their pleasing griefs ! Scarcely had it
appeared to either a minute since they had met, and
the envious clock, now striking three, warned Ed-
ward that ere the expiration of another hour, he
must be in the village at the post of glory.
Hubert advanced, and told him that it was
necessary for him to depart.
“ Promise me," said Edward, that you
will
be here to-morrow at midnight, and inform me of
the success of your interview with lord Rufus.”
“ I will indeed be here, Edward,” she replied,
and with a silent embrace, whose eloquence was
most expressive, they parted.

CHAPTER XIII.
There's one did laugh in his sleep, and one cried murder !
That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them.
MACBETH.
CAUTIOUSLY Rosalind retraced her steps through
the vaulted passages, scarcely allowing herself to
breathe, lest any sound which threatened a disco-
very of her nightly visit might escape her hearing.
A footstep alarmed her, but it was only that of a
sentinel on the ramparts, which sounded through a
grated window in the lofty passage. A few minutes
after she heard the guard relieved, and now she
trembled lest they should by any means discover
Edward in his retreat from the castle.
She paused
a few moments; all became hushed again, and she
went on,
Arrived at a flight of steps which led into the
corridor upon which opened the first of the suite of
apartments occupied by lord Rufus, a chill of fear
again pervaded her frame ; she could not forget her
having seen him abroad at the early hour she had
once done, and she could not conquer her alarm
lest he should be again returning to his chamber,
or leaving it, just as she might happen to pass the
door.

At the distance of a few paces from it she stopped
to assure herself that all was quiet ; she listened-
all was still, and she was on the point of proceed-
ing when a wild laugh burst on her ear, accom-
panied by a blow which seemed to strike the floor
of the room, and resembled the noise of some one
falling with great violence. Her every nerve trem-
bled, and she could scarcely hold the lamp in her
hand; a momentary silence ensued, and she then
heard a voice which it was impossible not to recog-
nize for that of lord Rufus, exclaiming
" Die she
must! If she will not kill herself, I must do it for
her! It is but one sta'r, and all is over !"
The terror of Rosalind was wound to a pitch of
such excess, that it was with difficulty she could
forbear calling out ; her knees seemed bending
under her ; she fell against the wall, and with dif-
ficulty kept herself from sinking to the ground.
A soft voice within the chamber spoke next.-
“My lord ! my dear lord ! pray come to bed again!”
it said.
• There—there !” exclaimed lord Rufus,
done! 'tis done! nobody knows it, and I am my-
self again!"
“ My lord ! awake, my lord ! pray awake!” re-
joined the other voice.
A momentary pause was followed by a deep
groan. De Madginecourt then said, in a softened
tone_" Oh, Alwin my boy, these nights are
dreadful-dreadful ! I must have air."
Rosalind now imagined that their steps were.

moving towards the door, and exerting all her re-
maining strength, she fled towards the great hall.
Here the beating of her heart was so violent, that
she was again apprehensive of sinking, and clung
to one of the marble pillars for support ; she, how-
ever, heard no pursuing step, and from this, cir-
cumstance she derived such comfort as in a short
time regained her sufficient strength to bear her to
her chamber.
She threw herself into a chair, her brain bewil-
dered with such a chaos of ideas that it was for
some time incapable of reflection. Of whom, she
inquired of herself, could it be that lord Rufus had
spoken in his sleep? Was he a murderer, or did
he intend to become one ? Of the crime she deci-
ded him equally guilty ; whether it were already
perpetrated or only planned ; and this knowledge
put the seal to her determination of never becom-
ing his wife, avoid the dreaded ceremony how she
might.
She had told Edward that it was her intention
to request an interview with lord Rufus, for the
purpose of setting before him the injustice of which
he was guilty towards her, by suffering a father
to treat his daughter with the cruelty to which she
was subject on his account; but, aware that the
heart which is capable of executing or commanding
the death of a fellow-being musi' be callous to the
voice of suffering, she now resolved not to see him,
if even he should himself request admittance to
her presence, in consequence of the note which

she had on the preceding evening sent to her father.
To him she felt no hesitation in determining not.
to impart what she had that night overheard in
de Madginecourt's apartment; blinded as he was
by prejudice, he would, beyond all doubt, accuse
her of fabricating a tale to the injury of him with
whom she wished to avoid an alliance, and her
want of a sufficient reason for having passed his
door at that hour in the morning would give colour
to the very imputation he would wish to put upon
it. Once she believed it possible that effective
means might be taken for frightening the truth out
of the page Alwin, but she considered that as he
was the only domestic allowed to sleep near his
lord, and this she knew to be the case, he was
doubtless well instructed in replies to any questions
which might be put to him ; and even if that were
not the case, without her father's assistance, which
she was certain of not having, she was not possess-
ed of the power of obtaining the desired explana-
tion from his lips.
She resolved not to quit her chamber that day,
but to see Edward again at the hour she had pro-
mised to meet him in the chapel, and be guided by
his advice. -
At dinner the baron sent to request her presence
in the hall. She replied to the invitation that she
was unwell, and begged for the indulgence of re-
maining in her own apartment.
Rosalind had not tasted repose on the preceding
night, and in the evening she laid herself upon her

;
couch, hoping to sleep awhile, and gain strength
for the ensuing night, which would be passed in
waking. She had not been long reclined when a
rap at the door called Gertrude to open it, and on
the outside she found Alwin. He was come, in the
name of lord Rufus, to inquire after her health, and
to request permission to visit her.
She returned in reply, that she was too much
indisposed to admit a visitor, and Alwin departed
with his message.
“ What a proud saucy urchin that Alwin is !".
said Gertrude, as she shut the door upon him
" he gives himself more airs than any of his lord's
attendants besides, or all of them put together I may
say; and I wonder what for for my part.”
Rosalind did not wonder, but listened attentively
to hear whether Gertrude knew more.
“ The little fool is as proud as a horse to day,”
Gertrude went on,
of a fine diamond button his
lord gave him this morning to loop up his hat with.
I am sure he has luck on his side, and indeed the
proverb seems made out with him, that it is bet-
ter to be born with good luck than good fortune,'
for they say it is not to be believed how fond lord
Rufus is of that boy, and what a number of hand-
some presents he is always making him.”
The reason was plain to Rosalind, but she made
no comments on Gertrude's observations, and, in a
short time, fell into a slumber, which was attended
with distressing dreams, and from which she awoke,
about two hours before midnight, unrefreshed.

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER
At her accustomed time of retiring to rest, she
dismissed her attendant, and when her hour of
ap-
pointment with Edward was come, and she be-
lieved all the inhabitants of the castle to be locked
in sleep, she left her chamber, sighing that the
cruelty of a father should drive his only child to
steal through his mansion like a midnight plun-
derer, for a moment's repose on a heart of friend-
ship.
With all the fears that had attended her on the
preceding evening, she again moved cautiously
along, shuddering as she passed the door of lord
Rufus's apartment ; but safety guided her footsteps
into the chapel. She had not left her chamber till
the hour had sounded twelve ; thus she found Ed-
ward ready to receive her.
“ Heaven bless you, my dearest Rosalind !” he
exclaimed, pressing her to his heart.
“ It has protected me through dreadful terrors
since I beheld you last,” she returned ; and then
related to him the occurrences of the preceding
morning, in her return to her chamber.
Edward's opinion was, like her own, that any
appeal to the humanity of the baron, upon the plea
of what she had heard lord Rufus utter within his
chamber, would be without effect. How then was
she to escape the hated fate that awaited her ?
" Oh Heaven !” exclaimed she, “ thou alone
hast power to interpose, and save me from the
dreadful sacrifice of my eternal peace!”
“ Heaven has presented us the means,” return-

ed Edward : “ it rests alone with my Rosalind to
accept or refuse them.”
" What are they?” asked Rosalind.

which by the step I shall propose becomes uncer-

from misery, I will now ask whether Rosalind will
become the wife of the humble Edward ?"
“ You know,” replied Rosalind,“ that were my
mind prepared for this step, our union is impos-
sible.”
“No-no, it is not impossible !” exclaimed Ed-
ward : I have at this moment a friend within call,
who is willing to unite us by the most sacred bonds
of religion.”
" Who can he be,” asked Rosalind,“ that dares
thus to hazard lord de Mowbray's displeasure ?”
“One,” replied Edward, « whom ill fortune has
sunk into necessity: he is a priest of the catholic
persuasion, who, driven by the laws of our present
sovereign from the exercise of his office, lives in
obscurity in the neighbouring village. Want presses
upon the poor old man, and he has consented, for
the reward I have promised him, to unite us by the
ceremony of our own church.”
A silence ensued. Edward broke it." Will
not my Rosalind,” he said, “ consent to save her-
self from the horrors of a forced marriage ?”
“I shudder,” returned Rosalind,“ to assent to
a deed on which I know a father's curse will fall."

;
“ Is it not his cruelty, in attempting to fix a
cu rse for life on you, that drives you to it?" return-
ed Edward “ and have you not, my Rosalind, the
consent of the parent whom you most value to my
becoming her son ? Look at this cross,” continued
he, producing it as he spoke, “the legacy of her
deathbed to me : is it not inscribed to Edward, as
a mother's gift? She had herself been torn from
the heart of her affections, and did she not confess-
her apprehension of the same fate awaiting her
daughter when she implored your father to give
you to the man of
your
heart ?
“ Oh that she had lived to have received his
promise to that effect !” exclaimed Rosalind.
“How much agony might have been spared her
child! Oh that she were now alive, to give her
sanction to our union !"
>
“ It is already given : she has called me her son,
said Edward.
The tears flowed swiftly from the eyes of the
trembling Rosalind, and as Edward supported her
agitated frame in his arms, he continued to whisper
his entreaties for her happiness into her ear. But
three days were yet her own before the hated de
Madginecourt was destined to become the master
of her person.. Edward urged tlrat he might be
prevented from meeting her again before the dread-
ed time arrived—that the priest might refuse again
to accompany him. Hubert appeared in view at a
distant part of the chapel. Edward called to him,

and directed him to bid the priest advance to the
altar.
“Oh, Edward—Edward " faintly articulated
Rosalind, and hid her face on his neck.
“May Heaven desert me,” exclaimed the youth,
“when your happiness ceases to be may first and
only care l”
Slowly he led her towards the altar. The priest,
a venerable aged man, stood forth. Her tears
ceased to flow : she almost ceased to breathe. The
ceremony was read, and Rosalind was a-wife
Edward extended his arms to bestow the first
embrace of a husband, and Rosalind sunk senseless
into them.
Some time elapsed ere she again awoke to sense,
and it was then only to give vent to her tears.
Scarcely able to move, she leaned upon Edward,
and he conducted her to her chamber.
With the early morning it again became Ed-
ward's duty to return to the tower in the village,
and he was constrained to leave Rosalind over-
whelmed with tears, with his vows of tenderness,
and promise of meeting her on the succeeding
midnight, for her only solace. -
Dreadful became the reflections of Rosalind when
left to the solitude of her chamber. Edward, her
beloved Edward, she now feared, would be made
the victim of the baron's revenge, for having been
the means of rescuing her from becoming the sacri-
fice of his pride : the idea almost maddened her,
and she now wished that her hand were her own to

she loved from her father's anger.
The day crept slowly on with Rosalind : Gertrude
was her only companion. In the afternoon she felt
an unquerable desire to visit the cedar-chamber; she
wished to see her mother's portrait, and almost to
ask it whether it approved the step she had taken.
Accordingly, whilst Gertrude was at dinner, she
repaired to the apartment where her parent had died.
Arrived at the door, she endeavoured to enter, but
the lock resisted her efforts, and she was obliged to
return disappointed towards her own chamber.
Lord de Mowbray, she concluded, had caused it
to be shut up, in consequence of the alarm he had
received there on the night she had been in confer-
ence with him in that apartment. As she returned
slowly through the gallery, her thoughts resting on

the face and arm of a man thrust out of the door of
the cedar-chamber. She thought he beckoned to
her ; but at the same instant a step was heard in
the distant part of the gallery, and he drew in his
head again hastily, and shut the door : the step was
Gertrude’s who appeared with a light in her hand.
Rosalind directly retired with her attendant to
her chamber; no one was in it. She framed an
excuse for going into her closet, and thence into
the chamber where Gertrude slept. No one was to
be seen, nor were there any marks of any one
having been there. The circumstance rested on the
mind of Rosalind : as she had not seen the figure
return, she feared there might be some secret outlet
from her chamber with which she was unacquainted,
but which might be known to lord Rufus, and of which
he might take advantage for visiting her in opposition
to her wish of not seeing him. No one but her father
she could suppose it, who had opened the door of the
cedar-chamber; and if it had been himwhom she had
seen there, she was as much puzzled to guess why he
should have visited it, as she would have been to
have decided how any, one else could have gained
admittance into it; at all events, she concluded
that she must have been deceived in supposing the
figure, whoever it was, to have beckoned to her.

its sorrows in a kind and sympathizing heart,

the tear with which it meets ours renders it of in-
estimable value to our feelings.
This sensation did Rosalind experience when she
reposed the history of her sorrows and the confes-
sion of her marriage in the breast of the artless
Gertrude, from whose tender sensibility and unaf-
fected sympathy she derived a most consolatory
relief.
With the sounding of the midnight hour, Rosa-
lind opened her chamber door, and anxiously
awaited the coming of Edward. Time passed on,
and no approaching step cheered her listening ear.
She left her chamber, and wandered towards the
grand staircase leading into the hall. All was
silent. She knew not what to imagine nor what to
fear: she dreaded lest he had been discovered in
leaving his post, or in eatering the castle; still she
hoped he was safe, and only delayed by some un-
foreseen circumstance. The clock struck one.
She supposed that she might have mistaken his
words, when she had understood that he would
come to her apartment, and that he might now be
expecting her arrival in the chapel as on the two
preceding nights. Impressed with this idea, she
delayed not a moment to proceed towards it: too
wretched to be shaken from her purpose by any of
those alarms which had before agitated her mind,
she was now experiencing terror for the safety of a
husband.
Arrived in the chapel, no friendly voice welcom-
ed her approach—no cheering lamp blazed in the

niche where his before had held its station : all was
silence and darkness. She moved towards the
passage which led to the vaults opening upon the
ramparts: extending into it the arm which bore her
lamp, she looked anxiously forward, but void alone
met her eye. Still she hoped he would come, al-
though it was now evident something had occurred
to detain him beyond his promised time.
She seated herself on the steps of the altar—of
that altar at which the sentence of her future life
had so lately been pronounced past all recall. The
clock struck two, and still he came not. Another
hour was lingered out by her in anxious expectation.
Again the clock sounded, and no Edward was
arrived. The twilight of the morning would now
soon be breaking through the dark clouds of night
she durst no longer be absent from her chamber,
and, in a paroxysm of heart-broken sadness, she
returned to it, and threw herself upon her disconso-
late bed. *. -
In the morning the baron de Mowbray entered
her apartment: a smile of triumph was painted on
his countenance, beneath which she foresaw some
evil to herself to be lurking.
“I know,” he said, “ that it will give my
Rosalind pleasure to be informed of the promotion
and honour of her friend and favourite; I am,
therefore, myself the first to inform her that
Edward is appointed to the command of a regiment
which forms a part of the troops our queen is about
to send into Flanders.”

" Par-
Rosalind would have spoken, but her efforts to
articulate were ineffectual.
“ The nature of the times presses for hasty
steps,” the baron went on : “ he had but a few hours
to prepare for his departure. He commenced his
journey to the coast whence he is to embark yes-
terday.”
“ Gone !” exclaimed Rosalind;

“ You informed me yesterday by your servant,”
returned the baron, “ that you were too unwell to
admit visitors when lord Rufus and myself made the
inquiry. This I told him, and promised to bear
you his apology."

Edward was content to send me an apology instead
of a farewell from his own lips ; nor can I credit
that it was his voluntary act to leave me at this
important moment. You have driven him hence
that his presence might be no impediment to my
accepting the hand of lord Rufus ; but know, my
lord, that if I never see him more, he has left an
impression on my heart which will prove a breast-
plate of steel to guard me from that monster's
arms.
“ It is well that you are thus provided with a
champion in his absence,” returned lord William,
with a satirical sneer : “ and what may be this
mighty talisman that forms the armour which you
vaunt of ?-is it love?"

" Pure as the source from whence our affection
flows,” replied Rosalind ; “ it is a safeguard to the
breast that nourishes it, for it teaches that breast
to preserve its own honour for the sake of that
heart's honour with which it is united."
“ Love, with all its enchantment," answered the
baron,“ is not always strong enough to draw a ma-
gic circle of security round the heart it inhabits.”
“ Because the violator of such enchantment,” re-
joined Rosalind,“ employs such wicked arts to
break the spell as love is too innocent to have de-
vised for its formation ; still, when too grossly ag-
gravated, and too cruelly beset, it has a tower of
safety to retire to, where it assumes a name on
which even few ravishers, monstrous as lord Rufus,
dare intrude.”
“ You seem well schooled in arguments to back
your weak prejudices,” answered lord William
* think you you should be as great an adept in their
practice?”
“ The most harmless reptile, my lord,” replied
Rosalind, may be stung by an envenoming ser-
pent, till, by a sudden effort of desperate strength,
it shall rise and free itself from the tyranny of its
oppressor. Such do I consider myself ; trodden
upon by the joint persecution of yourself and lord
Rufus, I have turned and asserted my freedom.”
Ay, your freedom !” echoed lord William ;
“ are you sure of that ?”
“. My release from an alliance with lord Rufus is
for me liberty enough,” answered Rosalind,

“ And what charm has insured you this release ?”
asked the baron, half laughing.
By assuming that name which had made him

wife.”
A silence of some minutes ensued. The eyes of lord
William flashed fire: those of Rosalind were sunk
and fixed upon the ground. The blood which had
on the first sound of wife fled from the cheeks of
the baron began again gradually to return to them,
and he exclaimed, in a tone of mingled doubt and
passion-" This is a trial of falsehood to deceive me
but it will not pass.”
“ It is no trial,” returned Rosalind, the words
faltering on her tongue, “ but the last effort of a
motherless child to insure herself a protector when
cast off from the affection of her father.”
“ Is Edward thy husband ?” roared out the baron.
“ He is, he is !” replied Rosalind.

CHAPTER. XIV.
There's mercy in each ray of light that mortal eyes e'er saw ;
There's mercy in each breath of air that mortal lips e'er draw;
There's mercy both for bird and beast, in God's indulgent plan;
There's mercy for each creeping thing—but man has none for man !
M. G. LEWIS.
The miseries of the unfortunate Rosalind appeared
now to be wound to their most poignant acme ; and
she even thought that she should have experienced
less wretchedness as the wife of lord Rufus, than
she now felt in the belief that Edward had been
driven from England on her account, and as she
considered the indignation which her father would
bear against him, now he had learnt that the union
which he had dreaded had been effected.
Edward was torn from her—perhaps for ever.
She endeavoured to pray, but her mind was too
much agitated for the office, and she flung herself
into a chair, scarcely able to encounter the light of
day.
In the evening lord William again appeared in
her apartment. In the most solemn manner he
commanded her to confess to him, by the hopes
she entertained of her soul's felicity, whether or
not she was the wife of Edward. His tone struck
terror to her heart, and sinking at his feet she im-

plored his pity and forgiveness ; but the tempest of
his impassioned mind was too wild to allow him
either to feel for her distress, or attend to her jus-
tification of herself; and uttering dreadful me-
naces against her disobedience and Edward's
temerity, he left her.
On the following morning, Rosalind was proceed-
ing to the door which led from her closet upon the
rampart; Gertrude hastily followed her, and with a
tear starting in her eye, she said—" Alas, my
lady, grieved am I that I am compelled to tell
you such unpleasant tidings—but you cannot pass
that door; the key is taken from us; you are the
prisoner of these apartments ; it was your father's
command that you should be confined to them
quite alone: but I implored not to be taken from
you; and as I promised solemnly not to let you
out of them, the baron gave me leave to stay
with you. I hope you are not angry that I accor-
ded to such conditions, rather than leave you
alone ; indeed, it was my love for you, my dear
lady, that impelled me to do it.”
“Am I then a prisoner in my own father's
mansion ?” said Rosalind—” denied the common
air, which Nature allows to the guilty as profusely
as to the good ? and am I deprived of its blessing,
because I am unfortunate ? Oh, Gertrude! kind
girl! thou art now the only solace of my af-
flicted heart!”
“I will be as far as I can, my lady,” returned
Gertrude; “ and when I am deficient in consoling

you, you must attribute it to my want of power,
and not my lack of will, for indeed I love you
dearly ; you are the kindest and best, as well as
the most injured lady; and let all the world
turn their backs upon you, Gertrude will do all
in her power to serve you."
Thus spoke the honest-hearted Gertrude, whose
sentiments would have shamed the noble inhabi-
tants of De Mowbray Castle, had they seen
through any sense but that of prejudice; and truly
did she act up to her declaration, in her endea-
vours to rob the hours of her mistress's impri-
sonment of their heaviness, by her prattle and
attentions; but still they crept on with painful
slowness. No tidings could she gain of Edward;
not a breath could Gertrude ever gather of his
fate, in her conversation with the other domes-
tics of the castle. Sometimes Rosalind was in-
clined to believe that her father had forbidden
them to mention, in Gertrude's hearing, any in-
telligence which might have been received of him,
wishing to deprive her even of the solace of
having his name repeated to her by her atten-
dant ; but in this point Gertrude's uncle Ambrose,
who was in fact the friend of Rosalind in his
heart, declared her mistaken, as he was certain
that whatever his lord might know of Edward's
fate himself, it had never transpired from his lips
to any one in the castle.
Lord Rufus departed on the second day after
the discovery of Rosalind's marriage had been

made to her father; but whither he was gone,
Gertrude heard not.
From this time, five months had passed away,
during which Rosalind continued a prisoner in her
chamber, and saw no human being but her faithful
attendant. Her father,
Her father, so far from visiting her,
never inquired after her at all; he concluded that
she was alive, or that her death would have been
reported to him ; for her happiness or health, it was
evident, from his commands respecting her imprison-
ment, that he cared not-nay, it was often a doubt
even to himself, whether he did not wish her dead,
rather than the wife of Edward. It was true, he
conceived—for even disappointed men, like lord
William, endeavour, in their own breasts, privately
to extract some good from the most hated circum-
stances--that it was possible Edward was her equal
in rank : the word “ noble” had escaped the lips
of him who had called himself his grandfather on his
deathbed, and been spoken in reference to the youth ;
but whether of his birth, or his mind, it had at the
time been a point of doubt with him, and was so
still. If noble by birth, of whom was he the heir ?
and why had he been thus obscured in the early
years of his life ? On this he had often reflected,
and found himself now as little able as ever to solve
the enigma ; the chances, he feared, were greatly
in favour of his being only the simple Edward,
the grandson of the plain old Matthews ; and, upon
this fear, he could not bring himself to bend to the
necessity of the occasion, by acknowledging him

as the husband of his daughter, but was resolved
to keep their union a secret for ever, unless such a
proof as he wished for, of his equality to his daugh-
ter's rank, should ever appear in his favour ; it is
also true, that he might have procured him to be
declared the heir to his own title and estates; but
this was poison to his pride, in his idea—hugging
a serpent to his bosom, which had been nursed into
presumption by the weakness of a headstrong girl,
who had defeated all his plans of aggrandizement;
and he made a vow, within his own heart, never to
perform that lenient act towards those by whom he
conceived his dignity and authority to have been so
grossly and contemptuously insulted.
His days were passed in superintending the mi-
litary concerns which were transacting at his castle,
and repelling the incursions ofthe borderers, by send-
ing out detached parties to route them from their
holds, in which skirmishes his men, from the ad-
vantage which they possessed in having been more
regularly trained to arms than the freebooters had
an opportunity of being, were usually successful.
His leisure hours were passed in disturbed reflections
with his own mind, during which he generally wan-
dered about the ramparts, or paced the marble hall
of the castle. Irwin was always the companion of
his meals; and sometimes he added to the society of
the table his other leaders.
Wretched and more wretched as the days crept
on, and no intelligence could be gained by her of
the fate of her husband, Rosalind conceived the idea

of addressing a petition to her sovereign, requesting
her intercession with her father, and explaining to
her the full history of her unfortunate situation ;
but she found, by the means of Gertrude, whom
she directed to make enquiry to that purpose, that
the baron's strict injunctions had been issued to
every individual in the castle, not to receive any
letter from his daughter for delivery out of it, with-
out first bringing it to him for inspection: she still
for awhile believed that some inferior domestic might
be won by a bribe to convey it for her into a proper
channel for reaching the queen ; but overawed by
the dread of what cruelties her father might inflict
on her, should her emissary be tempted to treachery
by the hope of meeting a second reward at the hand
of lord William, she desisted from her design.
Great as Rosalind had already, and justly too,
believed her portion of woe, the period was now
come which brought with it a discovery that gave
its keenest edge to the sharp tooth of misery which
preyed upon her heart. This discovery was that of
her being destined to become a mother!
Incessantly did the tears of Rosalind now flow.--
“ Unfortunate babe !” she would exclaim,
hast not yet beheld the light, to how bitter a portion
of sorrow mayest thou not be born!--no father to
welcome thy entrance into life—a grandsire, cruel to
thy parents, who will perhaps revenge on thy inno-
cent head the crimes of which he thinks them guilty
mother worn down by affliction, who will cradle
thee on a breast of anguish ; and when thou lookest up

to her for a smile of joy, will check thy fondness with
the tears that fall for thy unhappy birth ! Oh God
thou hast still mercy to bestow, and art perhaps most
merciful, when thou withholdest it from the mother,
to bless her doubly in bestowing it upon her child !”
Scarcely two months were now wanting to the time
at which her babe would see the light: not once
had lord William visited her, since the day on
which the confession of her marriage had been made
to him. Frequently since her discovery of her pre-
sent situation, had she entreated to see him, but
in vain; he had returned contemptuous, sometimes
brutal, replies to her messages borne to him by
Gertrude. Still she was resolute in her desire of
seeing him : with the gloom natural to her present
situation and misfortunes, she had most strongly
imbibed the idea that the birth of her child would be
the period of her own existence ; and her anxiety to
see her father proceeded from her wish to recom-
mend to his protection her yet unborn babe, whom
she dreaded he might doom to share the neglected
fate of its unfortunate parents, although it could not
be otherwise than innocent of their faults.
The baron still continued deaf to the entreaties
of his daughter to visit her; and Rosalind became
wretched beyond bearing, at the idea which haunt-
ed her, of dying without having recommended her in-
fant to his protection, and having received his pro-
mise to that effect.
At length she wrote the sentiments of her ha-
rassed brain, and putting them in the hand of Ger-

trude, besought her not to leave her father till she
had prevailed on him to peruse them. Interested
in the fate of her mistress, Gertrude implored the
grant of her request, in terms which led the baron
to suppose that some extraordinary cause must
exist to render her thus resolute in her entreaties;
and his curiosity being thus excited was probably
the cause of his receiving the letter at her hand, and
breaking the seal.
Gertrude waited to see no more, but ran back
with the joyful, as she believed it, intelligence to
Rosalind.
The paper fell from De Mowbray's hands when
he had perused its contents. He had believed that
Fate had exerted all its ingenuity in tormenting
him, when it had given the hand of his daughter
to the unknown Edward ; but he now found it sub-
tle in its plagues beyond his belief, when he learnt
that an offspring of the hated marriage was about to
enter the world, and his protection implored by his
daughter, as her last request, for the child of the
man against whom every indignant and rancorous
passion of his heart was raised.
Edward, he considered, subject as he was to
the fate of war, might be cut off from a return to
England; his daughter might have been weaned
from his memory, and induced to form an alliance
in a sphere suited to her birth—perhaps even with
Lord Rufus de Madginecourt himself: but now a
perpetuation of the act which he wished to have for
ever buried in oblivion, and which he was satisfied

to be little known in the world, was about to start
up, and hand down to future ages what he deemed
the disgrace of his family. -
Rage was too cool a term for the emotion of his
soul; every nerve quivered with hatred, disappoint-
ment and dread. The passion of pride cannot be
supported without the aid of vices more heinous than
itself: it is a fact which has often been asserted,
and as often proved, before the days of lord William,
as since his time; his conduct serves only as ano-
ther example to elucidate its truth. He resolved
the babe should die.
This resolution was the event of a sleepless night;
and when he arose in the morning, assuming a com-
posure in reality foreign to his mind, he wrote to his
daughter, informing her that she might rely on his
protection for her child.
Rosalind kissed the paper which contained the
promise, and thought her father still was kind. .
On the first opportunity, lord William took occa-
sion of conversing apart with Mr. Wilmot, the sur-
geon of his household, and this conference called
for the exertion of all his wariness and subtilty.
The baron knew Mr. Wilmot to be a man strongly
educated in those prejudices which support the
dignity of high birth, and scarcely consider even as
minor sins those alliances which infringe on family
rank and honours. Thus far he knew him suited to
the purpose of his present conference with him ;
but then he likewise knew him to be a man of so
strict principles and religion, that he would fly-off

from him the moment he saw him deviating but a
single hair's breadth from the path of rectitude,
though he was certain of his utmost assistance in the
support of those prejudices which corresponded with
his own sentiments, while they demanded no sa-
crifice of honesty or honour.
Artfully then did he disclose to him the preg-
nancy of his daughter; and having, with equal art,
brought him to confess that he thought it necessary,
to the honour of his family, rather to bring up the
child at a distance from the castle, than to permit
it to live within its walls as the acknowledged off-
spring of Edward and his daughter, he told hiin
that he had a service to require of him, towards
the forwarding of his plan, which was to pronounce
the child still-born, as he feared that if the mother
knew it to be alive, it would be impossible to re-
move it from the castle, and thus the disgrace,
which he so much dreaded, would, without his con-
sent to this proposition, be indelibly fixed on the
honour of his house.
With this demand Mr. Wilmot was for some time
unwilling to comply. He first demanded whither
the child was to be sent ? and in reply to this ques-
tion, lord William showed him a letter forged by
himself for the purpose, which contained an agree-
ment, and promise of secrecy, as from a farmer's
wife in Westmoreland, to bring up the child as her
own, on condition of receiving a yearly sum from
the baron." She believes it,” said lord William,
a natural child of my own.”

181
This letter hushed Mr. Wilmot's scruples in part :
his other objection was, the pain it would create to
the mother when she should be told that all the
pangs she had endured were without a recompence;
but this objection, after some time the baron also
overruled, by representing to Mr. Wilmot how
much more in favour of her happiness it would be
for her to believe her child had never existed, than
to know it alive, and constantly to be desiring to see
it, without the possibility of so doing, which the
baron said would undoubtedly be the case, as he was
resolute in never suffering it to know its parents.
Upon this argument Mr. Wilmot yielded; and it
was then agreed between them, that, at the time of
the child's birth, Mr. Wilmot should declare it still-
born, and, upon this plea, take it away from the
chamber, that its sight might not affect its mother,
and instantly bring it to the baron’s apartment, who
would, against that time, have a confidential person
in readiness to convey it without delay into West-
moreland.
Thus far all had gone well with the baron in his
plan ; but that confidential person had more to per-
form than Mr. Wilmot guessed, and he was yet to
be sought for.
Cunning is a mean quality, the surface of sense,
which floats upon it, like a froth, and partakes not
at all of its solids. This was the baron's master-tool;
and, in the exercise of it, he believed himself keen
and sharp-sighted : it was true that he could exer-
cise the talent, if it may be admitted to the name,

with sufficient skill to make it serve his purposes:
but he wanted that depth of perception which looks
into character, and does not chuse improper objects
for its villanous confidence—that judgment which
gives security to foul deeds, as far at least as they
are capable of concealment; for every crime is but
for a time delayed in bringing to the light; and when
the wicked seem most to prosper, they are but sink-
ing deeper into that gulph from which they are one
day to find the impossibility of emerging.
The baron looked around his household for a
countenance which should seem the index of a heart
impressive to the touch of gold, and suited to his
purpose. No face appeared to him sufficiently
gloomy; no lips pouted enough with discontent to
tempt him into a trial of their souls. Time was
creeping on, and yet no minister for his dark plot
was found. One evening he had strayed to the vil-
lage, and was returning thence in the dusky hour
of twilight: in passing the newly-erected tower, he
hailed the sentinel, and the voice that replied to
him was that of Hubert.

CHAPTER XV.
-If the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound one, unto the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
Or, if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had bak'd thy blood, and made it heavy, thick;
Or, if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone-
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.
King Joun.
Tue baron moved on slowly towards his own castle-
Hubert the subject of his thoughts.
Those who have not the skill of searching, deep-
ly into characters are always much biassed by the
name a man bears in the world. Hubert had ac-
quired the name of “ surly.” On this the baron
reflected, and from the sternness of his countenance,
doubted not but the epithet was a just one.
He
remembered the day when he had refused Edward's
bounty, on the walls of the castle, while yet a boy,
with a moroseness which had indicated a sourness of
temper, and a spirit of dissatisfaction at his indigent
lot. Many trivial circumstances lord William called
to mind, to prove to him that his temper was not

- : W.
softened into greater complacency since his situation
had become ameliorated by his entering into the
troops of De Mowbray Castle. For this sternness
of temper he could himself see no reason, but that
of a bad heart : he thought it impossible for a man
to be dissatisfied with the inferiority of his situation,
and not at the same time to be capable of any crime
which would amend it. Thus knowing Hubert's
bluntness of temper great as ever, he conceived him
to be the very man whom gold could tempt, and
whom remorse would never goad.
Thus agreed with his own mind, he resolved to
enter into conversation with him on the next night
of his being stationed as sentinel on the same post
where he had that evening seen him, and which
would happen on the eighth day from the present
time.
The expected evening being arrived, the baron
sallied forth at the proper hour for seeing Hubert.
The evening was bleak, the rain fell from the skies,
and the north-east wind poured its sharpness over
the heath which skirted the village. The gloominess
of the evening rendered the approach of night ap-
parently more sudden than usual, and when the
baron reached the watch-tower, substances, but not
features, were any longer discernible. The quick
step of the sentry, hastily pacing his allotted portion
of ground to preserve his limbs from numbness, led
the baron immediately towards Hubert. It was a
night when the baron believed that no one, whose
business did not call him into the air, would expose

himself to the roughness of the weather. Thus he
spoke to Hubert, without hesitation, having no fear
of being overheard—“A cold night this to be upon
guard, sentinel,” he said.
“My lord de Mowbray, by the voice ?” returned
Hubert.—“ It is a colder for you to be abroad
from choice ; for such you must be.”
" When I am on an errand which gives me
satisfaction in the performance,” replied the baron,
" a glow of pleasure warms my breast, which coun-
terbalances the cold without. I come hither, Hus
bert, on purpose to seek you.
For what ?” asked Hubert, the gruffness of his
voice not at all relaxing into complacency, though
the words of lord William were poured forth in tones
of the utmost kindness. Hubert had more insight
into men's hearts than the baron gave him credit
for possessing : he knew how seldom the great seek
the little, except for their own convenience, and he
did not want to be told that such must be the mo-
tire of the lord de Mowbray's exposing himself to
the inclemency of the night to seek a poor sentinel.
-“ For what?” asked Hubert, still continuing to
perambulate his spot of ground.
" I have perceived in you,” the baron went on,
“ a soul superior to the rank of life in which fate
has destined you to move. Justly is fortune depict-
ed blind : the partial hand with which she distributes
her gifts daily proves her so; but the sense of per-
ception of which she is deprived, nature has placed
in the judgments of men, and they become willingly

you that
faulty in the point where her blindness is her ex-
cuse, when they do not rectify the faults into which
her infirmity leads her.”
Hubert was silent.
Lord William walked by his side, and continued
speaking thus—" Perhaps you do not understand
what I mean to say, Hubert ? I wish to tell
I think it the duty of men in my situation of life,
when they see a mind like yours, superior to the
rank it has been born in, to transplant it into a
more prosperous bed of life.”
Has your lordship just come to a sense of this
duty,” asked Hubert, that you have chosen this
hour of the night to inform me of it ?”
“Oh no, no,” replied lord William, “it has
been long in my thoughts; and the reason which
has kept me from avowing to you my feelings is
this: I reflected that a mind like yours would indig-
nantly refuse an offer of service, which it would,
from the nobleness of its nature, conceive to lay it
under an obligation to the man at whose hands it
was received; I have therefore anxiously awaited
a moment, when I might ask of you a benefit in
return for such service as it is my desire to confer
on you, that thus a mutual obligation might relieve
us both from the unpleasant idea of either being the
debtor of the other."
There is some reason in what you say,” re-
turned Hubert ; “ the friendship which only lays a
poor man under an obligation to a rich one is but
increasing his misery, by rendering him dependent

in competence, while he was free from that clog in
his indigence."
The sentiment was natural to the disposition of
Hubert, the baron considered, and not at all con-
trary to the feelings he wished to inspire him with ;
he therefore rejoined—“ Your ideas correspond
with my own: to serve you, on a system of equa-
lity, is my wish ; but as your advancement here in
Cumberland would but create for you the envy of
your fellows in situation, and for me their hatred,
originating in their jealousy at seeing you singled
out for my favour, I must first point to you the ne-
cessity of your enjoying your good fortune at some
distance from hence."
There was a secret chord in the heart of Hubert,
which vibrated with joy at the idea of possessing
the means of leaving Cumberland, and he replied
“ I am not so attached to my native county as to
regret departing from it.”
“ Nor perhaps,” said the baron, “ to your na-
tive country ?”
« Perhaps not,” replied Hubert : “ to a man
who has money, every country is the same.”
“ It is indeed,” answered the baron;
« and
sometimes a foreign one more friendly than his
own; for, in fact, old friends are the worst ac-
quaintance for a man who rises suddenly into pros-
perity; they think themselves authorized, upon the
privilege of long acquaintance, to dive into his
secrets, and if they cannot fathom them, they con-
sider themselves at liberty to use very unwarrant-

able remarks upon his change of situation. I myself
believe it impossible for a man, who experiences
either a sudden change from affluence to poverty, or
from indigence to wealth, to be comfortable on the
same spot, in the two opposite situations."
" What is the service you require of me to equa-
lize our obligations ?” asked Hubert.
“The benefit I propose to confer on you is five
hundred pieces of gold,” returned the baron.
· The sum is large,” grumbled out Hubert.
“ It is,” returned the baron.
“And therefore seems to bespeak,” added Hubert,
“ that the requital demanded for it is of an extraor-
dinary nature.”
“ One suited to the performance of a friend,”
returned lord de Mowbray. “ You are my friend ;
I have selected you as such, and will never swerve
from my friendship, though you refuse to return me
yours.
Hubert was again sullenly silent.
The baron conceived him only reluctant in giving
his promise, in the hope of an increase of reward;
thus fearlessly proceeded—“You know, Hubert,
that I have a daughter. Hubert, that daughter has
brought shame on me and on herself.”
Hubert stopped for the first time, and rested on
his pike.
The baron went on.-" The service that I ask of
you is to hideastain thatis about to fall upon myhouse.”
Proceed, my lord,” said Hubert, his accents
somewhat softened.

Edward, the wretch whom I fostered,” replied
the baron, “ has returned my kindness with trea-
chery-has stolen my daughter's heart! Would
that had been all, and that he had spared her honour!
But oh, madness to a father's brain ! she is about
to give birth to his child !”
“ The lady Rosalind become a mother !” stam-
mered out Hubert.
Ay, a mother!” exclaimed the baron. . Thy
“ voice falters, and I perceive that thou feelest for
my unhappy situation. I could not doubt thou
wouldst; thy heart is one capable of feeling for the
dignity of man; and thou canst not want a keener
spur to promp thee into sympathy with me But
great as is my misfortune, Heaven has sent a balm
for the wound which an undutiful child has made
in my heart. Edward will see England no more :
he is, by my design, detained in Flanders. Rosalind,
since the moment of her fatal frailty, has been a
prisoner in her chamber: no one has visited her but
Gertrude, whose affection for her mistress will pre-
vent her from disclosing her shame ; and thus, with
thy aid, good Hubert, the honour of my family
may be re-established.”
Hubert did not speak,
The baron demanded—“Will you say it shall, and
by your promise restoremeto my dignity and peace?”
“ But the means ?” asked Hubert, hastily.
“ That you be prepared to leave Cumberland at
the moment of the child's birth, and take it with
you,” replied the baron.

“ Never to return to its mother ?” asked Hubert,
emphatically.
“ Never-never !” replied the baron, signifi-
cantly. “ She shall be taught to believe it born
without life. Oh no, no; it must never return, or
be known to have lived ! It must be removed
farvery far from hence: it must be rendered impos-
sible for it to return.”
“ My journey hence must be precipitate when
once begun, for fear of a discovery,” returned
Hubert ; “ and 'tis not unlikely that this haste may
prove fatal to the life of so young an infant.”
“ It is not unlikely—not at all unlikely, my
friend,” said lord William, pressing the hand of
Hubert in both of his as he spoke ; " and should it
so chance, the six hundred pieces of gold will be all
your own, which else the maintenance of that
young
imp must lessen.”
“Do you wish it rather dead than alive in ob-
scurity ?” said Hubert, in a whispering voice.
“Dear valuable Hubert,” exclaimed De Mow.
bray, “ judge of me as thou wouldst of thyself if
any blot were thrown upon thine honour, and thou
couldst wipe it out unseen, unknown by all the
world. I trust me to thy fervour in my cause ; but,
Hubert, both for thee and for myself, the grave is
a security which no art can equal in the hiding up
of those who live."
The steps of the soldiers who were coming to re-
lieve the sentinel were now audible.-" Hush !”
said Hubert.

Only say I may rely on thee,” replied De
Mowbray.
Say no more,” returned Hubert, “but let me
have the child the instant it is born."
The baron again pressed the hand of his new
friend, and then fled into the shade, to avoid the
sight of the guard which was advancing ; and wind-
ing round a path which obscured him from the view
of the newly-placed sentinel, he returned back to
his castle, his spirits elate with the success which
had attended his enterprize, and extolling his own
penetration into the character of Hubert.

But a short time elapsed before lord William found
a second opportunity of conversing in private with
Hubert, and he was then more than ever pleased
with his own discernment and the fervour of his mi.
nister in his cause, as Hubert expressed something
like alarm lest lord William should find any other
person with whom he might prefer to entrust the
business before the time of the child's birth should
arrive, and the sum of which he anticipated the pos-
session be thus lost to him; but this apprehension
the baron silenced by his solemn promise of not

swerving from their agreement, to which Hubert
voluntarily added his own.
As the time of Rosalind's confinement drew near,
the baron took care so to arrange matters that an
exchange should be made between some of the
armed men at his own castle and those at the tower
in the village, in order that Hubert might be on the
spot, to attend him at a moment’s notice.
An uncommon depression of spirits hung over
Rosalind as the hour approached which was to usher
into being the unfortunate offspring of her love for
Edward. Her health was as much impaired by her
seclusion from the air as were her spirits; and it
appeared a doubtful case to Mr. Wilmot, who had
been lately several times allowed to visit her, whe-
ther or not she would have strength to carry her
through her agony.
At length the minute of her fate approached.
Gertrude was alone permitted to attend upon
and to her and Mr. Wilmot was entrusted her safety.
Contrary to the expectations of the latter, she did
survive the hour of birth ; but so far had herstrength
been reduced by her pains, that her child was
brought into the world during the insensibility of
its mother. All Gertrude's care was fixed upon
her lady, and this circumstance gave to Mr. Wilmot
a most favourable opportunity for removing the
child, as Gertrude, employed in her endeavours to
‘recall her fainting mistress into existence, scarcely
considered whether there was a child born or not.
The baron was alone in his private apartment,
her;

when Mr. Wilmot entered with the child in his
arms.—“Is it alive?” said he, on seeing the surgeon.
“Yes, it is,” replied Mr. Wilmot, “and appears
likely to continue so. It is a boy, and a fine one
too.”
“Thanks, many thanks, and acts of gratitude
untold are thine !” returned lord William, putting
into his hand a diamond ring of great value, for
which the surgeon having made a due compliment,
retired to attend to the health of Rosalind.
The hour of this transaction was the dead of night;
and in expectation of the child being brought to him,
lord William had stationed Hubert in a closet adjoin-
ing to the apartment which was dedicated to his own
private use, and where Mr. Wilmot had now found
him. No sooner was Mr. Wilmot gone, than the
baron called in the minister of his dark deed, and
having wrapped the child in his presence in a mantle,
to prevent its cries from being heard, as Hubert
passed with it through the castle, he gave it into
his arms, and then putting into his hand a purse con-
taining the six hundred promised pieces of gold, not
a word was spoken, as had been agreed upon between
them, and the baron then preceded Hubert out of
the apartment, in order to point out to him a pri-
vate way of leaving the castle, which he had before
told him he should do, when the occasion for secrecy
arrived; and this outlet proved to be that which
opened from the vaults of the chapelupon thenorthern
rampart, and with which it is scarcely necessary here
to remark that Hubert was already well acqainted.

and when he vanished from his view, he returned to
his own chamber with a heart which felt lightened
from a load of anxiety.:77

recovered from the fainting fit, into which loss of
strength had thrown her, and her first inquiry had

hers that it did not exist. She did not appear to
doubt the truth of his assertion, but she asked to

that it was unusual to submit an infanti thus borda

After the first week of her confinement was past,
Rosalind began to recover much more quickly than
Mr, Wilmot had augured she would ; and when he
thought her capable of tasting the air, with benefit
to her health, he procured for her, from her father,
the grant of the key which opened the door leading
from her closet upon the eastern rampart, and its
use was not again repealed by the baron shis:

regard to the minister of his foul commands, as he
had done of their object, that no security can equal

In the castle Hubert was looked upon as a deserter
from the troops, and as such was universally despised,

and supporting, in order to cover suspicion, and

NEARLY three years had elapsed since lord Rufus
de Madginecourt had quitted the castle of lord Wil-
liam de Mowbray, on the discovery of that band,
which he had bimself sought, being already given
to another. He had departed in a gust of disap-
pointed pride and rage, which he had no one to
vent upon, and proceeded sullenly to a castle of his
MIT Diftolatki
own, in the county of Durham.
Rosalind was already a wife; no existing law
could therefore give her to him; hence there was
no appeal from the destiny upon which she had
rushed to avoid him, and complaints were vain,
where no redress could be obtainable: to return to
court, where another and more material disappoint-
ment stared him in the face, he felt as unwilling
as he had been to quit the castle of De Mowbray,
the scorned suitor of its lord's fair daughter. Ac-
cordingly he resolved for awhile to bury himself in
the retirement of his domain, and to confine with-
in his own breast the secret which, through neces-
sity, the baron de Mowbray had confessed to him
of his daughter's marriage ; and upon this he deter-
mined for two reasons—the first, because he was

unwilling that it should be noised abroad that the
great and noble lørd Rufus had met with a refusal
where a peasant had been accepted; the second,
because he judged that if he did not himself reveal
the circumstance of Rosalind's private marriage, it
might, in all probability, never meet the ear of the
world at all; and that Rosalind, by the death of
her husband, whom he knew to be engaged in war-?
fare abroad, might still be his, without a suspicion
being entertained of his having sued for her hand
before.
Seit OT
The third year since his departure from De Mow#
bray Castle was drawing towards its close, when
lord Rufus first began to discover that from having:
orignally addressed Rosalind as a suitor, with re
gard only to her rank and favour with the queen, -he
now entertained for her a more tender, or at leasts
a passion of a different nature; and it is by no
means an uncommon instance, that the man who

9. With disappointment did he heart of the existenos
of Edward in Flanders; and at length, despairing of his
death, he wrote to De Mowbray, requesting him to
appoint some place where he would meet him, on a
subject which required their deliberate conference.
Lord William had his reasons for not inviting lord
Rufus to his own castle again while Edward still
lived ; thus appointed a place for meeting,' to
which, at the time fixed, came lord Rufus, and
found the baron there ready to receive him."
The wish of De Mowbray to court an alliance
with lord Rufus " for his daughter, when they had
first met at the court of queen Elizabeth, on his
return from France, had not escaped him ; and
convinced that in seeking the alliance, his only
consideration had been that of his superior ranks
and wealth to the nobles of the age, he doubted
not but that if he were now to shew himself readys
to aecept Rosalind, of whose marriage there was no
existing proof, as his wife, lord William would joyat
fully accede to any proposal which accorded with a
his favorite plan of aggrandizing his family. " KOI
Relying, therefore, on this expectation, and feet
ing that it was necessary to his happiness to possess
Rosalind, even though already a wife, he, without
hesitation, proposed to the baron to lead her pubos
licly to the altar, and to stifle her opposition to the
plan, by promising, on these tertis only, to spare i
the life of her beloved Edward! 11 to die huit

may therefore be imagined that the unnatural sacri-
fice of a daughter would have appeared a lesser sin
in his eyes; but this was not DeMowbray's temper.
By crushing in its bud a blossom which had scarcely
opened its sweets to the light, he deemed himself
performing so essential an act towards the support
of his house's dignity and honour, that the crime
was lost in the service which it was to confer on the
idol passion of his heart.
The proposition of lord Rufus appeared to him
the demand of his adjunction in an enormity, which
might for ever blast that purity which he wished to
bind the eternal partner of his name; the discovery,
should such a discovery ever transpire (and nothing
appeared to him more likely than that the rash step
proposed by De Madginecourt might spirit on the
parties whom it so nearly concerned into adducing
proofs of their marriage), must instantly publish
what the death of the child was for ever intended to
hide. Thus, deciding from his feelings, as men
are apt to do, on the heinousness or innocence of
the most important virtues and most enormous
vices, he considered the proposal of lord Rufus an
insult, and openly declared to him his opinion.
Infatuated as lord Rufus now really was with the
person of Rosalind, yet, like all men of strong pas-
sions, love was forgotten at the moment when re-
venge stepped into view as the champion of frus-
trated gratification. “Remember,” he exclaimed,
“I have the secret of her base marriage ; and if
you give her not to me, I blazon it to the world.”

"The voice of threatening was new in the ear of
the haughty lord William, and painful was it to
him to subdue his füry: but his subtilty never for-
sook him at the moment of his need, and in a tone
of composure, which it cost him many a struggle
to command, he said—“ The fate of a father who
is unhappy in the connexion of an only child, will
at least gain as much sympathy in the world, as
that of the monster who would induce that father to
lead his daughter to a second marriage-bed while
vet her husband lived. I have, you perceive, lord
Rufus, my tale for yours,” he added, with a smile
of triumph ; " and it cannot be difficult to you to de-
termine on whose side the opinion of a virgin queen
would rank, when the object to whom this brutality
is proposed to be offered is her goddaughter.”
• The truth of lord William's remark struck forcibly
to the heart of lord Rufus ; rage and disappoint-
ment choked his utterance, and his emotions became
the more violent, as no ready means of vengeance
upon De Mowbray presented themselves to him. In
sullen passion he broke up the conference. and
breathing curses on the mean spirit of the baron as'
he quitted his presence, retired again to his own
castle, more strongly than ever bent upon the ac-
complishment of his purpose, 'in proportion as fate
seemed to have removed it farther from his grasp.
With far different sensations did lord William re-
turn into Cumberland ; the meanness of De Mad-
ginecourt's disposition, and the ambition of his
views, had now been so clearly unfolded to him,
2 D

202 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
that he almost began to repent of having ever re-
quired his daughter to bestow her hand on him.
He could not forgive her union with Edward; but
he thought it possible that if he had offered to her
acceptance some man less repugnant to her feel-
ings than lord Rufus, she might not have rushed
into an union with Edward, as a safeguard to her
against becoming the wife of De Madginecourt.
He believed that she had seen more clearly into his
evil disposition than he had himself done, and he
almost began to pity, though he could not pardon
her. So true is it, that the slightest proof which
our senses give us of any fact, wins us over in an
instant to an opinion, into which the repeated ar-
guments of others have not been able to induce us.
The baron's first action on arriving at his castle
was to enter the apartment of his daughter. It was
now three years since she had beheld him; his pre-
sence startled her, and she could scarcely support
her frame from sinking to the earth, so many pain-
ful ideas, which the lenient hand of time had in
some measure deadened within her heart, did his
sight recall into life again. The baron was little
less agitated than his daughter; his step faltered,
for he was unconscious what reception he had to
expect from one whom he had so cruelly treated.
But Rosalind, the amiable Rosalind, who, although
seeing the persecutor in the father, could not still
forget the father in the persecutor, advanced, and
extended to him her hand.
The recapitulation of past events the baron dread-

ed more than did his daughter; thus he proceeded
hastily to repeat to her his late conference with De
Madginecourt, and, their enmity which had suc-
ceeded it. But, alas! what availed to Rosalind
their dispute º She was already protected by the
rites of religion from becoming the wife of lord
Rufus; and she found that although her father's
eyes were opened to the atrocious character of the
man whom he would have given to her for a hus-
band, his heart was not in the smallest degree sof-
tened towards him whom she had made his son;
for still with firmness he refused to reply to her in-
quiries after Edward, and still maintained, that to
forget him must be the price of her entire return to
his favour.
Still she fed on hope, the only medicine for an
aching heart; but all its promises were deceitful,
and the fourth year passed sorrowfully on, as the
three former ones had done, since the birth of her
child.—With the fifth, fate brought to her what ap-
peared to be the climax of her misery—intelligence
of the death of her beloved Edward. And here the
scene becomes too painful for recital; let it suffice
to say, that she felt as every breast wounded by the
hand of cruel destiny must feel, when the master-
stroke of misery bends its feebleness to the earth,
and the perspective of its day presents no friendly
hope to raise it up again—no ray of comfort to re-
animate its exhausted nature.
When the baron de Mowbray first employed
means for sending Edward out of England, in order

to prevent that union, which the youth was no
sooner gone than he discovered to be already ac-
complished, he appointed trusty spies near his per-
son, and from one of these he now received the
intelligence of his death.
This information, as it may be imagined, was
most delightful to the feelings of the baron ; and the
object of his dislike being now for ever removed
from the power of occasioning him any fresh anxi-
ety, he used every tenderness in his disclosure of
the event to his daughter, not doubting, or at least
most ardently hoping, that now he from whom her
separation had been to her a constant source of mi-
sery, was no more, she would in time be prevailed
upon again to appear in the world as the heiress of
De Mowbray, and the goddaughter of her queen.
But long before a sufficient time of trial had been
given to her spirits for such a change, a written
application from lord Rufus arrived to the baron,
for his permission again to become the suitor of his
daughter. -
Since lord William believed himself to have dis-
covered the real character and views of lord Rufus,
a proposal of this nature could not be received by
him in any other light than as an insult; and, thus
impressed, he returned a negative to his letter,
written in terms of the warmest indignation against
his presumption.
No farther tidings were from that time heard of
lord Rufus at De Mowbray Castle, and nearly three
months more passed away, unmarked by any event

but the incursions of the borderers, whose temerity
in advancing towards the English posts was now
becoming every day greater.
Rosalind, during the lifetime of her Edward the
prisoner of her father's will, was now the prisoner
of her own inclination, and all his entreaties to her
to leave the solitude of her apartments were ineffec-
tual. Her hours were spent in weeping for him
whom she was never again to behold, and in draw-
ing forth such plaintive airs from the strings of her
lute, which he had been accustomed to praise.
The baron's hours were divided between his at-
tentions to his daughter, whom he still hoped again
to court into the world, and his superintendence of
the military regulations necessary to be observed in
his castle.
At this period then it was, and as it happened,
on the very day which completed the fourth year of
Rosalind's becoming a mother, that the Scotch
youth, who called himself Donald, arrived at De
Mowbray Castle, with information to the baron of
the danger that awaited him from the attack upon
his strength, which was threatened by a freebooter
named Allanrod.
And having now recapitulated all the events of
moment which had occurred to the characters in
our history, before the period at which we opened
our scene, we will return to that night in which we
left the baron de Mowbray marching towards the
enemy, and Rosalind locked in the arms of sleep in
her father's castle.

-Foul deeds will rise,
(Though all the earth o'erwhelm them) to men's eyes,
HAMLET:
Rosalind arose at early morn, and proceeded to
the chapel : ever since she had learnt the death of
her Edward, it had been her daily custom so to do;
and the hour which she passed at prayer by the side
of her mother's grave was the only one which
brought her consolation through the long and weary
day. Here would she cling to the cold marble that
encircled the mouldered frame of her parent, with
a heart as frozen to every object, but the images of
those whom it was now alone given her to behold
through fancy's eye, as the icy stone she knelt upon.
It was always Rosalind's choice to proceed to her
devotions alone ; thus Gertrude's services not being
at this hour in request, she sought her uncle,
Ambrose, eager to hear from him some farther par-
ticulars of the spirit, which had for a few evenings
past haunted the ramparts of the castle ; and on
the very last had occasioned so much alarm to him
and Philip Watkins, the sentinel, at the drawbridge.
To her wish, Ambrose, with his bunch of keys
slung on his arm, was the first person whom she

met in the castle hall, and without delay she proposed
to him her inquiry.
Ambrose shook his head sadly and significantly,
looked around wistfully to see if they were observed,
and then said—“Oh, Gertrude, the times, I do verily
believe me, grow wickeder and wickeder every day!”
-He paused ; then added—" Have you
mentioned
to your lady what Philip and I saw last night ?”
“Oh yes,” replied Gertrude; “ I told her directly,
and begged of her not to walk on the ramparts so
late in the evening.”
“ And what said she to it?" asked Ambrose.
Smiled, and treated it as an idle tale,” re-
turned Gertrude.
“ Oh Jesu !” cried Ambrose, " had she heard
the noise that I did, by the side of the moat, three
evenings ago, and seen the face that I saw last night,
beneath the vizor of the spectre-
“ Pale as ashes, and a streak of blood down the
left cheek, had it not ?” asked Gertrude, tremb-
ling as she spake.
Ay, ay, even as you say,” returned Ambrose.
“ Heaven be praised the lady Rosalind treats its
appearance so lightly! I am glad in my soul she
does. It was my intention, Gertrude, if you had
not spoken to her of it, to have warned you not to
have done so; and now I charge you, girl, as you
love your uncle, never begin the subject to her
again, nor enlarge upon it: if she should start it
to you, drop it-do you understand me?-as quickly
as possible, and talk of something else.”

Why, I tell you, uncle,” answered Gertrude,
“ it does not frighten her.”
“ But it would frighten her, if she knew all,” ex-
claimed Ambrose. _"Oh, Gertrude, I know, though
thou art simple, thou art to be trusted : so I will tell
thee why it would alarm her. Heaven forbid it be
evil that I am going to say! but Heaven is my wit-
ness how true my words are ! Philip Watkins said
it before I said it, though I believe I observed it
first.—The spectre which appeared to us is the spi-
rit of my lady Rosalind's husband ! The pale face,
with the streak of blood down the left cheek, which
we saw last night, was the very picture of Mr. Ed-
ward.”
“Mr. Edward's ghost !” cried Gertrude—"what
can it mean ?”
“ Hush! hush !” repiied Ambrose, looking again
cautiously around him ; “ I would not, for the
world, that we were overheard.”
“ Nor I," answered Gertrude" But what can
it mean, uncle ?”
“ I fear me,” returned Ambrose, “it indicates
that foul deeds have been abroad. I accuse no one
-I condemn no one, girl ; but I cannot stifle my
thoughts. The baron disliked his daughter's mar-
riage : Edward was sent abroad, into Flanders-a
villainous country, Gertrude, that Flanders, where
the Jesuits still have much power; and I well know
where there are Jesuits, men do not stick at the
commission of crimes, because they get them wiped
off their consciences by confession-Idle, foolish

ideas! The truth will prevail ; sin will come to
light, and all the absolution in the world has not
power to make a murdered body rest in peace.
“. Murdered !” echoed Gertrude—" Do you
mean-
“ I mean nothing,” interrupted Ambrose, “ for
I know nothing. I only am certain that spirits do
not walk without they have some evil to reveal, or
when their consciences are overburdened. I got
my knowledge in spirits from thy grandfather, Ger-
trude, who was esteemed to understand their nature
well. Now I am certain Mr. Edward (bless his
good heart !) cannot be raised from his grave by an
unquiet conscience; thus it must remain, that he
has some matter of importance to unfold—and what
can I think it is, when I see the streak of blood on
his poor pale cheek ?”
“ Heaven grant he tell it not to me!” replied
Gertrude : “ I should never live to make it known.”
No, no, no,” cried Ambrose-"no fear of that:
he will choose some one gifted with good sense
for the purpose ; perhaps myself, as likely as not.
Gracious, gracious me! Heaven send I be not made
the accuser of my master! But were I invited to
that purpose by the spirit, I must perform its com-
mands, Gertrude : disobedience would rank me on
the side of Satan's legion ; for my soul's sake, I
must perform, if it commands.”
Rosalind was now seen returning from her devo-
tions.-" Here comes my lady,” said Ambrose.

ards Gertrude, he added in a whisper-" Promise
me not to reveal a word of what I have imparted to
thee."
Upon my faith, uncle, I will not,” returned
Gertrude; and Ambrose then moved out of sight.
Rosalind returned to her chamber, and throwing
open the casement, admitted into her apartment the
enlivening rays of an eastern sun, which was emerg-
ing, in golden splendour, from a bed of purple
clouds. As she stood contemplating the beauties of
the surrounding landscape, she could not forbear
exclaiming—" How blest is every animal of this
creation but myself! How cheerfully are the bleat-
ing flocks browsing on the dew-bespangled grass!
how jocundly are the birds singing on every spray!
and how carelessly is the whistling husbandman
proceeding to his labour, whilst I alone know only
heaviness and care!"
Her attention was now directed to some flowers
which grew in her window; and as she pleased ber-
self with examining their beautiful colours, and in-
haling the sweetness of their scents, a rose-bud,
snapped from its stem, just as it was opening into
bloom, caught her observation: the melancholy
tone of her mind led her to draw a parallel between
her own fate and that of the flower; 'and it afforded
her a slender consolation to divert her thoughts from
bitter reflection, by versifying her ideas in the fol-
lowing lines,

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER;

DAYS OF QUEEN BESS.
CHAPTER I.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace,
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
SHAKESPEARE.
Lord William de Mowbray and his troops mean-
while pursued their march, under the stillness of
the night, without any interruption, save what
arose from the nature of their route; the difficulties
of this kind which they had to encounter were in-
deed not a few. As it was of consequence to them
to use whatever speed was in their power, they
quitted the high road, which would have extended
their journey several miles ; and though attended
by skilful guides, they found it by no means an
easy task to wind up the unfrequented passes of the
mountains which they were obliged to cross, or to
ford the numerous rivulets which obstructed their
progress.
However, these were difficulties thought lightly
of by men who had been accustomed and inured to

fatigue and danger, as most of lord William's men
had been, both before and since they had been taken
into his service; and they made such good use of
their strength and spirits, that ere the morning be-
gan to break, they found themselves within a short,
distance of the spot where Donald's information had.
given them reason to believe that Allanrod and his
advanced body had halted during the night.
The cheeks of the youth Donald glowed with
anticipated vengeance on the murderer of his fa-
ther, and the ravisher of his sister's honour; and
he could not forbear expressing his joy as they
marched on.
The baron presently commanded a halt, in order
that he might have an opportunity for consulting
with his chief leader, Irwin, on the measures best
to be pursued at this crisis. The situation occu :
pied by him and his soldiers, at the moment he is.
sued this command, was one most favourable to:
the purpose of a short repose ; it was a romantic
glen, enclosed on all sides by rough and stupeng
dous mountains, the frowning, craggy tops of most
of which appeared to bespeak them impervious,
Placing, therefore, guards at the avenues, which
were alone believed accessible by De Mowbray and
his commanders, the baron seated himself, with
his friend Irwin and the youth Donald, at the foot
of one of them ; while his men reclined themselves
on various spots suited to their inclinations; and
their horses were permitted to browze, upon the
grass which the valley afforded. as I es bistego

A' little refreshment was necessary to all after
their march, and while they were taking it, lord
William submitted to his companions the propriety
of remaining awhile on the spot where they now
were, and dispatching from thence a spy or two,
to gain, if possible, information of the enemy's
situation. This proposal appeared to Irwin and
Donald so perfectly judicious, that they strongly
recommended its being put into execution without
delay; and three of their party were accordingly
chosen for the purpose.
One of these three was one of their guides, and
to him Donald made it understood in what direc-
tion to proceed for gaining the desired information.
It was not till this scrutinizing party was dispatched,
that the baron himself began to taste the refresh-
ments which were necessary to the support of his
strength ; and as he pressed Donald to join 'with
him in his meal, he perceived that the youth's fa-
tigue was so great as to have entirely deprived him
of a wish for food : he drank willingly of a flask of
ale which Irwin offered him, but he refused all sub.
stantial nourishment ; his agitation appeared every
moment to be increasing, and the baron besought
him to endeavour to compose his mind, and not to
suffer the recollection of the past, or the anticipa-
tion of the future, thus to harass his feelings, as it
would entirely unfit him for the enterprize they
were shortly to rush uponit bolsinha Djor

that joy affects me more than pain, and that I will
do my duty when we meet Allanrod—would to God
that the moment was come!”
A shrill whistle, blown through the fingers at this
moment, called the attention of the baron, and he
saw two of his spies returning with the utmost
speed down the steep side of a mountain. The ba-
ron sprang up to meet them, and as soon as they
could be heard—" The enemy ! the enemy !” burst
from their lips..
“Do they coine ?” exclaimed Donald, " Thank
Heaven ! thank Heaven !”
Instantly the drum beat to arms, and lord Wil-
liam and his men snatched up their rested weapons ;
every one was, in as short a time as possible, in a
posture of defence ; and, quick as were their move-
ments, they had not an instant to spare ; for alrea-
dy had a body of freebooters appeared at the mouth
of the only avenue which the baron believed prac-
ticable for leaving the glen. To escape from the
circle of danger which was environing them, Lord
William thought the only means, to rush through
the enemy by force of arms; and their only chance
of conquering, to attack them on a level ground ;
as the fortune of the war must be indisputably
against them, were the event hazarded in a spot
where the enemy had the advantage of height over
them, as they had in the present instance.
He had little time for reflection, but he could not
help repenting that he had not marched earlier on
the preceding evening from his own castle, which

would have prevented his present surprise. The
enemy, aware of the baron's intention of forcing
a passage through them for his troops, stationed
their strength at the point for which he was making,
and opposed his approach towards it with the most
obstinate vigour. Equally resolute did lord Wil-
liam's men shew themselves in their attempt at
gaining the pass; and a most severe contest ensu-
ed, in which the freebooters were repeatedly driven
back, by the skilful use made by the English sol-
diers of their fire-arms ; but although frequently
repulsed, they returned, with the violence of wolves,
to the attack; and the party of De Mowbray had
still gained but little progress towards the mouth of
the valley.
For a time, the effects of steady discipline and
regular tactics prevailed eminently over savage fe-
rocity and irregular vehemence; but Lord William
now made a discovery, uncomfortable in the ex-
treme to his feelings, which was, that the troops
of the Scottish banditti, as repeatedly as they were
driven back, returned to the combat with increased
numbers; which discovery brought with it the sad
conviction that Allanrod had already collected his
forces into one body, contrary to the opinion of
Donald, or the still more to be dreaded apprehen-
sion that Donald himself was an impostor.
He looked around for him, and perceiving him
mixing in the English ranks, the momentary doubt
which had arisen in his mind of his truth was dis-

pelled, and he now thought that he had only been
faulty in his calculations, and not so in his intentions.
All men are apt to judge from events, and lord
William was, in this respect, a man in the full
sense of the expression. Burning with almost mad-
dening disappointment and chagrin, that the issue
of the present contest was likely to prove contrary
to the opinion he had formed of it at its commence-,
ment, he began to believe that he had been guilty
of an imprudence in following an enemy into their
own haunts, uncertain of their strength and num-
ber, and to think that he would have done better
in awaiting their arrival before his own castle, al-
though the evils of such a delay had been fully re-
presented to him, and upon that representation he
acted: lord William, in short, felt as all disap-
pointed men do, who have not sufficient fortitude
to restrain the effervescences of their passion with-
in the bounds of sense and reason; and seeing the
situation of himself and his men to be a desperate
one, he rendered it still more so, by passing over
the cool measures of management, and issuing a
command for the exertion of a last and desperate
effort for disentangling themselves from the lines of
the enemy.
In order to atone for what he now thought his
own oversight, in the first instance, of marching
from his castle, he resolved to sell his life or liberty,
which however he was destined to lose, as dearly
as possible: fighting himself like a wounded lion,

which turns in desperation on his hunters, he spur-
red on his men, both by the example of his own
courage, and promises of immense rewards, to an
emulation of his conduct.
Suspicious of Donald (for thus men are always,
in circumstances which run adverse to their wishes,
of those by whose advice they have acted), he again
looked round for him: he saw him not; but he
hoped, at least he trusted, that if he was not amidst
the ranks, obscured from his sight by the clouds of
smoke which were rolling through the air, that he
was in search of the moss-troopers' leader, Allanrod,
against whom his vengeance had been so warmly
denounced, and his hatred to whom he had declared
to be his only reason for joining the English cause.
This Allanrod lord William had not yet seen :
his eye had met the forms of several, whom he
conjectured, from their dress, and the posts of
command they held, to be leaders in the savage
band; but he had seen no one who appeared of
eminence enough to bespeak him their chief, or
who at all corresponded with the account which
Donald had given of Allanrod; he had described
him of gigantic height, and of a fierce and com-
manding aspect. At the present moment, it was
impossible to make inquiry whether he was present
or not ; and thus the baron was obliged, if he was
not satisfied with doubt, at least to put up with it.
At length the archers of De Mowbray had ex-
pended all their arrows, and his horsemen had fired
their last charge, although not without considerable

execution, for great numbers of the slain and
wounded of the foe strewed the ground. The fight
must now, the baron saw, be given up, or the
event of close combat be hazarded; the latter he
determined on, not abating a single spark of his
lion's fire, and he accordingly urged on his men to
attack the enemy shield to shield. -
The command being given on the side of the
baron, the enemy accommodated themselves to the
fresh charge which was preparing for them ; and
throwing aside their bows and matchlocks, drew
their swords, and rushed, like their foes, to closer
combat. -
The surrounding hills, still reverberating with
the thunder of the musketry, now caught the dire-
ful sound of clashing swords; shield was opposed
to shield, and pike to pike; every stroke was aim-
ed with a ferocity on both sides, which seemed
almost decidedly to render its direction fatal; and
the earth was bathed with reeking blood. But
short was the duration of this mad carnage ; for
suddenly a fresh band of the moss-troopers appeared
on the tops of those mountains which the party of
De Mowbray had supposed impassible, and thence
rushing down into the vale, decided the fate of the
battle. Lord William and the few remaining men
of his troops who were still alive, were completely
overpowered, and enclosed by the enemy. Even
did the baron scorn to sue for quarter; his pride
was about to receive a stab in becoming a prisoner,
for which he would willingly have bartered his

life ; but fate had decreed it otherwise, and lord
William and his followers were surrounded and
made prisoners of war.
At the mercy of this ferocious band, the few
existing men of De Mowbray's party entertained
but small hopes of preserving that life, which their
lord despised on the terms upon which he now held
it: they had held down their conquered heads in
despair and sadness, while their savage opponents
triumphed over them, mixing with their insults
threats of torture and death.
Lord William was offering up a silent prayer to
Heaven, in the first despair of a vain mind foiled
in its plan of glory, to be released from an existence
intolerable under the circumstances which at the
present hour attended his, when one of the leaders
of the borderers advanced, and having motioned
with his hand to enjoin silence, he spoke thus :
“ Our loved and venerated chief commands me to
inform the conquered De Mowbray, that as the
fortune of the day has placed him in his power,
he
must not expect him to yield his person to liberty,
without the remuneration of a valuable ransom. In
the meantime, he condescends to assure him that he
shall experience no other ill-treatment than that
of imprisonment.”
“ Who is your chief ?” asked De Mowbray.
“ Allanrod, the great and powerful Allanrod,”
replied the leader : “ behold him on yon mountain's
brow !”
Lord William turned his eyes the way the lead-

er's hand was extended, and perceived, on the top
of a craggy mountain, less elevated than the rest
which fenced in the valley, a man of extraordinary
bulk and height, clad in the Highland fashion,
and leaning on a matchlock of enormous length,
one end of which was rested upon the ground, and
his arm laid across the other: every part of his
dress and arms corresponded with those worn by
the Scottish freebooters, except that of his head,
and upon this he wore a helmet, the vizor of which
was pulled down. But the eye of the baron rested
scarcely an instant on the form of the conqueror;
it turned to a small figure, in the attire of his own
soidiery, which was hanging on the arm of Allan-
rod, and which, though its countenance was turned
from him, he could not hesitate to decide the trea-
cherous Donald.
The baron's feelings defied controul ; and he ex-
claimed to the leader—“Tell me, I entreat you,
is not he who leans upon his arm a youth named
Donald 2’’ *
“I have no time for parley, sir,” replied the
leader; “my commission to you from our chief is
delivered, and we must now on without delay, or
we shall not reach our quarters by nightfall.”
“It is he, by Heaven ſ” cried the baron. “Cur-
ses on his villainous hypocrisy "
His exclamations were unnoticed by the enemy,
or, at least, not replied to ; all their attention was
directed to the commands issuing by their own lead-
ers; and these were for them to leave a sufficient

number of their party to take care of the wounded,
and for the rest to guard the prisoners from the
valley to their own fortress.
Maddening were the reflections of the baron : he
now perceived, or fancied he perceived, that he
had been made the dupe of a tool from the enemy,
commissioned to his castle for the purpose of draw-
ing him into the entanglement which had just led to
his ruin; and although he could not but think, that
were the same circumstances to occur again, the
plausibility of a tale like that delivered by the youth
two evenings before, in the hall of his castle,
would again lead him to pursue the same steps he
had taken, still he felt enraged at himself that he
had taken them, now he believed it probable that
by observing a contrary conduct he had been safe.

It was now high noonday, and the sun unobscured
by a single cloud to soften its heat. Their way lay
over steep mountains, and through rugged paths;
and, owing to the weakness which they felt from
their exertion in the battle, and the wounds they
had received, the progress of both the conquerors
and the conquered was considerably retarded.


## p. 224 (#252) ############################################

224 MYSTERíous FREEBOOTER.
As they moved on, the baron looked sorrowfully
around on his beaten troops, and found that the
number of the surviving was scarcely forty; of these,
his chief leader, Irwin, was one, but the wounds he
had received were so great as to oblige him to be
borne on a litter, formed of the branches of trees.
About the time that the sun began to withdraw
his light from the earth, and usher in the twilight
of the evening, they entered upon a wide and dreary
heath: for nearly three miles they proceeded along
without any signs of cultivation or inhabitants meet-
ing their eyes; from the slowness of their march in
these three miles, the twilight had retired beyond
the expanded curtain of night, and the pale silvery
light of a rising moon alone gave a faint illumina-
tion to the scene. -
The country continued wild and desolate in the
extreme ; no vegetation could yet be perceived,
except a short brown grass, on which one solitary
flock of sheep were picking their scanty meal; and
here and there piles of enormous stones, the growth
of ages, broke the melancholy sameness of the bar-
ren heath.
At last their road wound into a rugged path, on
one side of which arose immensely steep mountains,
clothed with a black furze, which gave to the scene
a gloomy and funereal appearance, heightened by
the shades of night, from which the eye of the tra-
veller turned to seek relief on the opposite side of
the road ; and here it no sooner rested, than it
shuddered at the sight of a deep gulf, from which

there was neither natural or artificial protection,
and which appeared expressly designed either to
perpetrate or conceal a murder in ; and there was
not wanting evidence that of such a scene the spot
beneath had been a witness, for a creaking noise
drew towards it the eye of the baron, and he found
that it proceeded from the rusty chains of a gibbet,
on which hung a half-decayed figure, which the
wind agitated, and caused the links to grate each
other in their motion.
The baron shuddered as his eyes rested on the
horrid object ; the freebooters passed it with jocu-
lar observations on the fate of the unfortunate
wretch, who had been placed there as a warning
mark to those who were now treading in his path
of iniquity.
As they drew towards the end of this path, the
baron perceived a speck in the horizon, which he
conjectured to be a distant building: a short time
convinced him that it was so ; and as they advanced
towards it, the conversation of the freebooters in-
formed him it was their haunt.
For the first time since the commencement of
their march, the baron spoke.—“ Is this the abode
of
your
chief?” he asked.
The reply was in the affirmative.
“ Is it a castle—a building of strength ?” he re-
joined.
“Oh no, no, it's no castle,” replied one of the
freebooters; nor is there much strength in it,
except that of some good muscles and hearts : it

was once a monastery, but it is turned to a much
better use now ; what they used to pray for and
never get, we fight for and always enjoy.”
One of his companions was going to reply, when
a horn, sounded from an advanced body of the
moss-troopers, obliged him to silence, or at least
prevented his being heard.
The horn lord William found to be a signal to
those at home of the approach of their comrades ;
for in a very few minutes many torches were visi-
ble about the building, and their light exposed to
him the ruinous state it was in ; for not one of the
torches was as yet in the air, but gleaming along
the vaulted aisles and winding passages, which had
once formed the beauty of the edifice, and which
were now decayed, either by the hand of time or
violence, and appeared to leave almost the heart of
the mansion naked to the light.
Those who now issued from the various outlets
of the edifice with their torches, appeared, if pos-
sible, more ferocious than their companions; the
triumph of the latter was instantly made known,
and congratulations offered them by the former.
Before this edifice they halted : the leader who had
addressed lord William on the field of battle again
approached him, and having commanded the pri-
soners of inferior rank to be led into the subterrane-
ous vaults of the building, which had formerly
been the cellars of the monastery, he preceded the
baron into a large gloomy hall, which appeared
once to have been the nave of a church : it was

faintly illuminated by an iron lamp, suspended by
a chain from the roof, which served to discover the
many obscure passages that branched off from it
into the several parts of the building, and led to
wide and lofty stone staircases. -
Irwin was immediately taken up one of these :
the baron could not forbear expressing some anx-
iety for his fate, although he did not believe such
an expression calculated to procure him any addi-
tional advantages amongst the savage set they were
now with ; but the leader, who would have been
considered a man of a most dark and forbidding
countenance, to have been seen alone, but who,
by comparison with the more ferocious faces he was
now amongst, almost deserved the name of gentle,
assured the baron that every care his situation re-
quired should he shewn to him : and then desired
the baron to follow him to the apartment destined
for himself.
The baron's pride wanted relief as much as his
body ; and considering it a condescension, if not a
mark of respect to his situation, in the leader to
denominate that his apartment which justice would
have allowed him to have called his prison, he fol-
lowed with more complacency of temper than he
believed he could, in his present trying situation,
have commanded.
It may be urged—“What could he do but obey 2
he knew resistance or complaints to be in vain.”
To this it is replied, that it is a mind of more than
common energy that can restrain its feelings in a

situation so galling to its peace, and that it is the
custom of the multitude most to murmur where
murmuring least avails; because their complaints
are always great in proportion to the greatness of
their sufferings, and a sense of suffering takes away
from them the power of reasoning upon the good
or evil effect of bewailing their misfortunes.
Following the leader, he ascended a flight of
stone stairs, although not the same up which Irwin
had been carried, and passed into a long gallery,
faintly lighted in like manner as the hall; hence
they proceeded to some smaller stairs, which ap-
peared to wind up a tower : there was here no
lamp, and a torch was necessary to shew them their
way. The stairs were extremely decayed, and even
dangerous to pass; they were, however, few in
number : thus, notwithstanding their ruinous situa-
tion, they soon arrived at the top of them. The
leader drew from his pocket a key, and giving it to
one of his attendants, ordered him to unlock a
small iron door which presented itself to their view.
With difficulty the man turned the key in the
rusty wards, and then forced open the door, from
which issued a cloud of dust that almost blinded
them, and proved the length of time the apartment
had been unoccupied.
The man who bore the torch entered first ; him
the leader followed, and called to the baron to come
in after him. The baron obeyed, but not without
casting on his conductors alookof suspicion, to which
they replied by a malicious and satisfactory smile.

The room they had now entered bore every mark
of having been built for a prison : it was large and
high ; the walls of stone appeared once to have
been plastered, but were now in many places bare,
and in others covered with a green and mossy dew ;
the roof was formed of beams of oak, worm-eaten,
and black with age ; and the only place for the
admission of light was a small grated window, fixed
nearly at the top of the wall. -
In the middle of the apartment stood an iron
pan, in which wood seemed once to have been
burnt, for ashes might be discovered in it, as also
scattered about the floor. The only furniture was
a small table and a chair ; and in one corner stood
a large oaken chest, over which hung a rude wooden
crucifix.
Lord William looked around him with marks of
dejection at the appearance of the place, which the
leader observing, told him that it should be made
more comfortable, and immediately gave directions
for a fire to be lighted, and a lamp to be brought
him ; which being done, some provisions were set
on the table, and a mattress and blanket spread for
him on the floor ; and the moss-troopers then all
departed, the chief observing that it would be very
soon in his own power to shorten his imprisonment.
The door was shut upon him, and he heard it lock-
ed and barred without.
The baron, left to his own reflections, cast his
eyes once more hopelessly round his prison, and

heaving a deep sigh, he threw himself into the chair,
and felt his heart sinking within him.
The pride, the vanity of his life, which it had
been his soul's passion to feed and to support, had
met a blow, from which it might never rise again
to its former dignity and honours: the queen
might believe that he had been faulty and rash, in
marching towards the quarters of the enemy, and
might withdraw her countenance from him, as a
man without sufficient skill to guard the frontiers of
her kingdom. From himself, his thoughts wan-
dered to his daughter : what pain would she not
experience at his not returning to his castle ! for he
believed she still loved him, notwithstanding the
rigour with which he had enforced over her his pa-
rental authority. His own unfortunate circum-
stances softened his heart; and, now he supposed
her to be regretting his absence, he thought he lov-
ed her more tenderly than he had ever done, and
wished more ardently than he had ever done before,
to clasp her to his breast.
The loud voices of the freebooters, who appear-
ed in dispute, probably, he thought, about the
division of the spoil, or else under the influence of
intoxication, or perhaps both, sounded at intervals
from the lower parts of the building, and broke the
silence of the night. At length, about an hour af-
ter midnight, universal silence prevailed, and the
victorious crew beneath him appeared to have retir-
ed to rest.

He longed to know how his soldiers, and his
leader Irwin, were treated; but the wish was vain;
and relying but little on the promise made to him
by the leader who had conducted him to his prison,
he felt for them a degree of anxiety which height-
ened his own unpleasant sensations; for, as we
have before said, lord William's heart always inclin-
ed to the side of feeling, where it did not interfere
with his darling passion, to exercise his benevolence
and humanity.
His march had been a long and weary one, and
the cravings of nature impelled him to examine the
contents of the basket which had been placed upon
his table ; he found in it a loaf of brown bread and
some broiled fish ; and by their side stood a stone
jug of malt liquor, and a flask of spirits.
It was at this moment some small relief to him
to find a supply for his appetite, and having eaten
what necessity required, and drunk a draught of
the spirits, in the hope of inducing sleep, he threw
himself upon his mattress, having first trimmed
his lamp, and laid an additional log of wood on his
fire.
Painful reflection for a long time combated fatigue
and drove off the approach of sleep; at last it stole
upon him, but his slumbers were short and disturb-
ed: he fancied that he heard various noises, some-
times of persons running up the stairs of his prison;
then, as if the door of his apartment was unlocking.
Several times he sprang from his mattress, and
paced the room, to examine if any danger was lurk-

ing near him, and severely lamenting that he was
unarmed : nothing however was to be seen or heard
when he rose up, and believing that his fears might
have been the suggestions of his hurried imagination,
he again stretched himself on his hard bed. The
dawn was now beginning to peep through the nar-
row casement that alone gave light to his prison,
and feeling more secure as the darkness of night
died away, he soon fell into a profound sleep.
When he again awoke, the strength of the light
which entered his apartment proved to him that the
morning was far advanced, as did his lamp and fire
which were both exhausted.
He instantly began to use the light of day for
more closely investigating his prison than he had
yet been able to do: he examined the door ; the
bolts were all too firm to admit of the hope of an
escape that way : he placed his table under the win-
dow, and upon it he put his chair, upon which he
mounted ; but the casement was still beyond his
reach, nor could he, by all his endeavours, catch
through it a glimpse of any object but the passing
clouds. He descended, and his next step was to
endeavour to lift up the lid of the chest, but it bade
defience to all his efforts: he kicked against it, and
the hollow sounds which followed his knock seem-
ed to bespeak it empty. º
He continued to walk round and round his prison
hoping to find some chink, some outlet which might
flatter him with the hope of an escape; but all in
vain—the walls appeared strong in every part, and

233
fully capable of resisting the efforts of an unarmed
individual to force a passage through them. He
observed that they were not in every part bare, but
that here and there fragments of tattered tapestry
were still adhering to them; many of these which
were within his reach he pulled away, hoping still
some chasm might present itself to his sight behind
them ; but dust only followed their fall, and the
wall beneath appeared perfectly firm in every part.
The leader had, on the preceding night, said that
it would be his own fault if his imprisonment was
of long duration ; thus all he had now to do was to
await in patience the proposed terms for his ransom.
He had not been risen more than an hour when
one of the men appeared, and brought him his
breakfast; with the evening his provisions were
again renewed, and his oil and fuel replenished ;
but still no one but an inferior of the freebooter's
party had been into his apartment, and he had heard
nothing of the expected terms of ransom.
His night was not at all more easy than the form-
er one had been ; indeed rather less so, as he began
to entertain suspicions that he was meant to be
detained a prisoner for life, or perhaps to be deliver-
ed up to a death of torture.
Late in the evening of the following day, the
leader appeared.
“I am glad to see you,” (said De Mowbray,)“ I
feared that you had forgotten me: I have been
expecting, ere this, to have heard from you. What
are the terms of ransom which you mentioned to me?”.
* 2 G :

nued,
“ I have purposely delayed visiting you,” replied
the leader, “ lest, in the first heat of your disap-
pointment at not being yourself the conqueror, which
you know Allanrod to be, you should have spurned
at terms which, on cool reflection, will no doubt
appear to you as reasonable.”
“I am fully prepared to hear them,” returned
the baron.
“ And foolish will you be,” answered the leader,
“ if you do not as readily comply with them, and
think yourself blessed in the easy terms offered to
your acceptance. Remember, proud lord,” he conti-
" that it is in the power of Allanrod to confine
you here for life—to keep the spot of your confine .
ment a secret, by detaining your captured soldiers
here like yourself ; and if the spot be suspected, and
a force marched out to attack it in your behalf, it
will be in his power to cut off your liberty by death.
Reflect well on the superiority he has over you, and
then hear his conditions."
Lord William's blood boiled within him. Con..
ditions from the leader of a savage band of freeboot-
ers to the lord of De Mowbray Castle, was a sound
worse than poison to his ears; but policy com-
manded him to subdue his feelings, and with an effort
which cost him many pangs he said, in a voice of
composure—“Speak!”
“ Promise to give your daughter in marriage to
lord Rufus de Madginecourt, and you are this in-
stant free, and shall be conducted with honour to
your own castle,” replied the leader.

If the mind of the baron had before been agitated
what were his feelings at this demand ! Astonish-
ment closed his lips, and he stood fixed in silence
and surprise: his eyes encountering those of the
leader—“Give my child to lord Rufus !” he exclaim-
ed, after a pause.
“ As I say,” returned the leader.
“Never, by heaven !” answered the baron.
“ Deliberate upon it for the night,” returned the
leader—" I will see you again to-morrow;" and was
departing
“ No deliberation, no idea of my own liberty shall
ever induce me to sacrifice my daughter to the
monster I know him to be," returned the baron :
" but stay—I conjure you, stay, and tell me how
am I to understand this demand—as proceeding
from whence, and from whom? Is it urged by lord
Rufus himself, or by Allanrod, your leader, for him ?
Is lord Rufus here? How is Allanrod interested in
his happiness?”
“ None of these points can be replied to till you
have answered in the affirmitive,” said the leader.
He then repeated_“I will see you again to-morrow,
and departed.

a
The baron sunk into his chair, in a state of greater
wretchedness of mind than he had ever yet ex-
perienced ; to solve the mystery which had just been
presented to him he found himself inadequate ; but
he plainly perceived that he had been the dupe of
plot deeply planned to win his consent to an union
which his own soul now abhorred, not less than did
his unhappy Rosalind.
Who could this Allanrod be, whose prisoner he
was and how were lord Rufus and he connected,
as this demand seemed to bespeak them ? were
questions which he proposed to his own mind many
different times during the night, and which he was
obliged as often to dismiss from it again unanswered.
The transactions of the few last days appeared to
him a dream : he could scarcely believe himself now
awake ; he felt suspicious of the truth of every occur.

as facts, and knew himself certain only of one thing,
and this was, that be his own fate what it might,

237
been a sufficient monster to have led her to a second
marriage bed, while yet her lawful husband lived.
In the morning the leader returned as he had fore-
told he should do.-" Well,” he said,
are you
determined ?"
“Yes, I am,” replied lord William, “ never to
agree to your terms of liberty.”
The leader placed on the table some paper, some
ink and a pen.-" When you change your mind,”
he said, “ as there is no doubt but you soon will,
write your consent on that paper, sign it, and order
it to be given to the leader Monrose, who is myself ;
till then you will see no more of me, rest assured.”
The baron was beginning again to propose to him
one of the questions relative to the connexion of
Allanrod and lord Rufus, which he had urged in
vain the evening before ; but Monrose interrupted
him by saying—"Not a syllable from me till you
have given your consent ;” and with a malignant
smile he left the place.
Two days passed unmarked by any event but in-
creasing misery to the baron ; on the next he
determined to tamper with the men who at-
tended him, and to endeavour to open their
feelings to his situation by the master-key of gold,
which fits the wards of almost every heart. The
first on whom he resolved to make the attempt,
was the fellow whose observations on the gibbet
they had passed in their march had so much shock-
ed him ; and his reason for selecting him was, that
he thought he did not appear to possess sufficient

sense of feeling to bind him honest, even to his
comrades in dishonesty. He it was who usually
brought him his morning repast, and on 'this day
he came to his wish.
“ How long have you been a freebooter ?” said
the baron to him, as an opening to the conversation.
“Long enough,” replied the man, “ to be much
richer than I am."
“ Perhaps your honesty has kept you poor,” re-
joined the baron : and though you are not above a
robbery, you may, perhaps, scorn a bribe ?”
“I was never tried,” answered the fellow, with
an arch smile.
“ I have three pieces of gold at your service,"
returned the baron, " in return for some informa-
tion I want to gain of you.”
Respecting what ?” asked the man.
Respecting your leader, Allanrod,” replied the
baron. “I want to learn how he stands connected
with Lord Rufus de Madginecourt. Do you
know
any thing of their concerns ?”
“ A little, I believe,” returned the fellow, with
another intelligent smile.
“ Then what say you to the three pieces ?” re-
joined the baron.
“I say that if they were nine,” returned the
moss trooper, “ and in my hand, my communica-
tion should be at your service.”
Nine pieces were all the baron had about him,
but he considered them worth bartering for inform-
ation upon so obscure, so mysterious a point, and

" Now you

said lord William.
“ Not a word,” answered the man.
see I have honesty to my chief, and know how to
use a bribe, though it is the first I ever received ;”
and with these words he left the place.
To curse was in vain : the baron clasped his hands,
and paced his prison in an agitation which he would
not at any other time have believed the insolence
and treachery of so mean a wretch could have exci-
ted in his mind. He had never before been in a
situation to lament the loss of such a sum, but it
was now his all, and in more friendly hands might
have rendered him the most essential service: he
had now nothing of value left him with which to
win the robbers to his cause, and he despaired of
making an impression by any other means than
those of gold on the heart of a freebooter.
At night a stranger appeared, with his fire and
provisions ; he doubted not but that the other had
formed an excuse for not coming again into his
presence.
For three successive days he saw only this stranger
and another man, whose features were equally
new to him. The first of the two seemed to be cast
in a less rugged mould than were the general part
of his comrades, and him the baron resolved first
to address : he had only promises to hold out to
him ; but he hoped to be able, in some measure,
to prevail by these, as he recollected that none

of the moss-troopers could be unacquainted with
his rank and wealth.
On the fourth morning he accosted him when he
brought in his breakfast. The man did not reply,
or raise his eyes from his employment, when the
baron spoke. He addressed him again ; still he
replied not. He spoke to him a third time, and
with as ill success, the man not even looking tow-
ards him.
As he was about to leave the apartment, the ba-
ron crossed upon him, and spoke once more: the man
fixed his eyes on him, and having for some moments
watched the motion of his lips, he shook his head,
and pointing to his ears, indicated that he was deaf.
The baron made a sign to him not to depart, and
the man waited patiently to see what he required.
Lord William tore a slip from the paper which had
been brought him by the leader Monrose, and on it
he proposed a question, in writing, and shewed it
to the man.
" I can't read.” said the man, but I'll send
somebody to you that can hear you directly."
He went away, locking the door after him, and
leaving the baron to lament a second disappoint-
ment. He had not many moments for reflection,
before the door opened again, and another man ap-
peared.—“Do you want any thing, sir ?” asked
he. “ Murdoch thinks you do ; and we are or-
dered to grant you every accommodation you may
require."

241
Indeed !” exclaimed the baron, surprised at
the question : “then tell me, who is Allanrod ?”
* That is an accommodation he ordered us not to
grant you," said the man.
“ And do you refuse to grant any on your own
account ?” asked De Mowbray.
“ You were unlucky the other day," returned the
man—" you met with one of our chief's first
favourites."
“ Whom do you mean ?” asked the baron.
“ His name is Frasier," was the reply ; " he
that got the nine pieces of gold of you : he has brag-
ged enough below of his deceit to you."
The baron was now animated with a spark of hope
which announced a friend at hand; and bitterly did
he lament that an enemy had snatched from him the
only reward he had been possessed of, and which
might now have been valuable indeed to him.
“ Would to Heaven," cried lord William, “that I
were possessed of thrice that sum to bestow on thee!
but I have not a single coin about me.
I do not
scruple to tell you this, because I think I read in
your eye that you will not doubt the sincerity of any
promise I make to you : and to shew you that my
promises are not in vain, answer me faithfully to a
few questions which I shall ask of you, and I will
give you my written promise on this paper."
“ Will you give me a promise for twenty pieces
of gold ?” asked the man.
On my life I will,” returned the baron, with
the energy he felt.

Enough,” replied the man ;
then propose
your questions : but do not betray me—it would
expose me to torture, and render you no additional
benefit."
The baron promised most solemnly not to reveal
what should be imparted to him, and then proposed
his first question-
“ What connexion is it that exists between your
chief, Allanrod, and lord Rufus de Madginecourt ?”
“ Connexion !” replied the man, why they
are-
“ Rascal !_villian !” exclaimed a voice, and at
the same moment Frasier darted into the prison.
“ This I expected,” he cried, “ from your remarks
when I shewed you my nine pieces : but I am in time
to prevent your damned tattling:-Out imp! your
life is not worth an hour's wear."
Voilently he drove him towards the door, and was
following him out.
“For Heaven's sake!” cried the baron, “re-
port him not : on my soul, he has disclosed nothing
to me!"
“That was not his wisdom, but his want of time,”
replied Frasier “ and we, who exist only by ho-
nour to each other, are philosophers enough to con-
sider the will and the deed the same."
The door was instantly shut, the baron left with-
out hope, and the unpleasantness of his feelings
materially increased by the punishment which he
dreaded awaited him who had shewed a readiness to
become his friend.

MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER,

The
paper, upon which he had been about to give
his written promise of a reward to the man who had
been just hurried from his presence, was still in his
hand. He had found one heart, which from interest,
or perhaps partly from humanity and partly from in-
terest, at least he wished to believe it so, had been
about to become a friend to his cause ; and he doubt-
ed not but there were others amongst the freebooters
possessed of the same feelings, if he had but an op-
portunity of seeing them, and selecting one for his
purpose : as he had not this opportunity, being aware
that, now Allanrod's favourite, Frasier, had unfortu-
nately been the first object of his temptation, none who
were likely to incline to his suit would be permitted
to approach him, chance must inevitably be his guide
in his future attempts at freedom: accordingly, hav-
ing torn off a part of the paper he wrote upon it-
“ Lord William de Mowbray promises to reward
with a thousand pieces of gold, him who shall give
information at de Mowbray Castle that he is a pri-
soner in this building."
This done, he tied the paper to a piece of rusty
iron, which he found on the floor of his prison, and
again placing his chair upon the table under the
window, he climbed upon it, and threw out what
he had written : he had secured it from being car-
ried away by the wind, and all he feared was that
it might fall upon the roof of some lower part of
the building, and thus be lost for ever. The chances
were also much in favour of its falling into un-
friendly hands. However, he must either submit

to these hazards, or forego all attempts at liberty ;
and he resolved to repeat what he had that day
done on every successive one, whilst any of his
paper was yet remaining.
In the evening his oil and provisions were brought
to him by the deaf man: he heard the voice of Fra-
sier on the stairs, but he did not come into the
prison.
Late in the night the baron laid himself down to
rest ; the fatigue of mind which he had endured
during the day inclined him to sleep, and he soon
sunk into the lap of repose : but his imagination
was too much disturbed for him to derive much re-
freshment from his slumbers ; and dreams of a
horrid nature floated in his brain. He imagined
his daughter sinking under the ferocious embraces
of lord Rufus, and calling to him for assistance,
while he stood by at a short distance, anxiously de-
siring to rescue her from her ravisher, but unable
to move towards her : the agitation of his mind
awoke him, and as he awoke, he heard the clock
strike twelve.
In a short time he again composed himself to
sleep ; still dreams, of a like dreadful nature,
haunted his fancy: he thought himself entangled
in the labyrinth of a wood; a rough-looking figure
approached him, and he besought it to point out to
him his way. The figure beckoned to him to follow
it, and he did so; but it appeared only to lead him
still further into the entanglements of the forest :
presently it knelt down, and scratching up a tuft

of grass, discovered to his view, beneath it, the
skeleton of a child; the figure, at the same moment,
assumed the likeness of Hubert, and darted at him
a blow with a dagger. In an agony of mind he
awoke, and started from his bed ; his lamp was not
entirely extinguished, and a faint light still proceed-
ed from the dying embers of his fire : he cast his
eyes fearfully around his prison, almost dreading to
behold the form he had seen in his dream ; as they
turned towards the greak oak chest, he perceived
the lip open, and a haggard countenance appearing
beneath it.
He started at the sight, and uttered an exclama-
tion of surprise : the face immediately disappeared,
and the lid fell down with a loud clap.
Terror seized him : he could not disunite the ideas
of his dream and his waking observation ; he be-
lieved the haggard countenance which he had just
seen to have been that of Hubert. Could it be
pos-
sible that he was one of the freebooters, and really
determined on his life, as his dream had predicted ?
“ Oh that the child of Rosalind were living !"
he exclaimed in mental agony—“ oh that the black
hour of my misfortunes were not deeper dyed by the
recollection of my crimes !"
Trembling he staggered towards the chest (for
security of the worst is better to endure than sus-
pense), and endeavoured to raise the lid ; but, as
on all his former trials, it resisted his efforts; he
again kicked against it, to ascertain whether it
would now return the same sound of hollowness that

it had before done; and the sound was still the
same.
He retired to a corner of his apartment, anxious-
ly listening, and expecting momentarily to hear
some fresh sound of terror, or behold some object
of alarm ; but the silence of the night was unbroken,
except by the echoes of his own quick breathings.
After a length of time had elapsed, and neither
sounds nor objects returned to excite his terror, he
became almost ready to impute the impression of the
past to his perturbed imagination, as being merely
a part of his dream, or the consequence of it: but
he could not pass the soothing impression on his
senses ; he felt too certain of having been really
awake, and too strongly convinced that what he had
seen was no vision of sleep, no waking dream, but
a reality.
He traversed his chamber in an agitation of des-
pair ; a few minutes put a period to the life of his
lamp, and he was constrained to pass more than
two hours in dreadful darkness, ere the grey morn-
ing began to break through the clouds of night;
and when the rays of day once more entered his
prison, he felt a reluctance again to return to his
mattress, and placed himself in his chair, where
he hoped for awhile to forget his miseries in sleep;
but thought drove off its approach, and though his
mind was busily occupied by reflection, ideas crowd.
ed so fast upon each other, that he felt himself en-
tirely incapable of so arranging them as to produce
any thing like reasoning.

CHAPTER IV.
Look where it comes |
It harrows me with fear and wonder. HAMLET.
ABOUT an hour after sunrise, lord William heard
a drum beat; an immediate bustle seemed to ensue
throughout the building; he heard the voices of the
borderers calling to each other, and sometimes their
hasty steps approached close to his prison. For a
moment he entertained the faint hope of a rescue
being near at hand; but as the noises seemed all
confined to the inside of the building, the idea of its
being attacked by any friends of his soon vanished.
In about an hour more, the single drum beat a
call, and in a few minutes after it was joined by
several instruments which played a lively march :
for some time they appeared to be stationary, either
on the outside of the edifice, or in some court within
its walls. They then began to recede from it, and
their sounds were heard by him gradually decreas-
ing, till they died away amongst the whisperings of
the floating breeze. -
It was the first time since his confinement that he
had heard the sounds of instruments, and he doubt-
ed not but that they were now used to lead the
freebooters to some act of plunder and devastation.
During the day no one but the deaf man and the

malignant Frasier attended upon
him.
About noon
he again threw a paper out of his window, similar
to the one he had let fall from it the day before ;
as the evening advanced, he determined to be
sparing of his fuel and oil, that he might not again
be left in darkness during any part of the night.
The whole day he had traversed his prison in the
greatest inquietude of mind, and as the dusk of
light began to add the gloom of nature to that
which already obscured his feelings, Hubert was the
only subject of his thoughts ; nay, he even fancied
that the passing breeze seemed to whisper in his
ear—" Murderer of thy grandchild !” In agony
insupportable, he wrung his hands, and from an
aching heart his lips groaned forth—“How blessed
are the innocent in misfortune, when compared
with what the guilty suffer!" Still he attempted to
flatter himself with the idea that his present con-
duct, in so resolutely refusing to sacrifice his daugh-
ter to lord Rufus, must be of some weight in his fa-
vour in the scale of good, to balance his former
cruelty to her and her child ; his heart acknowledg-
ed it a feeble consolation, but he grasped at the
only straw of comfort which there appeared in view
for him to catch at in his present sea of calamities.
About midnight he sunk to sleep in his chair :
how long he slept he knew not, but when he awoke
his lamp was out, and his fire was also nearly ex-
hausted ; two or three expiring sticks were all that
remained of it, and these threw a feeble light upon
the wall on one side, leaving the rest of the room

in dark shade. He directly rose to replenish the
fire, and as he approached it, he heard a noise,
resembling the rubbing of two pieces of iron against
each other': he stopped, and listened ; the sound
of an opening door followed immediately after, and
all was then still again.
Several minutes elapsed, and the sounds did not
return : he heaped more fuel on his fire, which for
the present rather choked than added to the little
light which proceeded from it: suddenly a loud
noise, like the falling of chains, burst on his ear,
and seemed to proceed from the chest. He recol-
leeted the haggard countenance which he had once
seen under its lid, and trembled : he doubted not
but that the performance of some treachery was at
hand, and he was unarmed, thus unable to defend
himself.
He now heard something creak within the chest,
and thought he could distinguish the drawing of
breath. A loud snap in its inside made him start,
and he stole into the shade, to observe what he
could not fly from. The gloom he now looked
through upon the chest was thick, and almost im-
penetrable by the slender light his fire afforded ;
but he thought he could perceive the lid lifted up:
a faint gleam of light, which immediately appeared
beneath it, convinced him it was open. All anxiety
and dread, he durst scarcely breathe. The light
increased gradually, but not to any great strength,
and an armed head appeared rising up above the
edge of the chest; its features, as well as he could

discern, for the shade of its helmet was strong upon
them, appeared black, and distorted ; and he felt,
for the first time, what excessive fear is. The fi-
gure continued to rise slowly up, its eyes rolling
wildly about, as if endeavouring to look through
the misty gloom that pervaded the prison ; its right
arm was now stretched out, and in this it held a
lamp and a dagger.
Lord William continued involuntarily shrinking
back from the appearance before him ; and as he
receded towards the wall, a violent blow on his
head brought him to the ground : a loud crash en-
sued—a dreadful giddiness seized him, and in a mo-
ment all was darkness and silence.
*
When lord William's recollection returned to him
he found himself lying upon the ground, and totally
insensible how long he might have lain there. He
awoke from his stupor sore and bruised, and entirely
ignorant where he was ; the place to which he was
transported appeared to his senses full of misty va-
pours, and a strong earthy smell assailed his nos-
trils.
The ground was clammy and uneven ; and, in
endeavouring to raise himself, he several times slip-
ped down again.
He extended his hands on every side—all was va-
cancy : he moved on a few steps, and a stone wall,
dripping with humid exhalations like that of a sepul-
chre, met his touch.
Guiding himself by this wall, he determined, if

possible, to heasure the extent of the place he was
in, and endeavour to learn if there was no openingfor
him to escape by. As he proceeded, unwholesome
vapours met his breath, and the dewy damps, which
settled on his hair and clothes, ran down in drops
upon his face and hands.
He trod on cautiously for a considerable time, his
hands constantly held out to warn him of any obsta-
cle that might intercept his progress. Suddenly a
short but rapid declivity in the ground again threw
him on his side, and at the same moment a deep
groan struck his ear. With suspended respiration,
he awaited its repetition; but no similar sound was
heard—all was again profoundly silent.
He sighed aloud, thinking that it had perhaps been
the echo of his own breath which had alarmed him,
and willing to ascertain if it was so. No echo now
replied to it, but at the moment when he expected
to have heard it, the air close by him was cut by the
rapid movement of some substance passing through
it—and all was then again still.
He had heard no footsteps accompanying the sound
but dreading that danger was lurking near him, he
made an effort to rise : he could not find the wall
which had before been some protection to him in
moving along; still he thought that a few steps
might bring him to it. The ground became more
slippery than ever: he again stumbled, and in his
attempt to catch at something which might save
him from falling, he encountered in his grasp a-
skeleton. -

He threw himself from it, as if a serpent had met
his touch, and darting on one side, he again found
himself by the wall : cold drops of perspiration
burst from every pore, and a deadly sickness seized
him; he groaned aloud in agony, and the spot
where he now stood returned him the echo of his
own voice in hollow sounds, which fear might have
believed to have proceeded from the mouths of an
hundred spirits.
Lord William stood chained to the spot, at a to-
tal loss how to proceed amidst the horrors he was
existing amongst : at length, recovering, in some
measure, his fortitude, as no fresh cause of terror
assailed him, he thought he perceived the gleam of
a faint light at a distance : he fixed his eyes on it ;
it appeared of the same nature with that which had
issued from the chest, on the opening of its lid that
night ; he fancied that it moved, but if it did, its
progress was remarkably slow. He presently as-
certained that it did recede from him, and consi-
dering that his only chance of escaping from this
spot of horrors was to follow it, he moved boldly
forward.
The ground became drier, and thus favoured his
advances towards the light; he kept it still in view,
and believed that he could discern by it a deep and
lofty vault, into which he was entering : gradually
the vault became narrower and narrower, and at
length he moved along with one hand upon either
wall. For a considerable time he continued to pro-
ceed, the light appearing to him to move at nearly


## p. 253 (#281) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 253
the same pace he did, and becoming neither stronger
nor paler, till on a sudden it totally disappeared.
In this dilemma, lord de Mowbray felt himself as
much at a loss as he had ever been how to act; he
dreaded equally to advance or to recede from the
spot where he stood, and to remain there could not
forward his hope of escape; he therefore deter-
mined, at all hazards, to proceed.
After a progress of a few moments, he found him-
self at the top of a flight of steps, down which his
extreme caution just saved him from falling. He
descended about a dozen steps of stone, and on ar-
riving at the bottom of these, he again caught a
glimpse of the light, and, as he believed, of the fi-
gure which he had seen rise from the chest. He
again stopped to deliberate: was he really under
supernatural influence?—was the spirit of Hubert
haunting him 2 or was the living Hubert the agent
of a plot for his destruction ?
The clock at this instant struck three ; it sound-
ed loudly, and appeared much nearer to him than
it had done in his prison: he started at the sound,
for its reverberations beat from vault to vault.
The light was now again swiftly disappearing,
and still fearing to be left in total darkness, he
again quickened his pace; but his progress was al-
most immediately stopped by a grated door. He
placed his shoulders to it, and it flew open with a
noise which resounded through the place like distant
thunder; and at the same instant he felt himself
precipitated down several steps, upon a hard and

flinty ground. He immediately raised himself up
again, painful as was the effort, and looked around
hastily for the light, but it had entirely vanished.
Thedungeon into which he had fallen was so small,
that its extent measured scarcely a dozen paces ;
but he could perceive in it no outlet, no means of
quitting it, but by the stairs down which he had
fallen, and which were so decayed and broken
away, as to defy all his attempts to reascend them.
For a considerable time he continued in this
wretched situation, till chancing to raise his eyes
to the opposite side of the dungeon to that in
which he was standing, he saw a faint illumination
playing upon the wall, which appeared to be the
reflection of some light above his head : he turned
his eyes to the spot, and discovered a cleft of con-
siderable size, through which the moonbeams were
gaining admittance. His heart leaped with joy ;
the cavity was not above his reach, and hanging
upon it by his hands, he easily raised himself up
to it. He perceived that it was indeed the welcome
light of the moon which was cheering him, and a
fine star-light night presented its beautiful serenity
to his view,
· He now blessed his unknown conductor, what-
ever his intentions might have been, and began to
place all his strength upon his endeavours to force
himself through the aperture.
Those alone who have been exposed to the situa-
tion in which lord de Mowbray had been condemned
to exist, can be adequate judges of the force with

which the expectation of freedom arms the nerves;
at another time, the baron himself would have as-
serted his incapacity to rend the rock which pointed
out liberty to him, and still denied him its enjoy-
ment; now, with strength almost supernatural, he,
by small particles, crumbled away the envious
earth, till he was enabled to thrust his body into
the aperture : from the descent to the ground was
but a few feet, and, without hesitation, he leaped
down.
On looking round, he found himself at the foot
of a rocky piece of ground, on which stood the
building where he had so lately been a prisoner.
He raised his eyes, and beheld the very turret which
had been the scene of his miseries, frowning upon
him from the gloomy grandeur of the shade in
which it was enveloped. He had however enjoyed
but very few moments of exultation, when he heard
the silence of the night broken in upon by the
sound of footsteps. His heart sunk within him: if
he was pursued, how dreadful might be the punish-
ment decreed against his escape, although he him-
self had not been the original agent of it. He erept
into a cleft in the rock, and here he endeavoured
to hide himself; the sounds advanced nearer, and
then again receded from him : thus they several
times returned, and then again died away; and the
baron at last discovered that they were the footsteps
of a sentinel who was pacing his allotted portion of
ground on a prominence of the rock nearly above
the cavity in which he was standing concealed.


## p. 256 (#284) ############################################

256 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
Once more lord William feared to move ; one
glance of the sentinel might destroy all his hopes
of escape : he perceived, however, that the moon
was rapidly withdrawing her light from the atmos-
phere, and knowing that there would be an interval
of at least an hour between her disappearance and
the rising of day, he determined to await that time
for flying from the precincts of the castle: accord-
ingly, when the orb of night had sunk below the
horizon, he again ventured forth : the stars were
also withdrawing their influence, and the country
was now wrapped in the dark shades of night. The
road towards his own castle he knew to be intricate,
and he was unacquainted with the track which it
became him to pursue.
Afterhehad moved a short distance from his hiding
place, he discerned a path down the rock on which
the castle stood; it was steep, and covered with
knots of furze and loose stones, which rendered his
going down it not only dangerous but difficult.
Arrived at the bottom, he resolved not to proceed
by the regular path, lest he should encounter any
of his enimies returning to their haunt, but to de-
viate from the road, still keeping it as much as
possible in view, and making it the rule of his
progress. -
He wandered on, through an immense valley,
bounded on each side by lofty hills, and soon disco-
vered that he was passing through that very gulf
which, on the evening that he was conducted pri-
soner to the monastery, had struck him with terror

as a spot suited to the dreadful purpose of murder.
The gibbet was scarcely discernible at the present
time, but the creaking of the chains met his ear,
and he shuddered at the sound.
• Over the range of hills which encircled the val-
ley, he perceived he must climb, before he should
quit the purlieus of his enemy's encampment; and
with extreme difficulty and caution he arrived on
their other side, without any obstruction but such
as the ruggedness of the hills themselves presented
to his progress.
Although the exertion was overpowering, he
abated nothing of his speed, and as the dawn of day
began to break, he believed himself at least six
miles from the spot where he had so lately been a
prisoner. Thirst was the most painful sensation he
suffered under, and perceiving no cottage near, he
slacked his drought at a rivulet; sweetened by li-
berty, the draught was delicious, and seemed to
inspire him with fresh spirits and strength.
Morning was now beginning to break; the grey
dawn had for some time mixed its lighter tints
with the sable and retiring shadows of night; and the
dappled clouds separating in large masses, unlocked
the rosy gates of day.

Rous’d by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves

About an hour after sunrise, the baron felt a faint-
ness, the consequence of fatigue, seize upon him,
which required some short respite of his progress;
he accordingly threw himself down at the foot of an
oak, where his bed was perfumed by the violets,
which shrunk from view amidst the herbage : and
here he lay for awhile, almost entranced, enjoying,
in luxury, the beauties of the scene, and contrast-
ing them with the horrors of the preceding days and
nights; and but for the recollection of his impri-
soned men, and the uncertain state of his affairs at
home, he would for some moments have revelled
in perfect happiness: so exquisite is the air we
breathe in that liberty which has for any time been
denied us.
Short, however, were the moments of his bliss-
ful trance : a distant sound, resembling the tones
of music, mixed itself with the rustling breeze that
played upon his ear; it grew gradually louder, and
and he plainly distinguished the voices of warlike
instruments : he was now as miserable as he had

just before been happy; he doubted not but that
the sounds portended the return of some of the
moss-troopers from a sally for plunder, and the
dread of discovery again seized him ; he crept to-
wards some bushes, through the foliage of which he
could catch a glance of that part of the country
from whence the sounds proceeded, without expo-
sing himself to view.
He perceived a long train of men, whom he in-
stantly recognized to be Scottish freebooters, wind-
ing up the side of a hill, at the distance of scarcely
a furlong from the spot where he stood : he could
also perceive that they were laden with plunder, and
heconjectured, heavily to, by the slow pace at which
they moved. The road along which they must
pass ran close by the present concealment of the
baron; to quit it, however, he judged more hazard-
ous than to keep close within the cover it afforded
him ; and he therefore skulked down beneath the
underwood, in a state of dread and anxiety which
equalled every unpleasant sensation he had before
experienced.
The music continued to sound, and the rough
voices of the freebooters were now audible, even
amidst the din of their instruments. The baron
crept still closer to the earth, not daring to raise
an eye from his hiding-place. They at length
passed within a stone's throw of him. By the few
words he overheard of their conversation, he dis-
covered that they were conducting some prisoners
to their fortress. He pitied those condemned to

the cruel fate from which he had so recently, so
unaccountably escaped himself, and from returning
to which he yet scarcely thought himself secure.
At length they had all passed the spot, and he
ventured to raise his head ; but those he looked
for were no longer visible, although the sounds of
voices and instruments were still reverberating on
his ear: they had marched into a valley, into
which his eyes were prevented from following them
by a cluster of trees which grew at the entrance
of it.
That this body of freebooters had been encoun-
tered by him in his way, the baron was glad, now
he had escaped their observation, because the
chances appeared in his favour, that he should not
meet any of the party to annoy him during the re-
mainder of his journey to his own castle. Inspired
by this hope, he again set forward; the sounds of the
instruments were now scarcely audible, and he saw
his enemy at a considerable distance, proceeding
along the upper part of a road, where there ap-
pearance was that of one moving body, separate
objects being no longer discernible.
Lord William felt the want of sustenance grow-
ing upon him at every step; but still he wished to
proceed a little, and still a little further, before he
asked refreshment of any of the shepherds whose
huts were scattered about, lest he should be recog-
nized by any of them, as he dreaded what connexion
they might have with the freebooters. Whilst he
was thus debating with his own mind, he perceived

three men coming towards him : he was at first
startled at the sight, and felt undetermined whether
he should avoid them ; but perceiving that they were
shepherds, and that they saw him, he collected
himself as much as he was able; and assuming the
manners of a weary traveller, besought their hos-
pitality. They returned his salutation with great
friendliness; and the eldest, who was the father of
the other two, a venerable grey-headed old man,
immediately invited him to his cottage, which he
told him was situated on the other side of the hill
which the baron was ascending when he met them.
One of the sons being left with the flock, the
other returned back with his father and lord William,
and after a few minutes' walk, they arrived at the
humble dwelling of the shepherds. The hut was as
rude as it could well be conceived to be : the walls
were of boughs, plastered with mud, and the roof
of thatch was in many parts quite broken away, and
in others nearly overgrown with moss and weeds;
the door was too low to allow a person who did not
stoop to enter it; through a few narrow chinks in
the walls was admitted all the light the cottage re-
ceived; the fire was contained in a hole dug in the
centre of the floor, and the smoke having no chim-
ney to conduct it out, had dyed the inside of the
roof with its dusky influence, and cast innumerable
blacks on the beams and rafters, in finding a way
out for itself.
Two or three wooden benches, and a rough-hewn
table, composed all the furniture of the place, except

some straw, which was scattered in one corner, and
covered with sheep-skins for a bed. Every thing
around denoted the poverty of its inmates; yet they
appeared cheerful and contented, and with a most
cordial welcome they joined many apologies for the
humble roof beneath which they received him.
A female, of a hale and florid complexion, whose
attire corresponded with the meanness of her habi-
tation, rose, at their entrance, from her employ-
ment, to welcome the stranger; and at the com-
mand of the old man, she set before the baron some
new milk and some oaten cakes: the old man in-
troduced her to his guest as the wife of his son.
Readily did lord William partake of the humble
but palatable repast which was placed before him;
and he then threw himself upon the shepherd's bed,
which, in a state of less fatigue, he would not have
been emulous of pressing, but which now wore the
most inviting form. After a few hours' repose, he
awoke, and found himself alone in the cottage,
with a boy of about five years old, who appeared to
have been placed there to watch his waking, and
give notice of it to the woman; for the moment he
opened his eyes, the child ran to the door, and
calling out—“The stranger is awake,” the female
entered, and graciously enquired what she could do
to serve her guest ? -
“Nothing further, I thank you,” returned lord
William ; “I am now sufficiently recovered from
my fatigue to proceed on my journey.”
The boy was standing by the side of the woman,

“ He is
your child, I
as were two other children, apparently younger than
he was: the baron's eyes fell on the child, and he
observed him to be remarkably beautiful, and of a
most interesting countenance; his face was round,
and lighted by a pair of arch and nearly black eyes;
a vivid colour painted his cheeks ; his hair was a
few shades deeper than the flaxen, and his scanty
raiment displayed the fairness of his skin.
“ That is a very handsome boy,” said the baron,
suppose
?"
No,” returned the woman,
“ they are all
mine but him.”
And whose is he? rejoined De Mowbray.
My brother's,” was the reply.
“ He whom we left with the flock, when I first
met your husband and father, I guess ?” said
the baron.
“ No, another brother,” the woman replied.
The old man at this moment entered the hut,
with some firing, which he had been cutting : he
had overheard their conversation as he approached,
and patting the boy on his head as he spoke, said-
Ay, Heaven bless him ! I call him mine, for he
has nobody else to look up to at present ; all
have not humanity enough to take care of their own.
Earnestly did the baron, at the present moment,
wish that he was possessed of the means of reward-
ing his hospitable entertainers; but being destitute
of them, he promised that they should not be long
without meeting a return for their kindness.
The old man replied, that a reward was what he

did not wish for, nor think of; he had. but little
it was true, he added, but he had never found that
little less for relieving with it the hungry and weary
traveller.
" With such ideas,” returned the baron, “ thou
art more blessed than affluence could make thee; thy
comforts, however, may be increased, without en-
dangering the purity of thy happiness—and depend
on it they shall.”
The baron, by inquiring the nearest road to his
own castle, had found that the cottage 'where he
had met with so hospitable a reception was but a
stone's throw from the valley where he and his men
had been surprised by Allanrod and his freebooters.
At this spot 'he quickly arrived ; and although it
had led him nearly a furlong from his road to visit
it, he could not resist the impulse he felt to pass
that way, and learn whether the banditti had pos-
sèssed sufficient humanity to bury his soldiers wlio
had fallen in that day's contest.
Having gained a sight of the tumulies which en-
closed their bodies, he set forward again, with all
the speed he was capable of making. But sixteen
miles lay between him and his castle: it was now
little more than noonday; thus, at a moderate pace,
he might reach its walls by sunset. This idea in-
spired him with strength, and lent wings to his
speed.
At length the turrets of De Mowbray Castle, rear-
ing their heads above the groves which surrounded
it, met the eye of their lord ; the sun was at this

moment on the horizontal line, and its golden light
painted the scene with a glowing influence, which
communicated itself to the heart of the baron, and
almost drew the tears of joy into his eyes.
Nimbly he ascended the velvet turf which led to
the moat of his castle, and eagerly he turned the last
angle which lay between him and the drawbridge :
on coming within sight of it, he found it down ;
this did not surprise him, as he supposed that some
one had lately passed over it, or was about so to do;
but on arriving at its foot, he perceived no sentinel
near, nor any human being whatever in view. This
startled him : he cast his eyes to the watchtower ;
it was without its accustomary guard, and those
places on the battlements which had for years past
been the stations of sentinels were all vacant.
He crossed the drawbridge, and arriving at the
gate of the first court, he found no obstruction to
his entering it; the heavy portcullis bung supended
in its chains, and gave free access to the interior of
the building. In the utmost astonishment he step.

the second court, when fragments of the broken
walls met his sight, scattered on the earth, and min.
gled with the balls of the musketry, the snap-
ped blades of swords, the barrels of matchlocks,
the unbent bow, and the useless sling.
Plainly did these bespeak that his castle had been
besieged in his absence, and too clearly did the
state of the drawbridge and portcullis declare that
the enemy had conquered, and despoiled his man-

sion. Where was his daughter 2—was the build-
ing deserted, or were there still some remaining
within its vanquished walls, to tell him the sad
tale 2—were the instant questions which he proposed
to himself, and rushed towards the castle to gain a
reply to. The doors stood open; wildly he enter-
ed the castle hall, and called aloud upon his house-
hold, in various names, to which no answer was
returned. He rushed into the first apartment
which presented itself to him; it was the saloon,
where oft the assembled group of joy had made the
vaulted ceiling ring with the echoes of the dance
and song: now'how altered its state 1 Every feature
denoted rapine : the heavy chairs alone remained
of all its sumptuous furniture; the golden tripods,
which had supported the fragrant exotic and the
blooming shrub, were no longer there; the silver
lamps were torn, with their chains, from the walls,
and the ewers and basons of massy gold, which had
been the containers of the scented water devoted to
the refreshment of the partakers in the dance, were
alike no more to be seen.
“ Allanrod—accursed, damnable Allanrod 1
these are thy ravages, these are the marks of thy
savage fury,” exclaimed lord William, as he gazed
on the scene before him. “ Doubtless, from my
castle was thy ruffian band returning with their
wealthy spoils, when I this morning beheld them
from my covert;-perhaps at that moment my
faithful servants passed me, the prisoners of thy
inhumanity—nay, perhaps at that instant my un-

fortunate child was led thy captive, unconscious
how near to her was her unhappy father, ignorant
of her fate--unable to succour her if it had been
known to him!”
It was still possible, he thought, though hardly
probable, after the demand which Allanrod had
made of her for his friend lord Rufus de Madgine-
court, that she might be in her chamber. Thither
flew the baron. The stairs which led towards it
bore indubitable marks of the avarice and ferocity
of the spoilers of the building ; spots of blood, strips
of garments, and broken weapons, lay everywhere
scattered amongst such articles of furniture as the
ravagers had rejected.
The door of Rosalind's apartment stood open;
no one appeared to meet him at his entrance ; he
called on his daughter, but his invocations were in
vain; he clasped his hands in agony, and stood al-
most maddened by the idea of what atrocious suf-
ferings she might have been condemned to, or still
might be reserved for.
In a state of mind that bade defiance to cool re-
flection, the baron continued to run from one apart-
ment to another, in the vain hope of at last finding
some individual who might reply to his interroga-
tories : at length despair seized him, and overpow.
ered equally by his recollection of the past, his ideas
of the present, and his anxieties for the future, he
sunk, overpowered in body and mind, upon a
couch.

the day, and the gathering darkness added to the
misery of De Mowbray's mind. Still he did not at-
tempt to quit the castle; he knew not whither to
go at so late an hour, and he felt equally unwilling
to remain where he was : his mind was too much
harassed to admit of any resolution or plan, and he
continued to lie where he had thrown himself down.
The apartment to which chance had led him was
the cedar chamber, in which the baroness, his wife,
had died: this alone appeared to have escaped the
fury of the spoilers, and at the present moment he
could scarcely avoid believing that fate had pre-
served the solemnity of this scene entire, to add
one more pang to the tortures of his soul. There
is a state of frenzied grief to which the mind is dri-
ven by accumulated sorrow, in which it almost
wishes, rather than dreads, an increase of misery
and terror, imagining it almost impossible that it
can feel more than it already does, and almost de-
siring that it may experience enough of horror and
affliction, to end all feeling at a blow.
In this situation was De Mowbray; he felt, as
it were, prepared to see the spirit of his wife ap-
proach him, and demand the cause why he had not
given Rosalind to the man of her heart 2 He recol-
lected the awful, the unknown voice, which had
called upon him to spare Rosalind, on the night
when in that chamber she had fallen in supplication
at his feet, and he had declared to her his resolu-
tion of yielding her to the detested lord Rufus; he
expected te hear the voice again address him, and

his feelings were worked to that pitch of horror,
that something like disappointment attended the
failure of his expectations.
Then came to his mind the remembrance of his
parting with Hubert, and the innocent countenance
of the babe whom he had committed to his mercy.
To this idea succeeded the recollection of the ter-
rible visage which had gazed on him from the chest
in his prison, in the fortress of Allanrod, and
which he believed himself to have followed through
those vaults into which he had so unaccountably
been introduced. Had this been Hubert, or the
spirit of Hubert ?
His tongue was parched within his mouth, a
burning fever drank his blood." Oh God !” he
cried aloud, “ thy punishments are just, but they
are severe. Oh Power Omnipotent! accept my
repentance; let the infant spirit of him whose blood
I have spilt plead to thy mercy for my offence !
My weight of woe already crushes me to the earth
forbear, forbear to torture me further ! I am
humbled before thee."

We now return to Rosalind, whom we parted from
on the day succeeding that which was marked by
the setting out of lord William and his men from
the castle, to meet the advanced body of Allanrod's
troops.
: Rosalind slept peacefully, although the rumour
of the black ghost, which had been seen on the
drawbridge, and on many parts of the ramparts,
interfered with the repose of some of the inhabitants
of the castle, and caused them curiously to watch
the burning of the lamp at midnight, dreading the
appearance of its flame turning blue.
But although Rosalind experienced no anxieties
on account of the spirit which her household so
universally dreaded, still her mind was rendered
ill at ease by those which she derived from other
sources; for her father she could not help feeling a
degree of interest, notwithstanding his conduct

towards her had been so unlike that of a tender
pa-
rent ; and for the life of Gertrude, her only female
companion, and whom habit and affection combined
had taught her to consider in the light of a kind
friend, her alarm was not less than for the safety
of her father.
Gertrude had suddenly been taken ill, and from
the first moment of her indisposition, her disorder
had worn so alarming an appearance, as gave Ro-
salind the most serious uneasiness on her account.
Bereft of her, she should be deprived of every one
whom she now looked upon with any degree of af-
.
fection, and whom she considered as feeling any
real love for her. Mr. Wilmot, the family physi-
cian, had been nearly two years dead : his loss had
only been replaced by a youth in the castle, to
whom he had, at leisure hours, given some little
instruction in the art of medicine ; and Rosalind
trembled for the safety of her servant, committed
to the care of his slender skill.
Day and night, Rosalind herself attended upon
her with unremitting care and attention ; she did
not for an instant suffer herself to quit her apart-
ment ; even her devotions, which she had for a
length of time been accustomed to perform in the
chapel, were now offered up in the chamber of
Gertrude.
As she one night watched by her bed, observing
her to be fallen into a slumber, she amused her
thoughts, and kept herself from sleep, by composing
the following

ODE TO HEALTH..
T'koo, who mak'st the cheek to glow,
Health !-prime blessing here below,
What can all the world bestow
If thou'rt not nigh?
What to soothe the voice of woe,
Of pain and misery?
Need Experience tell his tale ?
Ah! too surely riches fail !
But thro' the rugged path of fate,
Altho' a thousand ills await,
Tho' thorns around,
And stings abound,
And numerous brambles scatter'd lie,
To wound the naked feet of poverty,
Yet with the wretch, if thou wilt stay,
Thou strew'st with roses still his way.
See on his crimson couch of state
The wealthy Cræsus laid !
Around physicians wait,
And livery'd slaves, who with officious aid
Attend his anguish'd eye,
All ready at a glance to fly-
Vain, vain their help! The fever-heated brain
Rages ; nor can the icy poles allay the pain.
_" Oh for yon beggar's ease, yon beggar's health!
A moment grant it, and take all

wealth!
He by some greenwood side
Contented opes his wallet's humble store,
And quaffs the clear, cool tide
Of the fresh rivulet; happy, tho' poor !
Presses the grassy turf in thoughtless sleep,
While I, worn out, eternal vigils keep.”
The tantalizing thought adds keeper fires ;
He storms, he madly rages, and expires.
Riches oft tempt excess ;
The costly wine, and yiand season'd high,
Contain the slow disease ; nor less
The onervating bed of luxury.

And promps the feast, and circulates the glass :
Health flies the revelling board ;
Still 'midst fresh fields and dews she loves to stray,
To sip the sweets of young-born day,
Far from temptation's scourging rod.

Then keep thy boasted gifts, oh wealth!
Be thou my better portion-health.
Thee, goddess, with the rosy crest,
Florid cheek, and azure vest,
Sparkling eyes of heavenly blue,
Shall my eager homage woo!
With thee from smoky towns l'll dy ;
To scenes of rural peace we'll hie ;
Inhaling zephyr's balmy breath,
Sweeten'd o'er the yellow heath ;
Blown from beds of scented broom,
Open'd now, and all in bloom ;
Climbing up the mountain's side,
To behold the prospect wide ;
Dells, and woods, and lawns, and streams,
Gilded with the sun's bright beams;
Now to view the lessening sail
Sink beneath a cloudy veil ;
Now to hear the feather'd throng
Tune their magic-breathing song ;
Now to roam thro' grove and dale,
To listen to the shepherd's tale,
Drawn from softly-breathing reed,
And, listening, check our ea ger speed ;
While exercise gives sweetest zest
To each short interval of rest.
Thus would I live, and live content,
To know with thee my days were spent,
Far from the witchery of wealth,
Bless'd with thy better portion-health!”

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
When Rosalind laid down her pen, she perceived
that Gertrude still slept, and she hoped that it
might prove an omen of her returning health. Her
wish was accomplished; for on the morrow Ger-
trude shewed signs of approaching convalescence,
and Rosalind once more entertained a hope that her
only companion of her own sex would be spared her.
Twelve days the baron, her father, had been
absent, and no tidings of him had reached De Mow-
bray Castle : every day increased the anxiety of
Rosalind for his fate; she knew not whether to be-
lieve him the victim of a powerful foe, or delayed
from returning by pursuing the freebooters to their
holds. She had no beam of comfort to cheer her
desponding mind, but that which Heaven had kindly
granted her in the life of Gertrude ; and situated
as she was at the moment of its favour, she felt a
more than common gratitude for its indulgence.
On the eighteenth day after the departure of the
baron from his castle, Gertrude's health was so far
improved, that Rosalind felt no hesitation in quitting
her, for the hours which she had before her illness
been accustomed to spend in devotion, by the side
of her mother's tomb in the chapel.
Ambrose attended her, and opened for her the
gates, which had lately been kept locked, on ac-
count of the communication of the vaults with the
northern rampart. Rosalind knelt on her accus-
tomed stone, and with her eyes raised to heaven,
she mingled her prayers of request and thanksgiving:
when her devotions were ended,' her eyes fell upon

the marble which enclosed the ashes of her loved
and lamented parent; and upon a white spot of its
surface, where the veins of jet which variegated the
stone did not interfere with its purity, she perceived a
glittering trinket, which arrested her observation ;
she looked closer, and discovered it to be the very
cross of rubies set in gold, which had been the legacy
of her deceased parent to her lost Edward !
The sight startled her, and a thousand distract-
ing ideas rushed into her brain.—“ Ambrose !" she
exclaimed " Ambrose, who has been into the
chapel ? can you explain this mystery ?”
Ambrose entered hastily, and inquired the mean-
ing of her question.
A secret instinct, for which she could not ac-
count, whispered to her heart to be silent on the
occurrence of the foregoing minute, and she replied
-“ It is so long since I have left my chamber, in
attending to your niece, that I tremble at my own
shadow; my momentary alarm is past and forgotten.”
“No one has been within the chapel, I am certain,"
replied Ambrose ; “ the keys have not been from
my side.”
Rosalind attempted to change the subject, and to
chat with Ambrose on other matters, as they to-
gether returned towards the castle hall; but she
observed that he saw her mind occupied by some
recent impression, and she felt that her efforts to
conceal the emotions of her heart were very
inade-
quate to her design.
She repaired quickly to her chamber, and here

her first action was to draw the cross from its hiding
place in her bosom, and to assure herself that it
was indeed the same which the baroness de Mow-
bray had bequeathed to her beloved Edward. The
same it was, beyond all doubt ; she recollected a
small fracture in a rim of the gold which enclosed
one of the stones, and which certified it to be the
very cross that she had at first believed it.
She considered that in Gertrude's present weak
state it would be wrong to make her the confident
of this discovery, and that she would be an equally
unfit subject for the deriving of an opinion from ;
accordingly she was doomed to confine her thoughts
to her own breast.-—" By what means,” she began
with asking herself, “ could this cross have been
conveyed into the chapel ? and for what purpose
but to meet my observation ?”—Then succeeded
the question of " By whom had it been placed
there ?” At this demand, a sensation approaching
to frenzy seized her brain ; she almost dared to hope
that Edward might himself be alive !—The chapel
gates, Ambrose had said, were constantly kept
locked; but Edward was acquainted with the en-
trance to the vaults from the rampart, and the pas-
sage which led from thence into the chapel.
Through them had Edward gained admittance on
the night which had made her his wife. Could it
be possible that Edward was himself alive?
A flood of tears came to the relief of her over-
burdened heart ; and as the first impression of hope
wore away, she began to chide herself for the weak

latitude which she had allowed to her thoughts and
expectations. Edward was a corpse, and had been
so for six long months—sad testimony of his death
had reached her father, and no doubts could hang
on the heart-rending fact.
Thought is ever busy to torment the breast thatit
inhabits, and thus it whispered in the ear of Rosa-
lind:—Never would Edward have parted from this
bequest of her whom he considered as his mother,
but in death. He died far from his native soil, in
Flanders. Who then could have been sufficiently
acquainted with the history of this trinket to have
returned it to the spot from whence it was brought?
or, if any one had gained this knowledge, or, from
his intimation, had learnt that it would be regarded
as valuable by her, why not bring it to her in per-
son, and place the sacred relic in her hands?—why
commit it to the chance of never reaching her, by
leaving it on the spot where she had discovered it 2
The finding of this cross, so well known and
highly revered on account of those to whom it had
belonged, in so peculiar a situation, must have some
meaning, some reference to herself; and to disco-
ver what this might be she wanted no spur to goad
her on; where alone she failed was in devising the
means for discovering what design lay concealed
beneath her finding it where she had done.
The day passed in thought and anxiety unequalled
by any she had ever before experienced; she knew
not what to expect, or what to believe. The gates
of the chapel Ambrose had declared to have been

kept locked; thus, whoever had placed the cross
there must have gained admittance from the vaults
which opened upon the northern rampart. A chaos
of ideas filled her brain, and from the mass, she
determined (she could scarcely answer to herself
why) to ask of Ambrose the keys of the chapel that
night, under pretence of going, earlier than usual,
to prayer on the following morning ; and to visit
the chapel at that hour of the night at which she
had met Edward there previously to their marriage.
With the dusk of the evening, she accordingly
called Ambrose into her presence, and having re-
quired of him the keys, she indulged him with half-
an-hour's conversation, spent in surmises on the
fate of her father in his present attack upon the
forces of the freebooter; and then retired to her
chamber, where the hours crept heavily on till the
clock of the castle struck twelve.

ing a single observer ; as she was turning into a
passage, which led from it to that wing of the cas-
tle which she was under the necessity of passing in
her way to the chapel, sounds, which startled her,
met her ear. She was, at first, at a loss what to
conclude them; but as she moved a few steps to-
wards a casement, of which an upper compartment
had been left open, she clearly distinguished the
approach of martial music.
Before she had time for reflection, an alarm was
sounded from the watchtower of the castle; the
sentinel at the drawbridge replied to it with his horn ;
the trumpet in the watchtower sounded a second
and a third blast—" To arms ! to arms !-an enemy!
—to arms !” ran from sentinel to sentinel on the
ramparts; and in a few seconds, the soldiers of the
castle burst from all parts into the great hall, in
quest of their arms.
The first who recognized Rosalind was Ambrose :
he had no suspicion but that the terror of the mo-
ment had drawn her from her chamber, and address-
ed her with—“ Dearest lady, be of good cheer ! Hea-
ven still protects the innocent amidst the din of war.
We have sturdy fellows in our castle, who will oppose
the enemy's force to the last drop of their blood."
“But should their courage be overpowered by
numbers?” said Rosalind.
“ Even these ravagers must shew mercy to fe-
males,” answered Ambrose.

the troops belonging to the castle had devolved dur.

advanced, and requested Rosalind to suffer herself to
be conveyed, with the other females, into an interior
apartment, where they might in safety await the
issue of the attack. *
Rosalind accepted his counsel, and retired to the
room which he had pointed out.
Already was the combined force of the musketry
and the bow levelled from the ranks of the enemy
against the defenders of De Mowbray Castle.
Rosalind threw herself into a chair, and in that
dread of mind which imposed silence on her tongue,
she sat awaiting the event, and endeavouring to
catch an idea of the fortunes of the hour from the
mingled sounds which assailed her ear. Now a
shout beneath the ramparts caused her to believe the
invaders victorious—now the voices of her father's
soldiery seemed to bespeak them conquerors. Of
the women who were, at this trying moment, her
companions, some wept from cowardice, some from
their apprehension for the safety of individuals
amongst the soldiery to whom they had attachments.
Gertrude was too weak and ill to express her sen-
sations, and Rosalind was without a consoler.
Ambrose alone visited the chamber ; he was the
only male whose age exempted him from an active
share in the contest: the intelligence of hope which
he one moment brought, his entrance on the next
crushed; a third visit would again perhaps revive
the sensation, and a fourth once more banish it
entirely from the heart.

Thus did Rosalind pass three hours, between
the extremes of hope and despair. The dawn
of day was now beginning to break, and with
the first approach of twilight she distinctly heard
the cry of “ Quarter !” from her father's troops.
Dreadful was the sound, and still more terrible was
that which succeeded it ; for in a few seconds more
she heard the castle gates burst open, and the
riotous band of conquerors rushing through the
building
Ambrose came again into the apartment.-" Oh
lady!” he exclaimed, “ dear lady !--that I should
live to bear you these tidings ! -we are the prison-
ers of the freebooter Allanrod. Oh that I had died
ere I had seen this wretched day!"
“ We are still the creatures of Providence,” cried
Rosalind; “ in its mercy
I trust."
The gleam of torches which now played upon the
roof of the vaulted passage leading to the apartment
where Rosalind sat awaiting her fate, announced the
approach of the freebooters. About thirty were
seen advancing : the females in the apartment fled
to the remotest extremity it afforded them, and
united their shrieks for mercy. By an effort almost
superior to her strength, Rosalind rose from her
seat, and moving a few steps towards the door, she'
said " If you are 'men,' sully not your pretensions
to the name by cruelty to the defenceless; stain not
your conquest by inhumanity to helpless woman!"
One alone, whose dress bespoke him superior to
his fellows, entered the apartment ; the resť remained

without, closing up the entrance." You are, I
presume,” he said, “ the lady Rosalind ?”
“ I am that Rosalind,” she replied.
“ Fear nothing, lady,” returned the man ;
“no injury is intended you: comply willingly with
my demands, and you are safe and happy.”
“ Will you extend the same promise to my
poor attendants here ?” asked Rosalind.
“At your request they shall be safe,” returned
the moss-trooper. Come, lady,” he added,
taking the hand of Rosalind to lead her forth.
“ Whither do you require me to go ?" she
said.
“ To a place better suited for your abode than
the despoiled castle of your father,” answered he.
Oh, where is my father? tell me that, I
conjure you ?” asked Rosalind.
“ More of that anon,
» returned her conduc-
tor, still leading her away
from the apartment.
“ Tell me whither it is that I am required to go-
only tell me that,” said Rosalind.
“ I have already told you, to a place of safety
and happiness,” he replied.—“ Nay, lady,” he ad-
ded, drawing Rosalind's arm through his, " be not
reluctant to your own good ; no force will be used
with you but in this particular.”
It was in vain, she knew, for her to resist the
power which had conquered her father's soldiery,
thus suffered herself to be led by him through the
hall of the castle, where spoil and rapine presented
themselves to her sight at every step: they pro-

ceeded to the outer court, where the light of the
morning rendered the torches no longer necessary;
and here she beheld a carriage, which, from the
preparations making about it, she doubted not
awaited her. Her conjecture was not ill founded;
she was desired to get into it, and the moss-trooper
who had led her to it, having once again requested
her to lay aside all apprehensions for her safety,
the door was closed, and the carriage put into
motion.
Rosalind threw herself back in the carriage, and
with her handkerchief held to her eyes, she sat for
some time in wretched thought ; when she again
opened them, and looked around her, no light met
them, except a faint gleam which burst through a
crevice in one of the shutters that occupied the
space of the windows. She attempted to open
them, but they were too securely fastened to be
moved by her. Patience and resignation she now
perceived to be alone left her, and with a mournful
silence she endeavoured to retain her composure of
mind. -
They travelled during the whole of the day, stop-
ping only at intervals for refreshments, which were
brought to her by the same Scotchman who had in
the morning been her conductor to the carriage:
about the dusk of the evening they arrived at a
house of rather mean appearance, where she found
they were to repose that night. Her guard led her
to an apartment which seemed to have been pre-
pared for her reception; a delicate repast was served

up to her by: a. decent-looking woman and girl,
and the moss-trooper remained standing in a remote
part of the room.
Rosalind questioned him upon various subjects,
and gained his ready replies to them all, except that
of her own destination, from which he still assured
her she had nothing to fear, relative to her father's
fate, he declared himself ignorant. She wished to
have been left alone with her hostess ; she believed
that she might have it in her power to reveal what
þer guard withheld from her ; but this opportunity
was not given to her, for when the hour of rest ar-
rived, her conductor to her chamber was still this
man. She found it a comfortable apartment, with
a lamp burning ready for her on a table, and both
a key in the lock, and a bolt on the door, to secure
her from interruption in the night.
Still waiting respectfully at the door, the guard
inquired if she would have any objection to pursue
ing her journey at five on the following morning, or
if the hour was too early for her pleasure ? She re-
plied, that she could not have any pleasure in an
action of force, like the one she was now con-
strained by, except of accelerating, as much as pos,
şible, her journey, that she might the sooner know
her fate.
The moss-trooper bowed and retired, after telling
her that he and his companions were to occupy the
adjoining apartment, through which she had passed
to her's, and that she need entertain no fears for
her safety during the night. Of this assurance the

strangeness of her fate would not allow her to feel
certain herself ; but, apathy had for so many years
benumbed her feelings, that she was almost indiffe-
rent to the event of her captivity. She sat for some
time dwelling on her fate ; and knowing herself to
be the prisoner of the freebooter Allanrod, with
whose name she had heard her father threatened
on the evening previous to his departure from De
Mowbray Castle, she concluded that she was now
carrying to his fortress, as an hostage for an im-
mense ransom. Her thoughts dwelt also on the
circumstance of the cross which she had found on
the tomb of her mother; and what she lamented by
no means the least in her present captivity was,
that it had prevented her from visiting the chapel
at that hour when a combination of strange circum:
stances seemed to have promised her some occur-
rence of surprise or pleasure. She thought of
Gertrude, and hoped the moss-trooper had kept his
promise of sparing her, and the other females of the
castle : she thought also of her father; cruel as he
had been to her, she prayed for him, and then
laid herself down, without undressing, upon the
bed.
In a short time, her guards entered the adjoining
chamber ; but none of the riot attendant on con-
querors marked their approach--their footsteps
seemed to be lightly set, and every mark of silence
and respect observed by them towards her. The
fatigue of the day had brought on the attacks of

sleep, and reassured by the conduct of her guards,
she presently sunk into repose.
When she awoke in the morning, she heard her
guards stirring in the adjoining chamber. She
arose and looked out of the casement ; a landscape
presented itself to. her view : a few scattered cot-
tages appeared amongst the knots of trees that diver-
sified the scene, and she saw that the country she
looked upon was a spot perfectly new to her.
When her guide inquired at her chamber door if
she was ready to set out, she immediately opened
it, and came out to meet him. On entering the
carriage, she requested to be allowed to remove the
shutters from the windows, which was directly
complied with : he who had been her constant at-
tendant rode by the side of the carriage, and she
shortly heard him addressed by the name of sir
Maurice.
Their progress was much the same as it had been
on the preceding day, and their intervals for re-
freshment divided in nearly the same manner. The
country over which they journeyed had, during the
morning, offered some beautiful diversities of hill
and dale, watered by the circling streams that ran
amongst them, now glittering under the refulgence
of the sun's rays, now hidden by the clustering
forest; but they had passed, though not unnoticed,
still unenjoyed by Rosalind.
Towards evening those verdent prospects which
had hitherto decked the face of nature began gra-
dually to disappear : the herbage no longer vied in

sparkling greenness with the emerald, but brown
and withering, it appeared to conceal its meanness
beneath the wide-spreading furze and bramble,
which overran the earth : the road was now a heavy
sand, and a slow walk the only pace at which the
horses were able to drag along the carriage. Stony
cliffs bounded the road on either side, and the few
solitary trees which broke the uniformity of the
scene were all bent in one direction, and barely
clothed with a few brown and shrivelling leaves.
Rosalind remarked the change to sir Maurice, and
he replied—“ We are approaching towards the sea.”
The ocean was a sight entirely new to Rosalind,
with which she was yet acquainted only by des-
cription ; and, even in her present state of anxiety,
she felt something like pleasure at the idea of be-
holding it.—“ Shall we see it ?" she asked of her
guide.
“ It will burst upon us,” he answered, “ at the
next turn of the road."
“ Indeed!” said Rosalind“ we are not far from
it then?"
“Scarcely three miles,” was the reply.
The shades of night were now descending fast,
and when the carriage arrived at the anticipated
spot, the object from which Rosalind expected
gratification was scarcely visible even to one unac-
customed to behold it ; for in the duskiness of the
evening the horizontal line was lost, and the sea
appeared but a continuation of the clouds, ulti-
mately losing themselves amongst the cliffs.

: But as her eye roved over the scene, it fell sud-
denly upon an object on which it rested with a kind
of superstitious awe and dread: this was a building
whose towers seemed mingling with the skies, and
which, in the present twilight, she could only dis-
cover to be immense.
“ What is that ?" she asked sir Maurice, point-
ing to it with her finger.
“ Rockmount Castle,” he replied.
She had heard the name before, but could not
immediately recollect where or by whom, and echo-
ed his words.
Yes, Rockmount Castle,” he repeated, the
“ mansion of lord Rufus de Madginecourt.”
“Oh God!” exclaimed Rosalind, “ am I then'
in the power of lord Rufus ?”
“You are under his-protection, lady," returned
sir Maurice.
“Oh, why am I not rather the captive of Allan-
rod ?” continued Rosalind. . “ I should expect
more humanity from that freebooter than from lord
Rufus.”
“ It is from his savage ferocity,” answered sir
Maurice, “ that lord Rufus has rescued you."
The senses of Rosalind became bewildered, as in:
a hurried dream. The name of lord Rufus brought?
with it the remembrance of never-to-be-forgotten
horrors ; a thousand ideas crowded on her mind,
but she could dwell on none : recollection of the
past-united with it bitter regretmanticipation of
the future the most sickening terrors; she bursti
into tears, and sunk back in the carriage.

CHAPTER VIII.

To my proportion'd strength!
Milton.
The roaring of the waves dashing their milky foam
against the foot of the rocks roused Rosalind from
the trance into which she had fallen. Just suffi-
cient of the light of day was remaining to shew her
that she was on the point of entering the lofty gate-
way that led to the castle : the building itself ap-
peared equally gloomy and sublime ; the numerous
lights which were moving within it, and constant-
ly passing and repassing the high and narrow case-
ments, shewed it to be immense and dreary.
While Rosalind was lost in contemplation, the
carriage entered the castle court; the open door of
of the building presented to her sight a spacious and
lofty hall, of grey stone, thickly illumined with
lamps, which cast their reflection on various tro-
phies of highly-polished armour that were hung
upon the pillars, and formed a dazzling contrast to
the gloomy scene without, where nothing was visible
but the dusky rocks on one side, and the agitated
bosom of the ocean on the other, each sinking un-
der the veil of night.

A number of richly-clad attendants approached to
receive her; sir Maurice handed her from the car-
riage, and conducted her through the hall: they
ascended a flight of steps leading to an apartment, of
which the attendants who preceded them with lights
threw open the door ; and as Rosalind arrived at it,
sir Maurice let go her hand, and lord Rufus ad-
vanced to receive her.
Welcome, fairest, dearest lady Rosalind !" "he
cried : " the happiest moment of my life is that in
which I am enabled to afford protection to such di-
vine excellence and beauty."
He took the hand which sir Maurice had just
quitted, and led her to a seat, placing himself by
her side: the attendants retired, and they were
left alone.
My lord,” said Rosalind, addressing him in a
trembling voice, as soon as she could command the
power of utterance,'" all that passes now before
my senses appears to them as a dream. Do not,
I beseech you-do' not trifle with the feelings of a
wretched woman! tell me, I conjure you, why I
am brought hither.
“ It is my proudest boast,” returned lord Rufus,
" to explain to you the cause. You cannot, lady,
require to have it repeated to you that your father's
castle is fallen a prey to the Scottish freebooters,
commanded by the famed Allanrod–famed for his
cruelties, his oppressions, his brutal ferocity! Need
I tell you what horrors, females, young, beautiful,
and alluring, like yourself, have to expect from

such a conquest, and from such a conqueror ?
Dreadful the bare idea!--too horrible for tongue is
the relation ! Such a fate awaited you ; but Heaven,
which ever guards the innocent and deserving, by
a strange fate placed it in my power to rescue you
from the brutality that threatened you.”
Strange appeared this information to Rosalind,
and not less strange the soft accents in which lord
Rufus delivered it: but universally benevolent as
were her feelings, she could not still give credit to
the vaunted friendship of lord Rufus ; she could not
but believe that some fraud was lurking behind in
his heart.
"My lord,” she said, “ the man whom I have so
long' considered as the cause of all my misery in
life, my avowed and unfeeling persecutor, I cannot
thus easily be induced to consider as influenced to
save me by any motive but a selfish one : I cannot
therefore feel gratitude for your protection from
Allanrod, till I have proof that it is disinterested.”
*** What proof can I give to convince you that I
am your slave ?” asked De Madginecourt.
“ Convey me instantly,” returned Rosalind,
" to my sovereign ; place me under the willing
protection which she will afford me, and receive
her thanks for saving one whom I dare believe dear
to her."
Wise is your request,” returned lord Rufus, ,
and dictated by that sense and modesty which are
the ornaments of your mind.”
These words he uttered in a slow and hesitating

tone, his eyes averted from Rosalind as he spoke,
and fixed upon the floor. The expression of his
countenance was that of mingled reflection and
sorrow.
name
Without observing him, Rosalind spoke again,
-"You applaud my wish then,” she said, “ and
consent to my proceeding immediately to the court
of queen Elizabeth ?”
“ Would it were in my power to give that con-
sent !" returned lord Rufus ; but, alas ! it is not.
There is a tie--a bond, subsisting between myself
and Allanrod, which dénies me the power of allow-
ing you to pass these walls.”
“ Am I then your prisoner ?” exclaimed Rosa-
lind.
“ Oh no, no, no!” replied lord Rufus ;
not so harsh a word, I entreat you; there is no
indulgence which my power does not allow me to
shew you within this castle ; you are therefore not
its prisoner, but its queen.”
The name cannot alter the reality,” answered
Rosalind; and whatever you may call me, I shall
still feel myself a captive. You are endeavouring
to amuse me from my purpose, like a child, with
toys and promises : if
you had the power of bring-
ing me hither, why have you not equally the power
of conveying me hence ?”
“ You know not,” returned lord Rufus,
Rosalind, the strait in which I am placed--the ha-
zard I have encountered, to save you from brutality,
or you would bless the fate that has preserved you,

and ask no more than the protection you enjoy.
To disobey the commands of Allanrod would, after
what he has given up to me, in respect to yourself,
endanger my life ; nay, it would endanger the life
of one most nearly connected with your own-your
father, lady.”
“Oh, where is my father ?” exclaimed Rosalind
-“ I implore you to tell me what you know of my
father !”
“ He is, and has been long," returned lord Ru-
fus, “ a prisoner in the fortress of Allanrod : un-
successful in his sally against the freebooters, with
his vanquished men he was conveyed to their strong
hold, where he now enjoys all the comforts which
captivity can give him-and those he owes to me :
without my interposition, he had been the inhabit-
ant of a dark and loathsome dungeon, where his
necessities would have been so scantily supplied,
as merely to give a keener edge to famine."
Rosalind shuddered at the idea, and a deep sigh
escaped her lips. Lord Rufus was silent, and Ro-
salind, after a pause, spoke thus:-" It is strange,
my lord, that in some instances you should possess
the
power of turning this Allanrod from his purpo-
ses, and that in others you should appear to dread
his resentment! It seems also equally strange by
what means you should be thus well acquainted
with the proceedings of the enemy of your country,
and that you should appear so well content to live
in awe of him whom you might raise a force to quell,
serving at once your sovereign and yourself !”

?
“Oh, lady,” replied De Madginecourt, you
know not what you 'urge ; for your sake, I have
disclosed to you a tie, a union which no one but
yourself knows to exist between Allanrod and me.
Do not, I conjure you, by endeavouring to frustrate
the counsels I give you, by an attempt to act in op-
position to the conduct I mark out to you as neces-
sary, drive to perdition the man who has rescued
you from the extremity in which you stood : let it
satisfy you to be assured that your father suffers no
ill treatment, though a prisoner; and that you,
although restricted for a time to these walls, are
still their mistress. In the name of mercy, for
your own sake and mine, be guided by my advice !
none but myself can save you from Allanrod; and
Allanrod is the director of De Madginecourt’s fate.”
E" Strange, inexplicable declaration !” was on the
point of bursting from the lips of Rosalind ; but as
lord Rufus ceased speaking, he rose suddenly from
his seat, and taking her hand, led her towards a
door at the end of the apartment, which he threw
open, and discovered to her view an elegant saloon,
splendidly illuminated, in the centre of which a re-
past was spread, and at its extremity in a gallery,
appeared a number of musicians, who instantly
awakened to sound the chords of their instruments.
Lord Rufus led her to the table, and placing her at
its head, he said—“ Does this look like captivity,
lady Rosalind ?”
Rosalind knew not whether to believe him friend or
foe, and, absorbed in thought, she forbore to reply.

Her entertainer pressed her to taste the numer-
ous delicacies of which the feast was composed ;
but anxiety deprived Rosalind of all power to eat.
The minstrels sang, and their plaintive notes pro-
duced an oppression of spirits which drew the tears
into her eyes ; a sickly faintness at the same time
stole over her senses, and she could scarcely sup-
port herself upon her seat.
Lord Rufus perceived her emotion, and every
restorative was called in by him to animate her
drooping strength—but in vain ; the roses fled
from her cheeks, and she fainted in his arms.
On reviving, Rosalind found herself extended on
a bed, and several females surrounding her, one of
whom she heard say—“ Inform my lord that the
lady Rosalind recovers.”
As she moved her eyes round the chamber, she
perceived that it was of the same superb order with
the other apartments of the castle that she had al-
ready seen; the bed and hangings were of rich vel-
vet, sumptuously embroidered in gold, and loaded
with tassels and devices : the females who stood
round her were all in a similar dress, which bespoke
them attendants, and all of them young, except
one, whose appearance particularly struck her from
its singularity.
Under the burden of apparently a century of years,
she was the very essence of alacrity, and no sense
seemed defective in 'her but her eyes, which were
assisted in their function by a pair of spectacles, of
which the bows clasped down to her cheeks two

locks of perfectly white hair ; if she had more, it
was concealed by a point-lace cap, of which the
lappets hung down upon her shoulders; and this
was surmounted by a large hat of black silk, with
a conical top, that seemed to emulate the length
and erectness of a church spire : her gown was of
black silk, drawn up behind through the string of
her apron, to prevent its being an impediment to
her moving as quickly as the present occasion of
· Rosalind's illness might require: her petticoat was
of rose-coloured satin, over which hung her short
apron of lace, and from the string of this depended
an immense bunch of keys, and a pincushion: yel-
low stockings of worsted, with black clocks, and a
pair of embroidered shoes, with square toes and
high heels, completed her dress.
This good lady had, for three successive gene-
rations, been the house keeper and superintendant-
general of the economies of the castle ; she had
been brought to it when a girl, and had never stir,
red beyond the limits of Rockmount, since her first
becoming an inhabitant of it: her name was Edith,
to which the title of Dame had, for the last thirty
years, been added.
“ See, see! the sweet ladybird revives !” said
dame Edith, as Rosalind opened her eyes “ Ob,
bless her! she is as beautiful as the lady Helen,
that the siege of Troy was fought about.-Go, go
away, all of you,” she added, addressing the other
famales : “ the quieter my lady is kept, the bet-
ter, after the fatigue of travelling; so I'll put her

nurse to put you to bed, will you, my lady? I dare
say you have read that Penelope had her old nurse

Rosalind did not attend to the old dame's learn.
ing, but merely to the voice of tenderness in which
she addressed her, and replied thankfully in the
affirmative to her question, upon which the other
females retired.
“ The blessings of Heaven fall upon us !” said
Edith : “ how weak you are, sweet lady! but
you'll soon get better, now my lord has rescued you
from that brutal robber ; why, he is quite another
Nero in his cruelties, I hear.”
Silence prevailed until Rosalind was undressed,
and put into bed. Dame Edith then said "Good.
night, sweet ladybird ; may Morpheus visit you !
and should you want any thing, only call. dame
Edith, and you shall be replied to immediately from
the adjoining apartment: you sleep here, lady,
quite in security, like Semiramis in her bower, sur-
rounded by your virgins, of which I am one;" and
with these words the good dame departed, leaving
two wax tapers burning on a table.
Rosalind knew not the hour of the night, but the
eastle appeared perfectly still, and no sound met
her ear but the soft murmuring of the waves. Re-
flection for a time drove off repose from her pillow;
but dame Edith's wish at length prevailed, and she
sunk into the arms of the god of sleep.

within it she beheld sitting dame Edith, with a
large folio volume on a table before her, and her
hands clasped as in prayer.
“ Good morrow,” said Rosalind -" but I fear I
disturb you."
The dame did not reply, and Rosalind, conclu-
ding her at her devotions, walked away from the
door, and returned to the window. In a few mi-
nutes dame Edith tripped into the room." Many
pardons, my sweet lady,” she said,
" for not an.
swering your kind salutation just now: I hope you
will not take offence at me; but the first I address
in the morning is always. my Maker ; for eighty
years past, I have always said my prayers, and
read two chapters in the Bible, as regularly as the
morning came, and then I am ready to attend to
my business for the rest of the day.”
The family of the castle, Rosalind learnt, were
all risen; but the apartments appropriated to her
use were too far removed from those which were
occupied by them, for her to be disturbed by their
movements.
Rosalind's breakfast was prepared for her in an
elegant apartment, to which she passed through
two other rooms, which Edith informed her were
all set apart for her use, as were an equal number
on the other side of her chamber, for the domestics
which were appointed to attend upon her.
When her repast was removed, lord Rufus re-
quested permission to visit her. He entered the
apartment in the most respectful manner, and in-

quired, with the greatest tenderness, after her
health—informed her that the garden which she had
beheld from the window of her chamber was for her
particular use, and that a part of the ramparts,
which commanded a view of the sea, had been
prepared for her to walk upon at her pleasure. He
particularly questioned her whether every attention
had been shewn to her by dame Edith and his do-
mestics; urged her to inform him whether there
were any means by which he could add to her hap-
piness, or the tranquillity of her mind; and so
great with the interest which he appeared to take in
bestowing comfort on her, that Rosalind was half
won to feel gratitude for his kindness.
In the same respectful manner, he inquired
whether it would meet her inclination to join him at
dinner, in the castle-hall, or whether she judged it
most consonant with the delicacy of her present
situation to dine alone in her own apartment f of
which latter Rosalind made choice.
During the whole of the day, Rosalind had been
oppressed by a faintness and head ache, which the
agitation of her mind tended greatly to increase;
and in the afternoon she requested dame Edith to
lead her to the garden, hoping to gain a little re-
lief from tasting the air. The sea-breeze was serene
and refreshing, and from it alone she could derive
any enjoyment, save what the many-coloured par-
terre, studded thickly with flowers, afforded her;
for nothing could be seen from it but the sky and
the surrounding walls,

As Rosalind was returning from the garden,
through a hall in the castle, to her apartments, the
sound of boisterous mirth drew her eye, and she
beheld a youth, in an extremely rich dress, gam-
boling on a staircase, near the foot of which she
was passing, with some females, who immediately
on seeing her stifled their laugh, and fixed their
eyes upon her.
“ Who are those?” asked Rosalind of dame Edith,
when they had passed the group which had attracted
her attention.
“ Some of the foolish virgins, who do not put
oil into their lamps,” returned the dame, “wasting
their time in folly and idleness, instead of laying up
treasure for a rainy day; and that silly boy, Alwin
(or man, I suppose he calls himself now), thinks
he is a very Apollo amongst them.”
“ Is that the page Alwin ?” said Rosalind.
“Yes, my lady,” returned Edith, “it is Alwin;
and a rare job his pageship is to him, for he is as
much lord of this castle as my lord himself is."
“ Indeed !” said Rosalind; “ is he so great a
favourite with lord Rufus as that?”
“ Heaven forbid I should question my lord's
actions !” replied the dame, " but I can't think
what good qualities he finds in him to set such store
by him as he does ; 'but if he asked for gold to eat,
he'd have it of my lord. I blush to tell your lady-
ship, but those girls your saw on the stairs with him
are all kept to be his playfellows."
Rosalind was silent; she recollected the con-

versation which had passed between herself and
Gertrude some years before, on the partiality of
lord Rufus to Alwin, and believed, as she had then
done, that she was perhaps the only person who
could solve the enigma.
“ Are you not fond of reading, my lady ?” asked
the dame.“ There is a large library in the castle,
full of excellent books, which there is not above one
person in the house ever enters.”
“Lord Rufus, I suppose ?” said Rosalind.
Blessings on the heads of us! No, my lady,
not he- I don't think he has been into the library
these fifty years : the last time I saw him there was
when I carried him in my arms into it, to shew
him the illuminations in the histories of Colbrand,
the Danish champion, and strong, Guy, earl of
Warwick. I am the only reader.'
“ And you seem to remember well what you
have read,” said Rosalind, “ for I have remarked
your quoting many passages both from true and fa-
bulous history.”
I hope I am not wickedly vain,” went on the
dame, “ but I do pride myself a little on what I
have learnt by book-reading. It is now more than
eighty-seven years since I have crossed the castle-
moat, and yet I know more than any one in it,
except his lordship, saving your ladyship’s presence,
now you are here. But it is a hard thing upon me
that there is not any one soul in the castle with any
learning besides myself : if I mention the name of
an old hero amongst them, they all stare and grin;

women.
and if I talk of the gods and goddesses, they laugh
right out in my face, and call me an old Bedlamite."
Rosalind could not help laughing herself.
“ Hours, days, months, and years, as I may say,"
rejoined dame Edith, “ I have passed in that library;
for it suits my taste, my lady, far better to read in
wise books than to converse with foolish men and
Had Socrates been my husband, I had
never behaved to him as Xantippe did!!!
“ You'shall shew me the library in the morning,"
said Rosalind.
The remainder of the present evening she spent
alone ; she felt uneasy at the conviction of such
scenes of wantonness as the one she had just broken
in upon, where Alwin was the principal actor,
being too common in her present abode to excitea
comment, even in the apparently well-disposed:
dame Edith: she also reflected with horror on the
ascendancy which Alwin possessed over the man in
whose power she now was, as she accounted for it,
in her own mind, by the words which she had
overheard him atter in De Mowbray Castle. She
went to bed, and passed a sleepless night.
Towards noon, on the following day, dame Edith
reminded Rosalind of the library, and she directly
expressed a wish to visit it. A long vaulted corridor,
upon one end of which a door in the bedchamber of ,
Rosalind opened, led to the library, which was
situated at the other extremity.' Dame Edith
opened the door, and Rosalind entering beheld a
large and lofty apartment ; such parts of the

wainscot as were not hidden by shelves of books, or
almost illegible maps and charts, the hand of time
had turned nearly to a black; the windows were of
painted glass, and the dust which had gathered
upon them from neglect, lending its assistance to
the paint to keep out the rays of the days, increased
the gloomy and dismal appearance of the place.
“Your ladyship sees what a state it is in ; you
can't want to be told it is neglected,” said dame
Edith, as she followed Rosalind; “every volume is
an inch thick of dust: any that your ladyship
wishes to peruse must be brushed before you can
touch them.” - -
Rosalind opened several of the volumes, and
found, with satisfaction, that there was here some
amusement for her solitary hours. She continued
some time in the library, in conversation with
dame Edith, and when she was about to leave it,
and was turning towards a door for that purpose,
the dame said—“Not that way, my lady, you are
wrong; that is not the door we came in by—it is
on the other side of the room ; but you might ea-
sily mistake it, for the two doors are exactly alike.
That door,” continued she, after a short pause,
“leads to a set of apartments that I have not been
into for some years myself, and I believe I am the
only person that has been into them at all, since
she who inhabited theim died.”
Who was she 7” asked Rosalind, with some de-
gree of interest.
“She was, as I may say, a Venus from the

ocean,” returned dame Edith, " for she came hi-
ther by sea, and landed on the beach below the
castle ; she was the wife of my lord and master.”
“ The wife of lord Rufus !” echoed Rosalind.
Ay, my lady,” returned Edith, “for one short
year, and scarcely that : her death was sudden; a
malignant fever brought her to the grave, and I
doubt not she went to heaven, although she was
a Catholic and a Frenchwoman.
Rosalind stood wrapt in thought ; words which
she wished she had never heard returned to her me-
mory, a chill stole over her blood, and she felt sick
at heart.
“ Will you like to see her apartments ?” conti-
nued dame Edith, opening the door which led to
them.
Rosalind followed her, without speaking.
They passed through a suite of apartments, of
which the fourth was a bedchamber, and beyond
this an oratory, which commanded a view of the
sea.
Nothing has been moved,” said Edith,“ since
the sad event which so greatly affected my lord ; it
is now full twenty-three years since the death of my
lady, and still he can't bear to hear her name men-
tioned, or to see any thing that ever belonged to
her. These apartments have no communication
with the rest of the castle, and nobody ever comes
near them now."

her last illness?" asked Rosalind.

No, my lady,” replied the dame, “ I was at
that time confined to my bed with a sprain I had
received in my back, by a fall I had down stairs.
My lord himself was her principal attendant ; he
left her neither day nor night.”
Having taken a cursory view of the apartments,
Rosalind returned to her own, and shortly after dis-
missed Edith : her thoughts were too busily enga-
ged for her to need a companion, and they rested
on the information she had just gained of lord Ru-
fus being a widower. Strange, that she should
never have heard this before! that her father
should not have mentioned it to her, when he first
introduced to her lord Rufus ! still more strange, if
the circumstance had never been known to him !
Why this concealment? why this mystery with
regard to his first marriage ? Could it have been
of his wife that he had spoken on that dreadful
night, when she had overheard him in his chamber
in De Mowbray Castle ?_“ God forbid it !” she
cried, as she sunk upon her couch, and gave vent
to those tears which she could not repress, although
she could not explain why they flowed from her eyes.

On the following day lord Rufus de Madginecourt
requested to see Rosalind : her dislike to him was
- now again (strengthened by a combination of cir-
cumstances, which she could scarcely for a moment
drive from her mind; and she felt more averse than
ever to beholding him: but she considered that
however great her suspicions of his evil conduct,
still she had but suspicion to rest her opinion upon,
and that the certainty of her being in his power
taught her, for her own sake, to act towards him
with complacency; she recollected also, how often
her deceased mother, in those precepts 'which she
had been in the constant habit of giving her for the
regulation of her conduct, had enjoined her, as a
principal virtue, to act with every lenity of opinion
towards those who shewed kindness to her; and to
disregard whatever of evil the world might práttle
of them.-- Remember, my child,” she had fre-
quently repeated to her, “how many good actions

are required, in the opinion of the world, for a man
to be accounted worthy by it; and on the other
hand, how decidedly it stamps him a villain for
one single crime. The unfair judgment of the world,
it becomes the individual, whose opinion is perhaps
of more consequence to him, to rectify, and to re-
member that it is the general tenor of a man's con-
duct from which his heart should be judged, not
from a single action. The most depraved frequently
practise a single virtue in its greatest purity; the law
of universal imperfectness, which governs this sub-
lunary world, may lead one of the purest of its in-
habitants into a single crime. From no single action
should a man's worth be rated.”
She desired that he might come to her apart-
ment, and in a few moments he appeared in it..?
After the usual salutations at meeting, lord
Rufus spoke thus :-Lady Rosalind, I am suddenly
obliged to leave my castle; my absence will, I
trust, be but for a few days, but I could not quit it
without informing you in person of my departure.”
m. He had himself commanded all the attendants to
retire on his entering Rosalind's apartment ; but
once more casting his eyes around it, to be assured
they were gone, he added" I have summoned
Allanrod to a meeting; for your sake I have done
that, which no extremity of my own should have
induced me to : when we are together, it is my in-
tention to urge him for his permission to conduct
you to the protection of the queen : should he com-
ply, may I rely on your not revealing to our sove-

reign that you are privy to the subsistence of any
union between myself and the freebooter? may I
rely that you will join me in saying that fate led me
to the spot whither you had been dragged by the
lawless Scottish freebooter, after the despoiling of
your father's castle, and that fortune granted me
the triumph of rescuing you from his power
?
“ Shall I not, my lord,” asked Rosalind, bý
joining in your fabricated tale, perhaps hereafter
render myself accountable for actions in which I
may be deemed an accomplice, although I have had
no share in them?”
“ I see your fears,” answered lord Rufus, and
cannot but commend them, and the purity of your
heart, which recoils, even for its own safety, at
the idea of falsehood; but trust me, you have noth-
ing to fear of the nature which you apprehend; and
I hope that it will not be necessary for you to be-
come a party in any fallacy. I have every expecta-
tion, that at my return I shall be allowed to conduct
you to the presence of your sovereign, in a manner
that will render any inquiry on her part into my
conduct unnecessary.
Let this idea cheer your
spirits, and keep alive your happiness : my stay
will be short--with to-morrow's dawn I shall depart,
and the evening of the succeeding day will, I doubt
not, mark my return to my castle. Trust me, lady
Rosalind, that I have terms to offer the freebooter
in your behalf, which I think he will know his own
interest too well to refuse."
Lord Rufus pressed the subject of his request no

further, but immediately changed the conversation.
After he had passed some time in her apartment,
he said—“I must request you, lady Rosalind, ere
my departure, which will be with the dawn of day,
to accompany me into the hall of my castle.”
“ For what purpose, my lord ?” asked Rosalind.
“ For a mere matter of form,” answered he,
smiling, “ but one under which I shall depart hap-
pier than I else could do; and then you will live here
in more security of your own peace than you might
do without it."
He took her hand, and she suffered him to lead
her into the hall of the castle. Here she found
assembled a numerous body of attendants and vas-
sals, who appeared to be awaiting her coming : they
received lord Rufus and herself, on their entrance,
with every mark of humility and respect; and lord
Rufus, leading her into the midst of them, said-
“My friends and servants, I have convened you
here, to request that, in my absence from my cas-
tle, ye consider her whose hand mine now clasps
as your lady mistress, that ye obey her as myself,
and tend to her every duty, affection, and willing
service, which
could render to me."
The hall rang with united promises of obedience
to Rosalind, from the assembled servants and vas-
sals; and lord Rufus bowing to them his head, in
acknowledgment of their compliance with his re-
quest, re-conducted Rosalind to her apartment.
The present action of lord Rufus was not more
extraordinary to Rosalind than every other part of
ye

his conduct had been, and she remarked it in
silence. Having returned with her to her apart-
ment, he again expressed his hope that the issue of
his conference with Allanrod, concerning her,
might be such as it would be satisfactory to her to
hear, and took his leave of her with a wish for her
happiness during his absence.
How earnestly did Rosalind desire that the in-
tention which lord Rufus had expressed, of endea-
vouring to obtain the grant of Allanrod for placing
her under the protection of Elizabeth might be sin-
cere, and that good angels might smile upon its
issue ! She breathed a prayer to Heaven for its
event, and sunk upon her pillow, more composed
than she believed she could have done in the castle
of lord Rufus, since her conversation with dame
Edith in the library.
At early morn the 'sound of wind instruments
awakened Rosalind, and dame Edith, who was
also aroused by it, informed her that it was the
signal of lord Rufus de Madginecourt's departure.
The general bustle throughout the castle appeared
great, for it was the first time that any of the move-
ments of its inhabitants had reached the ears of
Rosalind. In the course of an hour the sounds
began to die away, and she beheld the cavalcade
which accompanied lord Rufus descending into a
valley on the heath, from one of the windows of an
adjoining apartment, which overlooked the country.
It was a morning of peculiar serenity, and
Rosalind, for the first time, desired dame Edith to

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
* 313
accompany her to that part of the rampart which
lord Rufus had informed her was prepared for her to
walk on.
The glassy bosom of the ocean, reflecting the
golden beams of the rising sun, and sprinkled with
the white sails of passing vessels, presented to her
a scene of novelty which called forth in her mind
emotions unknown before, and which had the hap-
py effect of silencing for a while the cares of her
aching bosom.
. After her morning repast, Rosalind repaired to
the library, which dame Edith informed her she
would find in a better state than on her former visit,
for she had ordered a couple of female servants to
brush the books, and dust the furniture.
Rosalind took a volume, and sat down with it on
one of the window-seats; dame Edith stood at some
little distance from her, with one of her favourite
authors in her hand.
Rosalind had frequently requested the good dame,
when with her, to sit without restraint, which she
had regularly refused to do ; once more Rosalind
- desired her to take a seat, and dame Edith replied-
* Since you are so good as to permit me, my lady,
I will sit down to-day, and not be ashamed of my
famaliarity either; for to-day I think I have gained
- something like a right to sit in the presence of any
one, saving your ladyship’s presence.” She placed
herself in a chair, and then continued" And that
right, my lady, is, that I am this day one hundred
years old : till that time I think it a servant's duty
to stand in the presence of their superiors ; at that
2 s

age, I think they may have an excuse for wanting
a seat, wherever they are.” -
Rosalind paid the dame some compliments on her
hundredth birthday, which proved gratifying to her
feelings; and she told Rosalind that she had a re-
quest to make of her, which was, that she would
allow her to be absent from her apartment for a few
hours in the afternoon, as she had long promised a
treat to her fellow-servants on her birthday, and
that it would hurt her to break her word to them.
Rosalind desired her to use her time as her own,
assuring her that the library was capable of affording
her sufficient amusement for that day, and many
more, should she so long continue an inmate of
Rockmount Castle.
The volume which Rosalind had first taken up
was one with the contents of which she was well
acquainted, and she shortly replaced it, desiring
to exchange it for one which she had not read be-
fore. As her eye roved along the shelves, a small
volume, which was laid across the tops of the other
books, caught her attention: she took it down,
and turning to its title page, found written on it the
following sentence, in French :—
“Let those who think their own lot the most
unfortunate, their own sufferings the most acute,
read the following pages; and learn that a still
greater wretch than themselves has existed—even
she who wrote these words.”
Rosalind turned the leaf, and on the other side
she found written—

315
“ The History of Eloise de la Valois, unlawfully
made the wife of lord Rufus de Madginecourt."
The book almost fell from her hands; curiosity
and surprise shook her every nerve: she turned
towards dame Edith, to ascertain whether she had
noticed her agitation, but her eyes were fixed on
her book.
Rosalind instantly replaced the volume on the
shelf, resolving to use the time of the dame's ab-
sence in the afternoon for its perusal, and rejoicing
that such an opportunity would be given her.
“Has your ladyship done reading ?” asked
Edith, as Rosalind walked away from the spot where
she had found the manuscript.
“ For the present I think I have,” replied
Rosalind.
“ And so have I, lady,” returned the dame :
“ when I come to a grand climax, I always close
my book, and I am at such a one now ; I have just
left Juno on her visit to Jupiter, when she was girt
with the cestus of Venus ; and there I shall leave
her, till I have made the cakes for my treat."
“ Can you read French ?” asked Rosalind.
“ Heaven forbid !” replied the dame ; " it might
only lead me into evil reading."
Rosalind was satisfied. The manuscript she had
just found was then probably a secret to all the
world but herself.

List, list, oh list!
HAMLET.
It appears almost needless to say that Rosalind
seized the first moment of dame Edith's absence in
the afternoon for returning to the library, and be-
ginning to peruse those pages which seemed to im-
plicate the real character of lord Rufus de Madgine-
court. Their contents were as follows:
“Oh, may aheart of feeling peruse the lines which
I now write! may it drop a tear of symphathy to
my sufferings ! it will be a balm to my sad spirit,
if it shall haunt the spot where my miseries were
endured.
“I am the only daughter of the marquis de la
Valois ; I lost my mother at an early age, and for
some years my father was to me the kindest of
pa-
rents, till love in my heart, and interest in his, dis-
united from me his affection.
“My father's marquisate was situated in the
neighbourhood of La Valence, and on a small ad-
joining estate lived a youth named D’Altonville;
whose slender possessions did not prevent me from
desiring that his petition to my father for my
hand
might be accepted. But, alas ! my father sternly
repulsed his suit, and bade me think of him no
more, on pain of falling under his eternal anger.

How common is it for parents to issue a command
against the thoughts of their children, without con-
sidering how impossible it is for those children to
restrict their thoughts according to their bidding !
“ After the declaration of his passion for me,
D'Altonville was refused admittance to my father's
house ;' and from the terms of intimacy on which
we had before lived, as neighbours, we now saw
each other no more; we had not even the opportu-
nity of correspondence, and I was ignorant of all
that related to my D’Altonville, except that I was
certain his sentiments with regard to me were the
same as when we had last met ; he had breathed
the most solemn vows of unceasing love, and judg-
ing of his heart by my own, I doubted not their
truth, nor was I deceived in him.
“ About six months after my father had refused
to him my hand, a stranger from England, who
brought with him a recommendation from our king
to the hospitality of my father, arrived at our castle.
This was—oh, bane of my peace! poison of my
earthly happiness! the wretch, lord Rufus de Mad-
ginecourt, within whose hated walls it is now my
only cansolation to commit to paper the events of
my wretched life ; and as I see the characters flow
from my pen, it is something like happiness to me
to know that the miseries already endured cannot
return, and that I am so much nearer the termina-
tion of a wretched existence.
" At my first introducton to lord Rufus, it was
my misfortune to please him : my person was hand-

some, and this is all he is capable of valuing in wo-
man. My father heard his sentiments of me with
unfeigned pleasure: his high rank, and great wealth
in England, were well known to him ; and he now
doubly applauded himself for having broken off my
acquaintance with the less wealthy, but more
worthy D’Altonville.
“ In less than a week after the arrival of lord
Rufus, my father informed me that he had done me
the honour of asking my hand in marriage, and
that I was destined to become his wife.
“ I fell on my knees before him, and besought
him not to sacrifice me to a man who, though al-
most a stranger to me, I was well convinced that
no length of time could induce me to love ; rather
than marry him, I entreated to be immured within
a convent's walls, where I declared myself prepared
to make a vow of retirement for ever from the
world.
“ He pretended to smile at what he called the
frenzy of a girl's disappointment in her first love,
and told me that in a few years' time I should return
him thanks for the excellent choice he had made
for me, and rejoice that the beggar D’Altonville was
not my husband. — Besides,' added he, 'your
D’Altonville is by this time probably no more, for
he has joined the naval force which our king has just
sent out against Spain, and it is rumoured that a
bloody engagement has taken place ;' and with this
humane information he left me.
“I was still on my knees, and breathing a fervent

319
prayer for the safety of him I loved ; I concluded it
with a wish that if his soul had fled from earth,
mine might be called to follow it.
“ Wretched beyond description, I continued for
two days alone in my chamber ; in the evening of
the third, my father came to me, and exerted his
parental authority to compel me to dress myself,
and join a party which I found he had invited to a
dance that night, in honour of lord Rufus.
“ Constrained to obey, I dressed myself and
went down; to my astonishment, I found that the
festivities of the night were to be held in the air, and
that the gardens were illuminated for that purpose.
I entered them : various groups of dancers in the
dresses of shepherds, shepherdesses, and other fan-
tastic characters, met my eyes; and lord Rufus, the
gayest of the festive crowd, came directly to me to
claim my hand as his own. Heart-rending congra-
tulations on my approaching marriage were poured
into my ear from every tongue.
“ The music, and various sounds of mirth which
filled the gardens, almost maddened me; and with
the first opportunity I retired into a corner, where
I burst into tears. The only individual who ob-
served my retreat was a person in the garb of an old
shepherd, whose grey hairs and grizly beard almost
concealed his countenance : I saw him pass two or
three times before the arbour where I sat ; at length
he spoke. — Eloise, do you not know me ?' he said,
It was the voice of D’Altonville.
• Good Heavens!' I exclaimed, ' are you here?"

c
Yes,' returned he; · but to-morrow I depart.
I am thankful that I have found this opportunity for
bidding you farewell. Angels guard you, and make
you blest and happy! he cried, pressing me to his
breast—' we may perhaps never meet again!'
' Are you then going to join the fleet ?' I asked,
in trembling accents.
· My destiny has reached you,' he said.
Yes,
Eloise, I cannot be happy here ; and it is immaterial
to me whither I fly to seek death, since peace in
life is denied me.'
Again he clasped me to his breast ; footsteps
approached the spot where we were standing-
• Farewell for ever!' he exclaimed, and darted
amongst the trees.
Stay, stay, I entreat you !' I cried. More I
could not utter, ere I sunk fainting to the earth :
when I revived, I found myself supported in the
hated arms of lord Rufus ; a faint shriek escaped
my lips—my father stood by me, and his presence
awed me from further expressing my sensations of
horror.
“ When the festivities of the night were over,
and I was permitted to retire to my chamber, I did
not attempt to enter my bed, but sat deliberating
with my own mind how it would be possible for me
to act, in order to prove the ' farewell for ever,' of
D’Altonville fallacious.
“On the morrow he had said he was to depart ;
the midnight hour had sounded, and that morrow
was already come-already he might be someleagues

proceeded on his journey towards the sea; a few
more hours might indeed render his parting address
prophetic; the thought was frenzy_intolerable even
in idea, and I resolved immediately to follow his
steps.
“ The point of greatest difficulty was how to es-
cape unobserved from my father's house ; disguise I
had none, nor had I any hope of procuring one where
I now was: I had no friends in the house who
would not be overawed from lending assistance to
me, by their dread of my father's resentment, if
they were discovered in it. I had, accordingly, no-
thing to depend upon but the smiles of fortune, in
suffering ine to depart undetected; and judging that
no time could be more favourable to my design
than the present, at which all the inhabitants of the
castle were wrapt in sleep, after the fatigues of the
preceding night, I lost no time in dressing myself
as plainly as my wardrobe would permit; and taking
with me nothing but a small sum of money, of which
I was possessed, I boldly sallied forth into the gar-
den, from which a private door opened upon the
high road.
“ In reaching this, fate smiled on me, and I left
my father's territories without a sigh of regret: I
lost not a moment in gaining ground on my jour-
ney, while I considered my departure as yet un-
known. I passed near the small estate which had

I judged it most prudent not to stop an instant
longer than necessary within view of it, although my

heart panted to inquire whether its master was yet
set out on his journey.
“ I knew that the fleet destined against Spain was
to sail from Toulon ; from this place my father's re-
sidence was deemed only a journey of three days ;
thus I doubted not but the energy of my mind in the
pursuit I was bent on, would support me in strength
and spirits for the time I should require them to
bear me to the spot of my destination.
“ About an hour after sunrise, I arrived at a small
town, which I judged to be five leagues from the
spot from whence I had begun my walk ; I felt my-
self already extremely weary, and still more sub-
dued with the agitation of my spirits than fatigue
of body: I dreaded to enter any house of public re-
freshment, lest I should be pursued, as such houses
would naturally be the first where I should be
sought; I therefore stopped at the door of a mean
cottage, of whose inhabitants, an old man and his
daughter, I requested a basin of milk, promising to
reward them for their kindness, if they would com-
ply with my request.
“ The daughter readily tendered me every ser-
vice in her power : the old man I found to be blind,
and this was some relief to my mind, as the old are
more suspicious, and inspire us with greater dread,
when we are acting under any deceit, than those of
our own years. In the course of my meal, I in-
formed the girl that I had a brother on board the
feet, whom I had an earnest desire once more to
stre before he should sail, and that I was for that pur-

pose travelling towards Toulon. I had been tra-
velling some time, I added, and was not only very
weary with my journey on foot, but also extremely
fearful that he might have sailed before I should
reach the place ; on both which accounts, I wished
to procure some conveyance forwards, if it were but
for a part of my journey.
“ She informed me, that if I turned aside to the
right, about a league and a half from the road I was
in, I should come into the high road from Paris to
Toulon, and that upon it I should find numerous
conveyances proceeding with the seaman to the
port of embarkation. . But surely,' added she,
* though the method is easy, it is both hazardous and
disagreeable, as you will be the only woman amongst
them, to join so large a company of men as you
will meet with.'
That,' said I, alarms me, I confess, and I wish
very much I could procure a disguise for my sex :
could you contrive to get me one, I would willingly
reward you for your trouble, and feel more grate-
ful to you than I can express.'
• There is nothing to be procured in our town,'
she replied; · if you thought you should soon be
back this way, I would, with all my heart, lend
you my brother's Sunday clothes ; he is younger
than you, and I think they would fit you.'
“ I told her, if she would accommodate me with
them, I would leave her the value of them, and my
own clothes into the bargain, as a surety of my re-
turning them.
She readily and unsuspiciously as.

sisted me to equip myself; and when I was attired,
I set forward to cross the forest which she had
-said would bring me into the high road from Paris
to Toulon.
"About noon I reached a small village ; at the
entrance into it I perceived two vehicles stand-
ing before a house, at the door of which sat some
sailors.; and from this circumstance I directly con-
cluded that it was one of the places of refreshment
for the seamen on their journey to the fleet. I ac-
costed them, and found my conjectures to be just.
Will you,' said I, have the charity to admit me
into your party? I have run away from a cruel
master, and have no resource against famine but en-
tering on board the fleet.'
They pitied me, and readily agreed to my peti-
tion. I thanked them from my heart, and directly
begged leave to get into the vehicle, where a seat
appeared to me at that moment the most enviable
treasure in the world. They brought me refresh,
ments, both of meat and drink ; but I durst not
offer to pay any part of my own expences, lest I
should draw suspicion on myself for being possess-
ed of money, after the story I had told of my un-
fortunate case
“ I inquired of them whether I should be allowed,
on my arrival at the port, to enter on board any
ship I pleased; for that a kind lady, who knew my
situation, had instructed me to make use of her
name as a recommendation to an officer on board
the fleet, of the name of D’Altonville, and that I
should like to sail in the same ship with him.

“ To this they could give me no satisfactory
answer, but said that the point would be easily
ascertained when we arrived at the port, which
would be in little more than two days.
“ Towards the evening of the second day, we
saw before us a carriage of a superior order to those
in which I and my companions were journeying,
which had broken down on the road. When we
came up to it, our driver stopped to offer assist-
ance to the passengers, and one of the first coun-
tenances which I beheld amongst those who had
alighted from it in consequence of the fracture was
-blessed chance ! D'Altonville himself!
“ This occurrence took place in the dusk of the
evening, and as I had resolved not to let myself be
recognized by D’Altonville, if I could possibly
prevent it, till the fleet should have sailed, lest he
should find means of preventing me from embark-
ing, for my safety's sake, I judged this a favour-
able opportunity for speaking to him ; I accordingly
said — Pray can any of you gentlemen inform me
where I may be likely to find an officer of the name
of D’Altonville, when I reach the port ?'
• That is my name, boy,' he instantly replied.
• Is it, sir ?' I said: 'then I hope you will be a
friend to me, and get me a situation on board your
ship.'
* On what pretensions do you ground this hope ?"
asked he who are you?'
'I am a poor boy, an orphan,' I answered, “with-
out any other means of gaining my subsistence ;

and my hope of your kindness is founded on the
promise of a good lady, who bade me address you
in her name.'
Indeed !' said he who is she?'
* The lady Eloise de la Valois,' I returned, ' who
said she was sure you would be kind to me, if I
mentioned it to you as her wish that you should
be so.'
“ He sighed, and said— Whatever she desires,
it is a happiness to me to perform—depend on my
protection.'
“ He then directed me on board what ship to
find him on my arrival at the port, and gave me a
paper signed with his name, which he told me would
prove a passport for my admission on board, should
he be absent from his ship at the time I went to
make my demand.
“My mind was now comparatively at ease, and
I dropped a silent tear of gratitude to the kindness
of my fate.
“ The carriage in which D’Altonville was jour-
neying was in a short time repaired, and then set
forward again with much greater speed than that in
which I was a passenger was able to travel ; I thus
quickly again lost sight of the only man whom the
earth possessed of value to me.
“ On our arrival at Toulon, we learnt that an un-
expected order had been received by the fleet to
leave the port ; and that twelve hours only were
allowed them for preparing to sail.
“ D’Altonville was himself on board his ship

y
when I went to it; but the hurry of the time so
much engrossed his mind, that he paid no further
attention to me than to appoint me to my station,
which was that of a cabin-boy, to serve him—a
task which I, with rapture, heard assigned to me,
on account of the frequent opportunities it would
give me of seeing him, and being near his person.
“I found that I was one more than the ship had
been intended to contain, but admitted to the num-
ber of the crew, merely on account of the fabricated
message I had delivered to its captain from her he
loved ; and on this account, as there was no ham-
mock for me, a small cot, made up in one corner of
the captain's cabin, was appointed for my sleeping-
place.
“It was about nine in the morning when I reach-
ed the port, and three of the twelve hours allowed
for preparing the fleet to sail were already elapsed:
thus about six in the evening, the whole of the French
squadron was under weigh. Throughout the day,
D'Altonville had been too busily employed in giving
instructions to his men, and receiving on board the
stores necessary for his voyage, to suffer his atten-
tion to rest for above a minute at a time upon me;
and when it did so, I always turned aside from him
my features, or managed to conceal them beneath
the face-piece of my cap; still dreading that a dis-
covery of who I was might frustrate my darling
scheme of living or dying with the man of my heart.
“With the object of our sailing I was unac-
quainted, except that the general voice informed me

it was to the annoyance of Spain ; but how or in
what manner that was intended to be effected, I
neither learnt, nor did I feel a wish to know: one
idea, and that alone, occupied my whole soul.
“ When I was informed that my attendance for
the night could be dispensed with, and that I might
retire to my cot, how fearful, yet how pleasurable,
were the feelings of my heart! Possessed I seemed
of every earthly bliss, in being the partner of my
D’Altonville's fate-blessed beyond the power of
fate to torture me, in the certain knowledge that
in one fortune the lives of us both were involved :
'but then, might not D’Altonville upbraid me for.
the excess of my love, in having so far forgotten
the softness of my sex, the effeminacy of my edu .
cation, as to have endangered my morals, my peace,
in a society so little adapted to the delicate tender-
ness in which every hour of my past life had been
nursed? might he not judge that my presence would
lead him into difficulties, involve him in situations
of hazard, which had not been known to him had
I been absent, and render him perhaps a coward in
the hour of battle, when his own natural spirit
might, without my presence, stamp him the hero
of the fight?
“ I shuddered at the idea ; the tears forced them-
selves into my eyes, and lifting my clapsed hands
to Heaven, I fervently prayed that my presence
might not prove a bane to the sight of him, for
whom, and whose love, life appeared to me of little
vahie. My fears almost subdued my spirit; a new

and inexpressible feeling rendered me alarmed at the
thought of beholding him for whom I had sacrificed
all again to see and to be near, and I resolved not
to let him know me, if it were possible to conceal
the secret from him, but to rest satisfied that I was
the witness of his fate.
“ An hourglass stood upon a table in the cabin,
and by its side burnt a lamp. By the darkness of
the night, I conjectured it to be about ten o'clock,
when I was dismissed from the deck to my cot, and
according to this calculation, the running sand pro-
nounced it near two in the morning, ere the fall of
footsteps announced the approach of D’Altonville.
“ I had only thrown myself upon my bed, with-
out undressing, and upon his coming, I turned my
face downwards, to avoid meeting his eyes, and ex-
perienced a sensation doubtless new to every bosom
but my own.
“ D’Altonville entered with a slow step : after a
momentary pause, and turning the wasting sand,
he threw his hat upon the ground, and let himself
fall upon his bed : at first I conjectured him over-
powered with the fatigues of the day, and tbought
that he had sunk hastily to sleep; but a short time
convinced me of the contrary. He turned frequently
upon the bed, clasped his hands in the wildness of
frenzy, struck them frequently upon his forehead,
and during all these actions of a disturbed mind,
he held converse with himself, and many a long-
dráwn sigh, laden with my name, escaped his lips.
My breathings probably informed him that I

was no more asleep than himself, for after a short
interval, he addressed me with What is your
name, my lad ?
'
Albert, sir,' I replied.
How long have you been known to the lady
Eloise de la Valois ?'
. Ever since I can remember myself,' I returned.
' And you esteem her ?' he went on.
And love her,' I rejoined, 'as tenderly as I do
myself.'
“ He sighed. What drives you from your home
and country ?' he inquired.
· Love,' I falteringly replied.
· Indeed!' said he ; ' you are very young, to
feel it thus acutely, and I pity you the more on ac-
count of your youth, for it is a passion which but
too often holds war with reason, and your youth
must therefore render you less able to struggle
against its attacks. I well know myself what is the
'
* And is your love, sir,' asked E-pardon the
question-at variance with reason ?'
• You cannot ask that question seriously, I am
sure,' he replied ; as you have known Eloise from
her infancy, you cannot but know the mutural at-
tachment which long has, and I trust, ever will sub-
sist between us ; and you cannot but know also,
that it was founded on every pretension that can
render love worthy of applause.'
“ He turned hastily on his bed, as he pronounced
these words, and the emotions of his soul were too
power of love.

.
audible to admit a doubt of his sufferings. A long
silence ensued: I durst not venture to break it. At
last he spoke.— I have,' he said, ' prepared my
mind to meet death in the engagement which we
· have daily to expect ; and all the anxiety I now feel
proceeds from my fear that the apathy with which
disappointment oppresses my soul will make me
appear a coward in the fight. Oh that it were pos-
sible that the countenance of my Eloise could shine
upon me at that moment ! her smile would arouse
in my mind the sensations of a hero, and I should
then die a death of glory and honour, becoming the
man who had sought and possessed her love.'
- This was an exclamation not to be passed over.
- Oh, D’Altonville !' I cried, be blest in the ac-
complishment of your wish--the countenance of
your Eloise shall shine upon you in the battle's heat ;
her smile shall be the excitement of your heroism;
her form shall be your shield against death, and her
prayers preserve you for a life of glory and honour !'
“ I had pronounced these words in my own na-
tural voice, without the disguise under which I had
concealed its real tones, whilst I had desired to re-
main unknown to him ; and starting wildly up, he
exclaimed — Almighty God! do you mock me, or
is it-is it indeed my Eloise who speaks ?'
• It is, indeed, she who now addresses you,' I
said, in reply. What reception will she meet for
her temerity in following your fortunes ?"
“ He sunk on his knees before me, and pressing
my hand to his lips-- Exalted paragon of thy sex's

constancy and truth,' he exclaimed, 'what reward
what recompence, can one honoured like myself
dare to offer in return for such heroism of affection ?
My hand, my heart are all I have to offer : long
have those been your own ; and witness for me,
Heaven, while yet I kneel in adoration of your
constancy, that none but yourself, either in your
life or death, shall ever possess them.'
“ Oh what an hour of bliss was this ! too exqui-
site to be permanent, and so richly laden with hap-
piness as to be the certain forerunner of misery as
acute. It was one of the last happy moments I
was doomed to enjoy on earth ; in heaven it may
yet be reserved for me, as my recompense for all
the woes that have been heaped upon my unoffend-
ing head, again to meet my D’Altonville in scenes
of purer bliss in scenes where the tempestuous
passions of the heart have no influence, and the
more refined feelings of the mind yield happiness
in its state of utmost purity.
" A short interval of silence restored a calm to
the feelings of D’Altonville, and he then began to
express his dread of the perils to which I had
exposed myself, in becoming the partner of his
voyage.
“ After the confession I had already made of my
heart, and the steps I had taken, any concealment
would have been folly: I therefore assured him, and
I spoke the truth, that in his presence I could brave
any danger which I might be fated to encounter;
and told him that the only thing which could render

333
me otherwise than satisfied with my present situa-
tion, would be to see him unhappy in his fears on
my account.
“ He received my acknowledgment with the
utmost delicacy as well as gratitude ; he instantly
insisted on giving up to me the cabin appropriated
for his own use; assuring me that he could easily
procure a bed in another part of the ship; and with
this assurance he directly left me, saying that I
must greatly require rest, after the fatigue of body
and mind I had been undergoing for the last few
days ; and having directed me how to fasten myself
within the cabin, where he told me I might lie down
to repose with the utmost security of no interruption
being offered me, he retired.
“ His conjectures were just, for my strength
was greatly exhausted by my journey; and notwith-
standing the novelty of my situation, I soon closed
my eyes in sleep.
“ The two succeeding days I passed entirely in
D’Altonville's cabin, in a calmness of mind to which
I had long been a stranger : he visited me at such
intervals as his presence on deck could be dispensed
with ; and the delicate conduct which he observed
towards me rendered me more than ever convinced
that he merited from me the step I had taken for
his happiness and my own.
“ On the evening of the third day intelligence
was brought by à frigate which had been sailing
somewhat in advance of the ship we were on board
of, that the enemy's fleet was bearing down upon us.

;
“ D’Altonville brought me information of these
tidings; he besought me to keep my spirits as calm
as possible during the scene I was constrained to
pass through, and conveyed me to a part of the ship
beneath the surface of the water, where, almost in
total darkness, the sounds of hurried preparations
over my head, and on each side of me, distinctly
reached me.
“ One hasty embrace was all that his call to duty
allowed him.-' The God of battles shield thee, my
D'Altonville !' I exclaimed, and he disappeared
from my sight.
" In less than an hour the cannon began to send
forth their dreadful thunder. How terrible were
the sounds ! Each explosion my hurried imagination
fancied might have borne with it the fiat of D’Alton-
ville's existence. My fears worked on my senses,
till every nerve became fixed in dread, and my brain
swam in a chaos of sensations which almost mad-
dened me. My senses were recalled to their func-
tions by the shrieks and groans of the wounded,
who were bringing down from the scene of action
into a part of the ship which was only divided by a
slight partition from the spot where I was placed.
Unspeakable were the horrors which assailed
my ears--dreadful were the groans of the dying !
still more piteous were the shrieks of those whose
wounds compelled them to seek the preservation of
life from the amputating knife of the surgeon.
“ The thunder of war still roared with unabated
violence, and to complete the sum of my terrors,

the flickering lamp which had hitherto afforded me
the slender consolation of light, in my awful soli-
tude, now died away in its socket; and by leaving
me the exercise of only one sense, rendered me
more capable of distinguishing all the wretched
sounds that were passing around me.
“ About nine in the evening, as nearly as I could
guess the hour, the cannon suddenly ceased to roar,
and in a few minutes D’Altonville appeared, to con-
duct me from my confinement. Thank God, he
lives!' I exclaimed, “I am blessed !' Little did I
foresee, at the moment of this exclamation, how
short might yet be the life of him I adored ! little
did I suspect that the darkness of the evening had
put a stop to the engagement, and that it was to be
renewed with fresh vigour at the break of the suc-
ceeding day!
“ I know not whether the moments of suspense
which intervened between this hour and the morn-
ing were not more dreadful than those of the actual
fight.
“ D'Altonville was slightly wounded in the arm,
but his mental anxiety for the event of the contest
rendered him almost insensible to bodily pain ; his
spirits wanted both refreshment and strength. I
pressed him to eat, prepared for him an invigorating
beverage; and after I had induced him to swallow
it, I urged him to seek the repose of a few hours'
sleep. Nature was greatly exhausted in him ; he
sunk at my feet, and let his head fall into my lap;
his slumbers never lasted above five minutes toge-

ther, and then they were broken by starts and in-
voluntary exclamations to his crew.
“At length the twilight began to penetrate through
the windows of the cabin, and the dreadful signal-
gun for all to meet on deck was fired. D’Altonville
again led me to my retreat from danger : in our way
thither, I ventured to inquire of him whether he be-
lieved the French would gain the victory? He did
believe it, he answered me. - The hand of God be
stretched out to them !' I cried.
“ As he closed the door upon me, I sunk, ex-
hausted by the violent emotions of my mind, upon
the ground, and anticipating a repetition of the
horrors which had before assailed me on this spot.
Had my senses been awake to any idea but the
danger of him I loved, I might justly have apostro-
phized to the all-powerfulness of love, which had
driven me to the present crisis of my fate.
Yet, oh reader of this my fate, whoever thou
art, if thy gentle nature already bleeds for
my
suf-
ferings, already leads thee to exclaim— Is she thus
punished for Aying a cruel father and a hated lover,
for the arms of him whom reason and whom
every
virtuous principle taught her to adore ?'-oh, do
thou read no further of my wretched story! What
I have yet to relate of my destiny will sink what I
have already unfolded to thee in the scale of com-
parison, till thou wilt forget that these were suffer-
ings at all. I warn thee, and proceed-Yet grant me
one word more of digression ; nor, as thou readest
it, judge that a wretch like me can advance aught

333
from vanity—oh no! all the unhappy speak is
truth : affliction wears out all the subtlety of hu-
man nature, and leaves the feelings too much
weakened for the practice of hypocrisy. Believe
then, that amidst the many sufferings of my life I
have never yet doubted the justice of the God
who permitted their infliction that I have never
ceased to doubt that some future recompence will
await my many trials--that the veil, which at pre-
sent separates me from penetrating the wisdom of
their infliction, will, at some future day, be with-
drawn from my eyes, and that I shall then bless the
cause to which I now bend. True it is, that I have
wept over my sorrows; it is allowed a woman's pri-
vilege, and it is a relief no sufferer need blush at;
it is a balm with which sorrow sooths itself, by na-
ture's law, by which Providence unburdens the
heart of grief, when man would choke it with a load
of agony, to swell and break it.
Again the struggle of the war raged with its
bloodiest fury, and the dreadful sounds which
pierced my ears exceeded even those of the fore-
going evening; every moment I believed too much
laden with horror for the next to equal it in the
power of communicating terror to the senses, but
each outweighed the last in shrieks, confusion, and
thunder.
“ Thus elapsed three hours, at the expiration of
which sounds of a different nature succeeded to
those I had before heard : running to and fro upon
the deck, and a confusion of French and Spanish

voices, were all that I could now distinguish, for
the cannon had for some minutes ceased to fill
the air with their vibrations.
“The intelligence of our fate soon reached me;
the Spaniards were victorious, and we were boarded
by the crew of an enemy's ship, who were come to
take possession of our vessel, and to secure us their
prisoners. With all possible expedition, we were
conveyed from our own ship into theirs ; our own
had been much injured in the action, beyond the
power of preventing her from sinking; and the ut-
most celerity was necessary to save the crew from
going down with her.
“ The Spanish vessel on board of which we were
taken was a first-rate ship of war; but the damage
she had received in the engagement was so consi-
derable as to render her wholly incompetent to sail-
ing at an equal rate with the rest of the victorious
fleet-indeed she could scarcely sail at all; only one
of her masts was left standing, and the small quan-
tity of canvas this was capable of bearing rendered
her progress scarcely perceptible.
“ The captain of the Spanish ship we found to
be a man of a humane and friendly disposition, who
did not wish to make his prisoners feel the rigours
of captivity, while he had it in his power to lighten
to them the misery of their fate. D’Altonville and
myself were kindly invited by him to his cabin and
table: he looked upon me with surprise : the unu-
sualness of a female in a situation similar to mine
made hiin inquisitive on the singularity of the ad-

venture ; and D’Altonville, believing him a man of
honour, entrusted to him the secret of my case.
“ He was the man of honour which my lover be-
lieved him, and his kindness to us was redoubled as
he became acquainted with the peculiarity of our
fortunes.
“ The shattered situation of our ship rendered
her extremely unruly, and we were tossed about
for several days on the ocean, without making any
advance of consequence towards the Spanish port.
The captain said he conjectured that his admiral
must have concluded his ship to have sunk, by the
distant situation which her disabled state had oblig-
ed her to maintain from the rest of the fleet, or he
undoubtedly would have sent a frigate to her as-
sistance.
We were five days at sea in the situation I have
just described, and the captain entertained hopes of
making the desired port in two days more, when a
vessel was descried bearing down upon us, which
proved to be an Algerine corsair : the alarm occa-
sioned by this sight was immediately conveyed to
every individual on board, and with one emotion,
we all ran upon deck. When the Algerine was ar-
rived within gunshot of our ship, she fired upon us :
we directly struck our colours, which was an act of
necessity on the part of our captain, as he had not a
single charge of powder left; his whole stock having
been exhausted in the fatal engagement which had
made us his prisoners.
“ The Algerines now sailed boldly up, and im-

I fancied their appearance
more horrid than that of any men I had yet beheld,
and my heart sunk within me.
If such were my
feelings at the bare sight of these new directors of
the unhappy fate of D’Altonville and myself, what
must they have been when I saw him, in common
with all his fellow-captives, French and Spanish
(for the conquerors of the last hour were now sunk
to an equality with the vanquished), loaded with
chains, and secured from rescuing the vessel from
the hands of her new possessors. I alone, on ac-
count of my sex, was spared the galling chain, and
conveyed to a separate cabin, where my savage
keepers confined me far
my
D’Alton-
ville, heedless of my tears, my shrieks, my prayers,
to breathe my last sigh in the arms of my beloved.
My strength was at that moment so dreadfully ex-
hausted, that I believed the last hour of my exis-
tence to be fast approaching ; but I lived to expe-
rience how capable was my nature of sustaining still
greater struggles with misfortune.
" The terrific ideas which I had formed of the
treatment I should be doomed to undergo from
the Algerines was, happily, not verified; they
behaved towards me with kindness, placed before
me luxuries both of wine and viands, at which my
sick heart palled ; and what was infinitely more
acceptable to me, as I was not permitted to see my
D'Altonville, they left me almost continually to

which my imagination had been harrowed up with
the miseries which it had pictured to me that both
my D’Altonville and myself would be doomed to
encounter, we arrived at Algiers.
“ On our landing, I saw not my D’Altonville,
except that I perceived a vast number of captives
leading along the shore, and conjectured him to be
one amongst them. Every care and attention was
shewn to me on my leaving the vessel ; and I was
conducted to a magnificent palace, which I under-
stood to be a seraglio belonging to the dey, and that
I was a present to him from the captain of the
corsair.
Wretched, it may easily be conceived, was my
fate : I sat, heartbroken, in the midst of splendour,
and regarded the costly habiliments which were put
upon my person as tacit mockers of the misery I
was enduring. The females with whom I had in-
tercourse expressed surprise that I did not rejoice at
the honour, as they called it, which had fallen upon
me : most of them had, I found, been educated in
ideas favourable to the easy mode of providing for
their daughters, which their parents had taken ad-
vantage of, in placing them under the roof of the
dey ; and they could not be brought to comprehend
the feelings of one whose affections were placed on
an object to whom any sensation but that of
gran-
deur had led her heart, and appeared wholly unac-
quainted with the criminality which I dreaded every
hour to be forced into.
“ Earnestly did I wish to see the dey. I thought

it possible that my grief might penetrate his heart,
and that he might, at least, for my sakė, ameliorate
the fate of D’Altonville, if he would not spare me
the hated honour of his favour; and I expressed
my wish to obtain an interview with him.
“ This desire my female associates construed into
my eagerness for an opportunity of trying the effect
of my charms on him; and stung by envy and jea-
lousy, the only passions of which their minds ap-
peared to be capable, they told me that I might lay
aside my hopes, for that the dey had for two years
been constant to a beautifulslave, whom he yet pas-
sionately loved; and that, if he were to forsake her,
they believed that many in the seraglio had claims
on his heart, that would, for as many years longer
at least, keep it from feeling that power of which I
seemed to believe my person possessed.
“ I heard theirreply in silence : it would have been
impossible to have convinced them that for my-
self I considered their information the happiest that
ever fell from tongue. For D’Altonville's sake, I
still secretly wished that I could have seen the dey,
although I felt, at the same moment, persuaded that
any interference of mine would be without avail.
Alas! what could my insignificant voice have effect-
ed with him? He was, doubtless, too happy himself
to have leisure for the cries of grief to enter his
soul; perhaps too fearful of the power of his tran-
sient joys to continue their charm over his senses, to
hazard the listening to any sound that might whis-
per to his heart—' Canst thou laugh alone, when all

who make thee blest are weeping around thee?'
“How many exist, who dare not look into the
causes of their pleasure, and who possess the power
of swelling their joy into heavenly ecstacy, would
they but assume the courage to investigate its
source, and to resolve that the rose which per-
fumes their senses with delight should pierce no
other hearts with its cancerous thorn!
“ Not the slightest intelligence could I gain of
D’Altonville, either from my female companions
or the eunuchs who attended on me; and I could
not even gather from their replies to my inquiries,
whether they were ignorant of him and his fate,
or concealed their knowledge from me ; it was most
probable, I judged, that they were wholly unac-
quainted with his name.
“I must now pursue the story of D’Altonville,
rather than my own, as it more fully explains the
progress of our fate during our captivity in Algiers.
“ D’Altonville and his fellow-captives, on being
taken out of the ship, were led, chained in pairs,
to a large square in the city, where a public market
for slaves was held : himself, the Spanish captain,
and six others, were bought by the superintendant
of the dey’s gardens, and appointed to work in
those which ran under the northern side of the se-
raglio. Within these walls, D’Altonville had found
means of learning that I was held a captive, though
all access to me, even by message or letter, was
denied him; and it was some slight alleviation of
the hardships of his toil, that he beheld the roof

which sheltered me: my apartments were on the
opposite side of the building to that which over-
looked the gardens he was employed in ; but of this
he was ignorant; and often did he incur the
anger
of the taskmaster, for desisting from his labour, to
fix his eyes on the lattices of the seraglio, in the
yain hope of seeing me appear at one of them.
“One day, nearly three months after the com-
mencement of his captivity, as he was reclined, at
noontide, by the foot of a tree, beneath the boughs
of which he sought shelter from the meridian rays
of a powerful sun, his frame being equally exhausted
by mental and bodily fatigue, a shrill whistle, which
seemed to issue from one of the windows of the se-
raglio, drew his attention ; and as he raised his eyes
to the spot from whence he believed it to proceed,
a small white parcel, which he perceived flying
through the air with great velocity, caught his
eyes : it fell near his feet; he picked it up, and
found it superscribed — For the French slave.'
“He opened it: it contained a jewel of value,
set in a ring. On the paper were these words :-
• By your voice, which I accidentally
overheard, I find you are my countryman. I am

• Farewell! Believe me one sincere in her pro-
fessions.'
Having twice perused this extraordinary note, he
shewed it to his friend, the Spanish captain (for
captivity had firmly bound them in the ties of amity),
and asked of him his opinion how he should act
under it. His friend recommended him, by all
means to comply with the invitation contained in
it: his situation, he remarked, could not be worse
than it at present was ; and on this consideration,
as in the case of a drowning man who seizes at a
rush for support, he would be wrong not to place

revenge the slight shewn her in neglecting to keep
her appointment, and that it was undoubtedly
better to risk the termination of the adventure,
than to incur an equal hazard, without having
sought the opportunity of receiving a benefit.
“Overruled by the arguments of his friend, D’Al-
tonville resolved to be in the arbour at the appoint-
ed time. The walls of the garden were too high
for the idea of effecting an escape over them to be
for a moment entertained by any of the slaves;

" The path' was strait and long, and at its ex-
tremity he presently discerned a moving body,
which, on its nearer approach, he discovered to
be one of the mutes of the seraglio. He entered
the arbour, and signifying to D'Altonville that he
was the person he was in quest of, hé untied a
bundle, containing a suit of apparel similar to that
worn by himself, and directed D'Altonville to strip
off his own garments, and put on those he had
brought him. D’Altonville had proceeded too far
in the adventure not to pursue it boldly, thus eas-
ily complied with the instructions of the mute,
who hid D'Altonville's clothes under a bush on one
side of the arbour, and then beckoned to him to
follow him.
Oh that it were to my Eloise,' mentally exclaim-
ed D’Altonville, ' that thou wert about to conduct
me! May the God of mercy, who directs the fin-
ger of fate, grant that my present compliance may
place in my power the means of rescuing her from
the oppression she now groans under !' and with
this silent prayer he followed the steps of the slave.
“ His conductor traversed an angle of the garden,
and arriving at a small doorin the wallof theseraglio,
he entered it, and invited D’Altonville to do the same.
They passed on through a long passage, which
led to the foot of a handsome staircase ; this they
ascended, and entered a gallery of lofty dimensions
and rich workmanship : at a door on one side of
this gallery the mute stopped-D’Altonville did the
same. The mute motioned to him to make no

noise-D’Altonville obeyed. The mute hit the
door twice with his knuckles, in a manner that
gave bis action the appearance of a signal agreed
upon between him and some person within the
apartment : the lock was immediately heard to move
in its wards, the mute pushed open the door, and
by his signs directed D'Altonville to enter. He did
so, and the mute following him in, closed the door,
and pointing to him to pass through an arch to the
right, disappeared hastily himself through another
which corresponded with it on the left.
* " D’Altonville proceeded according to his instruc-
tions; and penetrating the arch which had been
pointed out to him, he perceived a beautiful female
reclining on a couch, amidst all the voluptuousness
which an eastern monarch's favourite could com-
mand, and with a smile of countenance happy as
the most satisfied votary of pleasure could be dress
ed in.
w The fair form which D’Altonville now for the
first time bebeld was named Clotilda ; she was the
natural daughter of a French nobleman, and baving
been left, by the death of her father, dependent on
an uncle of a dissolute and mercenary disposition,
had been sold by him to the providers of beauty for
the seraglio of the dey. Born of a woman whose
immorality had raised her to the only notice and
consequence which she had ever obtained in the
world, Clotilda had inherited, both by birth and
precept, ideas which had rendered her a fit inmate
for the walls she now resided in; and her arts

345
and beauty combined had gained her so great an
ascendancy over her master and lover, the dey,
that no woman had ever been known to sway his
inclinations in the manner she possessed the power
of doing. Clotilda was, in fact, the female whom
my companions had informed me had for the two
last years fixed the heart of the dey solely on
herself.,
" The pride of Clotilda was indeed gratified by
the chains in which she alone held him for whom all
hearts panted; but her passions had no share in the
gratification, for the dey was a man whose person
she disliked ; and to repay herself for this sufferance
the spirit of intrigue with which she was born was
continually mounting, in some varied form, to her
brain.
Many plans she had already formed for allying
to herself a favourite, but she had not yet ventured
to put any one of them into execution-perhaps as
much because she dreaded a discovery depriving her
of that ascendancy she now possessed over the dey,
as that her attachments were of an unstable nature,
and that she felt a difficulty in deciding on whom to
select.
“ Slaves were all the males whom it was possible
for her to see ; but the condition of those amongst
whom her choice must unavoidably fall did not
weaken her inclination to sin. Those who give
themselves up to the practice of deliberate crimi-
nality, it is remarked, are seldom nice in the ob.
jects of their selection-a proof of the unworthi-

ness of that indulgence which sinks the use of every
rational sense in its gratification.
« On D'Altonville then fell the destiny of her
smiles : her ascendancy over the slaves that at-
tended on her person was too great to cause her
long to wish an interview, and wish in vain : she
watched the first absence of the dey from his palace,
and having given D’Altonville the intimation of her.
favourable intentions towards him, in the note which
I have already given a copy of, and in which she
placed the jewel it contained, more to give it suf-
ficient weight to ensure its reaching the spot where
he lay than from any other motive, she instructed
the mute who conducted him to her apartment from
the appointed arbour in the part he had to perform
in the business-a failure in which the poor tacit
instrument of her plan well knew would cost him
his life.
“ The moment Clotilda perceived D’Altenville in
her apartment, she ran forward to meet and wel.
come him ; and taking both his hands in her's, she
led lim to the couch, and placed him upon it. -
Welcome, my countryman !' she said,
both slaves, and must endeavour to soften to each
other our lot : the toils you suffer are imposed on
your bodily strength-mine on my heart'; I am the
tool of pleasure to a man I hate.'
“ And you wish, doubtless, to fly from your
galling captivity?' replied D'Altonville.
· Alas!
your wish, I fear, is vain; these walls are imper's
vious.'

" You mistake me,' returned Clotilda ; ! I do
not wish to fly them, but to insure myself happiness
within them. Every wish of my heart has here
been long gratified, except one: I cannot love the
dey; all I desire, in addition to the luxuries he
heaps on me, is a heart, not which I can call myi
own, for such is the dey’s but a heart to which I
can feel satisfied in giving mine; such a one,
countryman, I regard your's to be.'
You are flattering in your selection,' returned
D’Altonville,' and your frankness demands justice
on my part; I have no heart to receive your's in.?
Perhaps you are married ?' she said.
No, I am not,' he answered.
· Or intend to be so ? she asked.
' I hope the blissful moment, although protract-
ed, will one day arrive,' exclaimed D'Altonville.
' And is the anticipation of that blissful moment,'
returned Clotilda, “ to interdict to you every hap-
piness till it arrives ?'
* The anticipation of it,' answered D'Altonville,
grants me every happiness of which the interval
is capable: without that happy period for my
thoughts to dwell upon, life would be a blank, cap-
tivity and labour insupportable miseries; but that
idea cheers the void with many prospects of de-
light, and wrests from toil and bondage half their
power to gall my spirits under them.'
"And is the bliss of idea so great, that you mock
all substantial pleasure, when it presents itself to
your acceptance ?' asked Clotilda

That,' returned D’Altonville, is alone substàn-
tial which will give a second pleasure on reflection;
while a retrospect capable of calling a blush, though
even a secret one, into the cheek, must curtail the
enjoyment of that felicity towards which I hope to
be advancing through my present pilgrimage.'
“ Clotilda burst into a satirical laugh at the reso-
lute calmness with which my D’Altonville uttered
these sentiments; her mind could not comprehend
their delicacy, and her heart spurned their tendency.
“ D’Altonville remained unmoved by her re-
proofs.
" It is but too often that a sneer can subdue a
virtuous inclination, and that a jest can damp the
fervour of a religious intention; but the principles
and affection of D’Altonville were both too firmly
grounded to be shaken by the breath of fleeting
pleasure, and rising from his seat he said — If the
friendship or the advice of D’Altonville can be ser:
viceable to you, you may command them. As one
sunk in criminality, I pity you, and feel it my duty
to offer you such admonitions as I think
may
reclaim
you
from that part of the immorality of your con-
duct into which you voluntarily plunge yourself: if
you will resolve to listen to me, I shall never judge
my time ill spent in giving you my society. Suffer
me now to depart: reflect on what I have already
said, and if you determine to profit by my future
visits, send for me again ; you will find me ready
to comply with your invitation-but on no other
terms let me hear of you more.

Disappointment was the only passion which
at that moment swayed the breast of the lost
Clotilda ; her breathings were almost choked by
the repression of the intreaties which she could
scarcely smother, and which wounded pride yet
restrained her from uttering. D’Altonville had
moved to the door by which he had entered, and
now demanded to be reconducted to the garden.
Clotilda sprang towards him ; she seized his hand,
and endeavoured to carry it to her lips. D’Alton- .
ville drew it resolutely back, and placed his fingers
on the lock of the door.
“ Personal danger stared her in the face, when
she perceived him attempting to rush out alone into
the gallery, as he might mistake his way, and a
discovery of her wantonness be immediately convey-
ed to the dey. She struck the ground with her
foot, and the mute appeared to attend him.
· For the love of Heaven, stay yet one moment!'
she exclaimed.
· For the love of honour, no! replied D’Al-
tonville, and rushed out of the apartment.
“ On arriving at the arbour, the mute assisted
him in taking off his disguise, and dressing him
again in his own clothes; and this done, he left him,
“ D’Altonville directly repaired to his hut, where
he communicated to his friend, the Spanish captain,
the issue of his adventure; they agreed that he had
nothing to fear from the revenge of Clotilda, as she
had shewn herself a coward of any discovery by
immediately allowing him to depart from her apart-

ment, on his demanding to leave it ; and D'Al-
tonville slept peacefully that night in the conscious-
ness of having acted rightly.
“ Ten days passed on with D’Altonville unmark-
ed by any occurrence ; on the eleventh he was in-
formed by the superintendant of the gardens, that
himself, and some others of the slaves, were to be
sent on the following morning, to a spot at the
distance of about three hours' journey from the
grand seraglio, where the dey had lately crected a
light elegant building, to which his favourite mis-
tress was sometimes permitted to retire; and that
she who now possessed his favour had obtained
leave of him to carry thither a certain number of
gardeners, to decorate the ground contained within
its walls more fancifully than it now was.
« D'Altonville knew not that Clotilda was the
sole regent of the dey's heart, and little imagined,
when he received the superintendant's information,
that it was into her service he was going.
“ The discovery was very quickly made to him :
the day after his arrival at the villa, as he was dig-
ging the earth, by the order of the superintendant,
in a part of the garden remote from the other slaves,
he heard a voice address him in the language of
his own country, and on turning round his head
perceived by his side Clotilda, attended only by
two mutes, who stood at some distance from her.
* You perceive,' said she, “that though I excited
only your scorn at our former interview, I cannot
forbear renewing our acquaintance.'

· I hope,' replied D'Altonville,' that you are
convinced of the value of those admonitions which
I gave you, and are come prepared to reap a further
benefit from my tongue.'
Foolish man l’ she went on,' to slight my
favour, the only alleviation of your captivity which
you can expect or hope for ! Ungrateful man! to
permit a woman to suffer for your sake, who descends
from her own sphere, and humbles. herself by
intreaties to a slave for his smiles! You have not
even complaisance enough to desist from your
labour whilst I am speaking to you.'
“ In so doing,' answered D’Altonville, I should
only incur the displeasure of the superintendant
of the gardens to listen to that which I had rather
not hear.'
Camazin, the superintendant of the gardens,'
replied she, is my friend ; you have nothing to
fear from him, although every hour we remain here
were passed by you without labour: I have acquaint-
ed him with my passion for you, and bribed him to
leave
you always apart from the other slaves.'
Then if this Camazin ever receives the wages
of the dey again, he is a villain, and it is fit he
should be disgraced,' exclaimed D’Altonville.
* Folly !' cried she. "He who knows not of his
wrongs does not suffer by them; thus you ought
to think of your mistress, and we should then both
be blessed.'
* Impossible!' answered D'Altonville ; "he who
acts wrongly cannot be happy under the reflection,

although he to whom the wrong is done be uncon-
scious of its existence.'
'You are a coward,' she returned, 'who have
nothing to lose ; I have risked every thing for my
love to you: should the dey discover the motive of
my visit to this spot, which was undertaken solely
that I might here enjoy your conversation without
interruption, I should be undone for ever. The
dey is employed in affairs of state, which I under-
stand must confine him to the city : do not then
cast the gloom of disappointment upon the few
days of happiness which I have promised myself
with
you
in this seclusion.'
• If for me the journey was undertaken,' replied
D'Altonville, let me entreat you instantly to return
to the city, as your remaining here will but provoke
your indignation and my contempt.'
“ The same arguments were continued for some
time to be repeated on either side, without their
making any impression on the object to whom they
were directed ; and with the evening D’Altonville
saw no more of the infatuated Clotilda.
“ In the morning he encountered Camazin.-
· Having seen me only in the habit of a slave,' said
D’Altonville, addressing him, you probably con-
ceive my mind as abject as my situation ; you know
not the heart that animates this breast, or you
would not have brought me hither to expose me to
the licentious passion of Clotilda: words are the
only means which captivity does not deprive me of
for asserting that my nature is not of the mean tex-

353
ture you gave it credit for being in acceding to ber
infamous plan, or words should not be the means
I would employ to tell you so.'
“Instead of the haughty reply which D’Altonville
awaited from the powerful Camazin, something like
an hair of humility overspread his features, and he
said — I have a large family, and Clotilda has been
my benefactress.'
• But you owe your first obligations to the dey,'
pronounced D’Altonville, 'from whom you derive
your regular employment; believe me that your
family will prosper better under the honesty than
the craft of their father.'
“ Camazin muttered something like an apology,
and sluñk off to a different part of the garden.
“ For several successive days Clotilda continued
to haunt D’Altonville, and to repeat to him those
arguments in favour of her passion by which he had
resolved not to be moved : he continued uniform in
treating her with indifference and contempt, except
at those moments when he endeavoured, by the
effect of reasoning, to open her eyes to the atrocity
of her conduct ; but every method proved inade-
quate to the subduing of the passion which de-
voured her soul.
During this tiine Camazin was not met by
him.
“ At length a day arrived on which he saw not
the favourite of the dey, and he began to entertain
a hope that her ill-founded passion was beginning to
evaporate before the influence of returning reason;

but in the evening, about the hour of twilight, a
paper was brought to him, which contained these
words :- Clotilda desires to see you in her apart-
ment."
“ He tore the paper into atoms, and scattered
them into the air, as a signal to the mute who had
brought it, that he did not intend to comply with
the request contained in it.
“ The mute beckoned to him to come; but
with a frown of indignation on his brow he turn-
ed from him, and moved along in an opposite
direction. The mute immediately slapped the
palms of his hands together, and several of his
fellows, darted out from behind a bush, who
caught hold of D’Altonville, and confining his
arms, dragged him forcibly towards the building
inhabited by Clotilda.
They led him into an apartment, which Clo-
tilda was traversing with a hasty step, and the
wildest emotion painted on her countenance: she
stopped, and faced him as he entered, her full
dark eyes resting on his, and describing the war
of love and anger which was raging in her soul.
Why this outrage against my person ?' asked
D’Altonville, calmly why am I brought
hither ?
Because, inhuman man !' returned Clotilda.
-the lost, the shameless Clotilda, I cannot
live without you I cannot exist under your con-
tempt, and for the last time I entreat you to be-
come the partner of my joys.'
· For the last time, then,' replied D’Altonville,

take my answer to your importunities. No
earthly power can shake my resolution. I know
my duty to an absent being, who merits every
consideration I can pay to her : and knowing my
duty, I perform it. Once more, be advised by me
to perform your's towards the dey; and now let
us part for ever.'
• No, no,' exclaimed Clotilda, 'you are more
a slave here than you imagine. Part! what suf-
fer you to go, that you may bear to another wo .
man that love which I have humbled myself to
be refused ! Believe it not; Clotilda has pledged
an oath to Heaven, that you either requite her
love, or yield your breath upon the spot you
stand on.'
“ The fury of a disappointed woman raised no
fears for his safety in the breast of D'Altonville :
he trusted that her threats would never be put into
effect; he neither conceived her authorized by
the dey to take away the life of one of his slaves,
nor did he fear, that if the naked sword were
presented to his throat, she would not herself
again recall it, as while he lived her hopes might
still be kept alive.
• You do not tremble, I perceive,' she said ;
. but your calmness probably arises from your
not giving credit to my words. I will convince
you what my design is.' She turned to one of
the mutes, and commanded him to bring the
bow string

with him to perform the dreadful act, one of whom
held in his hand a cloth to shade the features of
the sufferer in his last moments.
Now, then, thy choice-Clotilda, or the bow-
string?' she exclaimed.
When death and sin are placed in opposition,'
D’Altonville replied, “ the grim tyrant loses all his
terrors ; if, by flying to his arms, I avoid the evil
that might make me dread to meet his touch here-
after, suffering unwarrantably here, I have nothing
to look forward to but recompence—
* Blind him exclaimed the female fury.
“ The mutes obeyed, and one of them held the
noose ready to slip over his head.
Whilst thou,' continued D'Altonville, with an
unfaultering voice, 'at some unexpected moment
wilt meet thy merited punishment !
Truly hast thou spoken !' exclaimed a voice,
which proceeded from one of those whom D’Alton-
ville had hitherto believed to be all mutes : 'be
that cord her instant fate-obey me!'
“ As it were by magic, the noose which had been
presented to the neck of D’Altonville encircled that
of Clotilda ; the cloth was thrown over her face, and
a low moan bespoke her in the agonies of death..
“ Wonder seized the frame of D’Altonville, and
he stood gazing on the scene before him.
“ The apparent mute again spoke.—' Thus ever
perish licentiousness and ingratitude joined !' Then
turning to D’Altonville, he continued — French-
man, know in me the dey of Algiers. That woman

possessed my heart---my soul: you perceive how
she has trifled with the good she enjoyed, and how
deservedly she has suffered. I confess I loved her ;
but I had rather mourn a disappointment than know
myself a dupe. Camazin, the superintendant of
the gardens, discovered to me the injustice that
was practising against me, and concerted for me
the plan of this disguise, by which I have had per-
sonal conviction of her guilt : he informed me also
of the nobleness of your mind, which refused to
wrong in his affections even the man who held
you in bondage; I have myself also seen the work-
ings of your glorious spirit; I have punished the
badit now alone remains for me to reward the
worthy; ask of me any boon, it is your's, in addi-
tion to your freedom, and safe convoy to your own
country.'
“Need I tell my reader that the gift which
D'Altonville asked was his Eloise ?
“ The dey heard his story with interest, and in-
vited him to return with him immediately to
Algiers.
" I was that night on the point of retiring to
my bed, when a slave came to my apartment, and
informed me that the dey requested to see me di-
rectly. Alarm seized me; I apprehended conse-
quences of the worst nature from the message, but
I had no alternative but to obey it, for if he were
determined on seeing me, my simple refusal could
be of no avail. I threw my veil over me, and with
a slow and trembling step I followed the messenger,

who conducted me to an apartment brilliantly light-
ed, in the midst of which I saw a repast spread,
and cushions of purple and gold surrounding it.
From behind a curtain of flowing silk, at the upper
end of the apartment, a personage richly habited,
and whom I could not mistake for the dey, from
the humble obeisances of the slaves, as he passed
along through the midst of them, advanced towards
me. He took one of my hands in his, without
which support I believe I should have sunk at his
feet, and thus addressed me-Fairlady, I in-
vite
you here to present you with a lover truly wor-
thy of your highest esteem : tremble not, it is not
myself I am recommending to your heart; here
comes the man !'
“I looked towards the curtain, and beheld my
D’Altonville, no longer habited as a slave, but with
the naval uniform of his country restored to him.
“ We few into each other's arms, and for some
succeeding moments I was wholly insensible.
“ The dey invited us to pass the evening in his
apartment, and our gratitude to him was too great
not to make us feel a true pleasure in complying
with any request which came from his lips. At the
present moment, I learnt but slightly the cause
which had restored to me my lover, as D’Altonville,
from delicacy to the feelings of the dey, forbore to
revert to the conduct of one whom, it was yet evi-
dent, the dey had loved better than she had de-
served.
“ What bliss, what ecstacy did I enjoy, during

359
the hours we passed in the apartment of the dey, to
feel myself once more in the presence of my D’Al-
tonville! to know myself secure from danger, in
those very walls, and in conversation with that very
man from whom I had dreaded the destruction of
my peace-the eternal separation of my lover and
myself! The joy was superhuman, and transient
as it was great: the last happy moments of my
existence had now been nearly all enjoyed.
Against the following evening the dey had pro-
mised to provide us with a vessel, which should
convey us to any port of France of which we should
make choice, and D'Altonville fixed upon Toulon.
Encouraged by the suavity of manners of the
dey, and the openness of his heart at the present
moment, D’Altonville ventured to request of him
the liberty of the Spanish captain, whose conduct
towards us I have before remarked as kind in the
extreme, during the time of our being prisoners on
board his ship, and whose friendship had been the
only consolation of D’Altonville's bondage.
“ The dey acceded to his request, and the poor
Spaniard was made happy in the morning by the in-
telligence of his unexpected reverse of fortune.
“I passed the night in golden dreams of bliss to
come-of blessing which never rose to light, fos-
tered alone within my breast, and overshadowed
at their birth by the lowering clouds of affliction.
“ At the appointed hour on the following day,
after receiving a most friendly farewell from the
dey at parting, we embarked on board the vessel

destined to convey us to France, the Spanish
captain, as had been already settled, being our
fellow-passenger.
“On the third day of our being at sea, a rough
gale sprang up, and as the waves washed over
the deck, I went down into the cabin. I was
assured by the Spanish captain, who was himself,
as well as my D'Altonville, an excellent mariner,
that there was not the slightest danger to be ap-
prehended; and thus satisfied, I retired to bed.
“The sudden change from grief to joy which I
had experienced within the last few days had en-
tirely exhausted my strength and spirits; and
when I sunk to sleep, I slept soundly, and for a
length of time.
“Oh God! so great are now my emotions at
the recollection of the scenes which followed my
waking, that my hand almost refuses to trace
them upon the paper before me: but the task
shall be fulfilled; the wretch of hereafter shall be
shewn that as miserable a being as herself has
existed before her. -
“On my waking—oh, what strange events
had taken place during my sleep –on my wak-
ing, the first object in the cabin on which my
eyes fell was—lord Rufus de Madgiaecourt
“’Ere I speak of my alarm, let me relate what
had preceded it.
“The violence of the wind had increased with
nearly every hour of the night, and towards
morning it was almost grown into a storm. A

little after the break of day, D'Altonville had es-
pied, through the mists of the morning, a vessel
about the size of the bark we were on board of,
as he believed, in distress.
“ The Spanish captain and himself directed
the mariners to make towards her. In a very
short time they perceived that she was foundering,
and in a few minutes more she entirely disappear-
ed beneath the waves. D’Altonville, who kept his
eyes fixed on the spot where she had sunk, de-
clared that he saw some of the crew struggling
with the waves. Our vessel soon came up with
them, and succeeded in preserving the lives of two
men, who were buffetting the foaming billows on
à mast, to which they were clinging. These
two men were no other than lord Rufus de Mad-
ginecourt and his adherent Ravil. They had
been on their passage in an Italian ship from
Genoa to Cette, and by bad weather and adverse
winds had been blown out of their course; their
vessel had sprung a leak, and every one on board
but themselves had perished.
“ Ravil was the son of a gentleman of small
fortune. Chance had introduced him to the al-
quaintance of lord Rufus, who finding him to be
one of those young men who prefer submitting to
the drudgery of making themselves useful to a
wealthy patron, rather than undergoing the toil
of earning for themselves an honest maintenance,
free from such dependence, had made him his
companion ; and his abilities in the accomplish-

ment of his patron's views, of whatever nature
they might be, had raised him extremely high in
the good favour of lord Rufus.
“This young man had accidently seen D’Al-
tonville, during his residence with lord Rufus on
the marquisite of my father, and lost not a mo-
ment in conveying to his patron information of
who the person was to whom he owed his life.
Upon receiving this intelligence from Ravil, lord
Rufus directly inquired of the captain of our
vessel, if there was any female on board, which
he doubtless suspected to be the case, as no he-
sitation was made in France at saying that I had
eloped with D'Altonville. The captain satisfied
him in this point, and he directly bought his ser-
vices with a purse of gold, which he had pre-
served about him.
“With the most rancorous villainy brooding in
his heart, he returned to that part of the deck
where D'Altonville was standing, and while in the
act of acknowledging him as the preserver of his
life, he drew from his girdle a pistol, which he
aimed at his head : fortunately the murderous
weapon missed fire; of this the Spanish captain
being unconscious, and only sensible of the dan-
ger in which he saw his friend, darted forward to
wrest the implement of death from the hand of
the wretch who grasped it; in the struggle the
pistol discharged itself, and the Spaniard was
sliot through the heart.
“ The consternation of D'Altonville at the

363
scene just past was so great, that both his power
of utterance and action failed him. It was by
accident that the pistol which lord Rufus happen-
ed to have upon him had been loaded ; a second
charge he had not at command, so threw from
him the useless tube ; but in the moment of the
action, whilst he was reflecting on the present
inutility of the weapon, his sentiments underwent
a change, which he expressed in these words,
unintelligible to D'Altonville— No, thou shalt
live to see my triumph over thee!'
« Ravil and lord Rufus then bound him to the
foremast of the vessel. D'Altonville called upon
the mariners for assistance, and upbraided them
for suffering him to undergo the evil treatment
he was enduring from two strangers, whom his
humanity had just rescued from death; but the
Algerines had been bought to passiveness by gold,
and they religiously adhered in faith to the god
they worshipped.
“ D'Altonville now turned himself to the stran-
gers, and began to remonstrate with them on the
ingratitude of their conduct, and to demand the
reason of the cruel treatment they were shew-
ing him?
“A thunderbolt bursting upon his head could
not have occasioned a greater pang to his senses,
- than he received in the information that lord Rufus,
the persecutor of his Eloise, stood before him. In
the wildness of his agony he called upon Heaven for
assistance: his eyes fell on his bleeding friend; he

perceived his bosom still heaving with the gaspings
of expiring life ; he called upon him by name, in
the vain hope that the sound of his voice might
reanimate his closing powers. Lord Rufus com-
manded the mariners to throw the body into the sea,
fearful, as it were, of its recovery. The eyes were
not closed; and D’Altonville believed that they rested
on him, as the body sunk beneath the waves,
" These particulars I learnt at a future period
from Ravil:
Having secured D’Altonville beyond the power
of disengaging himself, lord Rufus ordered Ravil
to remain with him upon deck, to ensure his re-
ceiving no assistance from the sailors ; for vice is
always doubtful of those engines which are merely
bought to assist in its purposes, without possessing
any interest in their being effected; and with this
caution he came down into the cabin, where I lay
sleeping.
" Whether the sound of his voice, or his more
hated touch, awoke me, I know not; I can only now
recollect, that on opening my eyes my sight fell on
his detested form. On perceiving it, I uttered a
frantic exclamation, which I seconded by calling
for assistance on D’Altonville.
Lay aside your fears, dearest lady, I beseech
you,' he pronounced ; ' you see before you one too
much devoted to your happiness to render it neces-
sary for you to call on any being for assistance but
himself.
My lord,' I replied, 'I acknowledge but one

protector ; there can be but one man whom a
woman's heart tells her she has a right to confide
in, and you already know that you are not he.'
'I am, at least, blest in thinking that since a
chance, which I revere has brought me once more
into your presence, I shall soon be the envied man
you describe,' answered lord Rufus.
• You !' I exclaimed_never ! never! Were my
D'Altonville at this moment on his bed of death
before me, and were his last request to me to ad-
mit you to my affections after his decease, not even
in compliance with his dying breath could I
tolerate you—could I feel any sensation but aversion
for the man who leagued himself with a cruel father,
against an injured daughter's cause. By what
authority you are here, I know not ; but whatever
it be, I trust my request to you immediately to
depart will supersede it.'
• Though an angel utter the command,' returned
the artful man, 'we are slow in obedience, where
death must follow compliance : I can only live in
your presence ; from the first moment I saw you,
my passion for you was extreme, and I care not
what sacrifices I undergo to call you my own; you
can make no terms to which I shall not accede, so
you do but give me yourself ; but urge me not to
desperation by your obstinacy, for, on whatever
terms it be, you must be mine!'
• Never in my life, my lord,' I replied ; ' nor
can this declaration on my part wound any generous
feeling of your heart: after the sentiments you

have just avowed, I am sufficiently convinced that
a passion far inferior to love stirs your warmth ; the
noble sensation of love is unacquainted with the
force your lordship talks of, and feels its greatest
happiness in that forbearance which blesses the
object of its selection.'
“ Lord Rufus smiled contemptuously.
* Besides,' I continued, “ you are already well
acquainted that I have pledged my faith to one
whom empires should not tempt me to renounce ;
and though the perversity of fate has hitherto
prevented our union, the hour is not now, I trust,
far distant."
“ Oh, would my tongue had cleaved to my lips
ere I had uttered that sentence! Fierce joy sparkled
in the eyes of lord Rufus, and he exclaimed— Not
yet his! Am I then so blest ? are thy beauties
yet untasted, and the first fruit of thy charms
reserved for me? Fear no intemperance on my
part now, lady; thou art my destined wife !'
" Where is my D’Altonville ?' I cried : ' why is
he not here? why does he not appear to vindicate
my fame—to protect me from insult ? D’Altonville !
D’Altonville ! oh, where art thou, my D’Alton-
ville ?'
" Of what succeeded these moments I have no
perfect recollection ; I alone remember that I felt
sick and giddy, and sunk upon the floor before the
monster who was exercising his inhumanity over
me.
" When I awoke from my trance, lord Rufus

was still with me. The sounds with which I opened
my lips were the same that I had closed them with
- Where, where is my D’Altonville ?'
Acknowledge yourself my destined bride,'
returned De Madginecourt, “and you shall instant-
ly see him.'
" There are emotions of the heart which no
tongue can express—there are souls which no argu-
ments can move ; of the former were my sensations
-of the latter class lord Rufus. I clasped my
hands in agony towards Heaven, and remained
silent.”
Rosalind, for the first time, turned her thoughts
from the eventful page she was reading.-" Oh,
Heaven !” she exclaimed, “ in the power of this
monster am I at the present moment ! Shield me,
Omnipotence, with thy protecting arm ! encircle
me with thy guardian spirit from the machinations
of this fiend ! She paused a while, in comparative
reflection on the fate of Eloise and herself. Again
she spoke—“Am I destined to be the second victim
of his licentious desires ? or is the friendship which
he now professes towards me real, and exercised
as an atonement for his past transgressions ? God
of mercy! do thou, in pity to my friendless state,
soften and ameliorate his rugged heart !”
The shades of evening were already descending
to the earth, and when Rosalind again turned her
eyes to the manuscript, desirous of pursuing the
narrative it contained, she found that the retiring
of the light of day had rendered the characters no.

longer discernible ; and not choosing to carry it
with her to her own apartment, she reluctantly
replaced it on the same spot where she had found
it, and left the library.
Dame Edith met her in her chamber, with many
apologies for her absence during the afternoon.
Rosalind felt disinclined to conversation, and
alleging an headache as an excuse for retiring
early to rest, dismissed the good old dame for the
ight, and sunk upon her pillow, where reflection
on the past, and anticipation of the future, rendered
the visit of sleep broken and unrefreshing.
CHAPTER XII.
-Mighty God!
What had I done to merit such affliction ?
Номе.
Anxious for the conclusion of Eloise's fate, Rosa-
lind left her bed at an early hour, and repaired to
the library, unobserved by dame Edith, who was
either still asleep, or occupied with her morning
devotions; she opened at the page where she had
left off the evening before, and found the narrative
continued thus :
“ For several days I was kept a prisoner in the
cabin, and saw only lord Rufus, and his equally
vile adherent, Ravil ; not a single reply could I gain
to my inquiries relative to D'Altonville ; and at
times I believed that the wretch who aspired to my

369
hand had freed himself by death from the rival whom
he saw me resolute in preferring to himself.
“ At length, when Ravil was one day alone with
me in the cabin, I thought he appeared more than
usually disposed to reply to my questions, and I
urged him, in the most imploring terms, to inform
me what was the fate of D'Altonville. He told me
that he was alive, but not allowed to descend into
the cabin to me.
• Whither are we sailing ?' I next asked. “We
must have reached France long ere this, had not the
destiny of the vessel been changed.'
· We are sailing towards England,' he replied.
'Lord Rufus de Madginecourt has a castle on the
margin of the shore, where we are to land.'
· Then that castle is destined to be my grave! I
exclaimed.
“ Ravil fixed his eyes on me; I thought they
gleamed pity, at least they did not appear to exult
in my agonies.
* More likely the grave of D’Altonville, he re-
plied. It is not the nature of lord Rufus to suffer
those to live whom he hates.—D’Altonville is a
brave fellow,' he added, after a short pause;' he
saved my life, so did he also that of lord Rufus ;
but lord Rufus has a heart unacquainted with gra-
titude.'
“ He then proceeded, unasked, to relate to me
the accident which had introduced lord Rufus and
himself on board our vessel ; he expatiated on the
death of the Spanish captain ; dwelt on the villany

of lord Rufus, who had attempted the life of D'Al-
tonville a moment after he had owed his own to his
humanity; and added — Would it were in my pow-
er to save the life of D'Altonville !'
“ The iniquity of Ravil's heart was not then so
fully known to me as it was soon after ; and catch-
ing at the expressions which had fallen from his
tongue, as if the lips of an angel had breathed a
sound of comfort in my ear, I said — Are you then'
as fully convinced as myself of lord Rufus's villany,
and will you stretch out your arm in the cause of
the innocent ?'
. Most willingly,' he returned; it would be my
pride to rescue you from the power of lord Rufus.
"But the means ?' I returned. Lord Rufus
has bought the captain to his side ; my D’Altonville
is bound : what can your single arm, or mine to
back it, avail against numbers ?'
· The numbers might soon be our own,' rejoined
Ravil : ' I have twice the sum of gold about me
with which lord Rufus bought his services; no fear
but a double bribe would as quickly bind him
to me.'
Oh, for the love of Heaven, make the attempt!'
I said.
* It remains with you, lady, to give the signal,'
he answered: say but that the heart which you
cannot give to lord Rufus shall be mine, and I
pledge my soul to you that the life of D’Altonville
shall be sacred.'
“ To express what were my sensations at that

moment is not in the power of language. Wretch!'
was the only sound that escaped my lips ; my eyes
spoke volumes of indignation and contempt.
• Be not so hasty in your decision, lady,' he re-
joined, with the utmost calmness of tone ; ' you
have not yet heard all the arguments I can advance
in favour of my passion. If lord Rufus be allowed
to maintain his present power over you, little do I
believe that his promise of marriage will be attended
to, when you are once within the walls of his cas-
tle ; and certain I am that the life of D’Altonville
will be as short as the period of your honour: if,
on the contrary, you will accede to my proposal,
lord Rufus, who feels no repugnance at attempting
the life of a man to whom he owes his own, shall
be cut off, and buried in those waves whose mur-
murs blab no secrets; you shall become a lawful,
honoured wife, and D’Altonville shall live to see
you happy.
“ I spoke not ; the expression of my ccuntenance
was sufficient to convince him of the abhorrence in
which my soul held him.
Requesting me to reflect on what he had said,
he shortly after left the cabin.
“ The misery of my mind was now, if possible,
increased. I dreaded more at the moment from
· the calm villany of Ravil, than from the baughty
brutality of lord Rufus. I considered that I might
free myself from the importunity of the former, by
a representation of his conduct to his patron ; but
would not this very act of self-defence be an

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
inimical step to my own peace? Would not a com-
plaint to lord Rufus of his creature be allowing lord
Rufus an ascendancy over him in my heart ? would
it not be saying that lord Rufus was not the being
most hated by me in the creation ? and would not
this confession lead him into the opinion of his
having obtained some influence over my heart?
Horrid idea! Whatever I might suffer from the
persecutions of Ravil, I resolved not to owe my
release from them to lord Rufus.
“ On the following day, Ravil attempted to win
upon me by a display of passion, which he artfully
pretended to make a merit of restraining within
the bounds of respect: more disgusted by this hy-
pocrisy than by his open fallacy, I commanded him
to leave me, on pain of my informing lord Rufus of
his conduct. He laughed contemptuously at my
threat, and told me that lord Rufus entertained too
good an opinion of his fidelity to be easily shaken
from it. He mentioned a large sum, which he said
lord Rufus had willed to him for his honest services,
(on these words he laid an ironical emphasis, as if
he gloried in the deceit which he had lived in), and
added, that ere long I might probably see him in
possession of it.
His words made no impression on me; I re-
garded them as the froth of villanous disappoint-
ment.
“ A few nights after, I had fallen into a slumber
in which horrid dreams haunted my sickening
fancy; a loud blow upon the door of the cabin


## p. 373 (#403) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
373
awoke me, and a confusion of tongues at the
same time met my ear: a second blow upon the
door burst it open, and from the light of the lamp
which was suspended from the top of the cabin,
I saw lord Rufus,pursuing Ravil with his drawn
sword. Ravil was unarmed, and his violent ef-
forts to escape the threatened danger had forced
him a way through the door in the cabin.
“ The struggle was as short as any contest
must necessarily be, where one man has the su-
periority of arms over a naked opponent: Ravil
fell, the blood gushing from a wound in his breast,
and another in his side.
Although contempt alone had met Ravil's in-
famous proposals to me, he had vigorously pur,
sued the desperate plan which had entered his
diabolical mind, of wresting me from lord Rufus to
himself, and of stepping through blood into that
independance which his knowledge of the concerns
of lord Rufus ensured to him on his death.
Accordingly he had, during the day appointed
the captain of the vessel to meet him at midnight
at the foot of the cabin stairs, the spot which, of all
others, he conceived the least liable to interrup-
tion, informing him that he had something of con-
sequence to communicate to him.
“ At the time fixed on, Ravil was repairing to
the place of appointment. The night was very
dark, and he could merely distinguish a moving
figure which appeared to be on the point of as-
cending the stairs, as he was going down them.
3c


## p. 374 (#404) ############################################

• Remain there,' he said ; and 'the figure ceased
to move. Ravil went down, and taking from his
pocket the
purse of gold he had mentioned to me
that he was possessed of, he put it into the bands
of the person before him, and said — Your servi.
ces are now given to lord Rufus—take this purse,
and let them henceforth be given to me; your
compliance shall be rewarded with treble the
sum when we arrive in England.'
“ The hand which received the gold was not
that of the supposed captain, but of lord Rufus
himself, who was coming upon deck for air.
“ Needless must it be to observe that vengeance
was the sole passion which animated the heart of
lord Rufus, on this unexpected and unequivocal
discovery of the perfidy of a man who owed to
him his all; his sword was in an instant drawn
from its scabbard; with an exclamation sufficient
to convince Ravil whose arm he had to dread
;
and terror lending him strength, he had burst his
way
into my cabin, in his vain attempt at flying
from the avenging steel.
“ The icy hand of death was upon Ravil, but
still neither remorse for the past nor dread of the
hereafter occupied his mind ; true to the vicious
principles under which he had lived, and which
had raised him to the rank of De Madginecourt's
favourite, in the last moments of his life he only
thought of revenging the failure of his ungrateful
villany. His head had fallen near my feet, and I
stood hanging over him, my faculties suspended

in horror. He fixed his eyes on me' D'Alton-
ville,' he said, 'is bound to the mast-take this
dagger. to defend yourself,' (drawing one, as he
spoke, from his girdle,) and fly to his release.'
'God forgive thee !' I exclaimed, snatching the
dagger from his hand, and flying towards the spot
he had named. The whole was but the transaction
of a moment.
“ Ardent hope gave wings to my feet, and I
reached the deck without scarcely touching the
stairs that led to it.- D’Altonville,' I cried, 'thy
Eloise calls upon thee!'
* Eloise !' replied the well known voice, and in
an instant my hands were upon the cords that bound
him. He was sitting upon the deck, and his arms
were confined to the mast in such a manner as to
prevent him from rising. Scarcely was one arm
unbound, ere the hand of lord Rufus, calling vehe-
mently on the mariners for assistance, held mine ;
my shrieks were mingled with his cries : the night
was too dark for me to be able to discover whether
I had given D’Altonville the power of wholly un-
binding himself; and my dread of Ravil's prophecy
concerning his life being at that moment fulfilled,
wound me up almost to frenzy, and I raved for
mercy for my D’Altonville.
“ Lord Rufus snatched me in his arms, and was
returning with me into the cabin: at that moment
I recollected the dagger; with all the violence of my
strength, I darted it at his breast. Forgive me,
Heaven, for the deed ! At any other time but that

of the most wretched desperation, I would not have
attempted the life even of so cruel an enemy : not-
withstanding the sufferings I endured from him, I
thank God that the blow was not fatal ; I had not
died in that peace with my own heart which, I trust,
will now attend my last moments.
“ But although the blow was not fatal, the point
of the dagger had entered his arm just below the
shoulder ; he contrived to stagger with me into the
cabin, and there he let me drop. My garments
werecovered with the blood which had issued from his
wound. The loudness of the noise which I heard
upon the deck filled me with the hope that D’Alton-
ville was at liberty, and triumphing over the attempts
of the sailors to rebind him; but, alas! the hope
was futile. The captain brought information to
lord Rufus that the villain was safe, 's Villain ! oh,
what was lord Rufus, if my D’Altonville was a
villian ?
“Ravil had ceased to breathe, and the dead body
was removed at the command of lord Rufus, whose
wound, I perceived, gave him pain; he darted at
me a look which was meant to upbraid me, but
checked by his consciousness of the provocation I
had received : he took a linen girdle from his waist,
and bound it round his arm; this done, he called to
him one of the mariners, and having seen the door
sufficiently repaired for again acting as a prevention
to my leaving the cabin, he departed in silence,
turning the lock upon me, as he went out.
“I tore off such of my garments as were stained

with the blood of my detested enemy, and threw
them upon the floor; this done, I sunk upon my bed,
my brain and heart endeavouring, as it were, to ex-
ceed each other in their throbbings: an immense
weight appeared to press down my eyelids ; my
ideas were bewildered ; my heart seemed to require
the relief of weeping, but the tears would not flow.
“ A deadly coldness stole gradually from my
feet
towards my heart; I believed the termination of my
life to be fast approaching, and I prayed only of
Heaven to grant D’Altonville resignation under my
loss.
“ The pain I endured was great, yet were my
sufferings for my D’Altonville still greater ; exposed
to the inclemency of the night air, confined to the
most irksome of positions, perhaps denied those
aliments which could alone render his strength
capable of bearing up under the affliction he was
doomed to undergo.
“ A violent shivering fit seized me, and unable
to resist the acceptance of present relief for my
feelings, though, in reality, heedless of the pro-
traction of my life, I, for the first time, drank a
small cup of some wine, which lord Rufus had a few
days before brought me into the cabin, I feared
not that it should be drugged with any sleepy
potion, as the power of instilling such a drug, had
it been his inclination so to do, would have been the
same into any drink brought to me; nor did it seem
likely that such should be his idea ; I could not, in
the deepest sleep, be more in his power than I was
at every moment of my present existence.

“ Towards morning I sunk to sleep ; the wine
had probably invited its approach ; although the
quantity I had swallowed was small, still, upon
exhausted spirits, it had possessed the power of a
larger dose : when I awoke; I found my accustomed
morning repast by my side, and I saw that the
blood-stained garments which I had taken off the
night before were gone.
“ My brain was more capable of thought than it
had been before I had slept.' What,' I inquired of
myself, ' is the fate of D’Altonville ? to what end
does the tyrant spare his wretched life?' I could
find no reply to these mental questions, but that the
wretch who was usurping an unwarrantable right
over my liberty felt averse to the commission of
deliberate murder, and therefore suffered him to
live till some new fit of passion should drive him on
madly to the deed.
“ It is not uncommon for villains to juggle thus
with their own conscience, and not to appear sen-
sible that the cool determination of an evil action is
the same as the performance of it.
“ When lord Rufus entered the cabin, he said
To-morrow, lady, it is probable that we shall
reach England; a very short time will now, there-
fore place you in the situation your charms were
born to shine in; two days more will make you my
wife.'
“ I did not reply; my determination was more
fixed than ever, rather to die than to suffer myself
to be allied by the tenderest name to the man I hated;

but I considered it useless at the present moment
again to express it.
“ In the night, as I lay upon my restless bed,
I imagined that I heard some one over my head
singing; the tones were those of the deepest melan-
choly, and the songster sighed with the most bitter
sobbins. At length I heard my name pronounced.
I could no longer be deceived in the voice; it was
that of D’Altonville. Again he sang, and at the
close of a long and mournful cadence he exclaimed
• Oh, Eloise, why hast thou fled to Heaven before
me?'
• Fled to Heaven! I voluntarily echoed : 'does
he then believe me dead? Impossible ! it is his
sleeping fancy that speaks !'
“ I sprang upon the table in the cabin, in order
to approach as near to him as possible, and exert-
ing my voice to its fullest extent, I called upon
him
by name. He either did not hear me, or did not
attend to my invocation, for he did not reply to me,
but continued sighing.
* Eloise l'he presently exclaimed.
• Here! here!' I replied, for I then doubted not
that he heard my voice.
"That blessed star is Eloise,' he added; and I
heard him move quickly away from the spot.
“ It was now impossible for me to admit any
opinion concerning what I had heard, but that D’Al-
tonville believed me dead; the fabrication must
have been conveyed to him by lord Rufus ; but
could I imagine that D’Altonville would, in this

point, give credit to his tongue ? Oh no! and yet,
might not the weakness of his harrassed brain con-
spire with his enemy to gain his credit to the last
pang he could ever be capable of feeling on earth ?
“ Again I heard his voice pronouncing my name,
and singing a melody which he had in former days
often heard me play to him upon my lute. Again
I heard his footsteps move on the deck. On what
account was he now at liberty, when he had hi-
therto been so closely bound ?
“ A tide of agony rushed upon my brain, and
each moment appeared to predict that it would
burst the next.
* Truly was that night a night of horrors: at
every interval of the roaring waves and rustling
breeze, I heard his wretched, his frantic voice.
About an hour after daybreak the wind rose higher,
and excluded every sound but the hoarse roarings
occasioned by itself.
Lord Rufus did not, as had been usual with
him, visit me in the morning; my breakfast was
brought me by one of the mariners. About noon,
certain words which I heard upon deck led me to be-
lieve that we were within sight of land. I stood by
the door of my cabin, anxiously endeavouring to
catch the sound of my D’Altonville's voice, whose
brain, I now firmly persuaded myself, had been
affected by his misfortunes ; but I heard him not.
I placed my hand by accident on the handle of the
lock of the door, and my action having without
design turned it, it flew open: my surprise at find-

381
ing that it was not barred was great ; but I deter-
mined to profit by the happy chance for once more
seeing D’Altonville : I rushed out, and turned my
steps towards the cabin stairs ; but, alas! the door
at their top, which opened upon the deck, was
closed, and refused me a passage.
· She is not dead-it is a villanous fallacy-she
is not dead ! Suffer me once more to see her-to
die in her arms!' These words, in the voice of
D'Altonville I distinctly heard.
· Frantic at the sound, I flew to another part of
the ship, where I had some recollection of having
seen an entrance to the deck ; I gained it, and once
more stood before the only man on earth that I could
ever love; but oh, how changed since last I had be-
held him! With the characters of death legibly
written on his countenance, and clasping my blood-
stained garments to his heart, lay D’Altonville ex-
tended upon the deck.
· Monsters! I knew she lived ! he exclaimed on
seeing me ; and at the same instant endeavoured
to spring from the ground; but the effort over-
powered him, and he sunk down by my side.
• Do not, at the peril of your souls, attempt to
tear me from him !' I cried, addressing lord Rufus
and the wretches allied to him by gold. 'Ye have
murdered him, and I will receive his last breath.'
“ I believe there was something in my manner
which struck awe even to the hearts of those
around me, for they suffered me to remain on my
knees by his side.

• Blessed God! I thank thee that I see her once
again !' said D'Altonville, endeavouring to fix on
me his eyes. They gave me these,' pointing to the
garments I have already mentioned, and told me
thou wert dead ! Frenzy seized my brain ; I broke
my bonds. He came, and found me once more at
liberty,' he pointed to lord Rufus as he spoke, ' and
his sword—' He could no more ; his hand explained
the rest, by placing itself beneath a wound in his
side.
Oh, save him ! save him !' I exclaimed : 'inhu-
man villains ! will ye let him die for want of aid ?'
It would come too late,' said D’Altonville, once
more opening his lips ? ' the pangs of death recalled
my reason-it convinced me thou wert still alive!
I prayed only to breathe out my last sigh in thine
arms !-Oh, Eloise, it is accomplished ! Almighty
Heaven ! shield The words died
died on his
tongue-his spirit was fled for ever
“ Without a groan, without a sigh, I saw him
expire: for a minute all my senses seemed stiffened
into apathy, then burst a maddening tide of grief
into my veins; one heart-drawn shriek escaped my
lips, and I ran to plung myself into the deep, and
end my woes in death.
“ An arm snatched me back, and all sense fled
from me.
“Oh, why was not that moment my last? Why
did not Heaven kindly close my eyes in death, and
spare me the horror of opening them upon the
murderer of my D’Altonville ?

“ I cannot dwell on the remainder of my nar-
rative as I have done on that already written ; it is
my desire to complete it before my death. It is a
singular, an inexplicable consolation to me to com-
mit my fate to paper : perhaps I am animated by
the idea that those sorrows which during my
lifetime
were shut from the knowledge of the world, may
excite a tear of compassion after my decease. I
must hasten in my self-imposed task, for I feel a
presentiment, a foreboding, that my miseries on
earth will not endure much longer: Lord Rufus
scorns the wretch he has made.
Upon recovering my senses, I found myself
in the apartment where I am now writing, and
from which I have never been permitted to stir,
except into the library adjoining to it, where I shall
deposit my sad recital, when I have concluded it,
if that power be ever granted me.
“ Lord Rufus and some attendants were in the
apartment with me; he dismissed the latter, and a
priest, at his call, entered from the library.—' The
moment of my happiness is now come !' was the
short intimation which he gave me of his intention
respecting myself. My tears, my prayers, my re-
monstrances, were unheeded alike by him and the
priest ; and a ceremony. which was by them call-
ed marriage, having been performed, the priest
left the chamber.
“And here I must for awhile lay down my pen.
I can dwell with comparative composure on the
death of my D’Altonville, to the sensations which

my mind at this moment experiences in the recol-
lection of the hour which followed that mockery of
religion.
“ When a month had expired, lord Rufus, pro-
bably judging of me by the impression which any
occurrence of joy or grief made on his own unfeel-
ing mind, and conceiving the time of affliction for
the loss of my D’Altonville to be past, was urgent
with me in his entreaties for me to quit my chamber,
and to shew myself to his household, and to the
world, as the wife of his choice. He should ex-
perience much pride, he said, in carrying me to
the court, and introducing me there, in a style be-
coming the rank to which he had raised me.
“ I replied, that I should ever consider myself
the victim of a tyrant ; and feeling that I was so, I
would, if possible, shut myself out from my own
sight, much more from that of the world.
“ The policy of lord Rufus was too great to force
me into society against my inclination, how
strongly soever he might desire to see me emerge
into the world. The tale of his villany at present
lay buried in his own breast and mine : within the
walls of his castle, I had no means of making my
wrongs known to any human being ; the domestics
I saw were few, and those as wholly unacquainted
with the French language as I was with that of
England. Had I suffered myself to have been led
into the world, with the splendour which would
have accompanied my introduction into it as the
wife of lord Rufus de Madginecourt, he probably

conceived that vanity would have dazzled my
thoughts from a recollection of the past, or that if
I had ever made the disclosure of my situation to
any heart, little credit would have been given to the
misery of a woman who was blazing in what the
world knew to be grandeur, and therefore would
conceive to be happiness.
My thoughts frequently reverted to the living
as well as to the dead. I thought of my father,
and I prayed for him : he was, indeed, the author
of all my misery, but he was still my father-I still
owed to him the duty of a child, though he had
omitted to perform towards me the part of an in-
dulgent parent. Sorrow softens the heart into uni-
versal benevolence; it is the channel through which
Providence pours the greatest balm into the breast
of affliction, by rendering it conscious that it suffers
undeservedly, when it unexceptionally forgives.
“ The conduct of lord Rufus continued consistent
with the crimes he had already committed. Indif-
ference quickly succeeded possession, and he did
not hesitate to offer me insults, when he found me
about to become the mother of a progeny more
wretched than myself, because condemned in the
very womb to lie under the hatred of a monster and
a father.
“ Alas! I shall write little more : I feel the mo-
ment of my pains approaching : the only consola-
tary sensation I have for some time experienced is a
whispering at my heart, that my existence will now
be short ; the belief would be exquisite, were it not

that a wretched being may receive life from my
death, whose unhappy state might be somewhat
ameliorated on earth, even by the little share of
comfort it would be in its hapless mother's power
to bestow on it.
My hour of suffering is at hand. May it be
no crime to wish that Heaven would hear my payer,
to snatch my babe to the arms of its mercy, rather
than consign it to those of its miserable mother !"
A chasm in the manuscript here ensued ; and
when it was again continued, the characters were
hardly recognizable for those of the same writer;
they appeared to have been traced by a hand almost
too feeble to commit them to paper.
“ Once more I resume my pen, but my hand,
weak and tremulous with illness and suffering, al-
most refuses to perform the office I require of it.
Still, even on the margin of the grave, the de-
sire of leaving a record of my affliction haunts me,
and gives me that strength which I could not exert
for any other purpose.
" The hour that was destined to make me a
mother gave birth to a female infant, which was
followed by one of the other sex. Nature never
fails to call forth the affections of the parent for her
progeny; and much as I had supposed I should la-
ment the birth of a child, I instantly felt that it
would be an increase of my sufferings to be deprived
of them, now they were given to me.
“ Lord Rufus did not appear to welcome his chil-
dren into existence.

“On the third day after their birth, the girl
closed her eyes to the light. I now almost wept
that my prayer to Heaven had been heard. Still
my boy was left me, to console my sad and solitary
moments. On the following morning, lord Rufus
came into my apartment. Instead of one observa-
tion relative to the recently created claim upon his
affection—instead of one word, even of pretended
tenderness to me, he abruptly informed me, that
as the girl had died under my care, he had resolved
to remove the boy to the superintendance of a nurse,
and required me immediately to take leave of him
for that purpose.
“In vain I remonstrated with him—in vain I
endeavoured to convince him that the nurse which
Nature has appointed to each child, in its mother's
breast, must be its ablest rearer. He made no
reply to my arguments, but merely repeated his
own determination. I pressed my lips upon the
cheek of the babe, and held him to my bosom. Lord
Rufus put his hand upon the child to tear him from
me—I was not able to speak—I raised my eyes to
him in eloquent silence ; his heart could not relax
to pity, and he bore the child away.
“That moment I learnt that there are still
fresh pangs in nature for every sufferer's bosom,
although he may believe himself already arrived at
the climax of his misery.
“Sometimes I dreaded lest the life of my child
should be unsafe in the hands of its unnatural father;
at others, I almost wished that, whatever the means,

it might be snatched from life while its sufferings
could only be short and bodily, rather than that
its existence should be spared for the lengthened
and more acute pangs of the mind.
“ In a few days, the conduct observed towards
me served to convince me that my boy had been
taken away from me, merely that he might never
have a knowledge of his unfortunate mother, who
was now reduced to that humiliating situation which
should attend the lost to virtue, but which, for
some unknown end, in the wisdom of Providence,
is too frequently transferred to the innocent sufferer.
"The mere necessaries of life were now alone
brought to me ; and the apartments, which it had
before been a voluntary act in me not to quit, were
now, I found, become my prison. Heretofore the
domestics, who did not understand my language,
had made it their study to comprehend my wants
from the signs I had given them ; now, only one
servant, and that of the opposite sex to my own,
appeared in my apartment, once, or at most twice,
in each twenty-four hours, and he obeyed no signal,
nor observed towards me the slightest respect.
" Even at this time a reflection came across my
brain, which administered something like peace to
my afflicted mind. What, in a situation siinilar to
mine, I considered, must be the feelings of a wretch-
ed object, who has voluntarily bent to infamy, and
sacrificed her innocence for gold and splendour ?
When the clouds of adversity and disdain over-
whelm her, where can she fly for consolation? That

389
which the world denies for she cannot receive from
her own heart ; her present existence is misery,
and she has nothing to look forward to but punish-
ment. Dreadful state of mind! While I have still
a friend in my conscience, and can indulge in the
delightful view of the mind, which presents to me
the sun of eternal reward rising upon me, as my
recompence for having leant firmly to the anchor of
religious hope, whilst tossed on the sea of worldly
calamity.
“ Thus passed on two months, during which I
saw not lord Rufus.
One day my attendants laid
before me, upon my table, a small parcel. I found
it to contain a dagger, and a paper, on which were
written the following words in the handwriting of
lord Rufus :
* Perhaps you will not immediately recol-
lect this dagger ; it is the one which you once aimed
at my life!
' Where,' I involuntarily exclaimed, 'is the
sword with which you drew the lifeblood of my
D’Altonville ?' The tears burst from my eyes, and
for some moments prevented me from returning
them to the paper in my hand; it was continued
thus :
"You have long since informed me that your
life was a burden to you. Your existence now

stands as much in the way of my projects as it can
do of your own happiness : you are therefore at li-
berty to part with it as soon as you please. I doubt
not but that you will receive my present thank-
fully, and for once acknowledge a benefit at the
hands of
RUFUS DE MADGINECOURT.'
“ This note I have transcribed into my narrative,
the moment after my receiving it, as I would not
that this last act of cool-blooded villany should be
unknown to the future peruser of my fate. I con-
sider myself as now writing for the last time. His
letter plainly expresses that Eloise must die, and
shortly too! If she will not commit suicide, it but
remains to close the scene with her murder.
" So then it shall be. Having endured thus
long, worlds should not purchase me to fly even
the cruel death he may intend me, by an action
that would destroy my hope of meeting D’Alton-
ville in heaven.
“ Prepared myself to die, with every soothing
sensation that can attend a sufferer to the margin of
the grave, my thoughts still lean towards the less
fortunate than myself, in their mental composure
at so awful a moment; and I pray to Heaven that
I may be the last victim of his villanous heart !
“ This is probably the last time I shall ever hold
a pen.
The night is closing in fast. I shall, as
usual, place my narrative in the station I have
chosen for it in the library, and retire to rest.

“ Reader, whoever thou art, that hast thus far
accompanied me through the journey of my
suffer
ings and afflictions, I thank thee for thy patience-
I thank thee for the tear which I take to myself a
pride and pleasure in believing that thou hast shed
over them.-Farewell! Should I never return to

Here ended the manuscript.
“ Thou didst never return to thy task, then, un-
fortunate Eloise !” exclaimed Rosalind,
didst, doubtless, perish by the hand of villany!
The tear that thou didst pray for falls upon thy
writing, and the sigh that thou didst desire is
heaved to thy memory, by one whose fate is equal-
ly wretched as thine own.”
Rosalind now heard the step of dame Edith ap-
proaching towards the library, and replaced the
manuscript on the shelf where she had found it.

“ It is strange,” said Rosalind, addressing her,
" that I should never have known lord Rufus to
have been married, till you mentioned it to me the
other day.”
Why,” replied the dame, your ladyship can
hardly have been born when the lady de Madgine-
court died; it is now full twenty-three years ago :
besides, as I have before told you, she was a French
lady, whom my lord fell in love with on his travels,
and made his wife. She was wholly unacquainted
with the English language, and also of a very melan-
choly turn of mind ; from both which causes, as I
guess, she disliked mixing with society; for I can't
say that I remember her ever quitting this suite of
apartments which she inhabited.”
I think you said she was his wife but a short
time,” remarked Rosalind.
“Not quite a year,” returned Edith : " she
bore him twins ; they both died on the third day
after their birth : the poor lady was desperate at
their loss ; her fever ran high, in addition to which
her milk flew to her brain-and-she died,” added
the dame, hesitatingly.
“Poor unfortunate !" sighed out Rosalind, fix-
ing her eyes on the dame ; they probably bore in
them a suspicion that Edith knew more than she
had spoken, for the dame advanced a few steps
closer to Rosalind, and in a lower tone of voice
added—" unfortunate indeed, my lady; for it is
asserted that the frenzy of her malady caused her
to lay violent hands on herself.”

393
Rosalind shuddered at the account: she recol-
lected the last lines of the narrative, which had de-
clared that whatever her fate, she would never lift
her hand against her own existence; and she
doubted not but that the wretched Eloise had been
the victim of unfair death, and had been falsely
stigmatized with the crime under which she had
suffered.
“ Such accidents are dreadful to reflect upon,”
the dame continued ; but we trust they are for-
given, because the sense is defective when they are
performed. For the sake of her soul, I hope that
queen Dido was frantic when she immolated herself
upon the funeral pile.”
Rosalind herself felt so strongly interested in the
subject she was discussing, that she could hardly
forbear an exclamation of anger or contempt at the
last remark made by the dame, who had plainly
displayed that her feelings were of the languid kind,
by the easy transition which she could make from
fact to fable, and lay an equal emphasis of feeling
on both ; and she could not, for some time, have
commanded her emotions sufficiently to have ad-
dressed the dame with complacency, had not her
ardent desire to learn all she was able of the fate of
the unhappy sufferer on whom her thoughts were
bent, overruled every other propensity. .
“ Did you see her children during the short pe-
riod of time they lived ?” asked Rosalind.
“No, my lady,” answered the dame,
saw the lady herself above two or three times; I
"I never

could not speak her language, or she mine ; so, as
I had not the power of offering her my services, I
did not intrude myself into her presence; and at
the time her children were born, as I think I have
told you before, I had been a couple of months
*confined to my bed with a sprain in my back; and
I had not the use of my limbs again till some time
after her death."
“ Had she any French servants?" asked Rosa-
lind, conscious that he had not, but still unwilling
to drop the subject in which her mind was wrapt,
and at a loss how to continue it, without betraying
herself acquainted with those particulars of which
she did not at present choose to avow a knowledge.
“ No, she had not one French servant," answer-
ed the dame ; " and those English domestics who
were particularly in her service have all left the
castle, or are since dead."
A silence ensued.
The secret then lies buried in the breast of him
who will hereaftrr have to account for it,” thought
Rosalind.
She was a beautiful lady, indeed !” continued
dame Edith; " and I dare say as amiable as she
was beautiful, for my lord cannot forget her to this
day ; that is, he never suffers himself to be put in
mind of her, for these rooms have been uninhabited,
though not locked up, ever since her death. His
lordship does not so much as enter the gallery that
leads to them; and I well remember once, about
five years ago, when he was giving directions to

some workmen on the ramparts, and his eye fell
upon these apartments, seeing him turn hastily
away, put his hand to his face, and shuddered.”
“To me at least thou standest convicted of thy
guilt,” said Rosalind, mentally. “Heaven grant
that the secret of which I am possessed may give
me power to shield myself from the villany thy
heart may intend against me !”
The remainder of the day passed on to Rosalind
in painful reflection ; she wished to taste the air,
but she forebore to visit the garden, or the rampart
not choosing to witness a repetition of the scene she
had once caught a glimpse of in passing through
the castle hall.
That hour of the evening at which lord Rufus had
acquainted her, at his departure, that he expected
to return to his castle, and to bring with him the
reply of Allanrod to her petition of being placed un-
der the protection of the queen, at length arrived.
She awaited his approach with a degree of impati-
ence natural to the unpleasant situation in which
she was placed, and with an anxiety which could not
fail to harass her mind, as she dwelt on the mys-
tery which formed the inexplicable nnion that sub-
sisted between lord Rufus and the Scottish freebooter.
The supper hour came, but lord Rufus did not
arrive. The spirits of Rosalind sunk at his absence.
If he really intended to act towards her the part of
friendship, this delay seemed to bespeak Allanrod
unwilling to comply with her request. If he were
in heart still her enemy, she wished his conduct

rather to be shewn to her at once in its true colours,
than thus to endure the pangs of suspence. On
either consideration, she prayed that his return
might not longer be protracted.
Whilst she sat with painful thought for her only
companion, in an apartment which received a faint
light from the thin crescent of a growing moon, that
was rising slowly above the ramparts of the castle,
dame Edith entered the room, with a much more
hasty step than she usually moved with, and throw-
ing herself, without ceremony, into a chair,—“I
am terrified out of my senses, my lady,” she cried;
“ I know not whether I stand on my feet or on my
head, with fear! Heaven send my lord may return
to the castle to-night, or I shall never dare to go
to my bed.”
The dame had brought with her a lamp, and
Rosalind saw real terror depicted on her counten-
ance.-“ What is it that has alarmed you ?” she
asked.
" A spirit-a most wicked and abominable spirit,
that haunts the castle!-Blessed be the Holy Ghost,
and grant that its appearance be not the foretelling
of the death of some of us !” replied the dame.
Rosalind's incredulity with regard to spirits has
already been shewn. Much as she had heard them
talked of, no report concerning them had ever yet
reached her, which had gained her credit to their
existence; and she had as regularly found that no
arguments can reason those who are disposed to
place belief in them out of the conceit: accordingly,

as she easily discovered old Edith to be one of that
class, she remained silent, hoping that she would
receive her taciturnity as a proof of her incredulity,
and go elsewhere to tell her story, which Rosalind,
at the present moment, felt particularly disinclined
to be teazed with.
But no—dame Edith was not to be disappointed
of her tale; she was willing to believe that Rosa-
lind maintained silence for the purpose of inviting
her to continue the narrative, and she proceeded
to recount, that the spirit had appeared to several
of the household in the course of the preceding
night, who had some taken to their beds, and some
gone half distracted, in consequence of what they
had seen ; that she knew she should die, if it ap-
peared to her, which she did not seem at all in-
clined to do just yet, old as she was ; and that her
anxiety for the return of lord Rufus proceeded, not
from any particular receipt which he possessed for
returning such air-born forms to their original va-
pour, but in order that his permission might be
obtained to send for a priest who was competent to
perform the task for him.
The dame would talk, and therefore Rosalind
was obliged to hear a long account of the different
situations in which the alarming spirit had been
seen, and of the different persons who had beheld
it, and their degrees of bravery under the sight,
which she concluded by saying, that the ghost was
dressed from top to toe in black armour, and that
its face was pale and livid, like that of a corpse,
with a streak of blood down the left check.

This last sentence arrested the attention of Rosa-
lind : she was struck with the resemblance that
dame Edith's description bore to the ghost which
Gertrude had some time before informed her had
been seen at De Mowbray Castle, and which had
passed the drawbridge, to the great terror of old
Ambrose, the porter, and Plilip Watkins, the
sentinel.
The singularity of the incident made a forcible
impression on her mind. On the evening of her
father's departure from his castle, she believed that
she had heard herself called upon by name, when
wandering for air on the ramparts, and that at the
same moment she had seen a dusky figure in the
act of rising above the parapet wall, which had im-
mediately disappeared on the sound of Gertrude's
voice. On the same evening of this occurrence,
Gertrude had informed her of the appearance which
had been witnessed at de Mowbray Castle. No
sooner was she arrived at Rockmount, than its in-
habitants were terrified by a vision exactly similar
to that which had been described to her to have
occasioned alarm to her father's household: there
was something undefinably strange in this coinci-
dence, which she could not so easily reconcile to her
mind as she would have done the
appearance of any
spirit which had been said to have assumed a differ-
entform :-according to the description which
dame Edith had given her, it seemed as if that par-
ticular appearance flew in her path, and fitted
around the spot which she inhabited.

Mysterious Freebooter.
CHAPTER I.
Is it come to this ?
JULIUS CÆSAR.
FOR the first time in her life, Rosalind felt a
sensation approaching to a belief in the existence
of supernatural forms ; why she now felt it, it was
difficult, nay, indeed impossible, for her to account,
even to her own heart. She was, however, too con-
scious that she did feel it, and almost joined dame
Edith in her apprehensions of some fatal event await-
ing on one of the inhabitants of the Castle—which
one she did not doubt to be herself; and her eyes
were turned slowly and fearfully around the apart-
ment, in united expectation and dread of encoun-
tering the vision pictured on her fancy.
The shrill blast of a horn caused her to spring
from her seat. Dame Edith jumped up hastily from
her's, and exclaiming—"Thank Heaven! my lord
is home-now we shall bear what is to be done,”
rushed out of the room.
The sound indeed, as she imagined, announced
the return of De Madginecourt to his castle, and the

intelligence of his arrival gave a fresh turn to the
thoughts of Rosalind, who momentarily expected
to see him enter her apartment, with the reply of
Allanrod to her request.
An interval of some length elapsed, and still he
came not. Some of the attendants appeared with
her evening repast, and judging that dame Edith's
conjecture concerning his arrival might have been a
mistaken one, she inquired of them whether it was
so or not?
One of the domestics replied, that lord Rufus
was returned to his castle, and had retired to his
chamber.
The information appeared strange to her; she
knew not whether to believe that it augured good or
evil : she feared the latter, and she endeavoured to
combat the disquietude of her mind, by traversing,
with hasty steps, the floor of her apartment. But,
alas ! the mind cannot fly from itself, nor are
momentary oblivions of care an actual relief to an
overburdened soul; memory, chased by art from
its seat, resumes its empire with a more powerful
and painful claim.
In about half-an-hour, Alwin, the page, entered
her apartment, for the first time since she had be-
come an inhabitant of the castle.-“ Lord Rufus
requests me to inform you, lady Rosalind,” he said,
“ that he is returned to his castle to-night, much
fatigued with the journey of the day; he therefore
trusts that you will receive this message as an apology
for his not visiting you to-night, and will allow

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 401
him to see you after the hour of breakfast in the
morning.”
Rosalind made a slight answer, and Alwin retired.
Every delay towards a knowledge of her fate in-
creased the anxiety of Rosalind; and, desirous of
passing the interval between the present hour and
the morning, in that state of forgetfulness which
she hoped sleep might grant her, she retired to her
chamber. Dame Edith followed her to it imme-
diately. The dame was, by no means, in a pleasant
humour. Lord Rufus had instantly retired to his
chamber on entering his castle, without paying the
slightest attention to the tale of terror she had
made an attempt of communicating to him ; and the
old lady seemed in actual fear of a summons to the
other world, by the spirit in armour, with the streak
of blood down its left cheek, before the morning.
Of the thoughts of Rosalind, when her head
rested on her pillow, the spirit in armour had by
no means an inconsiderable share. Her mind reverted
to occurrences of years gone by ; she recollected the
voice which had called to her father “to spare her,”
when, in the chamber where her mother died, she
was sinking at his feet, overwhelmed by the cruelty
of his commands to give her hand to lord Rufus,
and forget her Edward. What interceding voice
that was she had never been able to learn ; she now
fancied that there had been a resemblance between
that voice and the one which she had heard pro-
nounce her name a few weeks before on the ram-
parts of her father's castle: still this idea afforded

.
her no assistance in solving the enigma which ap-
peared to encompass her.
One consolatory reflection alone arose out of the
mass of ideas which crowded her mind : the voice
had been a friendly one, and if the voice and the
appearance therefore were one, she could have no-
thing to dread ; if they were not, if any ill were
haunting her, she had still this consolation within
her own breast—that she had not one evil action to
reproach herself with, and that innocence has never
any cause to fear.
At that hour in the morning, at which the message
lord Rufus had sent her, by Alwin, on the foregoing
evening, had taught her to expect his coming, he
entered her apartment.
He moved into it with a slow step and sorrowful
countenance, his eyes bent towards the ground.
Rosalind was standing by a window : he approach-
ed her, and making an inquiry after her health, in
scarcely audible accents, he led her to a chair, and
placed himself in one by her side.
Rosalind shuddered at his touch: never had she
regarded him in any point of view but that of dislike;
the narrative of the unfortunate Eloise had now
heightened her aversion almost to an insupportable
pitch.
Lord Rufus spoke thus" The most unpleasant
moment of my life, lady Rosalind, is now arrived.
It is impossible for me to express to you how ardent
has, for a long time past, been my desire to con-
vince you, that when I first rendered myself hateful


## p. 403 (#435) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 403
in your eyes, by the profession of that love which
swelled my heart—when I first ventured to ask, as
mine, the only hand which could have blessed my
life, I was urged into the declaration of my feelings
by your father, who, instead of informing me that
there were prior claims on your affection, induced
me to believe your sentiments congenial with my
own. This encouragement given to the fondest
wish of my heart made love the tyrant of my soul;
and when I found my hopes deceived in you, that
master-passion of the human mind poured an in-
flaming madness through my veins, that led me
blindly into a conduct of which the cause alone can
be the apology.”
He hesitated, as if expecting that Rosalind
should acknowledge, for truth, the avowal he had
just made. - -
“Proceed, my lord,” said Rosalind; “the past
has lost its power to wound; it is the present that
I wish you to speak of—Proceed.”
“Briefly then,” continued lord Rufus, “believe,
that I have, for a length of time, most sincerely
repented that one so excellent, so deserving of hap-
piness as yourself, should, from her first knowledge
of me, have dated her acquaintance with sorrow—
that every moment of my latter years has been em-
ployed in plans for proving to you that repentance,
and, as far as lay within the limits of my slender
ability, restoring you to comfort. From this avowal
your father's changed opinion of me has debarred
me; no opportunity was given me for entering

404
MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
your presence, or imploring your forgiveness, and
I almost began to despair of ever having it in my
power to make confession to you of my penitence.
At length-oh, blessed chance! the hour arrived
at which it was given me to serve you. The law-
less ruffian, Allanrod, besieged your father's castle,
and Heaven made me the engine of your rescue
from brutality.”
A pause ensued. Lord Rufus rose from his seat,
and moved to the other side of the apartment, appa-
rently overpowered by the emotions of his heart ; in
a few moments he returned to his seat, and pro-
ceeded thus :
Oh, lady Rosalind ! I once loved, but the es-
teem, the reverence I now feel, points out to me,
that there is a greater joy in giving happiness than
in receiving it. Oh, had my feelings then been
what they now are--had my kind genius whispered
to my heart, 'Receive thy bliss from seeing her
thou lovest happy in the arms of him to whom her
heart is given-make it thy felicity to know that
thou hast constituted theirs ! But that hour is past
—that moment cannot be recalled, and all that is
now left me is to repair, what I would give worlds
that I had placed beyond the need of reparation.”
“Even in your power as I am at this moment,
and repentant as you profess yourself,” replied
Rosalind, “I am too much hardened in the school
of suffering to fear to tell you that your declaration
makes not the impression on my mind which you
probably expected it would ; but I will also tell you

will say
how you may gain my future credit, if you
that your interferance has procured me the grant of
being placed under the immediate protection of my
queen."
“ There is the sting !—there is the wound that
galls !” exclaimed lord Rufus. Oh, that villain
Allanrod !—the monster refuses your petition-Ill-
fortune be his recompence !-Oh, lady Rosalind !
have I not reason to exclaim that this is the most
wretched moment of my life, when the perversity
of my fate withholds me from the performance of
that action which might gain me the only esteem I
covet to be blessed with ?"
Rosalind fixed her eyes on those of lord Rufus ;
she would have darted them, if possible, into his
soul, and have read in it whether she was his pri-
soner or Allanrod's. His warm declarations of re-
pentance for a moment led her to believe them real ;
then again, a vivid recollection of the past burst
upon her mind, and she saw him all a villain.
On the countenance of Rosalind, lord Rufus read
what was passing in her heart.--"You doubt me
still, I perceive,” he said ; “ you are placed, lady,
in a situation that authorizes your suspicions, but
you shall have proof that, with regard to myself,
they are ill-founded ; though my own ruin ensue,
you shall be preserved spotless. No, though De
Madginecourt perish in your defence, your lips shall
not be sullied by the kiss of a base robber-your
bosom shall not be contaminated by the embraces
of a freebooter!"

( what
“Oh, heavens !” exclaimed Rosalind,
mean these words ?-what new terrors are those you
hint at ? Explain, explain—do not, in mercy, do
not torture me thus with maddening apprehensions !"
“ Fear nothing; thou shalt be saved !” cried lord
Rufus.
“ From what ? - from what ?” asked Rosalind.
“ From becoming the wife of Allanrod,” returned
De Madginecourt.
" The wife of Allanrod !” echoed Rosalind.
“ Does he seek to make me his wife ?—The wife of
Allanrod !"
“ This is the secret that my bosom laboured
with-this is the secret that has thus long detained
me from your presence, since my return to my cas-
tle,” replied lord Rufus. “ Skilful in plans,' the
freebooter projects an alliance with you, that, by
becoming connected with the family of De Mowbray,
its intercession may procure him pardon from the
crown, to which he is in momentary dread of his
lawless life becoming forfeit.”
“ And it is really your wish to save me from his
wiles ? asked Rosalind.
“ So witness for me, Heaven !” replied De Mad-
ginecourt.
“ Then give up Allanrod to the crown,” pro-
nounced Rosalind, with emphasis, " as his lawless
existence merits, and I am saved.”
Lord Rufus clasped his hands with violence toge-
ther, and let his head fall upon them. After a pause
-"That cannot be,” he pronounced in a low voice.

so in
“ You say you wish to save me,” continued Rosa-
lind, " and yet reject the means that would preserve
me!
I feel myself justified in considering your
repentance of the same character with your pro-
fessions, and regarding you as I have ever done, a
combination of fraud and perfidy.”
“ You know not,” returned lord Rufus,
how dreadful a strait I am placed ; you despise my
actions, because you are ignorant of the motive
from which they spring ; you doubt my fervour in
your cause, because I dare not shew you the secret
ties by which I am bound to extend it to you only
within certain limits. Is it not enough for me to
say, that you shall be saved, if my power, my wealth
my arm can effect it?-But it cannot, must not,
be done by means of placing you under the pro-
tection of the queen ; such a step would be certain
perdition to myself. Give a patient moment to
consideration, and then tell me whether it can be
the principle of your heart to return evil to me for
the good I pant to confer on you? No, no; such, I
am certain, are not the sentiments of your breast.”
Once more Rosalind inclined towards his argu-
ments, and almost believed him her friend. It was
not the nature of her heart to wish to return evil for
good ; her feelings were the immediate reverse. She
looked at lord Rufus, and beheld him pacing the
room in a hurried manner, that bespoke his mind
ill at ease.
Her heart again softened towards him,
as she conceived it possible that his desire to make
ber reparation for his past conduct might be the

principal cause of his present involvements->" If,”
she said, " you reject the obvious means of ensur-
ing my security, you will not doubtless hesitate to
inform me what those are which you intend to adopt
in their stead ?"
“ Allanrod,” replied lord Rufus, “ gives us but
till to-morrow's eve for our separate decisions--to
me, whether I will surrender you at his request, or
submit to the besieging of my castle ?—to you,
,
whether or not you will voluntarily become his
victim ? I have heard your resolution, lady Rosa-
lind, and my own has been long formed. Let him
and his myrmidons come ; let them direct their un-
just force against my castle; let them dash down
stone from stone, until the entire fabric become a
pile of ruins, they shall not, in their victory, find
the spoil they seek. The triumph of Allanrod shall
lack the only prize he pants to obtain-Rosalind
shall not be found by him in Rockmount Castle, nor
upon the spot it stands on.”
“ You speak in riddles,” returned Rosalind.
“I will solve my last declaration to you,
if
you
enrol it amongst the other riddles I have been con-
strained to put to you,” answered De Madginecourt,
“ You shall, lady, be removed from hence to a place
of security, before the freebooter comes. I have
fixed my plans for your disposal; the consideration
of a sleepless night has presented me with the means.
I fear to send you away from my castle openly, lest
there should be spies from Allanrod lurking in the
neighbourhood, who might either detain you on

your road, or convey to him intelligence of your
route ; in either of these cases, I should be equally
miserable with yourself, in the failure of my earnest
desire to save you from his justly hated power.”
“Pray proceed, my lord,” said Rosalind, al-
most breathless with agitation, and impatient for
the conclusion of his plan.
“Beneath this castle, he continued, “is a secret
passage, which leads nearly half a league into the
country westward; at its extremity is a habitation
—I know not scarcely what to name it, a cell or
grotto—once possessed by a solitary man, my
friend; thither will I, during the night which shall
succeed this day, myself conduct you; a faithful
attendant, who shall be your companion during
your stay there, shall alone accompany us, and
alone be acquainted with your retiring thither, which
precaution must inevitably secure us from treachery.
There you shall remain till the issue of the threat-
ened siege be past, and I will then, myself appear
to conduct you to some spot of future safety.”
The eyes of lord Rufus were raised to Rosalind;
they bespoke him awaiting her affirmative to his
proposition. The lights and shades of his character
were alternately passing before her mind, and she
leant successively to each. There might be some
secret enmity to her peace, her life, depending on
her compliance with becoming the inhabitant of the
cell he had described, which, once arrived there, it
might be too late for her to repent not having
guarded against, by refusing to go to it: but then,

410 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
want of compliance might yield her up to the bru-
tality of Allanrod, when the advice of lord Rufus
promised to preserve her from his power. The mo-
ment of indecision was dreadful ; it was laden with
apprehensions that racked her brain.
At length lord Rufus urged her reply. With an
emphatic tone she spoke thus —“Lord Rufus,
you have already, during our conference this day,
yourself allowed that my suspicions of your fair
conduct towards me, after what is past, are not
without justification. They must sufficiently explain
to you the hesitation which you now see me labour-
ing under—my reply is still wanting. I feel my-
self entirely in your power; I feel that I cannot be
more so on any spot of the globe than I am under
the roof of your own castle, where every domestic
is doubtless the submissive performer of his lord's
actions. Thus, assured that you need not carry
me hence to inflict on me any barbarity which you
may have doomed me to suffer in revenge for your
once-slighted love, I think it probable, from your
offer just made to me, that it may indeed be your
intention to save me from the misery of becoming
the victim of this inhuman Allanrod. Carry me
therefore to the spot you have described; my
thanks I must reserve till you again call upon me
to leave it.”
With numberless repetitions of the ecstacy he de-
rived from befriending her, lord Rufus received her
reply to the proposition he had advanced to her
consideration, and then left her, to prepare his sol-

411
diery for the attack upon his castle by the myste-
rious freebooter.
The strangeness of her fate overwhelmed Rosa-
lind with terrors inseparable from open danger, and
which increase in proportion to the mysterious shade
which envelopes it. She knew that lord Rufus had
an invention equal to the conception of any project,
and daring talents to carry him through its execu-
tion; and she had also learnt enough of his past
life, during her residence in his castle, to convince
her that he had a heart too void of feeling to forego
the perpetration of any act which his interest or his
desires might require the performance of. As she
dwelt on these considerations, a thousand nameless
terrors, which exist in the most enlightened minds,
and which set reason and examination equally at
defiance, added horror to her thoughts ; and her
present situation appearing to her more tolerable
than the offered change, she now resolved to await
the event of the siege where she was.
Towards evening lord Rufus again entered her
apartment. He came, he said, to inquire which
of his household she would prefer as her attendant
and companion, during the time it would be neces-
sary for her to remain at a distance from a castle?
Almost trembling to speak it, Rosalind informed
him that her sentiments were changed, and that
whatever danger might await her remaining in the
castle, she felt a reluctance to quit it.
" Dearest Rosalind !” exclaimed lord Rufus-
pardon the familiarity of the expression-1 entreat

you to be guided by my advice ; for your own safety,
do not distrust my words. Were my intentions
towards you evil, were my aim even at your life,
would it not be as easy to me to take it here as on
any other spot ?"
“Do you mean to avow by that question," asked
Rosalind, pointedly, “ that you have already found
this castle a spot suited to a deed of that horrid
nature ?"
His countenance fell; the throbbings of his breast
could not lie concealed beneath the corslet of mail
which he wore, and he said, in a voice of tremour,
which he sought to disguise under a forced smile-
" What means the lady Rosalind ?”
The reflection of an instant convinced Rosalind
that she had hazarded too much by this hint; a
confession of the knowledge she was possessed of,
relative to the fate of his wife, might turn him into
her most deadly foe, at the very moment when he
was, perhaps, sincere in his friendship. She
checked her rising feelings, and, with all the calm-
ness she could command, she replied" Women's
fears often lead them to speak without meaning, as
well as to feel sensations they cannot account for.
The long and gloomy passages, and vaulted halls,
which compose a building of the extent of this cas-
tle, when my spirits are depressed, always seem to
convey to my senses some tale of horror in the
breeze that rustles through them; and my lord can-
not suppose that my fate, at this moment, leaves
my mind its wonted strength.”

413
Lord Rufus did not look as if he were perfectly
satisfied with her explanation, but he forced a second
smile upon his countenance, and began to renew
his entreaties to her to leave the castle. Again the
mind of Rosalind wavered, and once more she ac-
ceded to his plan.
He urged her to name the companion she should
prefer. She believed all those who composed his
household to be alike indifferent to her, and replied
to that purpose." Then,” said De Madginecourt,
your companion shall be Edith, and your atten-
dant my own page, Alwin.”
This proposition convinced her that all who com-
posed his household were not equally indifferent to
her. To Alwin, a combination of circumstances
had given her an insuperable aversion. Policy again
withheld her from confessing all she felt, and she
merely said—“ I shall feel happier with only Edith
for my companion.”
“So then it shall be,” he answered ; " and at
the hour of your departure, Edithi, shall select some
vassal, whom she approves, that you may not be
destitute of the means of sending, upon any emer-
gency, to the Castle."
Rosalind continued silent. Lord Rufus promis-
ed to come to her apartment when the castle was
buried in sleep, and again retired.
Rosalind then threw herself upon a couch, and
gave vent to her tears ; her overburthened heart
required the relief of weeping.--" How strange!
--how inexplicable is my fate!” she exclaimed.

ist a man on earth whom I should dread more than
dord Rufus ?-that I should ever have consented to
have fled for protection, under his escort, from a
being more terrible to my imagination than him-
self? Almighty providence ! thine omnisciencesleeps
not to the miseries of an imperfect being like myself.
I know thee merciful; I know thee just ; I ask of
thee only strength to endure the trials thy wisdom
has ordained me to pass through ; grant me thy
support, and I am still blessed.”
With her mind thus impressed, Rosalind retired
to the solitude of her chamber, and passed some
time in addressing herself to Heaven for support
and protection ; and she rose from her devotions
with a composure of feeling which seemed to pro-
mise her that her prayers were accepted at the
Throne of Comfort.

temporary departure from it, by her lord, she in-
formed Rosalind that the person she had fixed upon
as their attendant, was a grand-nephew of her own,
who was almost the only well-behaved male in the
castle, for he had profited somewhat by her in-
structions, and she had at least taught him to hear,
see, and say nothing.
The whole evening the old dame was employed
in packing up a couple of baskets of provisions and
deciding on what books she should take with her in
her pockets. She must have food, she said, for
the mind as well as the body-it was not her way
to feast on meat, and starve for sense ; she did not
doubt, she added, but that they should pass the
time very pleasantly ; the grotto was a charming
place, in her opinion, and situated in a beautiful
grove.
“ I thought it was buried beneath the rocks,"
said Rosalind, “ at the extremity of a subterraneous
passage leading from the castle.”
Ay, that's the way you get to it," replied the
dame," and part of it is under ground, sure enough,
when you are got there, but the other part is like a
neat cottage above ground. I have often seen it
formerly ; I can't say that I have been there of late
at all. No, no, your ladyship, you are mistaken
if you thought it was a dull place, like the cave of
Polyphemus; it is, I dare say, almost as pleasant
as the grotto of Calypso. Now I think of it, my
lady," continued the dame, after a pause,
take that book of the Odyssey in my pocket, and

then we can read about Calypso, and compare her
grotto with ours.”
Fortunately for Rosalind, if the dame did but talk
herself, she cared not whether the person whom
she addressed replied to her observations or not;
thus Rosalind was allowed to indulge herself in si-
lent reflection, whilst Edith continued talking
without cessation. “ It is a glorious thought of my
lord's, sending you to this grotto,” she went on,
"! to preserve you from the malice of this freebooter;
for such love as his I can only call malice, as he has
never seen you, and only wants you for the wick-
edest of purposes. Pray Heaven he may get shot
through the head in the siege ! But I'll tell you what
surprises me, my lady—don't it you? that if my
lord knows where to see this Scotch robber, and
hold conferences with him, and so forth, he does
not contrive at once to make him his prisoner, and
deliver him up to justice.
Without a reply to this remark, dame Edith
would not rest satisfied. Whatever Rosalind's own
opinion of lord Rufus was, she scorned to give it
to any one but himself, and answered—“There are,
doubtless, obstacles in the way of his effecting it,
which are not known to us."
“ True, my lady; the men say we are no poli-
ticians,” returned the dame, " but I am a woman
of courage, and if I were a lady of rank"
At this moment a rap upon the door frightened
away both dame Edith's courage and rank, and she
dropped into a chair, exclaiming—" Heaven pre-
serve us! what noise is that?"

The pleader for entrance was no other than her
nephew, Zachary, the destined companion of their
temporary seclusion, who overheard her exclama-
tion, and removed her alarm by announcing him-
self to his grandaunt; she immediately opened the
door to him, and apologized for the indifferent spe-
cimen she had given of her vaunted courage, by
saying, that ever since the ghost in the black ar-
mour, with the streak of blood down its left cheek,
had haunted the castle, she had not been like the
same woman in fortitude that she used to be before,
—that is, dame Edith, like many others, both be-
fore and since her time, was very courageous when
she saw nothing to be afraid of.
The figure in armour had not recurred to the me-
mory of Rosalind till the present moment, since the
time of her conversation in the morning with lord
Rufus ; and she now inquired, with some degree of
eagerness, whether it had again been seen since the
dame had given her an account of its appearance ?
No, no, Heaven be praised !" returned the
dame, “not that I have heard of ;” and Zachary
confirmed that it had not been seen during the last
night.
Rosalind eyed Zachary with an inquiring eye, on
account of the part which had been assigned him by
his aunt, who, she imagined, might have been ac-
tuated in her choice of an attendant by a hint from
her lord; but with his appearance she felt satisfied.
He had a countenance which plainly bespoke its
affinity to a heart devoid of the abilities for fraud

or stratagem. Zachary was one of those beings who
bear a continual smile on their countenance, and
seem content to wear out life with eating and
sleeping
Zachary himself had not been one of those who
had seen the spirit, and his senses were too dense
to have been alarmed by the sight, if ever he had.
One of the grooms, he said, who had been one of
those to whom it had appeared, believed that it had
vanished round a nook which led to the subterrrane-
ous passage, along which Rosalind had agreed to
pass that night.
Dame Edith's terrors began now to be excited,
lest they should meet the spirit in their way to the
grotto. Zachary laughed at her apprehensions, and
promised, if they did, to give the ghost a black
eye, or knock out some of its teeth ; upon which
dame Edith began a long harangue to him upon
his
ignorance, which she followed with a learned dis-
sertation upon the aerial nature of spirits.
At the end of her discussion Zachary burst into
a loud laugh.—“ You may as well leave off talk-
ing,” he said; “I am sometimes afraid of flesh
and blood, but your learning will never persuade
me to be afraid of air, I can promise you.
“ Oh, what a blessing," pronounced Rosalind
mentally, “ is insensibility! Why do philosophers
labour to be wiser still, when they can never return
to that blissful state of ignorance from which they
began their career after knowledge ?”
A few minutes after the castle clock had struck

eleven, lord Rufus came to Rosalind's apartment ;
he had a cloak thrown over his shoulders, which, he
said, was to protect him from the damps of the sub-
terraneous passages, and he had brought with him
another, of skin, for Rosalind, which he assisted
her in putting on. When dame Edith and Zachary
were laden with their respective stores, they all left
the apartment ; lord Rufus prevailed on Rosalind
to support herself on his arm, and with every en-
couragement which words could give her to believe
him her friend, he led her along.
They passed through various parts of the castle,
all alike unknown to Rosalind, who had only once
visited the garden, and once the rampart bordering
on the sea, since her residence in it. After some
time they arrived in a long vaulted passage, which
Rosalind would have concluded to have been the
aisle of a church, had the corresponding parts of
the building confirmed the idea ; but she soon found
that it was an outlet from the castle to the conceal-
ed path through the rocks leading to the grotto.
“ The subterraneous passage we are approach-
iny,” said lord Rufus, was, doubtless, dug out
of the rocks at some distant period from the present
time, when men sought refuge from their enemies
in the bowels of the earth.”
" Alas !” said Fosalind, “ that the hours of that
necessity were passed for ever!”
“ May it please Heaven,” returned lord Rufus,
“ since the necessity still exists, that we may owe
them our thanks for having afforded you the pro-

tection which you are doomed to seek from them.
At the extremity of the subterraneous passage,” he
continued, “on the spot where the habitation I
mentioned to you now stands, was once situated,
"as I have understood, a tower of great strength,
connected with this castle; its vestiges are still to
be traced, and it was doubtless for the purpose of
escaping thither from the castle in the time of as-
sault, that this passage was constructed.”
On arriving at the end of the vaulted passage,
which grew narrower towards its extremity, a range
of dark wainscoting presented itself to their view.
Lord Rufus disengaged his arm from that of Rosa-
lind, and placing his hand upon a particular part
of the wall, which concealed a spring, a door flew
immediately open. Again he drew the arm of Rosa-
lind through his, and led her on ; they entered
what appeared the ruins of a chapel, and her con-
ductor confirmed her in her opinion, by saying,
that it had once been so to Rockmount Castle. Rosa-
lind cast her eyes almost fearfully around on the
walls, green with damps, and the high and pointed
window-frames, which had become the supporters
of the creeping ivy and the luxuriant nightshades,
in whose clusters roosted the owl, the bat, and the
rook, which, on the interruption given to their
midnight meridian by the intrusion of the light
emitted from the flambeau carried by Zachary, sent
forth those dismal shrieks which communicate su-
perstitious shiverings to the hearts of those whose
ears they assail.


## p. 421 (#453) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, 421
They proceeded onwards, and as they passed
through a deep vault, which Rosalind conceived to
have been the cemetary of the castle, her eye fell
on some broken columns, which had once supported
the roof, and whose capitals were now hidden by
the overshadowing briony; and as they rested on
them, she fancied she saw a figure in black dart from
behind one of them, and disappear again amidst
a cluster of tombs, which were barely discernible
through the thick shadow of night.
She started at the sight, and lord Rufus inquired
what affected her ? She felt averse to confessing
her alarm, as she was resolved not to communicate
to him the impression which had been made on her
mind by the various rumours which had reached
her ear concerning the figure in armour, and pre-
tended that she had only stumbled over a part of
the rugged and broken pavement.
Zachary and dame Edith were silent; of course
they had not seen the figure glide from behind the
shaft of the pillar; her imagination, she conceived,
might have deceived her, and she was inclined to
believe it had. Still she proposed to her own mind
a question, which proved that she did not believe
the appearance to have been solely the offspring of
imagination; and this question was, whether, if she
had really seen a figure at that moment, it had
been the one described to her in black armour?
On leaving the chapel and its precincts, Rosalind
and her companions entered the subterraneous pas-
sage. The cavity they were to pass through was
3 I

hewn out of the bosom of the solid rock; dank
vapours there assailed their senses, and the damps
distilled their aguish drops upon their heads.
They had proceeded only a few steps into it,
when lord Rufus said—“ My motive, lady Rosa-
lind, for conducting you myself away from my
castle by night you are already well acquainted with ;
it is to confute the treachery of such as might not
be proof against the bribes or threats of Allanrod,
should he be the conquerer of my castle, and hold
out to the weak the promise of reward for the disco-
very
of
your place of concealment, or the terror of
punishment for the withholding of the desired in-
formation. The shorter the time therefore that
I am absent from my chamber this night, the safer
our plan, as any knowledge of my leaving it might
lead to a suspicion of the cause, and thus to a disco-
very of the transaction that has marked the hour.
The path hence to the grotto is straight-dangerous
it cannot be ; I will therefore here bid
you
farewell.
Good angels guard you, lady! Depend on seeing
me the instant I can appear to you without danger
to yourself.”
As Rosalind had already acquiesced thus far in
his plan, she had no reason for dissenting from this
immaterial part of it: and accordingly, with an en-
treaty that he would, as soon as possible, give her
information of her doom, she suffered him to depart,
and proceeded onwards with dame Edith and Zachary.
As she moved along, her faithful Gertrude recur-
red to her imagination, and she lemented more than

423
ever her separation from the affectionate girl. At
his departure from Rockmount Castle to his meet-
ing with Allanrod, lord Rufus had promised to
make the restoration of Gertrude a part of his re-
quest to the freebooter. Weightier matter to her
own happiness had occupied her mind since his re-
turn, and she had not made any inquiry of him
concerning her attendant ; but she doubted not that
every other consideration had been sunk in the de-
mand Allanrod had made of her person.
About half-an-hour brought them to the extre-
mity of the subterraneous passage. A low arch,
hewn out of the rock, presented itself to them; they
stooped, and passed through it. It was the en-
trance into what dame Edith called the grotto; to
Rosalind it appeared solely as a small apartment
cut out of the earth, which owed its walls merely
to the spade. In the middle of it stood arude table,
and seats of an equally indifferent workmanship were
scattered about; on one of these, dame Edith,
panting and puffing with her long walk, sought im-
mediate rest, and Rosalind instinctively followed
her example.
“ This is not the apartment we are to inhabit,"
said the dame,“ that is up those stairs,” pointing
to some steps in one corner of the place; “we will
go up them in a minute, but I am so unused to
walking, that my bones ache as if I had been
beaten.'
Rosalind's eye kept roving round the place, al-

though there was no object of sufficient importance
for it to fix upon.
In a few minutes the dame was ready to ascend
into the upper apartment. She took the light, and
Rosalind followed her. The stairs led them to a
neat room, furnished in the style of a cottage ; a
door, opposite to the one they entered by, led them
into a second room, similar to the first ; and these
were all the apartments of which the building con-
sisted. There was in each of them only one long
and narrow casement. Rosalind raised her eyes to
that in the first room, and, from the blank it pre-
sented to her sight, she imagined the night to be
dark; but from the second, she caught a view of a
resplendent moon, glittering through the foliage of
some surrounding trees, which convinced her that
some interposing substance threw a shade upon that
in the first apartment.
Trivial as these circumstances may appear to a
mind at ease, they are such as the heart, suspicious
of treachery, investigates with the nicest scrutiny.
A door in the second apartment, which was
bolted within, next attracted her observation.
" Whither does this lead ?” she asked her compa-
nions. “Out upon the country,” returned the
dame ; " here are a few knots of trees on this side
the cottage, then a field, and next the high road;
for every step we have set to-night from the castle
has been a step away from the sea-shore into the
land: you can hardly hear the roaring of the sea
here."
.

The possibility of an escape now struck the mind
of Rosalind, and darted a flash of joy across her
heart; but, upon a moment's reflection, the pleas-
ing impression faded away. Whither should she
fly? The roads were utterly unknown to her; and,
if she were acquainted with them, faintness and
fatigue must overwhelm her ere she could reach a
place of safety, as she was entirely ignorant where
to seek her father, and had no protector but the
queen, towards whom she could bend her steps. If
she were even to hazard the event of flying from
lord Rufus (could she escape the vigilance of her
companions, who were doubtless commanded to
keep a strict watch over her actions), and trust to
the guidance of any friendly stranger to whom
chance might lead her, she might, ere such a friend
was found by her, be encountered by Allanrod's
band, and her flight for safety become her ruin.
Restoration to peace, she concluded, might be the
issue of her remaining where she was ; to wander
forth alone upon the world was to court certain
danger.
In one of the apartments stood a couch; this
dame Edith prepared, with some clothes which she
had brought with her, in addition to some which
she found on the spot, for Rosalind to repose upon.
After some time the dame prevailed on her to retire
to it, but was resolute in not accepting that share
of it which Rosalind would willingly have given up
to her comfort; and wrapping herself up in the skin
cloak which Rosalind had worn during her walk

she placed herself in a chair by the side of a couch,
saying, that she could sleep as well sitting as lying,
and that if she did not sleep quite so long, or so
easily, she should enjoy her bed the more when she
returned to it, which she hoped would be the next
night, as she had understood from her lord that the
freebooter threatened to attack Rockmount Castle,
the next day, and she doubted not, from what she
knew of the bravery of its troops, that half an
hour's fighting with them would cool his courage,
and send him quietly about his business.
“Pray Heaven it may be sol” exclaimed Rosa-
lind, and sunk on her couch, not to sleep, but to
waking reflection. -
Zachary, according to his own account, could
have slept on a cannon; so the dame advised him
to take the stairs for his resting-place, and use the
threshold of the door, at their top, for a pillow, in
order that he might be near enough to hear her call,
in case she wanted him. He would have preferred
going down into the grotto, but the dame would be
obeyed; and in a very few minutes his snoring in-
formed her, that he did not sleep the worse for her
having selected his resting-place.
Rosalind slept as little as it can be supposed she
could do in her present novelty of situation, and
with her mind thus ill at ease; as soon as the first
streaks of returning day beamed through the case-
ment, she left her couch.
She wandered about her apartment, till the light
of day became sufficiently powerful to invite her to

the window. The first objects which struck her
sight were the distant battlements of the castle, ri-
sing above a cluster of trees that grew at their base,
and just tinged with the yellow gleam of the rising
sun; beyond them rose majestic hills, clothed with
oak and beech, which retired into a long perspec-
tive, and ultimately seemed to mix themselves with
the clouds.
Immediately before the window at which she
stood lay a flat country, of which the verdure was
scanty, and the vegetation barren ; it extended al-
most as far as her eye could accompany it, and at
length seemed to terminate at the foot of some
craggy steeps.
Having gazed some time on the scene which this
casement afforded her, she went to the other, which,
on the foregoing evening, she had imagined to have
been obscured by some outward object, and she
found that a bush of holly had been courted to twine
its spreading branches before it, so as almost to de-
priveit of the power of giving light to the apartmentit
was in. The ground immediately before the cottage
was marked by no tract which bespoke its door to
have been lately in use; unchecked weeds were
growing thickly around it, and the swallows flew to
its roof with a security that seemed to bespeak that
they had never met with any interruption from its
inhabitants.
Dame Edith, who had slept but indifferently du-
ring the night, was endeavouring to make herself
amends in the morning, and therefore Rosalind

moved about unnoticed by her; as for Zachary,
he was already at breakfast in the grotto below.
When Rosalind retired from the window, several
papers fastened upon the walls attracted her atten-
*tion; she went up to them, and found that they
contained different pieces of poetry; some of them
she perused ; they pleased her fancy, and she
sought for others. In pursuing her amusement, to
her surprise she encountered some lines which were
perfectly familiar to her—they had been given to her
by her lost Edward: he had informed her that they
had been written by the old man who had brought
him up, and at the supplication of whom, when on
his deathbed, lord William de Mowbray had taken
him under his protection. These were not only the
same lines, but in the same handwriting as those
which Edward had given to her as the composition
of old Matthews. Rosalind eagerly examined, in
turn, each separate piece contained on the walls of
the cottage, and found the characters of them all to
have been evidently traced by the same hand. The
lines with which she was already acquainted were
the following:—
THE SEAſ-SIDE.
When Evening's balmy breezes mildly blow,
And the bright orb of day is sinking low,
I wander to the shelvy ocean's side,
Where billows foam, or gently rolls the tide.
Sooth'd by the scene, discordant passious cease,
The soul is lull'd to happiness and peace ;
While contemplation takes the guiding rein,
And leads remembrance through a pleasiug train.


## p. 429 (#461) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTKR.
429
Who can the starr'd expanse unmoy'd behold,
Or see its azure surface ting'd with gold,
But must th' omnipotence of God adore,
And cease to doubt, if doubt he could before ?
Of life, an emblem is th' incessant change
From high to low, through which the billows rango :
How like to pain, when boisterous, rough, and wild !
How like to pleasure, when serene and mild !
Yon distant sail, an image too appears
of present pleasure damp'd by future fears;
For yonder clouds a threatping gloom portend;
The present calm may in a tempest end.
Thus in the noontide of our early days,
When joyous hope in expectation plays
About the heart, we feel its transports beat,
In sweet vibrations round its native seat.
Ah! happy moments, sources of delight!
Why thus on hasty pinions wing your flight ?
Ah! happy days of innocence and ease!
Why do you fly for those less sure to please ?
Less sure to please---because each passion grows
Asage increases ; thus the riv'let flows,
At first soft murmuring o'er its pebbly bed,
Till swell’d by rains, its roaring torrents spread.
Not a single word through all the stanzas varied
from the copy which Rosalind had, years before,
received of the same lines from her Edward, at De
Mowbray Castle; and the more she examined the
writing, the more fully she was convinced that it
was the same. The strangeness of the circumstance
wakened in her mind an ardent curiosity to learn
who had been the former inhabitant of the grotto
she might from such a knowledge unexpectedly
learn who were the parents of her never-to-be-for-

gotten Edward; she might discover the existence
of some beings to whom she was at present un-
known and to whom it might require her only to
acknowledge herself as his wife, to constitute them
her friends, as well as relatives.
The idea cheered her more than any which had
for some time received birth in herimagination, and
she impatiently awaited the waking of dame Edith,
to whom she panted to propose the questions rising
in her mind. The dame listened attentively to her
inquiries, without knowing the cause from whence
they sprang ; the verses, she said, had often charm-
ed her, and she doubtless considered this a sufficient
reason for any other person being desirous of know-
ing by whom they were written; but of the author
she could give no farther account, than that he was
a man of a solitary disposition, and had resided
there some two-and-twenty years ago, but that
she knew not either his name, or whence he had
COIſle.
“ Did he die here 2° asked Rosalind.
" . . No, my lady,” returned the dame; “he grew, I
have understood, weary of the solitude he lived in,
and left the country.”
“It is strange,” said Rosalind, “as he has been
reported to me, both by lord Rufus and yourself, as
his lordship's friend, that he was not invited rather
to make the castle his abode than this lonely spot,
especially as the want of society appears to have been
a cause of dissatisfaction to him.”
“Why, indeed, so it does seem, true enough,”

replied the dame, “ but I can't tell why it was or
was not so.”
“ Did he live quite alone here ?” asked Rosalind.
Entirely so, I believe,” answered the dame.
“ He had no companion at all then,” said Rosalind
-" no son, no child ?"
“ Not that I ever heard of my lady: what
makes you ask the question ?" returned Edith.
Only,” replied Rosalind, endeavouring to con-
ceal her feelings, “ because in that case it must
have been lonely indeed.”
The subject was dropped ; dame Edith prepared
the breakfast, and Rosalind continued silent.
The day passed on heavily and mournfully to
the daughter of De Mowbray.-A companion, who
knows not sufficient of our secret history to feel
that interest in our fạte which can alone render con-
versation acceptable to our feelings, is less pleasant
than solitude ; and in order to avoid the necessity
of listening, at least for a while, to the old dame's
prattle, Rosalind took a pencil from her pocket,
and reflecting on the bliss which might have been
her's with her Edward, in a cot like the one she was
now an inhabitant of, had she been the child of hum-
ble cottagers, rather than the offspring of wealth
and splendour, she composed the following lines
THE PEASANT'S NEST.
Far in the depth of yonder glade,
Where plenty smiles around,
The peasant's nest uprears its head,
With moss and ivy crown'd.

?
Embower'd within the friendly shade
Of oaks' encircling arms,
It asks not art's insiduous aid,
To deck its native charms.
A little garden, trimm'd with skill,
Boasts not each Aower that blows;
But waters with its murmuring rill
The jess’mine and the rose.
Peace smiles beneath its humble roof,
Love dwells in every breast;
Each morn brings joy, for ah ! content
Has blest the peasant's nest.
“ Whoever thou art," exclaimed Rosalind," by
whom the lines I have this day perused were written,
whether thou art stillon earth, unconscious of my pre-
sent action, or from the blest abode of saints
lookest down upon me, pardon the sympathy by
which
my mind is drawn to an emulation of thine,
and despise not the impulse which leads me to place
are graced by genius and understanding ;” and with
these words Rosalind placed them upon the wall,
amidst those which she had already found there.
Dame Edith put on her spectacles to peruse them. .
"Well, they are sweetly pretty,” she cried, "and
the first that I ever read that were written by a la-
dy. Whatever the men may say to the contrary,
we don't know what we can do till we make the
attempt ; and it is my opinion, that any woman
might fix a pair of horns on the head of some man
or other, as Diana did on Acteon's, if she had but
the courage to try.”

The evening approached without any intelligence
arriving to Rosalind from lord Rufus, or any
sounds meeting her ear which she could construe
into a supposition of the attack upon the castle being
begun. At times she hoped that Allanrod’s threats
would end in words; at others, that lord Rufus
might still come to an accommodation with him,
and induce him to relinquish the demand of her hand.
The twilight had scarcely begun to expand its
raven wings, ere dame Edith obliged her nephew to
have recourse to the flint and steel, to produce a
substitute for the waning light of the sky, which
appeared absolutely necessary to the keeping up of
her spirits in her present solitary abode.
The lamp was accordingly placed upon the table,
and Rosalind and the dame drew round it.-"It ap-
pears strange to me,” said Rosalind,“ that, if it is
now two and twenty years since the former inhabi-
tant of this place left it, it should still remain in
the good order in which we found it, and the fur-
niture appear so little injured by the hand of
time."

" Oh, my lady,” returned Edith, "it has had
another inhabitant since then."
“ Indeed !" rejoined Rosalind ;
“ who might
that be ?"
“ A person my lord was good to,” answered the
dame, casting a significant glance upon her ne-
phew, who was at that time performing some office
in the apartment; “only a pensioner of my lord's.”
Rosalind perceived her disinclination to speak
before Zachary, and therefore said no more. In a
few minutes he went down into the lower apartment.
-" I did not like to answer your question before
him, my lady,” went on the dame, “because it is not
fit that such as he should know secrets with which
there can be no harm in your ladyship’s being ac-
quainted. The last person who lived here was
Zachary's foot was heard upon the stairs,
and again his grandaunt became silent.--" When
you have got what you want,” she continued, after
a pause, addressing him,
“ I desire you will keep
below; my lady and I are busy.”
“ So am I going to be,” replied Zachary,
am going to get my supper;" and he was on the
point of again descending the stairs when the sound
of a horse's feet caught the attention of Rosalind
and her attendants. It appeared to be moving at
full speed, and as they continued to listen, it seemed
to approach towards their habitation. The eyes of
Rosalind and dame Edith rested in silent inquiry on
each other. Rosalind could not suppose that lord
Rufus would send her information, except by the

subterraneous passage. Dame Edith actually be-
lieved that Allanrod had discovered Rosalind's re-
treat, and was coming in person to demand her ;
but she forbore to express her thoughts.
« What
can it be?” broke, at the interval of some mo-
ments, from the lips of each ; and the insensible
Zachary mechanically replied to their question-
“Only a horse.”
The clattering of the hoofs drew nearer and near-
er, and at length stopped immediately opposite to
the cottage ; a rap with a stick upon the door fol-
lowed, and, almost at the same instant, the voice of
a person, who had discovered through the casement
that there were inhabitants within, called out-
“ For the love of mercy, if ye are not callous to every
impulse of feeling, give us shelter beneath your roof!"
Oh, Heavens, what a demand ! exclaimed
dame Edith. " What is to be done ?"
“ Whatever our own situation,” replied Rosalind,
we should still have a hand of succour ready for
the children of distress. Let us inquire who makes
the demand.”
“ Surely you would not let any body in here ?”
cried dame Edith.
“ I know not that it is in my power to do so,"
returned Rosalind ;“ but we may be otherwise able
to afford them assistance, on a knowledge of their
wants.”
Again the same petition was advanced by the
pleader without, and Rosalind could discern that
the voice which uttered it was that of a female,

Rosalind mounted upon the step at the foot of the
casement, and opening a small portion of it, which
just admitted her face through the aperture, she
perceived a woman, whose countenance bore
marks of the deepest affliction, sitting nearest to
the head of the horse ; in one hand she held the
bridle, and with her other arm she supported a
man, who was placed behind her upon the saddle,
and whose countenance bespoke him suffering un-
der the severest pressure of illness.
“Oh, for the love of Heaven!” the woman
again began, “ admit us into your dwelling! My
wretched, my unfortunate husband, must else die
where you now behold him, when a little succour
from you may protract, perhaps recover him his
existence."
Oh, indeed, we can't let in any body to die
here,” cried dame Edith we are very sorry you
are going to lose your husband, but we can't do
that.”
Rosalind was in this instance the mistress of her
own actions, and attended not to the exclamation
of the dame. She looked stedfastly upon the coun-
tenance of the woman, and believed it to be one of
those which bespoke a heart incapable of ingrati-
tude-one which would sooner have suffered wrong
than inflicted it. The duty of charity had, from
her earliest youth, been impressed upon the heart
of Rosalind, as that of which the performance
raised her the nearest to Him who, though clothed
in every virtue, did not escape earthly suffering.

The afflictions she had herself endured had rendered
her heart every day more susceptible of the cala-
mities of her fellow-creatures, and she would rather
have suffered from the perfidy of an object who had
proved undeserving of her commiseration, than to
have lived under the self-reproach of having refused
to stretch out her hand to a being who might have
perished from her neglect.—“ If it is in my power
to assist you,” she said, “I will.” She called to
Zachary, and, in a decisive tone of voice bid him
make the attempt of opening the door, which si-
lenced dame Edith, and left her only her grimaces
to shew her discontent of Rosalind's proceedings by.
The bolts were rusted in their sockets, and the
door itself had sunk upon its hinges, and settled it-
self an inch or more into the ground; but these ob-
stacles the strength of Zachary soon overcame, and
an entrance to the dwelling was opened to the un-
fortunate strangers. The female requested assist-
ance to take her husband from the horse ; Zachary
went out to her aid, and in a few minutes the sick
man was brought in, and laid, at Rosalind's com-
mand, upon the couch where she had slept the night
before.
The woman, whose accent Rosalind perceived to
be Scotch, was unceasing in her thanks for the
kindness she was experiencing, and pronounced a
blessing on Rosalind, with every effort which she
made, but made in vain, to induce her husband to
taste the wine which she had received at the hand
of her benefactress.

The dress of both struck Rosalind as extremely
peculiar, and she knew not whether to conclude it
the dress of the Scotch, or a garb which would, in
any part of the world, have been considered as un-
common as it appeared to her. The dress of the
man was less particular than that of his wife: he
wore buskins, and a philibeg of plaid, over which
his coat hung down almost to his knees, but was
unbuttoned before, and discovered his plaid, mount-
ing in the form of a corslet to his neck. On his
head was a skin bonnet, bound down under his
chin with an handkerchief, which seemed to be
intended to preserve him from the cold, out of con-
sideration to his ill-health.
The woman appeared about forty years of age,
well made, tall, and stout of limb; her counte-
nance was more interesting thanhandsome; it owed
its facination principally to a pair of full black eyes,
of which the expression was very great, and which
gave an animation to the rest of her features. Her
dress was not confined by stays, but formed of
stuff, and bound round her waist with a strip of
the same material which composed her outer gar-
ment, and which ligature gave it the only distinc-
tion it had between waist and petticoat; from under
this peeped out a pair of russet boots: upon her
shoulders hung a cloak, and the hood of this was
thrown over a plaid bonnet on her head.
Still, extraordinary as were their dresses, they
did not bespeak poverty; nor did the manners of

the female represent her as a woman of a mean rank
in life.
“ It avails not,” she said, after a time; he must
die--I see he must. If thou hearest me," she con-
tinued, addressing her husband, whose head was
rested on her arm,
grieve not to leave me behind
thee; I rejoice that thou art going so soon to join
our sainted mistress."
“ You see they are only servants, my lady,"
whispered dame Edith to Rosalind.
In a few moments the man opened his eyes.
" Margaret,” he said, “ this hour is my last. I
have not been insensible, although unable to speak
to thee: I shall never, never be able to execute my
vow."
“ Have not I told you already not to let that
thought vex you ?” returned the woman : “ have
not I promised to execute it for you
?"
“Will you—will you indeed, Margaret ?” replied
the man; “ will you assume the courage to revenge
the murder of that blessed?" The word which
should have followed died away on his tongue.
“ Yes, by Heaven !” answered the woman :
"may I never enter those blessed regions of eternity,
where she now receives her recompence for all her
wrongs on earth, if I do not, with mine own hand,
justify her on her murderer ?”
“ I shall die happy, Margaret--I shall die happy !"
faintly pronounced the man, pressing her hand to
his lips.
A silence ensued.

“ Ye have been sufferers, it should seem,” said
Rosalind, from the unfair death of some lamented
friend?"
“ The death of an angel,” replied the woman,
emphatically “ It is true that she was too good
for earth—too pure to live in this wicked world ;
but still the crime of her murderer deserves equal
punishment, and it shall meet its merited recom-
pence.”
The time passed melancholily on.
Rosalind
could not induce the woman to be more explicit as
to herself than she had already been ; and the
mystery observed by her, added to the evidently-
approaching termination of the man's existence,
made her almost repent her charity, although she
carefully concealed her thoughts from dame Edith,
who would only have triumphed in her feelings,
without comprehending the sentiment that occa-
sioned them.
" Wherever I go," said the woman, the tears
streaming down her cheeks as she spoke, your
angelic benevolence will never be effaced from my
heart. There was a time when I knew only pros-
perity, but it is now long since my husband or my-
self have experienced such kindness as we have this
night received at your hands : we had once a friend,
a saint, an angel, like yourself.”—Her tears now
entirely choked her utterance.
May I not know who that friend was ?” asked
Rosalind, again self-satisfied that she had admitted
the strangers to her hospitality.

No, no,” she replied, “ that is the only request
which, in the gratitude of my heart towards you,
I could withhold from you ; but that must not be
You will shortly know who was my friend,
and who I am too ; but that must not be till that
friend is revenged.”
The hour-glass on the table had just told the
second hour of the morning, when the dying man
made an effort to raise himself upon the couch.-
Margaret,” he whispered forth.
“ I am here,” she replied—“ I am here."
Margaret,” he repeated,“ remember thy promise!”
“So bless me, Heaven, with life!” she returned ;
" it shall be done !"
A faint smile stole over his countenance, which
was followed by a convulsive sigh, and in a few
moments after he ceased to breathe.
The woman clasped her hands, and stood bend-
ing over the corpse.—“I lament thee not,” she said
“ all thy comforts on earth were fled, and thou art
now with the blessed in heaven; soon, soon shall I
join thee there—Prepare, my sainted mistress, to
give me welcome !"
She continued for some time hanging over the
body, and Rosalind, by the motion of her lips,
believed that she was in silent prayer; one word
only she heard of her oraisons, and that was the
word “ mistress,” of which, at her first use of it,
dame Edith had so readily explained the meaning,
but which Rosalind could not induce herself to re-
gard by any means in the same light.

Her prayer ended, she kissed the inanimate lips
of her husband, and then turning away from the
couch, wiped the tears from her face. This done,
she approached Rosalind, and falling upon her
knees before her, she caught her hand in hers.-
“Whoever thou art,” she said, “it is needless for
me to implore on thee the blessing of Heaven ;
thou hast a heart that must ensure it to thee. In
words adequate to my feelings it is impossible for
me to express my thanks, that your pity has saved
him, who now lies cold in death, from breathing
out his last sigh unsheltered from the biting air ;
give his remains a little earth, and if thy inheritance
in heaven be not already secured to thee, accept
for it the prayer of a dying woman.”
Having uttered these words, she rose from her
knees, and ran hastily out of the cottage ; Rosalind
followed her with her eyes, and saw her spring
upon her horse, on which she instantly set off at
full speed.

had no terrors for the mind of Rosalind, and draw-

ing towards the couoh, she examined the features
of him who lay extended upon it; they were calm
and serene-a satisfying assurance that he had died
at peace with Heaven.
Well,” cried dame Edith, "s of all the histories
I ever read, I never met with any thing equal to
what I have seen this night !-to bring an utter
stranger to die under one's roof, and to leave hiin
there too !—But some people have no consideration
at all.”
This last sentence was probably intended as a re-
proof to Rosalind, if she chose to take it, for having
admitted the dead man under her roof; for dame
Edith, with a courage very natural to piqued infe-
riors, ventured to express her dislike of what had
taken place when it was past, though she had not
dared to utter a syllable on the subject whilst the
action was yet undone, and her interference likely
to meet with a reprimand.
But Rosalind was too well satisfied with having
acted rightly, to he moved by the displeasure of the
old dame.
On the morrow she had every reason to expect a
recall from her present abode, and she felt no in-
convenience in giving up her couch for that night
to an unfortunate man, whose lifeless body must
else have been exposed to the rude attacks of animals
of prey upon
the
open
road.
“ And what are we to do with the body ?” in-
quired Edith.
“ Nothing,” replied Rosalind; will return

into the other apartment, and leave it ; when we
are recalled to the castle, it shall be buried.”
“My lord will think it finely odd to find a dead
man here when he comes back," exclaimed the dame.
“ If the sentiments which your lord professes to-
wards me are unfeigned,” replied Rosalind,“ he
will not see any thing reprehensible in my having
performed a charitable action.”
“I hope you will tell him I had nothing to do
with it,” the dame went on.
“ He will perfectly understand that without
explanation,” answered Rosalind, “as he made me
the mistress of this abode.”
This was a hint to dame Edith to put a stop to
her observations, which if she did not much relish,
at least produced the effect Rosalind desired to ob-
tain from it.
Rosalind and the dame wrapped themselves up
in cloaks, and placed themselves in chairs in the
first apartment.--" I durst not sleep, on any ac-
count,” said the latter, “in a room next a dead
man, especially a Scotchman.”
Rosalind could not forbear an inward smile at
the idea of the dead being feared, in proportion as
they were natives of one or another country.
The dame went on—" I am a true English sub-
ject, my lady ; I revere our queen with all my soul,
and hate the Scotch from my heart.' ”
The period at which dame Edith was talking was
a few weeks after the unfortunate Mary queen of
Scots had bowed her neck beneath the axe; and

the people of England having been influenced into a
belief that by her death their queen had been freed
from a most iniquitous foe, who had endeavoured to
hurl her from her throne, and usurp her seat on it;
condemned promiscuously all her countrymen with
herself.
Although Elizabeth was the godmother of Rosa-
lind, and she had heard only one side of the ques.
tion during the trial of the Scotch queen, still from
circumstances which she had singly gathered, but
which had rested on her mind, she had been led
privately to pity Mary's unfortunate lot, and to be-
lieve her, if not innocent, at least less guilty than
she had been represented, and most rigorously pun-
ished by the privation of life.
The dame, although shut for nearly a century
within the walls of Rockmount Castle, considered
herself by no means a less able politician than those
who visited the court; and she now began to des.
cant, with all the fury of bigotry, on the heinousness
of Scotch principles, and the universal wiekedness
which must of necessity be inherent in the Scotch
nation, when they had the example of most atro-
cious crimes set them in the person of their monarch
but that she trusted and hoped that the punishment
which had overtaken her would lead them all to
repentance, and that before they died, they would
bless the queen of England as the instrument of
their reformation.
The narrow-minded principles of the dame were
as much beneath the attention of Rosalind, as she
3

considered her arguments too contemptible for
reply. Rosalind was a firm adherent of Eliza-
beth, and bore her that love and respect which the
honour she had conferred on her at her birth de-
manded from her; but still she was not so blind in
her affection, as not to be able to distinguish that
the most perfect may be liable to single actions, but
for the performance of which the fame of their even
rectitude would raise them above the level of mor-
tality; and she could not forbear considering the
death of Mary as the single shade which dimmed the
otherwise unsullied lights of Elizabeth's character.
The dame passed the night in intervals of sleep
and conversation. Rosalind was content to wear
away the hours in passive expectation of the ensu-
ing morn, which at length arose with peculiar sere-
nity and brightness. Rosalind rejoiced at the ap-
proach of day, because it enabled her again to look
towards the castle, and form some idea whether the
threatened attack upon it had yet been made. The
dame rejoiced, because the light of day dispelled
from her mind her superstitious fears.
Rosalind stood at the casement some time before
the increasing light enabled her to discern the bat-
tlements of the castle, and when she could see
them, she discovered no cause to believe that the
forces of the freebooter had yet been planted before
them; indeed she believed it hardly possible that
the attack should be made without various sounds
reaching her. The dame endeavoured to persuade
her to suffer Zachary to go back to the castle, and

make inquiry; but this appeared, in every respect,
so openly to be frustrating De Madginecourt's plan
for her security, that she would not for an instant
admit the idea.
“We have no provisions to last us longer than
till night,” said the dame.
“When that hour arrives,” said Rosalind, “it
will be time enough to think of procuring more ;
besides, lord Rufus is acquainted with what stock
we brought with us, and will doubtless not allow
us to remain here in want : much may occur in the
course of the next twelve hours.”
The dame went to breakfast with an appetite that
seemed to bespeak her determined not to suffer their
stores to last beyond the time she had named, pro-
bably from her dread of remaining another night
under the same roof with an unburied Scotchman.
Rosalind continued standing before the window,
her mind occupied alternately by the mysterious
occurrence of the preceding night, and the strange
uncertainty of her own fate. Her eyes rested on
the grandeur of the scene before her, closed in on
every side by distant rocks, whose spiral tops were
illuminated by the rays of the rising sun, which
was creeping slowly above them into an azure fir-
mament, unspotted by a single cloud. At the foot
of the mountains, beyond the castle, she descried
a broad stream, which wound amongst the trees
that clothed their sloping sides, and was then seen
falling over the crags of a moreperpendicular steep;
now it appeared flickering beneath the golden sun-

beams, now gliding in a silver current under the
shadowing foliage of the woods.
The solid mass which composed the castle gave a
feature of the sublimest kind to the landscape ; and
the extent of the fortifications, which spread along
the plain, appeared the work of centuries, and
seemed to frown defiance on the attempts of an ene-
my to invade them. As her eye drew nearer home,
the ground sparkled beneath the dew-drops gemmed
by the sun ; and the song of the skylark, flying in
circles round the spot where its nest lay concealed,
gave a momentary glow to her spirits.
About two hours after sunrise, as her eyes were
stretched out towards the mountains, she perceived
a moving body descending from the summit of one
of them, on which the light of the sun rested with
peculiar brightness, and she concluded that it must
be a body of troops, whose arms glittered beneath
the reflection of its beams. She called upon Za-
chary to assist her conjecture, and he confirmed
the one she had already drawn.
Those then, Rosalind concluded, were the troops
of Allanrod, advancing to their attack upon Rock-
mount Castle. She inquired of Zachary at the dis-
tance of how many hours' march they were from it ?
and he replied, that they were a good way off, al-
though they seemed so near; for at the foot of the
mountain they were now crossing, there ran a river,
over which there was no bridge, and which was
not fordable in that part : thus on reaching the foot
of the mountain, they must turn to the left, away

from the castle as it were, in order to reach a shal-
low elbow of the stream which they could pass.”
His account appeared to be a just ore; for, in the
course of some time, Rosalind saw the moving
body, on which her eyes had been fixed, wind
round a knot of trees at the base of the mountain,
and disappear from her view.
· Several hours elapsed, during which no object
met the aching sight of Rosalind; at length the
faint sound of a trumpet broke the silence of expec-
tation.-" That is our trumpet upon the battlements
of the castle,” said Zachary ; “ I wonder whether
it will sound again.”
" What if it does?” asked Rosalind " what will
that imply ?"
“ A second blast, like the one we have just
heard, lady,” he answered, will announce the
approach of an enemy.”
A few minutes passed, and, at their expiration,
a second sound, similar to the first, was heard.
“ Was not that somewhat louder ?" asked Rosa-
hind.
“You only heard it plainer,” he returned, “be-
cause the wind happened to catch it, and sent it this
way. The attack will soon begin now, I warrant
me,” added Zachary, after a pause.
“ Thank Heaven, we are not there!” exclaimed
his aunt. “ Should those ruffians conquer, which
the saints forbid, we might have shared the fate of
the Sabine virgins."

sisted between the freebooter Allanrod and lord Ru.
fus, Rosalind began to inquire into the history of
the former, hoping that Zachary might, in his inter-
course with the soldiery of the castle, have learnt
some particulars relating to him, of which the pre-
sent moment might make him communicative; but
he appeared to know only the common story—that
he was a Scotchman, and headed a band of free-
booters.
“ If the siege is going to begin,” said dame Edith,
“ do, my lady, take my advice, and let us go down
into the cave below for safety : only think of the
consequence, if any of the wretches should come
this way, and discover our retreat."
“ We have nothing to apprehend from that,” re-
plied Rosalind.
“ On the level between us and the
ramparts of the castle, we could discover any one
who was approaching hither, long before they could
discern us, and it would be then time enough to
fly from them to the protection the cavern would
afford us
It is also very unlikely that any indivi-
dual of a troop like Allanrod's, bent on plunder,
should turn aside from the siege, to wander to a
mean cot like this. Lord Rufus doubtless knew us
secure in this situation, or he would not have placed
us in it,” she added ; for every apprehension of
De Madginecourt's infidelity to her cause had va-
nished, since the ocular demonstration which she had
received of the freebooter's troops advancing to the
attack of his castle : and she now only wondered
what concealed motive could have withheld lord Ru-

fus from delivering so determined an enemy into the
hands of justice.
Yes, yes, we are safe here,” said Zachary ;
“ if any of them were within arm's length of
the cottage, we could escape them. This trap,'
kicking his foot against the door at the head of the
steps leading into the cave below, “ has a spring
that they could never find out, and strength can't
master it ; for it is so made, that the harder it is
pressed upon, the faster it is—so let them come if
they will, say I.”
The sun was already past the meridian, and the
day, which had risen in cloudless splendour, was
now become overcast, and seemed to threaten a
storm ; the wind had rapidly risen to a considerable
height, and the swallow, skimming in uneven
mazes, scarcely above the level of the earth, mixed
its screams with the whistling gust.
The clouds moved heavily and almost impercepti-
bly along the sky, their weight upborne by the
strength of the breeze, and prepared to fall in tor-
rents upon the earth, as soon as they should lose
its sustaining aid.
“ Hark!” cried Zachary, suddenly—" there
they go !”
" What ?what?" asked Rosalind.
“ A fire from the castle, lady,” he replied ; "the
work's begun.”
Rosalind listened, but heard nothing; and she
was inclined to believe, from the appearance of the
clouds, that if Zachary had heard any sound, it
bad been that of distant thunder.

MYSTERIOUS FRELBOOTER,
How awful is suspense !-how much more toler-
able is the hour of actual suffering than the period
of doubt !-apprehension swells the worst of evils
beyond the magnitude of which we find them in en-
durance. Rosalind had reasoned with her mind,
till her arguments, by repetition, had lost all their
weight ; and she now beheld futurity robed in the
most gigantic horrors.
“ Was it not distant thunder you heard ?" asked
Rosalind.
Zachary's countenance indicated that he thought
it was not, and also bespoke him in the act of en-
deavouring to catch a repetition of the sound.
In a few moments it was repeated, with sufficient
strength to leave the less acute senses of dame Edith
no reason to doubt that it proceeded from musketry.
either on the ramparts of the castle, or of the ene-
my before its walls.
At intervals the volleys of firing were continued
with great rapidity, then again they ceased for
several minutes together; at each of these intervals
Rosalind believed that some decisive blow had been
struck ; but Zachary told her, that it required a
longer time to decide the event of an attack of this
nature, and that the cessation of the musketry was
occasioned by the occasional resources which each
party had to the bow and the sling.
The smoke rose in columns above the battlements
of Rockmount Castle, and spreading itself along
the plain, appeared like a snowy vapour, floating
between the eyes of Rosalind and the sable terrors of
the gloomy atmosphere.


## p. 453 (#487) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER. 453
Dame Edith sighed and groaned at every fresh
sound ; and by the closing of her eyes, and the
motion of her lips, Rosalind believed her to be in
prayer. Zachary did not speak when he was not
spoken to ; and Rosalind experienced that dreadful
sensation of seeing human beings around her, and
yet being conscious of their inability to pronounce a
sentence which could convey to her heart a single
particle of the consolation it so much stood in need
of.
Her head had fallen upon her hand, which was
rested on the frame of the casement, and she per-
ceived not how quickly the shades of darkness were
descending to the earth, till a vivid flash of light-
ning, which passed immediately before her sight,
drew her eyes again to the window.
The castle was now barely discernible; indeed
she believed that her imagining she saw its towers
at all proceeded merely from her knowing where to
direct her eye in search of them, and the strength
with which their situation was impressed on her
mind. A loud clap of thunder followed the flash
just past, and the rain and hail began to burst, in
mingled torrents, from the skies.
With every moment the darkness continued to
increase, and the tempest to grow more violent.
Rosalind begged that a lamp might be lighted, and
dame Edith warmly seconded the proposition.
Zachary accordingly proceeded to strike a light.
“Now, for Heaven's sake, my lady,” said the
dame, “do be persuaded, and let us go down
3 N

into the grotto : should our lamp be seen by any
of the assailants, it may betray us to them, and we
cannot now, as we could in the daytime, be ap-
prized of their approach by our eyesight.
Rosalind concurred in the dame's opinion, and
declared herself willing to comply with her request,
Zachary having promised to take his station at the
head of the steps, that he might catch the pass-
ing sounds, which was an indescribable consolation
that Rosalind could not be induced to give up, as
she drew conjectures from each that was heard res-
pecting the progress of Allanrod's attack, although
she could not at the same time forbear confessing to
herself how inaccurate, in all probability, were her
ideas, founded on so deceitful a basis.
The lamp being lighted, they rose to quit the
apartment for the grotto below ; as they were
moving towards it, the dame, in passing the door of
the room in which lay the inanimate object of Rosa-
lind's charity, and which Zachary had opened, to
fetch from thence the steel and flint, uttered a loud
scream, and would have precipitated herself down
the steps before her, but for the interposition of her
nephew, who caught her in his arms.
For some moments the dame's eyeballs appeared
fixed with terror, and all her efforts to speak proved
fruitless ; at length—“Oh, Heaven save us !” she
some judgment awaits us.
Heaven save
us !” she repeated. " I saw him wave his dead
hand at me.”
For the first time in her life, Rosalind was moved

by the superstitious fears of another person ; she
shuddered at the fact the dame had advanced, and
instead of smiling at her idea, as she would at any
other time have done, she moved hastily up to Za-
chary, upon whom she looked not less as a com-
forter, at that moment, than she regarded the lamp
which he held in his hand.
The dame persisted in what she had advanced ;
the dead man, she resolutely declared, bad waved
to her his hand, as she had passed the door of the
room where he lay, and she hurried down the steps,
entreating Rosalind to follow her. Rosalind com-
plied, but no sooner had she gained the bottom,
than the folly of listening to the terrors of her com-
panion struck her, and she felt half inclined to go
up again, and resolve herself whether there were
indeed any remaining life in him whom she had be-
lieved dead.
“ He is not alive,” cried the dame, “ I am cer-
tain-his corpse is bewitched : in the name of the
blessed Jesus, go not near him! Oh that you had
not let him into the cottage !-Some punishment
awaits us, for the kindness you have shewn to the
enemies of our good queen.” A clap of thunder
rolled with tremendous loudness at that instant over
the grotto, and dame Edith declared that she heard
a groan from the chamber above, notwithstanding
the violence of the crasb.
Rosalind was now strongly led to believe, that
life might not have been entirely flown from the un-
happy man above, when they had thought it so,

and that timely assistance might still recover him;
and she declared, that she would take Zachary with
her, and go and examine into the truth of the dame's
fears.
The dame wept, shrieked, and implored her not
to commit this rashness; but Rosalind could not be
withheld by any personal apprehension from an act
of duty, and was resolute in ascending the steps.
Dame Edith saw her determination, and, fearing
not less for her safety above, than she did for her
own in being left alone below after her recent alarm,
she shrieked her commands in so forcible a tone, to
Zachary to shut the door at the top of the steps,
for the sake of the soul and body of the lady Rosa-
lind, entrusted to their care, that he complied ra-
ther from surprise than actual intention of obedience
to his aunt, and fastened the spring beyond his
power to unfix it again.

Rosalind was not satisfied that the spring was
immovable, till she had ascertained, with her own
hand, that it was so, and she then descended again
into the grotto.
Neither the sounds of the thunder, nor of the
musketry at the castle, lost any part of their
strength by being heard in the grotto, and both
continued to rage with unabating ferocity.
With every moment the unpleasantness of Rosa-
lind's situation continued to increase. The dame
persisted in the cause of her alarm not having been
ideal. The insensible Zachary, unmoved by sur-
rounding circumstances, was sinking to sleep; and
the oil, which fed the solitary flame that cheered
their dismal abode, was almost wasted.
The dame's fears were wound to a pitch of un-
controllable terror at the idea of the darkness in
which they must soon be inevitably involved, and
wept aloud. Rosalind stood too much in need of
comfort herself, to be able to bestow any on her
companion—thus continued to sit in painful silence.


## p. 458 (#492) ############################################

Presently the thunder began to die away in scarce-
ly audible murmurs, and the sounds of the musketry
were no longer heard in lengthened echoes through
the cavern, as they had a few minutes before been.
Now then,” thought Rosalind,“ the die is cast!”
Anxiously did she pant for information of the event
of the siege from lord Rufus, and as the hours
crept on, and no footstep was heard approaching
towards the grotto, she began to dread that the
ruthless Allanrod was the conqueror.
The lamp gave a dying flash, and expired.
A general silence prevailed. The dame, who had
been afraid of stirring from her seat, even while the
lamp was still burning, appeared to be now even
fearful of hearing the sound of her own voice ; her
stifted sobs were alone audible, and the unfortunate
daughter of De Mowbray sat, worn by expectation,
till she almost lost the faculty of thought.
At length the sound of distant voices played up-
on the air; but whether they proceeded from the
plain without the cottage, or from the subterrane-
ous passage, Rosalind could not for some time dis-
tinguish. In a short time footsteps were mingled
with the voices, and the rays of approaching torches
already gleamed on the vaulted roof of the grotto.
Scarcely were these discernible, ere the page Al-
win was seen running towards the grotto." Fly,
lady Rosalind-fly to the fields for succour!” he
exclaimed, as he entered it. " Allanrod is the con-
queror--lord Rufus himself in chains--your retreat
by some villainous treachery, is discoverd to the

freebooters, and his ruffian band already presses on
my heels in search of you.”
“ Then save me, Heaven !” exclaimed Rosalind,
her hands clasped, and extended towards the Power
in whom her only hope was placed.
Fly, fly, I entreat you !" continued Alwin,
running up the steps towards the door into the cot-
tage. “The spring is fastened !” he exclaimed,
on reaching it" then submission is alone left
you.”
These words were scarcely uttered, ere a number
of the freebooters, some bearing arms, others car-
cying torches, burst into the grotto. The sight
struck horror to the heart of Rosalind; and, falling
upon her knees before them, she exclaimed—“Oh,
save me!-save me !"- from Allaprod, she would
have added, but the words died on her lips.
“ Fear nothing, fair lady,” said one of the fore-
most, raising her as he spoke from the ground;
“ the powerful Allanrod sends you joy by us. The
conqueror commands us to lead you to him in the
chapel of Rockmount Castle, where he awaits to
make you the wedded partner of his victory and
wealth.”
“ Tell your conqueror,” replied Rosalind,
I would sooner he awaited me there to entomb me
living, in the dust beneath his feet, than for the
hated act you set a praise upon--tell him, that Ro-
salind de Mowbray dares him to violate the rights
of her existence, who is under the immediate pro-
tection of her sovereign queen.”,
" that

The exertion of uttering these words, which she
had spoken with a pretended courage, overpowered
her, and as she ceased to speak, the tears burst
from her eyes.
“ You find, by the present instance,” returned
one of the men, who had something in his appear-
ance superior to the rest," that the protection of
your queen is not so powerful or extensive as that
which Allanrod is able to afford you; it were there-
fore wisdom in you, lady, to let this proof of his
superiority open your eyes to the honour he intends
you.”
“ You know me little,” replied Rosalind,“ if
you suppose that it is in the power of any sophistry
to win my heart into becoming the willing partner
of one of whose criminality I have every conviction,
as I have of Allanrod's ; if, therefore, your leader
believes to meet in me a woman who will bend in
humility before him, because the adventitious for-
tune of a moment makes him a lawless conqueror,
forbear, for his sake, as it is evident you value not
mine, to lead me into his presence—be he ever
so great, I carry with me a mortification for his
pride."
“ We must obey,” returned the freebooter ; and
he and one of his companions then began to force
her along the cavern.
“ You are not the first of your sex, lady, he has
had to deal with,” observed one of the men.
Perhaps you mean to imply,” said Rosalind,
*calmly, “that he owes his name for prowess to the

461
unfeeling conduct which he exercises towards our
sex.”
How, lady ?" returned the man.
“ It is a natural conclusion,” answered Rosalind,
" that the wicked man should be unfeeling.”
“ He is not cruel, unless opposition to his wishes
drives him to hasty actions,” returned the soldier.
“ A glorious character you give him !” replied
Rosalind; “ he is just so little a tyrant, as to be
able to act with lenity towards those who do not
thwart his wishes."
“For your own sake,” rejoined the man, mo-
derate your expressions; remember that you are in
his power.”
" That I do not allow,” returned Rosalind; “ my
soul and my opinions he can never bend to his de-
tested purposes. Let his brutality extend to what
lengths it may, he can never enjoy the triumph of
having subdued my heart. When he has bent me
to his villanous ends, whatever they may be, or
taken from me a life which is already a burden to
me, what can he boast of having done ?-tortured
with his brutality a form of mouldering clay, cast
in the weak impression of a woman, whose mind
could not be conquered even by the savageness of
his cruelties, and whose resolution baffled the tri-
umph of his enormities.”
Her conductors continued to lead her on towards
the extremity of the subterraneous passage, and
thence she was made to retrace the steps which had
led her to the grotto, through the mouldering ce.

metery and ruinous chapel. The shadow which had
flitted before her eyes the last time she had passed
through the vaults returned to her imagination, but
nothing now met her sight, except various indivi-
duals of the freebooter's band.
Having passed through the secret door in the
wainscot pannelling, which opened into the long
and vaulted aisle that connected the ruinous chapel
with the castle, they continued to move on through
various turnings and windings, which were termi-
nated by a flight of stone steps. On reaching these,
all the freebooters, but the two who led Rosalind,
remained below ; by the two who held her she was
constrained to ascend the steps, and, arrived at the
top, one of her conductors pushed back on its
hinges a heavy door, which they entered.
Numerous torches had hitherto accompanied their
progress from the grotto, and, for a moment, ut-
ter darkness appeared to Rosalind to have usurped
the place of the streaming lights which had so late-
ly been shedding their vivid influence around her ;
but in a very short time a couple of lamps, suspended
from the roof of the building she was now in, just
served to point out to her, that it was a place ap-
pointed for religious uses. She distinguished a lofty
marble tomb, on which as she passed, the partial
light from one of the lamps fell, and she discerned
the name of Eloise ; she doubted not but that de la
Valois had followed; but neither the light, nor the
hasty pace she was moving at, were favourable for
observation.

our lord
The lamps were hung at some distance from each
other, and as she was now moving in the inter-
mediate space between them, a confused medley of
pillars and monuments, shaded by the pervading
gloom, were alone discernible. As she continued
to proceed, by the influence of the second lamp,
which fell on the objects she was approaching, she
saw a semicircle of railing in brass, in the centre
of which a part of the workmanship swung back on
hinges to form a passage towards an altar, which
was raised a few feet beyond it in the depth of a
stone recess.
By the side of this altar she perceived standing
a priest, before whom lay an open volume.
Here,” said one of the borderers,
Allanrod will shortly appear, to claim the hand
which ensures the felicity of his future life.”
The horror which assailed Rosalind's mind-the
peculiarity as well as the cruelty of her situation,
choked her utterance. For some time she en-
deavoured in vain to speak ; at length with difficul-
ty, she faintly breathed out—" Priest, I charge
thee, by thy hopes of heaven, be not an accomplice
in this act of infamy !"
No sooner had she spoken, than distant foot-
steps, the echoes of which played through the
chapel, drew her eyes to the spot from whence
they proceeded, and she perceived approaching to-
wards her, a man of tall stature, and of a robust
frame; he was clad in the highland habit, and every
part of his dress bespoke him a Scottish freebooter,

except that on his head he wore an English helmet,
of which the visor was down.
This, lady,” said the freebooter who had be-
fore spoken,“ is the great Allanrod.”
Rosalind felt her strength gradually dying away;
she gazed, but could not speak. Allanrod ap-
proached towards her, and, in silence placed him-
self by her side. Every object danced before the
eyes of Rosalind, and she felt as in a lethargic
trance, from which she had not the power to awake
herself.
Allanrod waved his hand to the priest, who in-
stantly began to read the ceremony that was to
unite her to the wretch into whose power she had
fallen.
Again she endeavoured to speak, but her efforts
were more ineffectual than before ; a faint excla-
mation of horror alone was she able to articulate.
The priest proceeded, and Allanrod took the
hand of Rosalind in his; at the moment he touched
it, an unknown voice proclaimed—“ Hold! mons-
ter, hold !” and at the next instant a figure, in
blaek armour, whose countenance was pale and
emaciated, save where a streak of blood ran down
its left cheek, stood between them.
“ O God! exclaimed Allanrod, and sunk into
the arms of his attendants who had followed him to
the altar.
Rosalind turned her eyes upon the figure; a
shriek burst from her lips, and all sense fled from
her.

CHAPTER VI.

King RICHARD III.
We have hitherto scarcely spoken of Edward since
the hour of his departure from England, except to
mention the intelligence which lord William de
Mowbray professed himself, about a year from the
present time, to have received of his death. It now
becomes us to recur to the period of his setting out
for Flanders, and to enquire into the correctness of
this information, and the events which had marked
his life since bis leaving Cumberland.
It will doubtless be remembered, that Rosalind
saw'lier Edward no more after the night which
made her his wife ; that on the day subsequent to
this event, lord William brought her intelligence of
his departure with a levy of troops for Flanders,
and alledged, as the reason of his not having visited
her previously to his leaving the country, the apo-
logy which she had on the prior evening urged as an
excuse for refusing to see lord Rufus de Madgine-
court—" that she was not well enough to receive
visitors ;” and which sentence the baron de Mow-

bray pretended that he had supposed must extend
equally to every individual.
On the morning subsequent to that night which
had made Edward the husband of his beloved Rosa-
lind, Irwin arrived at early morn at the tower in the
village, and informed him, that lord William had
just received a command from the court, to dispatch
a levy of his own private troops to join the army
which was on the point of embarking for Flanders;
and that he had resolved on sending one hundred of
his stoutest men, of which he gave the command to
Edward, who was ordered to be ready to depart
within three hours.
Mingled were the sensations with which Edward
received this mandate from lord William. To leave
his Rosalind at that moment, although he had pla-
ced it beyond the power of fate to give her lawfully
to the arms of lord Rufus, occasioned him a regret
which the honour conferred on him, in the com-
mand of the company over which he was placed,
could not balance; still his eternal honour, his only
chance of promotion in arms, and progress towards
glory—the only attainments by which he could ever
hope to advance sufficiently into the favour of the
baron de Mowbray, to be acknowledged by him as
his son-in-law, were at stake. At the present mo-
ment, any hesitation on his part would for ever
condemn him ; accordingly, nothing remained for
him but to accept the command with apparent cheer-
fulness.
Thus convinced, his good sense overcame every

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
407
latent lingering wish of remaining on the spot he
now stood on, and he directly proceeded to the cas-
tle, to return his thanks to its lord, for the honour
conferred on him, in his promotion to the command
of the body of men devoted to foreign service, and
to bid him farewell previously to his departure.
Lord William received him with that complacen-
cy which was necessary to gloss over his self-inter-
ested views in sending him out of the kingdom ;
and when Edward made a request to kneel at the
feet of the lady Rosalind, and receive her good
wishes for the success of his arms, De Mowbray
artfully replied, that it was with regret he was com-
pelled to refuse his petition, but that Rosalind was
much indisposed, and had particularly desired that
no one should, on any cause whatever, be admitted
to her apartment.
Edward durst not advance the only plea on
which he might have enforced his petition ; and
with a heavy heart, pronouncing a silent blessing
on her name, he was constrained to place himself
at the head of his men, and begin his melancholy
march.
The heart of lord William de Mowbray bounded
with triumphant joy, when the refulgent blades of
the soldiery, headed by the devoted Edward, no
longer cast their reflection on the plains of Cumber-
land. A sigh of ecstacy escaped from his bosom,
and he mentally exclaimed—“ Farewell, bane to
the pride of my house! farewell, thou minion of a
fond foolish daughter !” The baron had yet to learn

408

that the indissoluble knot of love was tied between
those bosoms, which had only virtue and affection
for their guide ; and the unfortunate pair, thus
united in love, were still ignorant that the machi-
nations of a pride-devoted father had driven Edward,
as he hoped, for ever from the presence of her in
whose sight alone he lived.
Little imagining that his daughter had possessed
the firmness of soul to repair to herself his neglect
of her dying mother's petition to him, “ to give
her Rosalind to the man of her heart,” he had vainly
judged that Edward once removed from her sight,
time and his arguments would be efficacious in re-
moving him equally from her thoughts, and that,
when he was once rooted out from them, it would
be by no means a difficult matter to place lord Rufus
in his vacated seat: for this reason, therefore, had
lord William given to Edward the command of the
hundred men chosen for foreign service, as the most
ready and least suspicious method of sending him
out of the kingdom-an honour which belonged by
right to his elder chieftians, and which, but for
this secret cause, had doubtless been theirs.
And here lord William intended to have stopped,
trusting either to the continuation of the war for
detaining Edward abroad till Rosalind should have
been prevailed on to receive lord Rufus as her hus-
band, or to the accidents of the field, for precluding
the possibility of his ever returning at all. But
when the suffering Rosalind disclosed to him that
she was already a wife--the wife of an unknown-

469
the wife of the foundling Edward, lord William,
for the first time, experienced a proof of that power
which the insignificant sometimes possess of over-
throwing the greatest plans of those who conceive
themselves the most mighty ; and in the first heat
of his rage, he determined on the immediate death
of him, whom he wanted strength of invocation to
curse with the emphasis he desired to condemn
him.
But his idea of depriving Edward of his life was
soon overruled by various considerations which
crowded on his mind : principally he reflected on
the expression of " noble” which old Matthews had
used on his deathbed, in reference to his young
charge, and which the baron had always felt a doubt
in determining whether it had been applied to his
mind or his birth. If it had referred to the latter,
the time might come when the youth might be re-
claimed by his family, from the bosom of which,
perhaps, some mysterious circumstances had hi-
therto shut him out ; and should the progress of his
life, in such case, be traced by those anxious for
his welfare and existence, and its thread be disco-
vered to have been cut by him (for the grave itself
is not always silent, and foul deeds will sometimes
speak, though there be no tongues to tell of them),
what would not be his disgrace, his punishment, for
the act into which his hasty intemperance had driven
him! These thoughts sunk deeply into his mind;
and, terrified out of his plan by the chimeras of his
brain) for the most determined villains have their

moments of fear), he resolved, by someother means
than death, to prevent Edward from ever returning
back to England.
Edward meanwhile pursued his journey, unsuspi-
cious of any fraud practising against him, but that
which had ostensibly torn him from the arms of his
beloved Rosalind. The company which he headed
embarked from England, and landed, after a pros-
perous voyage, at Ostend, in the neighbourhood
of which place they were encamped, amidst vari-
ous other troops just landed from England.
When the tower of strength was first begun to be
erected in the village, of which the scattered roofs
reared their humble heads in the valley which ran
at the foot of an amphitheatre of hills, on the sum-
mit of the highest of which stood the proud castle
of de Mowbray, engineers were sent by the queen
from London, for the purpose of constructing its
foundation. When the building was completed,
and the task for which the workmen had been hired
concluded, two of the number enlisted themselves
into the service of lord William, as pioneers.
Of these two men, neither was English; the one
was a rude and ignorant Cambrian—the origin of
the other it was not so easy to define: his father had
been a Spaniard, his mother a Frenchwoman; they
had been stragglers for the greater part of their lives
over the face of the globe, and had ultimately set-
tled in the Netherlands, as the keepers of a prison.
The name by which he called himself was Sanchez
Xavia ; at the age of manhood, he had been cast

471
upon the world by his parents, to fight his way
through life, according to his own confession, not as
a reward for his good conduct previously to that time.
He had entered into the service of an Irish gentleman
of fortune in France, and returned with him to his
ewn country: no very honourable occurrence, it
appeared, had driven him from that situation. To
England he had wandered during the preceding
reign, and here there existed a stronger proof than
suspicion of his having assisted in the barbarous
executions of murdered martyrs, which will for
ever stain the memory of Elizabeth's predecessor,
and render her claim undoubted to the bloody fame
under which her memory lives.
How he had lived without punishment till nearly
his sixtieth year, as he had done, is one of those
enigmas which puzzle the good, while the evil are
insensible that their preseryation is not their just
and merited due. Too often is it the case in life,
that those who deserve to be reprobated by their fel-
lows gain their esteem ; while such as truly merit
approbation from the world are obliged to rest con-
tented with the single applause of their own heart.
This instance is peculiarly exemplified in the cases of
Hubert and Sanchez Xavia : the rough but honest
Hubert was constantly saluted with the epithet of
surly” and found but few who sought his compa-
nionship; while the smooth tongue and smiling
countenance of the rascally Sanchez gained him a
nod of welcome and a friendly shake by the hand,
wherever he went. So true is it that the majority

cast their eyes no farther than the surface, and that
the skilled in art are well acquainted that appearance
is accepted by the multitude for reality.
Sanchez Xavia had particularly requested of the
baron de Mowbray, that he inight be one of the pio-
neers included in the number of men under the com-
mand of Edward. “His father and mother were
both dead, but he had,” he said, “a brother, on whom
the government of the prison which had lately been
held by his father had devolved, and he wished to
see him, now an opportunity offered of so doing,
without expence to himself.” That he was going to
fight against the country of which his father and
mother had, by residence, become subjects, he cared
not ; war was his trade, and therefore it was indif-
ferent to him where and against whom he exercised
it. He was not cruel from disposition, but from
interest—he would not have dealt a painful blow to
any one which he had not been paid to do ; but he
would hire himself to the performance of any action
whatsoever, and having once let himself to perform
it, most religiously did he act up to the interest of
his employer.
Although we have seen, in the instance of Hu-
bert, that lord William de Mowbray could be
mistaken in his opinion of character, still the fawn-
ing villany of Sanchez was of too common a cast for
a man of even a less acute perception than lord
William to be deceived in ; rumour had also whis-
pered in his ear, that gold was the deity of Sanchez,

MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER,
473
and that he religiously observed his tenets of faith to-
wards those who showered it on him.
His recollection of Sanchez, at the present mo-
ment, was a most assuasive balm to the feelings of
the pride-wounded lord ; he united with the apt
character of Sanchez to stratagem, the convenient
strong hold of the prison of which his brother was
keeper, and doubted not that an annuity, equivalent
to the charge imposed on them, would render both
the brothers willing to find the means of decoying
Edward into its recesses, and retaining him their
captive for the term of his existence.
His heart leaped with exultation at the idea. He
doubted not a ready affirmative to his plan from
Sanchez : what alone distressed him was the means
of making known his scheme, and the price he was
willing to pay for its performance, to him whom he
desired to appoint the instrument of it, without the
hazard of a discovery of his intentions, or without
leaving on record a paper of his own hand writing
containing his black purposes, which, by some gust
of chance or fortune, might damn him as the actor
of so nefarious a proceeding.
After much deliberation with his own mind, he
decided on leaving his castle for a short time, under
pretence of his presence being required by the queen,
to cross the sea unattended, and to see Sanchez
Xavia himself. His absence he commanded to be
kept a profound secret from his daughter; and her
mind, occupied with matter of nearer import to
her own happiness, made not that inquiry relative

to a father from whose hand she had received the
mortal stab to her felicity, to subject her to the fal-
lacy which had been prepared as a reply to such
question, had she advanced it.
The baron accordingly left his castle, and having
disguised himself as a man of mean rank, he pro-
ceeded without delay to the coast, and securing
himself a passage on board a ship bound to the
continent, was soon landed there.
On reaching Ostend, the baron took up his abode
at a little inn on the side of the town nearest to the
camp, and here concealing himself till the shades
of evening began to fall, he dispatched a messenger
to the. English camp, to summon Sanchez to his
presence. No sooner did Sanchez perceive who
was the stranger that had sent to seek him, than
his artful brain prophesied that there must be some
secret cause for the baron's having undertaken the
voyage ; and a mutual explanation quickly took
place between them, on which they parted, fully
satisfied with the promises of each other.

As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet;
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his Heaven for thunder!
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven!

Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle. But man!-proud man!

Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,
As make the angels weep.

On the following day, when the exercises of the
morning were concluded, Sanchez, approaching his
captain, said—“Sir, I have a boon to request of
you.”—“ Name it,” Edward replied.—“ Do you
not, sir,” said Sanchez, -- behold that building on
yon distant hill ?" Yes,” answered Edward ;
“ what is it? it appears both strong and large."
-“ And so it is,” rejoined Xavia; “it is a prison
where captives of a superior order are kept-my
brother is the governor of it. To-morrow is his
wedding-day; he is about to marry a rich widow of
Ostend, and if you would condescend to grace his
nuptials with your presence, he would deem it a
high honour conferred on him. Your brother-offi-
cers will also be invited, as he wishes to be in amity

with all the British troops. I have besides to re-
quest leave of absence for myself from my regiment,
for the day, that I may be present at the ceremony."
Edward smiled inwardly at this invitation from
the keeper of a prison ; but, aware how essential
are friends of any description in a country which
we enter as enemies, he agreed on the following
day to partake of the wedding-dinner of Garcias
Xavia.
My brother, gentlemen,” said Sanchez, ad-
dressing his officers, “ is in a very difierent situa-
tion in life to myself; his place, as governor of the
prison, is worth several hundred pounds a-year to
him, and the lady whom he is going to marry is
worth an annuity equal to his own—every child of
the same mother has not the same good fortune."
At the hour of invitation, Edward and his bro-
ther-officers, conducted by Sanchez, repaired to
the governor's, for by that appellation only was he
known in the country. As they approached nearer
to the prison, every feature bespoke strength, and
every part of its construction seemed to bid defiance
to the captive to escape from its holds. The build-
ing itself stood on the summit of a rocky hill,
whose sloping sides fell into a deep moat, from the
centre of which arose a flinty wall, of at least fifteen
feet in height; thus, while the prison appeared ut-
terly unprotected, its situation, on the crown of a
summit, rendered escape impossible, as every step
which was set from the building, only sunk the pas-
senger still lower beneath the outer wall, which it

had been rendered by art an impracticable labour to
climb.
Having passed the outer gate, the governor met
them as they ascended the hill: he was a man of a
handsome person, and appeared to be at least ten
years younger than his brother ; his address was po-
lite and easy, and in the words of a gentleman he
thanked them for the honour they conferred on him
by their
presence.
He ushered them into a handsome apartment,
where he introduced them to his newly-married
bride, a middle-aged woman, whose appearance
had in it nothing remarkable, and a number of
guests of both sexes, who all bore the marks of be-
ing persons of some condition in life; but the most
interesting personage of the party was the daughter
of her who had that day become madame Xavia, by
her first husband. Belise, for such was her name,
had just completed her nineteenth year ; her figure,
although not tall, was beautiful in the extreme ;
her countenance was handsome, and full of expres-
sion-her dark brown eyes conveyed in them sen-
sibility, soul, and good humour; and her hazel
tresses flowed in the most luxuriant ringlets on her
delicate bosom.
The repast was handsome and profuse : of the
many apartments which were in use, not one bore
the slightest mark of its affinity to a prison ; and
Sanchez himself, although admitted to the feast as
the brother of the donor, retired with humility to
the bottom of the table, and forbore to intrude his
3Q

conversation upon the guests of the governor. San-
chez was indifferent about the dissimilitude of situa-
tion between himself and Garcias: the villany
which he was hatching against the unsuspicious
Edward produced him inward gratification, equal
to what his brother derived from the acquisition
of property which had attended his marriage, and
the guests of distinction which he saw placed round
his table: nor was Garcias himself, although thus
wealthy, much less delighted than his brother at the
idea of some increase to the income which he al-
ready possessed being about to flow to him from the
intended captivity of Edward; for rare is the in-
stance when the rich do not delight in the idea
of becoming richer, whatever the means which are
to make them so.
It appears unnecessary to say, that the brothers
had already held a private conference upon the
agreement which had been made between the lord
baron de Mowbray and Sanchez Xavia, relative to
the imprisonment of Edward, and that their plan
had already been laid for preventing him from leav-
ing the walls of the prison, where he was now en-
tertained as a wedding-guest ; to which feast he
and his brother-officers had been invited, solely to
colour over the treachery which was to be executed
upon him before the arrival of midnight.
When the repast was ended, and the cheerful
glass went round the table, the smiling Belise was
requested to produce her lute, and indulge the party
by accompanying its tones with her voice. With

that readiness which bespoke a willingness to oblige,
rather than a consciousness of excellence, she im-
mediately took up her instrument, and sang the
following words :
As Learning o'er his fountain hung,
Two infants wander'd by;
The eldest body was Genius nam'a,
The other Industry.
Beneath the stream, they had been told,
A treasure lay conceal'd;
So both plung'd in to gain the prize
The waters were to yield.
Firm Industry kept diving on,
Nor turn'd 'aside his eye ;
While Genias swam across the tide,
To catch a golden fly:
With joy the insect he ensnares,
But ah ! his pleasure fies,
When, mounting from the deep, he sees
Industry with the prize.
Every one present complimented Belise, not less
on the sweetness of her voice, than the subject of
her song; and when it was understood that the
music and words were her own composition, their
enconiums were greatly increased.
Belise happened to be placed at table next to Ed-
ward, and his commendations were amongst the
warmest bestowed on the fair songstress; for there
was something in her voice and expression, which
so strongly reminded him of his absent Rosalind,
that every pulse in his composition glowed under
the words which flowed from her tongue.
In return to his compliments she said." My

song contains a simple truth : I have ever remarked
through life, at least as far as I have had experi-
ence for my years, that perseverance always gains
us the accomplishment of such desired ends as the
too ardent and impetuous mind fails to obtain for
itself."
May thy words be prophetic, fair maiden !"
thought Edward; may the lingering hand of destiny
still reward my perseverance with the happiness of
being acknowledged the lawful protector of my be-
loved Rosalind !” At this idea a sigh escaped him.
“Let me fill your glass, sir,” said Belise: “
you
are melancholy; have you the headache, or the
heartache ?"
Edward made some commonplace apology for his
absence, and emptied his glass to the health of his
lively companion.
“ It is not the headache,” went on Belise,
you would not take your wine thus freely; therefore
it must be the heartache, and what can cause that
'in so young a man as yourself? It must surely be
love-am I right?”
“ If it be so, I must not be a telltale of my love,"
replied Edward, endeavouring to force a smile,“ or
I should be undeserving a return of my passion."
“ That is very well said,” answered Belise, sig-
nificantly; " but you should put the same restraint
upon your eyes that you do upon your tongue
they are telltales in spite of your precaution.”
And suppose I were to assure you I was not in
love at all?” replied Edward.
or

“ Then I should say,” returned Belise, “ that
the air of this prison has infected you with melan-
choly; it has me already, I freely confess. I love
my mother, and have no great dislike to the man
whom she has taken for her second husband ; but I
feel extremely averse to the necessity I am under,
from my dependence upon my mother, of being the
inhabitant of this gloomy building. I have visited
every part of it, once only, and I hope I shall never
do so again, for it is piteous indeed to see the un-
happy persons who are immured witbin its walls ;
they have certainly every comfort which captivity
can bestow, but what are all the luxuries it can
give, compared with the privation of liberty, and
absence from those connexions which form the
charms of life, and without which existence is a
blank—nay, a misery?”
“ Your feelings,” said Edward, are such as do
infinite credit to your heart.”
“I would I had the free exercise of them,” re-
plied Belise," and there should not be a prisoner
within these walls. Oh! it is dreadful to see those
in affliction, to whom the power is denied us of al-
leviating their sufferings."
“ This building is however of such extent,” re-
turned Edward, “ that you will not be constrained
to see those whom you pity.”
“ I shall equally think of them,” answered she ;
" and I am sure no threats of my father-in-law will
ever deter me from rendering them every assistance
in my power. When I see men in misfortune, I

cannot help forgetting the cause from which they are
doomed to suffer, and remembering only that they
are in a situation which deserves the commiseration
of the benevolent. and the succouring hand of such
as are able to extend it towards their misfortunes.”
The sentiments of Belise opened a way for her
into the noble heart of Edward, and he listened to
her conversation with the utmost pleasure and in-
terest.—“I have myself,” he said, “in many in-
stances, been the child of misfortune from my cra-
dle ; and having known how acceptable to a heart
of grief is the sympathy of those on whom we have
no other claim than the common tie of humanity, I
have learnt the respect due to feelings which are so
highly honourable to the breast that cherishes
them.”
“This,” said Belise, is not the exact moment
for a conversation of this nature; we must defer its
conclusion to some other opportunity, or our gra-
vity will seem to cast a reflection upon the wedding
we are celebrating. The dance is going to begin—
let us enjoy the pleasure which the hour presents us
with.” -
The party was now rising from table, and in the
course of half an hour the dancing began in an ad-
joining apartment.
Edward regarded it as a necessary compliment to
his entertainers, to take a share in the dance, and
accordingly selected Belise for his partner. The
amusement they were joining in did not admit of
their conversing much together while thus employed;


## p. 483 (#517) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 483
and when the dances, for which Edward had en-
gaged her hand, were concluded, another partner
directly claimed her attention.
Edward was far from being in spirits to enjoy an
evening of this festive nature; he felt it a painful
exersion to go through the ceremony of a single
dance, even with the engaging Belise for his part-
ner—thus he had resolved to dance no more, and
moved towards the door of the apartment for air.
Here stood in conversation the two brothers, San-
chez and Garcius; Edward joined them. Sanchez
directly began to speak of the immensity of the
building they were in, and to direct Edward's atten-
tion to various architectural points about it; one
remark naturally produced another, and Edward
expressing his surprise at the elegant apartments
which he had that day seen connected with a prison,
the governor began to explain to him that it was a
prison of a superior order, merely used for criminals
of rank, and upon a widely different construction
to such buildings as were usually distinguished by
that name. Sanchez seconded what his brother had
said, and added—“If you please, sir, to walk with
me a few minutes, I am sure my brother will give
you his permission to take a view of its different
parts; and it is well worth your while so to do—I
will answer that you have never before seen a build-
ing at all resembling this. I have visited the prin-
cipal prisons in England myself, and the difference
is great indeed.”
Edward's curiosity was raised by these remarks,


## p. 484 (#518) ############################################

484 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
and he accepted the offer made him of gratifying it.
The season of the year was the latter end of May,
and the hour about six in the evening; thus, not-
withstanding the gloominess of the building, of
which the narrow casements admitted but partially
and sparingly the rays of day, it was still sufficiently
light to allow of the investigation which Edward
had been allowed to make, without the assistance
of a lamp. Edward, following his conductor San-
chez, stole, unobserved, from the company in the
dancing-room, and passing through a stone corri-
dor, they arrived at a few steps which led to an iron-
grated door, that, Sanchez said, divided that part
of the edifice which was set apart for the governor,
from that which was allotted to the purposes of im-
prisonment.
They passed on through various passages and
apartments, some of stone, others of wainscot, dif-
ferently furnished, and containing, in different pro-
portions, accommodations and comforts for such as
were destined to be their inhabitants. One apart-
ment, or rather cell, particularly arrested the atten-
tion of Edward; it was evidently a place where the
torture was accustomed to be exercised on the un-
happy victims of bigotry or criminality. At one
end was an immense fire-place, which was scattered
over with cinders, the remnants of the torturing
fire which had scorched the supposed truth from
the lips of some unhappy sufferer. In the centre
of the apartment stood an iron chair, in which the
wretched being had, doubtless, been seated at the

hour of punishment : and on the floor 'were fastened
iron rings, which had been constructed for the pur,
pose of confining his feet.
“ For Heaven's sake, let us pass on!” said Ed-
ward ; “ this scene brings to the mind images too
terrific for the heart which is not entirely devoid of
feeling to dwell upon with any degree of compo-
sure.”
Yes,” replied Sanchez, “ the torture by fire is
bad enough for those who feel it; it is worse than
being burnt to death—in that case the smoke soon
does the business, and takes away all feeling.”
“ You have then, it should seem, been a witness
of both instances ?” rejoined Edward.
“Oh, ay,” replied Sanchez, “ I had my hands
charmingly full of business, when queen Mary in-
dulged her spleen against the Protestant church,
by roasting bishops.”
Edward fixed his eyes for a moment in silent sur-
prise on Sanchez. It had so happened that those
unfavourable rumours of his character which were
whispered in the world, had never met the ear of
Edward, and this unexpected avowal of his having
been an actor in scenes of such violent atrocity both
astonished and vexed him ; nor did the confession
of the horror which attended it to the mind
of Edward, by being made on the spot where they
now stood, and with which Sanchez seemed to pos-
sess all the familiarity of old acquaintance.
Sanchez smiled at the concern with which Ed.

ward regarded even the tacit instruments of punish-
ment, and said—“I see, sir, your's is a tender
heart. Pardon me, but such strong feelings as you
express are dangerous sentiments to gain ground in
any community. What would become of the good,
if the evil were allowed to exercise their villany un-
punished f Your heart recoils at these instruments
of punishment, and probably feels a deadly hatred
against the common executioner, whose office it is
to rid the world of those whose crimes make them
unfit members for existence: and still it is to them,
and to him, that you owe the security and happi-
ness of your own life.”
There was undoubtedly truth in this remark, but
it was that kind of truth which proceeds from an
unfeeling mind. Edward's was indeed, as Sanchez
had remarked, a tender heart; and he heard with
displeasure that philosophy which appears an apo-
logy for a mind incapable of sensibility.
Although these remarks on the part of Sanchez
had opened to Edward the nature of his heart, still
he was entirely unsuspicious of any treachery being
intended towards himself; conscious that he merited
no evil from any existing hand, he feared none, and
continued to proceedin his investigation of the pri-
son. Ascending another short flight of steps, they
arrived in a stone gallery of about twenty feet in
breadth, which they crossed, and entered an apart-
ment handsomely furnished, in which was a bed
and every appurtenance of a bedchamber; beyond

this was another room of equal dimensions, and
through the latter a closet, where on a table lay
scattered some books and implements for writing.
“ It is not long since these rooms were inhabited
by a man of rank,” said Sanchez ; "he has, I un-
derstand, been dead only about two months."
" What was the crime for which he was confined
here?" asked Edward.
" I believe only that of being one more than his
family wished to have belonging to it,” answered
Xavia, with a significant smile.
This assertion increased the dislike which the last
half-hour had given Edward to Sanchez Xavia; and
he was also surprised that he should so suddenly
have become careless of developing the evil senti-
ments of his heart.
“ I will entreat you to stay here a few minutes,"
said Sanchez, “ till I get a lamp from an adjoining
apartment; it is growing so dusk, that we shall not

ments without a light, much less to pursue our cir-
cuit of the building."
Edward answered, that he would await his re-
turn, and Sanchez, saying that he would be back
in a minute, departed.
Edward was surprised to see him shut the door
after him, and still more was he astonished when
he heard him double-lock it, and slip a heavy bolt
into its socket; he called aloud to bim, inquiring
the reason of his so doing, but received no answer ;
he heard his footsteps dying away as he proceeded

along the stone gallery, and an universal silence
then prevailed, broken only by his own quick breath-
ings, caused by the agitation of his mind at the
strangeness of the circumstance just past.

RICHARD II.
ILL-STARRÉD Edward ! thy doom is then sealed-
the tyrant of thy fate holds thee the captive of his
triumphant bonds, and exults in the drops of agony
which chase each other down thy fevered cheek,
which spring from thy racked heart, as it dwells on
the painful idea that thy Rosalind may never again
meet thy embrace. But despair not, thou suffering
youth ! however delayed the hour of retribution, its
arrival still is certain; the hand of cruelty shall
wither, when it stretches itself out to execute the
masterstroke of its unfeeling purpose, and the vic-
tim of its machinations, although every ray of cheer-
ing hope be fled from his heart, shall meet that
reward which is indivisable from the firm exercise
of virtuous principles.
For several hours no step approached the apart-

489
ments in which the anxious and astonished Edward
was confinel. At length, the fall of feet was audi-
ble; they stopped near the door, and he called
aloud to have it opened; no answer was returned,
but he heard a creaking noise, and suddenly a light-
ed lamp appeared in the apartment: he went up to
it, and found that it had been introduced into the
room by means of a shelf, which turned upon a pi-
vot in the wall; on the same shelf was also some
fruit aud bread in a basket, a flask of wine, and a
pitcher of water.
Again Edward called aloud, demanding enlarge-
ment; but the steps of the person who had brought
him this supply of necessaries hastily receded from
the spot, and all was again solemnly silent.
The mind of Edward was on the rack : he had
no hesitation in determining why he was made a
captive; not a doubt remained to him of his mar-
riage with his adored Rosalind having been dis-
covered by her father, and of his having taken this
method of preventing him from ever returning to
claim her as his wife. To what torments might not
she be doomed by a father whose ruling passion of
pride had met with so unexpected, so severe a dis-
appointment in the resolution of his daughter ! He
had shuddered at the sufferings to which the intem-
perate rage of the baron might have condemned her,
and sinking on his knees, he breathed forth a prayer
to Heaven for her preservation and protection.
The night was passed by Edward in waking
thought ; he augured it the forerunner of a train

of others similar to it, and despair almost benumb-
ed his faculties.
On the following morning, the shelf introduced
into his apartment a change of linen, and various
other articles requisite to the comfort of life; and
a paper lying on the top of them directed him to
write for whatever he wanted, and to place his de-
mands upon the shelf, by which means they would
be received on the other side, and attended to with
the greatest punctuality, as there was only one
thing which was desired to be interdicted to him,
and that one thing was his liberty.
Well assured that the governor Garcius was bet-
ter paid for his detention than he was able to reward
him for his enlargement, he forebore to offer him
terms, which he was convinced he should only re-
ceive the additional mortification of having refused.
From endeavouring to make any impression on the
hearts of his keepers, the sentiments expressed by
Sanchez on the preceding evening deterred him.
The man who had lately died in those very apart-
ments -which he was now doomed to inhabit, San-
chez had said, “was detained a prisoner in them,
only because he was one more than his family wish-
ed for.” In a place where atrocities of this nature
were spoken of with such cool indifference, the voice
of the sufferer could not expect to be attended to,
nor the cries of the innocent victim to reach the
heart.
When the dancing at the governor's broke up,
and the brother-officers of Edward were about to

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 491
return to the camp, they inquired for him, and not
being able to discover him in any of the apartments,
they concluded him gone forward towards his tent,
and departed, satisfied that they should find him
already in bed.
In passing his tent, they inquired of the sentry
whose patrol was before it, whether his captain was
returned? His reply in the negative rather surprised
them ; but Sanchez, who had followed them from
the prison, said, he doubted not but that Edward
had been decoyed to the abode of some votary of
the Cyprian rites, of which many had their dwell-
ings in the neighbourhood, and that he would ar-
rive at the camp ere long.
Under this idea, the officers returned to their
respective tents. The morning came, and still Ed-
ward had not been seen: every possible inquiry was
set on foot concerning him ; and has every effort
to discover him had proved ineffectual, his lieute-
nant dispatched to the baron de Mowbray intelli-
gence of his disappearance. A speedy answer was
returned by lord William, lamenting the untimely
fate which, he pretended to suppose, had attend-
ed Edward, from his having ventured into danger-
ous society: and appointing the lieutenant to the
command of the troops, the ensign to his station,
and Sanchez Xavia to fill the rank of the lowest
officer now promoted; but upon condition of their
being reduced to their former situations, should
Edward again appear amongst them: convinced of
the impossibility of which event, the lord baron

concluded his epistle with an ardent wish that he
might still be safe, and his return to his men
speedy.
This intelligence the baron took especial care to
prevent getting abroad in England; and it was pro-
bably a secret to every breast but his own.
Days and weeks passed on, and as not the slight-
est information could be gained of him by any one
of his troop on the continent, they concluded him
to have been murdered by some robbers, who had
despoiled him, as a security against their detection;
and as he had never been in the habits of particular
intimacy with any one of his company, his fate was,
for a short time, talked of and lamented, and in a
still shorter, forgotten.
The unhappy Edward, meanwhile, dragged on
existence through a round of months, uumarked
except by despair and agony. A solitary pleasure
still attended his captivity; the livelong day he
would sit with his eyes fixed on vacancy, and be-
lieve the shadow of his Rosalind present to his sight
—address the imagined vision, till he almost be-
lieved it real—and then, waking from his trance,
give way to the most violent expressions of grief
and frenzy. - - -
To one subject only did the thoughts of Edward
wander from his Rosalind, and this was the engag-
ing Belise, the daughter-in-law of the governor.
Frequently he reflected on the humane disposition
which she had evinced in her conversation with him
on the day of her mother's wedding; on the pity

493
which she had expressed herself to feel for the cap-
tives of the prison ; and more particularly on the
avowal she had made, that her fear of the govern-
or’s displeasure should never deter her from render-
ing any service which might lie in her power to such
unfortunates as were the prisoners of its relentless
walls. Did she know his situation, he doubted not
but she would use every method in her power to
endeavour to procure for him his enlargement :
should she not succeed, he felt that it would still
be an indescribable pleasure to him to know that
there was a being possessed of a feeling heart, who
was acquainted with his captivity, and would lose
no opportunity of releasing him from his bonds.
But the means of giving her such knowledge ap-
peared to be entirely removed from his power.
Hourly did he rack his brain for schemes to con-
vey to her the information of his captivity—a thou-
sand various plans presented themselves to his
mind, but upon cool examination he found them all
to be impracticable. Were he to write to her, his
letter would doubtless be examined, and, its con-
tents once known, it would never reach her hands.
Were he to send her any present, the motive of it
would be inquired into, and any secret it might
contain would be discovered, and his purpose
frus-
trated.
As nearly as he could calculate, he had now been
confined thirteen months, during which time no in-
dividual being had entered his apartment, nor had
he even beheld a human countenance : every neces-

sary of life, even his fuel, had been conveyed to
him by means of the turning shelf ; frequent ques-
tions in writing had been given to him, inquiring
whether his wants were all supplied ; but the sound
of no voice had, during that time, met his ear, for
if he made any demand of the person who came re-
gularly to the shelf, it was not replied to by speech,
but a written answer brought to it shortly after.
The light was admitted into his apartments by
windows in the roof; but still he conjectured that
the rooms he inhabited were by no means the high-
est in the building, as he could perceive around his
windows' high circular walls, whose tops he could
not discern; and therefore concluded that his rooms
were in the centre of the edifice, purposely sur-
rounded by turrets, to deprive the prisoner of the
hope of effecting an escape from the casements.
For the first time it now occurred to him, that
the possibility of an escape might present itself to
"him, were he to climb up his chimney, and take a
survey from its top of the surrounding walls. It
was now the month of June, the evenings of course
long, and the influence of a full moon rendered the
night itself almost a rival of the day. No sooner
had this idea entered his mind, than he resolved to
make the attempt ; he awaited with impatience the
hour in the afternoon at which his evening meal was
broughť to him; and the steps of the attendant
being no longer audible along the stone' gallery," he
stripped himself of his outer garments,' and sum-
moning that resolution which is given to us by

despair, he succeeded in mounting some feet up
the
channel, which would at least convey him to the
light and air, if not to liberty; for already the
beams of day met him as he ascended. But, alas!
a few moments cast a damp upon his hopes; an iron
grating, fixed across the chimney, baffled equally,
his attempts to remove it, or to crowd his body
through its apertures.
Disappointed expectation is one of the worst feel.
ings to bear with any degree of complacency of mind.
Edward threw himself upon his bed, and, for a
while, gave way to fruitless lamentations; for the
mind of greatest strength may be worn down by,
calamity, into expressing its sorrows in terms
equally devoid of self-control as the weakest could
uşe in a similar situation. It is very easy to reason,
upon the wisdom of resignation, when we do not
experience the necessity of exercising it; and equal-
ly difficult to call it forth, when we are placed in a
situation of trial and affliction.
Edward had not a single implement in his pos-
session with which he conceived it possible for bim
to wrench the iron grating from its holds, and
force himself a way to the top of the chimney. His
fire had been constantly of wood throughout the
winter, and a pair of tongs were all the furniture of
his hearth ; and these had been so long in use, that
there could be no hesitation in pronouncing them
too weak for the task of dislodging the iron grating
from its seat in the stone wall. He had no sword
about him, when first trepanned into his present

confinement; not a single article was there in his
apartments which promised him the slightest assist-
ance ; 'and he felt almost decided that his plan must
fall to the ground, till he began to reflect, that
what he had not articles of strength to effect, might
be produced by perseverance and art. He happen-
ed to have about him a large clasp knifeof tempered
steel : could he devise any method of cutting its
edge into teeth in the form of a saw, he believed that,
with unremitting labour, the iron bars which com-
posed the grating might be cut through.
He searched his apartments narrowly round, but
not even a nail could be found with which to begin
his experiment of converting his knife into a saw.
With fresh disappointment he desisted from his
fruitless search. Every thought was strained to
find means of effecting his purpose ; and, at length,
that invention which seldom fails to spring from
spurring necessity came to his aid. He observed
that a single iron bar, which was raised about half
a foot from the hearth of his chimney, in order to
confine the wood within the limits of security, had
a sharp edge towards the front : and against this he
resolved to make the experiment of indenting his
knife.
The labour of the whole night produced him one
tooth, which though neither so sharp nor so regu-
larly formed as those of a properly-finished saw,
still seemed to promise him that his desired end
might be accomplished; and he hoped, when all
the teeth were formed, to be able to discover some

s
means of sharpening their points, which his mode
of forming them naturally rendered blunt and jag-
ged. - -
Carefully avoiding to work at those hours when
he expected a supply of necessaries to be brought to
his shelf, lest the noise of the process he was pursu-
ing should be heard, and lead to a discovery which
might frustrate all his high-raised hopes, and allow-
ing himself but as few hours as nature could be sa-
tisfied with for sleep, his saw was completed in
somewhat less than three weeks. As he had pro-
ceeded in his task, he had gained skill in his per-
formance, and every tooth had improved in sharp-
ness and formation upon the last: thus he felt less
anxious than he had before done about the discovery
of a method for giving keenness to their points, and
contented himself with what could be effected by
means of a flat stone which composed his earth, and
afterwards whetting them upon the leather of his
shoe.
Seven weeks of toil, of a nature infinitely more
laborious than what he had experienced while em-
ployed in making his saw, were passed by him in
dividing the grating on three of its sides from the
walls in which it was fixed; the fourth he judged
he should be able to bend down flat upon the side
of the chimney, by hanging upon it with the whole
weight of his body; desiring thus to spare himself
the additional trouble of sawing it apart from the
wall, as he had been constrained to do the three
others.

MYSTERIOUS, FREEBOOTER,
The grating, as he had expected, bent freely
downwards, impressed with his weight: but sud-
denly it started from the wall, and Edward, being
unprepared for this accident, fell, with his head
downwards, upon the hearth: a blow which he re-
ceived on his temple was his least consideration;
what he most dreaded was, lest the noise of his fall
should have been heard, and bring some one to his ,
prison to investigate the cause. He rose up with
all the precipitancy he could command, and thrust-
ing the iron grating into his bed, he drew on his
nightcap, in order, if possible, to conceal his wound,
should any one visit his rooms on the business of
inquiry, and slipping off his clothes, he jumped
into bed himself.
A quarter of an hour passed, and no footsteps
were heard ; thus reassured, he ventured again to
quit his bed, and pay such attention as he had it in
his power to do to the wound in his head. Having
washed and bound it up, he again retired to bed,
as a violent pain began to settle in his temples; and
he judged that unless he took the precaution of pass-
ing some hours in quiet, if possible in sleep, his
bruises might be of a disagreeable consequence.
Before he entered his bed, he lifted upthe mattress,
and having concealed the iron grating between that
and the canvass bottom of his bed, he laid his head
on bis pillow, with something like pleasure, at the
reflection that he had obtained for himself free access
to the roof of his prison, dancing about his heart,
and anticipating the moment when he should begin

his investigation of the possibility of effecting his
escape.
On the following morning, the violent throb-
bings he had the night before experienced in his
head were considerably abated; but that part of it
on which he had fallen was greatly swelled, and still
extremely tender and painful. For two days, ae-
cordingly, he delayed his ascent up the passage
which he had formed for himself into the air ; and
on the third, he resolved to hazard the execution
of his plan. Fearful of a surprise, he chose the
hour of evening for his experiment. The moon
was now again at the full, and about nine in the
evening he began to climb his dark and perilous
way. He feared lest the parting of the iron grating
from the wall might have loosened some stones,
which his touch might draw down upon him in his
ascent, or whether the rending of the iron from the
stone might not have so much weakened the side
wall of the chimney, that it might render his pas-
sage to the top unsafe, perhaps impracticable; but,
in a very short time, he had to congratulate himself
on having passed the spot where the iron grating
had been fixed, and as he continued to ascend, the
full disk of the moon, shining from a clear sky,
studded thickly with refulgent stars, met his sight.
The chimney was at least twenty feet in height,
and the labour attendant on mounting it, which he
effected by resting his back on one wall, and the
soles of his feet upon the opposite side, had fatigued

him more than he could have believed it possible
for what his eagerness to breathe the air had led
him to consider but a slight exertion to have done.
Arrived at the top, he anxiously cast his eyes
around on every side: parapet walls, circular tow-
ers, and the sharp angles of massive battlements,
met his sight at every turn; even in what hedeem-
ed his own exalted situation, he now found himself
many feet below the height of the wall; the light
of the sky only met his sight from above, and
through the vacant embrasures, which were acci-
dentally seen in the parapet walls.
. He looked down, and perceived a flat roof, part
of which he knew to be the top of his own apart-
ments, for he recognized the windows of particular
shape, from which they received light. Upon this
flat roof it was his desire to descend; but the chim-
ney on which he was placed rose at least twelve feet
above its surface : could he contrive to slide down
its side, he considered that he might find it impos-
-sible again to climb up it; and were he even assur-
ed that he could compass this difficulty, if his foot
should slip in his descent, his fall might be heard
by those in the apartments beneath, perhaps by the
governor himself; and thus every hope of future
escape might be cut off to him, perhaps even pu-
nishment be inflicted on him, for having made the
attempt at procuring himself liberty. Of this idea
he was, however, more careless than any other ;
no bodily torture could exceed the mental agony
4

501
which he endured from his confinement, under the
circumstances which attended his banishment from
England and the wife of his affections.
As he hung upon the wall, in consultation with
his own mind, he heard a sound, which he at first
imagined to be a pebble falling upon the window-
glass below him ; but it was almost instantly re-
peated, and he then discovered that it was the
string of a lute vibrating beneath the touch of a fin-
ger. No sooner did he ascertain the nature of the
sound, than the kind Belise recurred to his thoughts.
It was unlikely there should be any other musician
than herself within the prison ; she might at that
moment be near enough to hear his words, to reply
to them, to promise him her assistance: his heart
leapt with ecstacy at the bare idea.
The lute sounded again, but it appeared to be
farther removed from him, for its tones were
scarcely audible, though it was evident that all the
strings were moved in their turn, and that some
one was playing an air upon it. His first desire
was to ascertain from whence the sounds proceeded.
After much hesitation, he was convinced that they
arose out of a chimney about seven feet distant from
the one on the top of which he was placed, and
which did not rise to the height of the latter by
about the number of feet at which it stood from it.
In the apartment beneath that chimney was,
doubtless, Belise-that Belise whose benevolent
heart required but to be informed of his unjust suf-
ferings, to exert herself with the most praiseworthy
3 T

humanity to procure his enlargement. He doubted
not but she would recognize his voice, should he
venture to call to her ; but then, should she not be
alone-should her dreaded father-in-law be in the
same apartment with her, what affliction might he
not bring upon her, as well as upon himself ? ·
A bell was regularly tolled at ten every night,
from the highest tower of the building; and on this
signal, every door was locked for the night, the
lamps were extinguished, and all the inhabitants
retired to their respective chambers, if not to bed.
Edward resolved to descend into his apartments till
that hour should be past at which the person who
brought him his meals should come to demand his
lamp for the night, and when he was retired, again
to ascend to the spot which seemed to lead to his
only hope of enlargement, and endeavour, if pos-
sible, to catch from the sounds which might arise
to his hearing, whether or not the room from which
the adjoining chimney issued was the bedchamber
of Belise ; if he should receive any reason to believe
it so, he judged that he then might venture to pur-
sue some method of conveying through it intelli-
gence of his captivity.
His lamp having, as usual, been demanded, he
lost no time in repairing to his situation upon the
top of the chimney. Several hours were there pass-
ed by him in increasing anxiety; but he heard
neither the voice nor the lute of Belise, nor, indeed,
any sound whatever, except the growlings of the
watchdog at the outer gate, which appeared to be

503
railing at the shadows of the night, as no attention
seemed to be paid to his howlings by any of the in-
habitants of the prison.
When the clock struck two, Edward again de-
scended, spiritless and heartbroken with his fresh
disappointment, but still resolute to pursue his plan
for endeavouring to ascertain whether he might
address Belise, through the channel which he be-
lieved to communicate with her apartment, without
the fear of a discovery.
CHAPTER IX.

First Part of HENRY IV.
For several successive nights Edward repaired at
the same hour to his accustomed station, but could
obtain no satisfactory information relative to Be-
lise's apartment.
At length, one night, a few moments after the
midnight hour had sounded, a more than usual
stillness appearing to prevail around, he heard a
voice, which he could not doubt to be her's, singing
a plaintive air, unaccompanied by her lute ; he lis-

tened, and was decidedly resolved that the voice
proceeded from the same chimney from whence had
issued the tones of the lute.
This decision carried with it to his mind a cer-
tainty that beneath this chimney must be her bed-
chamber: the bell for retiring to rest had already
been tolled two hours, and it was very unlikely that
a young girl like Belise should be, at that time of
the night, in any apartment but her own chamber.
He had learnt enough for that night, and descended
into his apartment, resolved, by some means or
other, to convey to her, on the succeeding one,
intelligence of his captivity.
But the method by which this was to be effected
was a consideration full as difficult as any of the la-
bours he had yet gone through. To address her in
words he durst not attempt ; although he could not
hear any sounds near to him when mounted on his
chimney, still there might be persons near enough
to hear him, if he ventured to speak sufficiently
loud for his words to reach her. Should he write
to her, it would be almost an impossibility for him
to throw the letter with such exactness, as to en-
sure its sinking through the aperture down which
he wished it to fall; it might be carried away by
the air to a different part of the building, picked
up, and conveyed to the governor : should his aim
be correct, there was still a doubt, whether a piece
of paper, from the lightness of its weight, would
fall through the aperture or not ; whether it would.

not be equally likely, and perhaps more so, to hang
upon some part of the chimney, and never descend
at all within the reach or knowledge of Belise.
From the various plans which entered his head,
he selected one, which shall be developed in the
course of its execution.
On the following morning, before his breakfast
was brought to him, he placed upon the shelf,
against it should be turned round, a paper request-
ing a lemon to be procured for him. Not one of
his demands had hitherto been denied him, and in
the space of half an hour, a lemon was brought to
him. He had previously written the following let-
ter :-
DEAR LADY BELISE,
“ The English officer of the name of
Edward, whom you must remember to have seen
on the day of your mother's wedding with the go-
vernor of this prison—whom you honoured by your
particular conversation during the repast, and with
your hand in the dance--impressed by the exalted
feelings of benevolence which you that day express-
ed towards the uuhappy captives under the power
of your father-in-law, hesitates not to inform you
that he is unjustly a prisoner within these walls,
and ventures to implore your humane assistance in
procuring his enlargement. He is so thoroughly
convinced of the excellent nature of your heart,
that he is assured you will serve him, if the ability

so to do be yours; he therefore only adds, that for
those exertions which he is conscious you will make
in his cause, you will be rewarded with prayers and
blessings from the hearts of himself and his wretch-
ed wife, from whom he is inhumanly separated.
He was trepanned into the apartments in which he
is now a prisoner, by the governor's brother, San-
chez, on the day of your mother's wedding ; and
since that hour, the countenance of no human being
has cheered his miserable solitude.
“Pardon him that he inflicts the wounds which
sympathy will cause in a heart so exquisite in feel-
ing as your own; but conscious that the heart of
humanity conceives the opportunity of doing good
a blessing, he on this pleą grounds his excuse for
intruding upon you the sorrows of the prisoner,
EDWARD."
Having folded his letter, Edward had again re-
course to his saw, with which he made a small
aperture in one end of the lemon, and having ex-
tracted from it all the juice and pulp, he nipped
his letter into as small a compass as the paper on
which it was written was capable of being pressed
into, and thrust it into the skin of the lemon.
About half an hour after his lamp had been fetch-
ed away for the night, he ascended that path which
use had now rendered him somewhat more of an
adept in mounting. When he arrived at the top,
the moon had retired behind a cloud, and he resolv.

ed to await the moment of its emerging, rather than
hazard a failure of his plan, from his impatience to
execute it.
On this night, he heard not the voice of Belise
proceeding from the spot from whence it had before
flowed : universal silence prevailed ; not even the
howlings of the watchdog interrupted the stillness
of the infant morn.
The hour of one was on the point, as Edward
conjectured, of sounding, ere the refulgence of the
moon tempted him to make his cast.—“God speed
thee !” he exclaimed mentally, and threw from him
his lemon ; he durst scarcely follow it with his eyes,
lest his aim should have been faulty, and the next
moment present him with the failure of his plan ;
but chance smiled on his effort, and he saw the
paper which contained his petition enter the aper-
ture at which he had directed it.
An emotion of pleasure, long foreign to his heart,
ran through his veins, and he resolved not imme-
diately to quit his station, but to remain there some
minutes longer, and endeavour to learn whether
any sounds would arise, to inform that Belise had
gotten his packet safe into her possessi
Full half an hour passed, and the universal si-
lence remained unbroken. Edward was now on
the point of descending again to his apartment,
when he heard the wards of a lock creak; the
sound appeared to be at a short distance from him
on his left side, and not far from the chimney down
which he had just thrown his letter.

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
He was at that moment in the act of beginning
to descend the chimney ; his hands were rested on
the top of the wall, and half his face only rising
above it. Fear and expectation equally prevented
him from moving, and he heard a voice say—
“ When you tap at the door, and I ask, who is
there? say, the city of Ostend—be that your watch-
word—I shall know you by it.”—“ It is well,” re-
plied another voice.—“ Think you she will be with
you?” asked the first speaker.—“I hope she will,
but cannot, to a certainty, determine,” replied the
other.-" Well, well,” answered the first speaker,
“ that is nothing to me: I will be ready for you.”
· The man who had spoken last now disappeared
again through the door by which they had both en-
tered upon the roof, and closed it after him ; the
other advanced towards the chimney which Edward
had conceived to arise out of the chamber of Belise,
and taking from under a horseman's cloak (or, at
least, such appeared the garment in which he was
wrapped) a ladder of ropes, he slung it, by means
of a couple of hooks which were fastened to it,
upon the top of the chimney-wall, and then threw
it into the inside." This done, he took off his cloak,
and having laid it down, he climbed upon an iron
supporter, which ran from the centre of the chim-
ney to the leaden roof beneath, and from this he
mounted on the top of the wall, whence he placed
his foot upon the first step of his ladder, and imme-
diately began to disappear down the chimney.
The agitated mind of Edward gave him no power

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
509
of reflecting on what the conversation he had just
overheard might mean ; all there was room for in
his brain was the possibility of escape, which ap-
peared to present itself to him in his knowledge of
the stranger's watchword, and his ability of disguis-
ing himself in the cloak, which he had left upon
the roof.
It was an opportunity too flattering not to be
grasped at by one in the situation of the unhappy
Edward. Remounting the top of the chimney, he
threw his legs over on the outer side, and clinging
with his arms to an angle of the wall, by a sudden
effort of resolution he suffered himself to drop down;
his arms supported him against the wall forseveral feet
of his descent, but here a prominence in the stone-
work threw him off his hold, and he fell with his
back upon the hård roof of lead beneath. His
shoulders were excessively bruised, and his left
arm benumbed by the blow it had received ; still,
regardless of bodily injuries, while the power was
left him of rising upon his legs, he listened anxiously,
dreading lest the noise of his fall should have
called any one to the spot. But all remained si-
lent, and judging that every moment might be of the
most material consequence to his safety, as the
stranger might return, and thus frustrate his at-
tempt at passing for him to the man, whoever he
might be, in the turret, he hastily put on the cloak,
and tapped upon the door. -" Who's there?”
immediately asked a voice.--" The city of Ost-

end," replied Edward, trembling lest his voice
should betray him.
The door was opened, and he stepped in: by
the lamp held in the hand of the man who ad-
mitted him, and whom he conjectured to be one
of the keepers of the prison, he saw that he was
standing at the head of a winding staircase. The
man began to descend, and he followed him.-
“ So you are come alone ?” said the man.
Fearful of speaking, lest his answers should betray
him for an impostor, and equally dreading to re-
main silent, Edward replied—" Yes, but I shall
come again to-morrow night.”—“Ah," returned
the man, “ it is ten to one if I can admit you again
to-morrow-night; why did you not bring her away
now ?—What is the use of delay ?-No time like
the present.”
They were now at the bottoin of the stairs, and
Edward's guide moved hastily along a stone passage,
which brought them into a lofty hall, of which the
vaulted roof was supported by pillars, beyond the
first range of which nothing was visible by the faint
rays of the single lamp carried by the man.
They had nearly gained the extremity of the
hall, when the 'man suddenly exclaimed-
“ Hark!” They both stopped and listened-Dis-
tant footsteps were audible—“Yes,” cried the
man, we are discovered ! fy to the chapel,
and conceal yourself in the confessional.” So
saying, he blew out the lamp, and Edward heard

his ear,
tance from the spot where he had left him stand-
ing.
This information was doubtless friendly, and
might have been of infinite service to the stran-
ger whom Edward was personating, but to him
it was entirely useless. He cast his eyes
around
-darkness met them on every side. The steps of
his pursuers, if such they were, increased on
and in a very few moments a light was vi-
sible on the opposite side of the hall; a second
followed it, and almost instantly after a third ap-
peared in view.
He perceived that they were carried by three
different men, and in the midst of them he be-
held one with a drawn sword in his hand, whom
he believed to be the governor. They did not
speak, nor did they appear to see him. He
slipped hastily behind a pillar, hoping thus to es-
cape their notice. They separated in the centre of
the hall, and taking different directions, each mov-
ed slowly along, with his lamp held above his head,
to assist his search after those of whom he was in
pursuit. After some moments, one of the three
passed within a few paces of the pillar behind which
Edward had screened himself; the light of the lamp
borne by this man shewed him a couple of steps
which led into a chapel. Once more something
like hope warmed his heart, and as the man receded
from him, he ascended the steps, and proceeded
forward. The lamps were now so far removed
from him, that he was again left in total darkness,

sáve a faint illumination which entered by a lofty
window, and which he conjectured to be the light
of the moon.
Eager to find some place of concealment, he still
moved on a single step, of about a foot in depth,
which the light was not sufficient for him to discerni,
threw him forwards, and he felt against a wooden
substance, which slid from him as the weight of his
body sunk upon it, and he fell with it to the ground.
A loud noise accompanied this accident.--" Here !
here !_this way!!!. was directly echoed from dif-
ferent parts of the hall, and in the space of a minute
the lamps advanced sufficiently near to discover to
him that he had fallen upon a coffin, which he had
knocked from its supporters, and as he rested his
hands on it to raise himself again upon his feet, he
read upon its lid, in brass letters,“ Sanchez Xavia,
aged LXIV.”
Before he had time for reflection, both his arms
were caught hold of by the men who had entered
the chapel, and the governor, presenting himself
before him, said—“ Well, sir, you see you are
caught; however, don't be alarmed-those never
need be afraid of me who can pay their way into
my good graces ; 80 come, deliver up to me the
two purses of gold which you have in your pockets ;
I'll turn them to quite as good a use as you would
have made of them.”
"You know,” replied Edward, surprised out of
the reply, and forgetting at the moment that he
was mistaken for another man, " you know that I
have no gold about me.”

513
I know you have,” replied the governor ; " I
overheard you tell my daughter-in-law that you had
sold your commission for four hundred and fifty pie-
ces, and that they were in two purses, one in each
pocket of your horseman's cloak ; so give me leave
to save you the trouble of delivering them up to me
yourself—I'll make you ample recompence for the
gift, though you give it me unwillingly—I'll main-
tain
you
for it for life-Don't think that I am weak
enough to let you go, and inform against me for
easing a young fool of his money."
These words he followed by putting his bands in-
to the pockets of the cloak now worn by Edward,
from which he pulled two purses, which, by the
chinking sound they sent forth, as Garcias shaked
them between his fingers, seemed to contain what
he had asserted they did : not satisfied with these,
but thinking that there might be still more behind,
the governor thrust his hands again into each pocket
of the cloak, and, in withdrawing them from the
examination, he pulled the cloak off one of Edward's
shoulders. " What's this I see?” exclaimed he:
“ have you got on an English uniform since you
sold your French commission? What does all this
mean ?” added he, raising the cap which had fallen
partly over Edward's eyes. “ Why, zounds, and
the devil, can I believe my sight !” he again burst
forth-"My English prisoner !-Am I witched, or
do my eyes deceive me ? By what mystery do I see
you here, in the cloak, and possessed of the money
of Adolphus Biron ?”

Edward was unable to speak, had he been inclin-
ed so to have done ; a mist danced before his eyes,
and he felt ready to sink into the earth.
“ So then,” continued the governor, '• not satis-
fied with his attempt to steal my daughter, the
brave Adolphus has been lending his assistance to
my prisoner in effecting his escape."
“ Whomsoever you are speaking of,” said Ed-
ward, roused to a reply by the unjust accusation
preferring against an innocent man," he is entirely
faultless with respect to myself, and my attempts
to escape your tyranny ; whatever I have done, in
the hope of procuring my liberty, I have performed
unaided. I do not know Adolphus.”
“ You soon shall then,” replied the governor ;
"you shall enjoy the happiness of being fellow-prison-
ers; for since you have not known how to be grate-
ful for the benefits and indulgencies you enjoyed in
the apartments you lately inhabited, you shall for
the future be taught the reverse, and learn what
you have lost by your folly.”
“Wretch!-wretch !” exclaimed Edward, “there
will come a day, when you will learn what you have
lost by the exercise of
upon
the inno-
cent and unfortunate. How did your brother in
blood, your brother in iniquity, who now lies dead
at your feet, expire ? Were the last moments of his
existence calm ?-were they such as gave you en-
couragement to die under the performance of such
acts as you are now living in ?”
The governor's countenance underwent two or

three changes from pale to red, and then again from
red to pale ; and he replied, though by no means in
so firm a tone as he had before spoken—“What, do
you think Sanchez died like a cowardly priest, and
that I am to be awed by your pious sermonizing?
Spare your breath-you only waste it on me ; when
Garcias Xavia hath once said, “I'll do it,' nothing
can turn me from my purpose. I owe my faith to
my employers, and religiously keep it with them.”
“ And what regard do you pay to the faith you
owe to Heaven ?” asked Edward, with emphasis.
“ Have not I told you already not to waste your
breath on me ?” he replied, in a tone of displea-
sure ; then turning to his men, he said" Conduct
him to the vacant cell in the southern tower-I'll
meet you there presently-do not leave him till I
come.”
The governor and one of his attendants then
turned towards the direction by which Edward had
wandered thus far from his prison, intending, as
Edward could not doubt, to repair to the chamber
of his daughter, in search of the stranger whom he
had named Adolphus Biron ; and the two men, who
already held Edward, dragged him out of the cha-
pel to the opposite side of the hall, from which they
constrained him to pass through several passages
to the cell of which the governor had spoken. It
was a lofty space of about eighteen feet square ; it
was built of a grey stone, of which material four
pillars, placed at equal distances from each other,
seemed to be the supporters of the roof. On one

side was a chimney, vast and dreary, and which
appeared, notwithstanding its size, incapable of
giving warmth to the prison, of which the air, even
at the present clement season of the year, was damp
and chilly.
At each end was a rude bedstead, spread with
straw, over which was thrown a ragged quilt, which
appeared the only covering belonging to it. The
men placed their lamps on a bench which stood
near one of the pillars, and kept their hands fixed
upon Edward's arms, whilst they awaited the com-
ing of the governor.
In the space of about twenty minutes he appear-
ed, followed by the man who had left the hall with
him, and another, who also appeared to be a ser-
vant of the prison; and these led between them a
young man, of about twenty-three years of age,
habited in the military uniform of France.
A couple of chains were immediately produced
by the order of the governor, and with these the
young man and Edward were chained to opposite
pillars; padlocks were placed on the chains where
they crossed their waists, to deprive them of the
possibility of freeing themselves from them : and
this done, the governor, without addressing his
prisoners, commanded his men to take up their
lamps and follow him; they obeyed—the prison
was left in total darkness, and its inhabitants heard
the door locked and bolted upon them.
“ Unfortunate stranger,” said Edward, address-
ing his companion in captivity, “add not to thee

many other miseries with which I am already bur-
dened, thy resentment against one equally unhappy
as thyself—who is indeed the instrument of thy
present bondage, but who is entirely free from the
intention of inflicting on another those pangs under
which he has himself so long mourned.”
Adolphus replied—“I cannot blame you for the
method by which you attempted to effect your es-
cape from these walls ; it was the perversity of our
fate which led us both into a situation where the
combination of circumstances has conspired to ren-
der us more miserable than we were before.—1,"
continued he, “have more to dread from the re-
sentment of the governor than you are acquainted
with ; my fears are not confined to myself alone-
my every nerve is strung with agony for the fate of
my Belise.”
“ Heaven avert all danger from her benevolent
heart !” exclaimed Edward.
“ I am well aware,” replied Adolphus, “that
you know how to estimate her excellence ; a few
minutes before I reached her apartment this night,
she had received a letter from you, mysteriously
conveyed to her, which proves that you entertain
just sentiments of her sensibility and benevolence :
impressed with the liveliest pity for your situation,
she shewed me your petition, and obtained my pro-
mise to assist her in attempting to procure your
enlargement from captivity.”
“ Generous girl !” exclaimed Edward ; may

the reward of her excellent disposition, although
protracted, be ultimately adequate to her merits!"
“ Should I ever obtain my release from my pre-
sent bonds,” said Adolphus, “should my Belise
ever be restored to my arms by the kind interpo-
sition of Providence in our behalf-how dismal are
the prospects in life to which I am doomed to look
forward! I am an outcast from those who should
be my protectors, and I am left entirely destitute,
by the loss of those pieces of gold which the villa-
nous governor has this night stolen from the pockets
of my cloak ; they were my all, and should I ever
again clasp my Belise to my breast, she will hold
a beggar to her heart.”
My lot,” replied Edward, is equally desti-
tute as your own; I have myself never known a pa-
rent; and the beloved woman whom I have allied
to me by the tender title of wife is under the control
of an unjust and imperious father, by whese machi-
nations I am now detained a prisoner in this place,
and who labours with too much success to prevent
her from ever again reposing her aching head on the
breast of an affectionate husband.”
This mutual confession drew from each inquiries
that led to the history of their past lives. Edward
freely narrated his to his fellow in misfortune, who
then recounted the principal events of his own life
in nearly the following words :-
My father,” said Adolphus, was a merchant
of considerable repute in the city of Dunkirk ; my
younger brother, Frederick, and myself, were his

only children ; I was two years older than my
brother ; and about the time I had attained my fif-
teenth rear, severe and unavoidable misfortunes
attended my father in trade, which reduced him to
the mortifying necessity of declaring himself insol-
vent; and, in the course of the following year, he
died of a broken heart.
“ At this unhappy period my brother and my-
self must have been cast destitute upon the world,
but for a brother of my deceased mother, a rich old
bachelor, residing at Ostend, who invited us to
make his house our home.
My uncle was a man of great pride and auste-
rity of character, and he took care to make us feel
that we were in his debt : however, in the course
of a couple of years, he became in some measure at-
tached to us, and gave us to understand that he in-
tended to leave his fortune between us at his death,
though he never explained to us in what proportion
he meant to distribute it.
“ About two years ago, that is, just after I had
completed my twenty-first year, I became acquaint-
ed with my adored Belise ; I saw her but to love
her, and to wish her mine. My brother Frederick,
who had also gained an introduction to her, saw
her with the same eyes as myself ; but his attentions
were by no means so pleasing to her as mine were ;
and upon me fell her choice and her heart.
“ Her mother, though a woman of considerable
property herself, still experienced infinite pride and
satisfaction in seeing her daughter likely to become

the wife of the co-heir of one of the wealthiest men
in the city, and gave me every encouragement in
her power to persevere in my suit.
“My uncle was acquainted with my attachment
to Belise, but considered it as one of those impres-
sions which assail the heart of youth, afford it plea-
sure while they last, and are easily effaced by any
other which promises a greater degree of gratifica-
tion ; for at the very same time that he rallied me
on my love for her, he informed me, with all the
seriousness of a man who believes himself to be
communicating pleasing intelligence, that he had
ascertained that my hand would be accepted, with
the greatest readiness, by a lady of the city, who
had already been twice married, besides being dou-
ble my age, and with whose family he said it had
always been his ambition to ally his own.
“I heard his proposal with real surprise, and
without hesitation expressed to him my astonish-
ment that he should suppose my heart to be of so
fickle a nature as to relinquish the prepossession
which he knew it already to entertain for another
object, particularly when he was well acquainted
with the highly amiable qualities and engaging man-
ners of her to whom it was devoted.
“He at first laughed at my scruples, but when
he found me resolute in my adherence to those
principles which justice and honour dictated to me
to persevere in, he flew into a violent passion, and
loading me with approbrious terms, all of which he
qualified with the epithet “ungrateful,” he burst out

of the room, and left me to my reflections. From
these I could receive no consolation but the consci.
ousness of having acted rightly, and the assurance
that my Belise would not waver from her attach-
ment, whatever might be the future fate of the man
on whom her affections were fixed; for I concluded,
from what I had already seen of my uncle's charac-
ter, that the right I had assumed of thinking for
myself, and my having been sufficiently hardy to
oppose one of his favourite schemes, would lose me
his favour for ever: nor was I mistaken in
my
idea.
From this time his coolness towards me increased
every day; and I could perceive that my brother
Frederick, who had before stood second in his fa-
vour, was now raised to the very summit of his
esteem.
“Rather more than a week explained to me the
cause of my observations : my brother no longer
spoke in raptures of Belise, as he had been ac-
customed to do, and in whose affections, I believe,
he had, to that very time, entertained a hope of
supplanting me. He even sought opportunities of
undervaluing that disposition, and those charms,
the praise of which had before been his favourite
topic; and when I remarked to him the change
that had taken place in his sentiments, he replied
- Well, then congratulate yourself that you
have
no longer a rival in your adoration of her. My
uncle has selected for me an alliance of which I see
the value, although your honourable heart spurned
the many advantages that are attached to it; but

you will no doubt be much happier with love and
slender circumstances.'
“ These words, spoken with a contemptuous
sneer, left me no doubt that my brother had been
swayed by the voice of interest, and had accepted
the alliance which I had rejected. My conjecture
was a just one, for within a month he became her
husband. On the day of his marriage, immediately
after the ceremony had taken place, my uncle thus
addressed me. It is but just that the observance
of the duty of obedience," and its neglect, should
meet with opposite rewards ; know, therefore, that
for his acquiescence in the favourite wish of my
heart, your brother is from this hour the declared
heir of my property, with the exception of one le-
gacy—that legacy I bestow on you before my death ;
it consists of a commission, contained in that pa-
per,' extending his hand towards me as he spoke;
" and learn, that it is not from any personal regard
I bear you that I confer on you this gift, but to de-
prive the world of the opportunity of saying, that
I have cast out an orphanof my late sister a beggar.
You will therefore immediately join your regiment,
as your presence here cannot give pleasure either
to myself or to your brother, whose happiness con-
sists in seeing me pleased.'
: “Humiliating as I felt it to be obliged to accept
the charity of one who soʻunjustly despised me, still
more dreadful was the idea of appearing before my
Belise an outcast anda beggar; and, receiving from
his hands the offered commission, I said From

one on whom I have no direct claim, every gift
must be acknowledged as a favour; I thank you,
sir, for what you have been pleased to confer on
me, and wish my brother and yourself much happi-
ness in your congenial sentiments.' I was greatly
gratified to find that the calmness with which I ut-
tered these words had the effect I desired them to
produce, of enraging my unnatural relative, when,
probably, had I suffered my own real feelings of
passion to have appeared, he might only have
reaped from them food for his ill-natured gratifica-
tion ; and while he was studying a reply, I left the
house.
“ In the heart of my Belise this unexpected
change in my circumstances had worked no altera-
tion; but her mother, who was now become the
wife of Garcius Xavia, and was probably influenced
in her opinion by his crafty avarice, immediately
forbade me access to the house, and charged her
daughter on no account to entertain any idea of my
now ever becoming her husband.
“ All access to my Belise was thus debarred me,
and I found that her mother had the intention of
uniting her to an old man, who had no recommen-
dation but his wealth, from which he had made
many handsome presents to the governor, to buy
his interest in his favour. No means of communi.
cating with her now remained to me but by writing :
she bribed one of the keepers of the prison to bring
me a letter, containing a full account of what was
passing, which informed me, that she feared her

mother intended to marry her to the man of her
aversion in the course of a few days. The keeper
who brought me this letter proved to be a person
who had formerly been in the service of my deceas-
ed father; thus his knowledge of me rendered him
doubly willing to be our friend. By him I returned
an answer to her letter, telling her that if she
would agree to fly with me, I would sell my com-
mission, and that we would retire into some distant
country, where the money I should thus have rea-
lized would purchase us a small farm, sufficient to
afford us a comfortable maintenance.
In the course of a week I received from her ano-
ther letter, acquainting me, that if I would be at
the prison gate, at the unfortunate midnight which
is just past, and provide myself with a ladder of
ropes against my coming, our mutual friend would
instruct mein a mode of gaining access to her cham-
ber, where she would load me with such articles of
value as she possessed, and then fly with me from
the tyranny of her mother and the governor.
“That I came at the appointed time it is unne-
cessary for me to repeat to you; nor need I inform
you of the means which I used, according to the
instructions of my friend, the keeper, for gaining
admittance into the apartment of my Belise; but,
arrived there, fate frowned upon our hopes—for the
governor, whose profession renders him naturally
suspicious and watchful, was, as he has since ex-
plained it, lurking about the prison at the time of
my descending into her chamber, and catching the

525
sound of a second voice within it, he immediately
laid his ear to the door, and having heard me
inform her of the four hundred and fifty pieces of
gold which were in the pockets of my cloak, he
resolved, at one blow, to make himself master of
them, and prevent our escape.
· Having accordingly summoned to his aid some
of his servants, he proceeded to the hall, through
which he knew we must unavoidably pass in our
way out of the prison. Here you, by the error into
which my cloak led him, became his victim, and
having secured you, he returned to the chamber of
his daughter-in-law ; we had just left it, and gained
the roof, where I was expressing my surprise at my
cloak being gone, when his voice assailed our
ears : in a few seconds more I was his prisoner,
and
my Belise torn from my sight.”
Here Adolphus paused; his heart swelled with
agony at the idea of the torments to which Belise
might be exposed by her cruel parents ; his fren-
zied inind presented her to him forced into the arms
of unfeeling age, and calling upon him for that pro-
tection which he was denied the power of rendering
her.
Edward and his fellow-captive were both too mise-
rable in their own feelings, to afford each other any
portion of that consolation which adds strength to
the mind, and pours a healing balm upon the wounds
inflicted by the hand of sorrow. They both con-
cluded their sufferings to be doomed to end only with

their lives, and the ineffectual sigh alone broke the
silence of their lips.
On the morrow some of the keepers entered their
prison, and lenthened the chains which bound
them, to such an extent as enabled them to reach
the straw pallets that were placed at either end
of their cell : this action afforded some relief to
their aching limbs; but still care was taken to keep
them at that distance from each other, which
should prevent their affording one another any
assistance in freeing themselves from their bonds.
Thus passed several months, during which the
bare necessaries of life were brought to them for
their support, and during which time they had not
been able to extort a single word from any of the
keepers who had entered their cell, in reply to the
inquiries they had advanced to them.
From Adolphus, Edward learnt that an engage-
ment had taken place a few days before they had
become fellow-prisoners, in which Sanchez Xavia
had been so severely wounded in both his legs,
that amputation had become necessary, and that he
had died very soon after the operation.
“We are still not the most unhappy beings in
existence,” said Edward; we are eminently
blessed, when our hearts are compared with those
of such men as Sanchez Xavia. Neither liberty,
wealth, nor the accomplishment of our most ex-
tended' wishes, if our minds be the slaves of evil
passions, can procure us that true felicity which
will be the companion even of imprisonment, poverty,

Thrbe sad and mournful years had now passed
over the head of Edward in his captivity, when
a circumstance took place, which once more ani-
mated the latentsparks of hope within his breast.
The provisions with which himself and Adolphus
were supplied consisted principally of bread and
fruit, amongst the latter, of which were frequently
mixed chesnuts. On a certain day, their supply
being brought as usual to their prison, Adolphus
who had been for some time past indisposed, and
unable to rise from his straw pallet, having refused
all nourishment but the bread and milk allowed
him, the basket was set down near Edward ; it
contained some apples, some bread, and a few ches-
nuts. On looking into the basket, Edward per-

ceived that one or two of the chesnuts were pe-
cu liarly marked with white lines ; he took them
up, in order to examine what these could be—for
where the mind has but little to amuse it, it eagerly
catches at any object which turns it for awhile
from itself—and found that they were made by
particles of the rind being cut away, through
which the white nut beneath shewed itself; and
on the one which he first took into his hand,
he imagined he could decypher those letters which
compose the word “ have.” He eagerly cast his
eyes upon a second, and on this was engraved the
single letter “ A.”
A confusion of ideas floated in his brain ; and
hastily picking out all those which bore on them
any characters, he arranged them with a trembling
hand in different situations, till they at last pre-
sented him with this sentence :-
" You have a friend within these walls."
A túmult of joy ran through his veins, and fall-
ing on ħis knees, he exclaimed—" Oh God, ac-
cept my thanks ! in firm reliance that the eye of
Providence never sleeps to the sufferer who places
faith in his benevolence, I have never despaired
—and thou hast rewarded my dependence on thy
mercy. Oh God! my soul pours forth its gratitude
before thee.
This sudden exclamation on the part of Edward
roused the attention of Adolphus, in reply to whose
inquiries of the cause which had thus agitated
him, he gave a full account of the occurrence of

the last minutes; and a thousand conjectures were
then formed by them both, of who could be the
person from whom this enigmatical assurance of
friendship had proceeded. It was also a doubt with,
Edward, on cooler reflection, whether the infor-
mation had been intended for him or his fellow-
captive. Adolphus believed it either the work
of his Belise, or of their mutual friend the keep-
er, who might have escaped from the detection of
the fault he had committed in admitting him, on
the fatal night from which he dated the commence-
ment of his captivity, to the apartment of Belise,
and might still retain his situation in the prison,
but have been hitherto prevented from giving him
information that he was not less than ever interested
in his fate. - -
However, as so great a cloud of mystery hung
over the intelligence thus artfully conveyed, they
mutually vowed that they would not accept any
terms of liberation which did not include them both.
The participation of their sorrows and hardships
had rendered them sincerer friends than flippant
prosperity could have done; and they experienced
the most consolatory sensations, from the strictness
of that friendship by which they felt themselves
allied to each other.
Several weeks passed on, and no fresh intelli-
gence reached the captives; narrowly did they exa-
mine every supply of chesnuts which was brought
to them, and with equal nicety did they investigate
every article which was introduced into their cell,

in the hope of meeting with some farther infor:
mation which might keep alive the embers of hope
within their breasts ; but disappointment attended
all their researches.
The weeks grew into months, and seven of these
had moved on with tardy pace, when, one evening
between the hours of eight and nine, the keeper
who had for some time past solely attended upon
them, entered their prison ; he closed the door after
him, and in a familiar tone called out--" How are
ye, gentlemen ? how are ye ?” Adolphus and Ed-
ward looked at him in silent surprise : his steps
were faltering, and they perceived that he was in-
toxicated ; in one hand he held a flask, his pipe
was in his mouth, and in bis other hand he grasped
the large key of their prison-door; he staggered
towards the fire, and placed himself upon the bench, ,
which he had drawn to the hearth... ili in
Having applied his mouth to the flask, and with-
drawn it again from his lips with a smack, which
pronounced him to have relished the draught it had
afforded him, he said' Gentlemen, I have come
to have a little talk with you : I am an honest man,
though you see me one of the keepers of a prison.
My master, the governor, makes a great deal of
money by keeping you, and others like you, con-
fined in this place; now I don't see the reason why
I should not make a little money, as well as he by
letting you out of it ; now an't I an honest fellow, ?”
However serviceable this intention might provę
to our prisoners, they did not feel it at all consistent

531
with truth to compliment him on the virtue of
honesty ; thus with a smile they remained silent.
Well,” continued the keeper,
now I have
explained to you my intentions, how much are you
willing to give me for your liberty ?”
Adolphus and Edward, well acquainted that they
were equally poor, cast upon each other a look of
mingled enquiry, how they should reply to the
question, and of agony and despair, at the certain
knowledge that they had no bribe whateyer to offer
him.
“ You hesitate, methinks, a long while,” cried
he,
“ for two men who have appeared as miserable
as you have both done in captivity, about deciding
on a reward for him who offers to become
your
li.
berator. Mark this-a trifle won't satisfy me, as
I can never return hither again to my present sta-
tion, when I have once conveyed you out of the
reach of danger, and shall therefore be thrown out
of employment."
My friend,” said Edward, you must be sen-
sible that we can have nothing valuable about us
here to reward you with ; nor will we deceive you
in promises that we should not be able to perform.
We are far from affluent, and were we enlarged from
this spot, our means of life would be to be earned
by us, as we have unjustly been deprived of all we
once possessed, and have no dependence left us but
our own endeavours. One thing alone we can as-
sure you of, that while we have the
power
of living,
you shall never be destitute ; our gratitude will

teach us to exert every nerve in rendering you a re-
ward equal to your desert : more we have it not in
our power to promise.”
“ You have not !” returned the man," why then I
must try somebody else : promises wont do for me ;
I have a certainty here, and can't give it up for the
chance of living upon promises. I am very sorry
for you, but I can't afford to do any thing for you,
as I am an honest man."
He rose from the bench and was moving towards
the door.
แ
Stay,” said Adolphus ; “ take this ring of hair:
shew it to the governor's daughter, Belise, and en-
treat her to return what money she can command to
him who sent it.”
“What should that be for ?” asked the keeper;
“ do you think she'll lend her money, if she has
got any, to a stranger, especially to help him out
of her father's clutches ? she'd sooner send you a
handcuff, I warrant me."
“ You mistake, you mistake,” cried Adolphus,
“ I am no stranger to her, nor is she at all of the
disposition of her father-in law. I entreat you to
take it, and make the experiment.”
“ No, no; there is too much danger in it,” said
the man : " ten to one but she informs against me
to her father.”
" I will pledge my soul that she will not !” ex-
claimed Adolphus.
' Ay, but that would be no recompence to me
for the loss of my head,” rejoined the keeper, “ in

533
case the governor was to chop it off, in consequence
of her prattling. I don't like trusting women.'
He placed the key in the door, in order to let
himself out.
“ Do
you then absolutely refuse to make the ex-
periment ?” asked Adolphus.
“ Not absolutely,” returned the man: “there
is one chance for you; if no other prisoner can pay
me for his liberty in any thing better than you have
offered me, namely, promises, I'll come back, and
make trial of the ring; but if I can get any thing
better, you must not expect me. I am an honest
man, and tell you the truth ;” and having said this
he went out, and locked the door after him.
Their present disappointment bore less hardly on
the friends than it would have done, had they pos-
sessed no other chance of being delivered from their
bonds than the one which their poverty had just
obliged them to relinquish. They were not at all
surprised at the kind of philosophy practised by
the keeper, who was in the daily habit of seeing
his master heaping together wealth by the most
unfair means ; · and they entertained some faint
hope that he would find it difficult to meet a ready
reward for his offered services from any unhappy
victim to the avarice of the governor, and that he
would still return for the ring:
The night passed on, and the keeper did not return;
thus they concluded that he had either found some
captive able to pay him for his enlargement, or that
Ke had sunk to sleep under the influence of intoxi-

cation, and had entirely forgotten the ring of Adol-
phus.
About that hour in the morning at whieh their
breakfast was usually brought to them, the door of
the cell was opened, and a keeper, whom they had
never seen before, entered; he was followed by an-
other mạn, in mean and tattered garments, one of
whose eyes was concealed under a bandage, and
whose left leg was bent up at the knee, and rested
on a wooden supporter. The former addressing
Adolphus, spoke first. -" We are come to fetch
you,” he said,
by order of the governor, to a
better apartment. Here, comrade, unlock his
chain,” he added, giving a key into the hand of
the other man, who having received the key, moved
up to Adolphus, saying to his fellow—“Stand you
meanwhile, by the door."
There was something of such infinite familiarity
to the senses of Edward in the voice of the last
speaker, that it thrilled every chord in his system :
he fixed his eyes énetratingly on the features of the
man; a variety of circumstances united in his mind,
and he recognized in the poor, tattered, and disabled
figure which stood before him—the well-known
HUBERT.
The eye of Hubert met his : its expression en-
joined silence, and, painful as was the injunction,
Edward obeyed it.
A few moments served to unlock the chain of
Adolphus. Had his own inclination been consulted,
he would have preferred remaining where he was,

and sharing the conversation of Edward, which had
been a great consolation to the miseries of his im-
prisonment, to the enjoyment of a better apartment
without his society; but knowing remonstrance to
be in vain, as the command proceeded from a voice
from which there was no appeal, he suffered him-
self to be led away without resistance, Edward and
he exchanging good wishes for the future welfare of
each other at parting.
For some minutes Edward could scarcely believe
himself to be awake, so impossible did he feel it to
believe that his senses had presented him with any
thing more than an illusion, when he had supposed
himself to have beheld the person of Hubert; and
as he became convinced that it was indeed a reality
which he had seen, he burst into a flood of tears,
which gave relief to his overburdened feelings.
When his mind became sufficiently calm for re-
flection, he no longer doubted by whom had been
planned and executed the artifice of the chesnuts;
and his heart glowed with a fervency of gratitude
towards Hubert, which surpassed in strength any
sensation he had yet experienced ; so exquisite is
the happiness of finding a sincere friend still allied
to us, at the moment when we have believed our-
selves to be forgotten and forsaken by the whole
world.
How Hubert had introduced himself into the pri-
son, in his present disabled state and mean disguise,
did not at all excite his surprise; what most raised
his astonishment was, by what means Hubert had

learnt him not to be dead; when he doubted not
but the report of his death had been currently circu-
lated in England, and had discovered the place of
his confinement.
A thousand distracting thoughts bewildered his
brain, and pain and pleasure met in it with equal
strength. Hubert might be detected in his friend-
ship, might suffer death on his account-Hubert
might succeed in procuring his enlargement, and
once again conduct him to the arms of his wife.-
Oh, Rosalind ! dearest, most adored of women !
dost thou still live ?” he exclaimed. “Oh that one
single instant of communication had been permitted
me with Hubert, that I might have received from
him intelligence of thy welfare !"
The contradictory ideas which swelled his imagi-
nation almost brought on a delirium ; he endeavour.
ed in vain to compose his mind, and throwing him-
self upon his pallet, prayed for sleep, lest reason
should fade under the torturing influence of combin-
ed hope and fear.
CHAPTER XI.

To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.

We must now dedicate a few pages to the adven-
turous Hubert. It will be remembered, that in
the conversation which passed between him and the

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, 537
lord baron de Mowbray, relative to the disposal of
Rosalind's then unborn child, the baron had said
—“Edward will see England no more; he is by my
design detained in Flanders.” And at the same
instant that conveyed to him this intelligence,
Hubert resolved that if human means could disco-
ver his retreat, and procure his enlargement, to be
himself the instrument of restoring him to his
lamenting Rosalind.
Hubert was one of those beings who may be
termed the universal friends of man; the benefits
of education he had not enjoyed, but nature had
gifted him with a heart possessed of those rich
virtues which instruction may refine, but cannot
better. Whence then had one, whose soul was
the seat of every good quality, obtained the name of
“Surly 2” It was because the honest Hubert could
neither fawn, smile, nor cringe—it was because the
honest Hubert could not see the dignity of man
insulted, whether it were clad in the laced robe of
prosperity or in the tattered garb of indigence,
without expressing the indigent feelings that arose
in his mind—it was because Hubert could not com-
mend an action of which he believed the motive to
be dishonourable—it was because, desiring the
happiness of every human being, the many wretches
whom he saw in existence caused his brow to wear
an almost constant frown of grief.
When Edward, whilst a youth, first addressed
Hubert on the ramparts of de Mowbray Castle, and
offered him the slice of bread and meat which he so

haughtily rejected, Hubert who had been accustom-
ed only to hear of the great, with descriptions of
their comforts, their luxuries, and their affluent
ease, and who had seen so much of the poverty,
the hardships, and the ill-rewarded labours of the
poor, whom it had been his constant question,
“why the better provided for by the hand of chance
did not more amply relieve?” conceiving that there
could be only the one motive of Edward's being una-
ble to eat himself what he offered to him, and that
any animal had been equally welcome to the gift,
his very wants gave him pride to refuse the offer, of
which he mistook the nature. Still did the next
instant explain that his heart was tender, although
proud; for he scrupled not to submit to the most
humble supplication to obtain what he had refused
for himself for the relief of a poor animal, whom
he saw hungry like himself, and like himself the
sport of superior strength and well-faring.
But no sooner did Hubert discover his error, than
mingled repentance and gratitude swelled his heart.
Edward, unlike the sons of fastidious grandeur,
who are irreconcileable on a first offence, and ever
hate the object from which it sprung, easily per-
ceived that the young Hubert possessed a degree of
character superior to the station he had been born
in ; and justly conceiving him one of those person-
ages for whom it is peculiarly the duty of the more
fortunate in life to feel consideration, took frequent
opportunities of conferring on him such little services
and attentions as proved to Hubert equal sources of
of comfort and gratification to his feelings.

Actions of this nature, when they spring from
hearts like that of Edward, seldom go unrewarded ;
the sensation of gratitude is the noblest feeling
which the human mind can experience; and the
justice of Providence has not deprived the poor of
the power of tasting and exercising it, any more
than the rich—a knowledge which ought greatly to
induce us to the performance of benevolent actions;
since, in the eventful scale of life, nothing is more
likely than that those who rise to-day may sink to-
morrow, and rejoice to meet him as a friend whom
they have once thought it a condescension to ac-
knowledgs as a dependant.
Every day Hubert became more and more attach-
ed to Edward, and he thought himself the happiest
of human beings when, through the intercession of
Edward, he was admitted a member of the new
troops then raising at the castle.
When Edward was sent to take the command of
the newly-erected tower in the village, he first ac-
quainted Hubert with his love for Rosalind, and
confided in his already-tried friendship to visit the
castle (a privilege which was not interdicted to him,
although Edward enjoyed not the same liberty),
and to bring him intelligence of what was passing
in it.
At length, when Hubert brought him the dread-
ful information, that the baron had destined his
daughter to become the wife of the hated lord Rufus
in the course of four more short days, and Edward
could no longer endure absence from her sight,

Hubert repaired in the evening to the castle, under
pretence of sleeping there; and in the night he
admitted Edward, as they had previously agreed
that he should do, by an outlet from the ramparts,
which led him into the vaults connected with the
chapel.
From hence they had planned, that Hubert
should proceed to the chamberof Gertrude, and re-
quire of her to give Rosalind information of Ed-
ward's wish to see her in the chapel; but that plan,
our readers will recollect, was anticipated by Ed-
ward finding Rosalind already in the chapel when
he entered it, whither she had come to pray by the
side of her deceased mother's tomb.
The events which followed this interview down
to the time of Edward's hasty departure with his,
company for Flanders, have been already fully de-
tailed.
At this period, the heart of Hubert experienced
as great a pang as that of the forlorn Rosalind. Not
even the opportunity of saying farewell to his bene-
factor Edward was given him: anxiously, most
anxiously did he wish that he had been one of the
number under his command ; but the chance had
not been his, and he lamented it more severely than
any misfortune which had yet befallen him in life.
Earnestly did he desire that a second body of troops
might be sent to reinforce those already gone; were
he not of the chosen number, should such an event
take place, he resolved to solicit for leave to become
one of them; and in this hope he grew tolerably
composed.

so the
Thus had passed on seven months, when the ba-
ron de Mowbray addressed Hubert, upon his post,
as sentinel at the tower in the village, offering him
five hundred pieces of gold for removing the child
of Rosalind from Cumberland. Hubert could
scarcely forbear falling on his knees before the ba-
ron, and returning thanks to Heaven that he had
selected him as the instrument of his villanous in-
tention.
“ Edward will see England no more: he is, by
my design, detained in Fland. 13," said the baron.
Then,” whispered the soul of Hubert,
five hundred pieces you offer shall be devoted to his
release.”
As eagerly did Hubert pant for the moment at
which he should receive, from the hand of the ba-
ron, the sum which would enable him to set out in
quest of the victim of treachery, as the stag, which
escapes from the pursuit of the hunters, pants for
the cooling stream to allay its thirst. At length
the hour came, and the five hundred pieces which
lord William had promised were made six hundred,
and safely deposited in the pocket of Hubert.
Cautiously had he avoided asking a single ques-
tion relative to Edward, lest it should have led the
baron to suspect that he felt interested in his fate;
thus the only clue which he possessed for tracing
him out was tie common report which had been
circulated throughout the country, on the departure
of the troops, that they were destined for Ostend.
Having disguised himself in the tatterсd jacket of a

sailor, and assumed the unnecessary support of a
wooden leg, he tied a bandage over his left eye, and
having, in other respects, disfigured his person as
much as he was able, he proceeded to a seaport
town, where he took his passage on board a ship
bound for Ostend.
Rich as he was at the present time, he took es-
pecial care to make his expences correspond with
his appearance, that he might not, by any ill-judg-
ed display of his ability to procure for himself accom-
modations superior to what his beggarly outside
denoted him possessed of, drawn down upon him-
self suspicion: his money he had sewn within the
lining of a waistcoat, which he had chosen for its
strength, not its appearance or comfort, and which
he judged would prove a faithful safeguard to the
valuable trust committcd to its care.
A few days landed him at Ostend. Having taken
up his abode at a mean house in the town, and sig-
nified to its landlord that he was a poor distressed
man, who had once been a sailor, and had now
been shipwrecked upon the coast of Flanders, from
a vessel of which all the crew had perished except
himself, he expressed a wish of finding some em-
ployment; he was indifferent, he said, of what
nature, provided he was capable of performing it,
and that it would keep him from want, alleging that
all his relations in England were dead, and that
every country was now alike to him; to which ac-
count he added his inability of paying his passage
to the opposite shore.


## p. 543 (#577) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER. 543
The landlord of the house was a humane man,
and promised his assistance in procuring him some
work, if any could be had ; but he remarked, that
few were willing to engage a servant, whose dis-
abled limbs must render him less useful than ano-
ther man. To which Hubert replied, that he was
well aware of this objection, and must therefore be
satisfied with less wages.
Hubert felt fearful of visiting the English camp,
lest, even disguised as he was, some individual in
it should recognize him. Earnestly he wished for
the means of making some inquiry relative to Ed-
ward amongst the English soldiery, but his appre-
hensions of a discovery forbade him to make the
attempt.
Walking abroad one day with the landlord of his
little inn, the prison, in which he little suspected
the object of his pursuit to be a captive, caught his
attention, and he inquired what it was. The land-
lord explained to him, that it was a prison where
offenders of a superior order were kept, and where
no comfort but that of liberty was denied to them.
As they walked on, they approached nearer to its
walls, and the sound of music struck the ears of
Hubert.
“They are very merry methinks,” said Hubert,
“for the inhabitants of a prison.”
“The prisoners have nothing to do with the
mirth you hear,” replied the landlord; “ this is
the anniversary of the governor's wedding-day, and
it is celebrated with great festivity. But the rejoic-

ings of to-day are far inferior to those which took
place on the day on which the governor was mar-
ried ; they were splendid indeed : but it is no won-
der, when we reflect on the great income his place
is said to bring him in. No doubt but there are
many deeds transacted within a place like this, that
are kept secret at a high price."
“ It is a pity,” said Hubert, “ that any edifice
should exist which is capable of concealing the
crimes of those who live at `large unsuspected,
whilst the unhappy victims of their iniquity sigh
out their days in solitude, unheeded and un-
consoled.”
“ It is a necessary evil,” returned the landlord,
" that there sould be such places; and as no good
institutions exist without improper.encroachments
being made upon the power annexed to them, we
must be content, that if a little evil, by such means,
creeps into society, much good is produced to it
from the same causes. But,” continued he, “ what
I was going to remark to you was an extraordinary
circumstance which took place at this same gover-
nor's wedding. Amongst the guests invited were
the officers of the English camp; when the even-
ing's entertainment was concluded, all the coinpany
left the house much about the same time, and,
strange to relate, one of the English officers has
never been heard of since.”
“ Indeed !” said Hubert; “what was his name?"
" I never heard him called by any name,” re-
turned the host.

545
Hubert stopped, lost in thought.
Ay, it is a strange story—is it not ?" went on
his informer, not at all suspicious that Hubert was
more moved than any one might have been by the
recital he was making to him. “ It is supposed
that some villains robbed him on his way to the
camp, and then murdered him, to prevent his pre-
ferring an information against them.
Of a far different tenor was the opinion which
Hubert formed of this mysterious occurrence.
“ Edward is, by my design, detained in Flanders,”
lord William de Mowbray had said; and what
place could appear more likely to be the scene of
this treacherous confession than a building of the
nature of which the host had just described the
prison they were looking at to be ? But IIubert
closely shut up his ideas within his own breast, and
endeavoured to continue his conversation with his
companion, without discovering to him the emo-
tions which agitated his mind.
As they returned towards the town, Hubert,
scarcely conscious of advancing the question, in-
quired the name of the governor of the prison they
had just seen ? His host replied that it was Garcias
Xavia.
“Xavia !” repeated Hubert ; " it is a Spanish
name, and an unusual one. I think I have heard
that there was a pioneer in the English troops that
came over here last year of that name ; but, al-
though I cannot recollect his Christian name, I am
inclined to believe it was not Garcias.”

“No, no,” answered Hubert's companion, “it
was Sanchez.
“You know him then,” said Hubert.
“I am not acquainted with him,” rejoined the
host; “ I have only heard of him ; he is the go-
vernor's brother.”
“The retreat of my loved master is then dis-
covered l’’ exclaimed Hubert to himself. If San-
chez Xavia is the governor's brother, and an En-
glish officer disappeared on the evening of his visit-
ing there, no longer doubt remains to me of his
fate.” The warm blood of joy poured into his
heart, and he breathed a silent prayer of thanks-
giving to Heaven.
“Did you know him 2" asked the host, who
suspected nothing from Hubert's question.
“I have seen him, as you may have done,” re-
joined Hubert, “but it is some time since.” He
then gave a change to the conversation, wishing
that the subject should be discussed as little as pos-
sible, lest he should let fall any expression which
might draw upon him the eye of suspicion.
Hubert's night was sleepless; no sooner had he
reclined his head on his humble pillow, than a thou-
sand various plans for gaining access to the prison
passed through his brain. He reviewed each sepa-
rately, and some obstacle presented itself to the
execution of them all; he, however, felt an inde-
scribable satisfaction in believing himself possessed
of the secret of Edward's concealment, and willing-
ly resolved not to let his impatience to inform him

547
that lie was acquainted with it lead him into' any
rashness which might for ever blast the hopes he
now entertained of one day restoring him to liber-
ty, and to his beloved Rosalind.
The age of miracles, even at that distant period,
was past—at least of those open interpositions of
Providence which were once permitted to the eye of
man; but those which are allowed to reach the
mind of observation will never cease while the jus-
tice of Providence continues to exist. Although
the finger which disposes the events of life be con-
cealed from our view, many are the instances which
feelingly convey to our senses the immediate inter-
position of a merciful Power, which, beholding
with pity the sufferings of the innocent, accommo-
dates what appear to the unthinking the common
accidents of life, to their eventual happiness and
triumph over their oppressors.
To such a cause did Hubert attribute the accia
dent which, in a short space of time, made him
an inhabitant of the prison whose walls enclosed
Edward.
Compelled to catch at the first employment
which offered itself to his acceptance, as one of the
most requisite parts which he had to act in sustain-
ing his present character, he hired himself to an
old woman who sold wood about the streets. On
the third day of his serving in his new capacity,
his mistress took her road out of the town, and
stopped at the gate of the prison. “ The governor,"
she said, “is my best customer; I come here re-

548 MYSTERIO US FREE BOOTER.
gularly twice a-week.” A man came to the gate,
who received the stinted quantity of wood, placed
it in the prison-yard, and having done this, again
closed the gate.
Having disposed of her wood, the old woman
returned home for a fresh load, and Hubert, with
a heavy heart, followed her, disappointed that he
had not even been admitted within the outer wall
of the prison.
Thus passed on a second, a third, and even a
fourth week; Hubert still constrained to lead about
the blind horse, which dragged the sledge that con-
tained his employer's logs.
One day about this time, when they stopped as
usual at the gate of the prison, a ſat dame, who
was a kind of superintendant of the household eco-
nomies of the place, came out to the dealer in
wood, and addressed her, with an inquiry whether
she could inform her of any poor wretch who was
willing and hard-working, and wanted a place, for
that the man who had been accustomed to perform
all the menial offices in the prison had died the day
before, and they were in want of some one to fill
his station ?
“I pray you, good mistress, engage me,” said
Hubert; “I shall be very thankful indeed for the
situation.” -
“I doubt you are not strong enough for it,” re-
turned the fat dame, eyeing him as she spoke from
top to toe. “You are lame, I see, and can't be very
quick in your movements on that account”.

549
“ But my willingness to oblige my employers
may make amends for that deficiency,” replied Hu-
bert; “ and I am strong, very strong, I assure
you.”
“So, you ungrateful fellow,” cried Hubert's
mistress, then you would leave me, that took
you when you had not a bit of bread to put into
your mouth ?"
“ It is not ingratitude that prompts me to make
the change,” returned Hubert, " but it is because
I should prefer the work I should have here, within
the house, to being continually obliged to walk
about the streets.”
As the dealer in wood contended for Hubert's
services, the housekeeper of the prison directly
thought thein worth having, which she probably
would not have done had his present mistress seem-
ed willing to part from him; and accordingly said
" Well I have a good mind to try you :” and she
then offered him a very small sum as wages, for
which she demanded of him the performance of as
many different concerns as would, upon a moderate
calculation, have afforded employment for three
others besides himself. However, as the terms
were indifferent to Hubert upon which he entered
the prison, so he did but get within its walls, he
accepted the proffered conditions.
His mistress paid him a parting compliment, in
which she wished him ill-luck for quitting her ser-
vice ; and his new one gave him encouragement by
saying that if he was obliging to her, she would be

his friend with his master; and with this prornise
he was ushered into the kitchen of the prison.
His labour was full as much as he expected it
would be he was the servant of almost every ser-
vant in the prison; but still he was content, for he
believed himself near his benefactor, Edward.
Hubert had been about four months an inhabitant
of the prison, when he was conducted to the vault
set apart for the governor's family, and commanded
to dig a grave, which he was informed was for the
governor's brother, Sanchez. It was with no little
pleasure that he heard the account of his death, and
he performed his task with great good will. The
night had been the season at which he had been set
about this employment; and as he returned from
the performance of his task, with the keys of the
vault hanging upon his arm, his mattock and spade
supported on his shoulder with one hand, and his
lamp held in the other, he was surprised at hearing
the sound of the governor's voice, and seeing the
keepers running about in a hasty manner, that de-
noted some matter of importance to have taken
place.
He durst not stop to ask any questions in the
presence of the governor, but of the first keeper
who followed him into the kitchen he inquired the
cause of the commotion he had just seen and heard.
Oh,” replied the man, " there has been the devil
to pay: the governor's daughter-in-law has been
very near eloping to-night with a lover, whom nei-
ther her mother nor the governor approves ; and, as

misfortunes never come single, our English captive
was as near making his escape at the same time.”
Well, they are not like me,” cried Hubert ;
“ I don't want to get away-I never was so well off
in my life as I am here."
One of my comrades is turned out,” went on
the keeper, who was discovered to have let in the
lady Belise's lover, and who meant to have favoured
her elopement.”
“ Is her lover an Englishman ?” asked Hubert.
“ No, a French officer,” answered the keeper :
“ the Englishman is an officer too.”
What, is he a grandee, a lord, or a duke, or
any thing of that kind ?” inquired Hubert.
“ I don't know what he is,” returned the man ;
“ titles are all sunk here: we seldom know our
captives by name; I never heard him called any
thing but the English officer.”
Hubert was now entirely convinced—“ Have you
had him long ?” Huhert was beginning to say, when
the keeper was called away, and no farther oppor-
tunity given him of adding to the number of his in-
quiries.
Almost all the keepers of the prison were men
who had for a long time been the servants of the
governor; and whose fidelity to their master had
been tried. He who had just parted from Hubert
was the only talkative man with whom he had yet
met; he was a young Frenchman, who had but
lately become a servant in the prison, and who, with
the address to appear discreet before the governor

and the old servants of the place, still loved to hear
himself talk when he was with any one who would
listen to him. Hubert found him to be the only
one in the family from whom he was likely to gain
any intelligence of what was passing within the
walls, and therefore did all in his power to attach
the young man to him. Pierre, for such was his
name, would probably have scorned an intimacy
with a man in Hubert's inferior situation, had he
been able to have found any other person about the
place who would have indulged him in the use of
his tongue; but not being able to do that, he pre-
ferred society which he considered beneath him,
rather than to desist from his favourite amusement
of tattling.
Amidst Hubert's numerous employments, it was
a part of his business to go to the outer gate of the
prison, and receive from those who brought them
the bread, the fruit, the milk, and, in short, every
article consumed within the prison ; after bringing
them in, he was appointed to carry them into the
hall, and here the keepers received from him, in
different baskets, the allotted portions for the pri-
soners under their care.
Hubert remarked that Pierre brought a larger
basket than any of the other keepers, and received
into it a double share of fruit and bread ; Pierre
was also the last of the keepers who received from
Hubert the portion for his captives; and this gave
Hubert an opportunity of inquiring of him, why he


## p. 553 (#587) ############################################

had always a double quantity put into one of his
baskets 2
“Why,” replied Pierre, “ever since that night
when our young lady had like to have run away,
and the English captive to have made his escape,
the unfortunate lover and the Englishman have both
been confined in one cell, so the double portion is
for them.”
Having thus gained the knowledge of which was
the basket of provisions conveyed to Edward, Hu-
bert began to consider it no difficult matter to give
him information that he had a friend at hand. After
many debates with his own mind, he resolved on
engraving those words of hope, which have been
already laid before our readers, on some chesnuts,
which he intended to take the first opportunity of
putting into the basket that daily received the double
portion of provisions. To his great delight he
found his plan by no means a difficult one to exe-
cute; he artfully contrived to give Pierre a subject
to discuss, and, while he was engaged in talking,
Hubert put his prepared chesnuts at the bottom of
the basket, and covering them over with apples
and bread, he gave the basket into the hand of
Pierre without feeling the least alarm that he should
examine it—he was at all times too idle to do more
than he was ordered.
From this time the days passed on with Hubert
unmarked by any event, till madame Xavia paid
the debt of life, and he was again sent into the bury-
ing-ground to open the family vault for the recep-

tion of her body; his friend Pierre assisted him in
carrying his tools to the spot, and in the way
thither informed him, that the vault was immedi-
ately beneath the prison where the lady Belise's
lover and the young Englishman were confined.
Possessed of this knowledge, Hubert resolved to
use every moment of the night which he could spare
from the labour he was employed on, in endeavour-
ing to make himself heard by Edward, in his prison
above him : to this purpose he repeatedly called on
him by name, but as he received no answer to his
calls, he concluded that the stone which parted
them was impenetrable to his voice, and therefore
began to seek some other method of making himself
hcard. The roof of the burying-place was within
reach of his mattock, and he struck various parts
with the iron end of it, hoping that some of the
knocks would reach the ear of Edward; but his en-
deavours proved fruitless, and he was compelled to
complete his task, and leave the spot, where he
felt a pleasure in lingering on account of its proxi-
mity to Edward.
On returning to the kitchen, he was surprised to
find Pierre, who had promised to sit up for him till
he came back from the vault, was not there.
During the time that Hubert had been employed
in opening the vault, the governor and Belise had
repaired, at midnight, to the chapel, to say a
requiem for the rest of madame Xavia's soul ; and on
the governor's return to his chamber, he found his
money-box broke open and robbed; nor was this

ail--his master-key to the various locks in the
building, which was usually hung at the head of
bis bed, was also gone. An immediatc search was
made after the thief-Pierre alone was missing,
and, as he did not return in the course of the suc-
ceeding day, no doubt was entertained of his being
the purloiner of the governor's gold.
A reward was offered by the governor for his ap-
prehension ; but it proved ineffectual, as Pierre was
never heard of after.
Pierre's flight was at first a circumstanceon which
Hubert by no means reflected with pleasure ; he
had been the only one in the prison whom he had
found ready in his communications, and he feared
that his absense would deprive him of gaining any
intelligence relative to Edward. While Hubert
was wondering whether the new keeper would prove
a man from whom he might reap equal advantage
as he had done from the familiar disposition of
Pierre, he was surprised with the information that
he was himself promoted to the station.
Hubert received the intelligence with warm but
concealed joy: he now believed that he should en-
joy the privilege of waiting upon Edward, and thus
easily gain an opportunity of conversing with him ;
but in this hope he was disappointed : the keeper
who had heretofore watched over the prison of Ed-
ward in the evening was appointed to attend upon
it entirely ; and Hubert was deputed to serve two
solitary captives, whose apartments were at one

which led to the prison of the two friends.
CHAPTER XII.
-Oh! 'tis excellent
To have a giant's strength ; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
On the eleventh day after the interment of the go-
vernor's wife, a stranger arrived at the prison about
the hour of noon, who was for some time shut up
with the governor in his private apartment, and
then departed.
In the evening, the governor, which was by no
means usual with him, went out himself, saying
that he was going to meet some friends, who he ex-
pected would arrive that night at Ostend.
Each keeper had a small apartment for his own
private use in some part of the gallery which led to
the apartments occupied by the prisoners immedi-
ately under his care; that which was now become
the property of Hubert was directly opposite to that
of one of his comrades named Gourtray. While
Hubert had been only in a menial capacity in the
prison, this man had noticed him but very little ;
now he was raised to an equality with himself, their
acquaintance grew fast, and they usually passed
their leisure hours in each other's apartment. Hu-
bert found Gourtray to be, what he, perhaps un-

charitably, but probably very justly, supposed every
one who filled an office like his, a rogue in his heart
—who wanted but opportunity, like Pierre, to make
himself rich, at whose ever expence he might be-
come so.
Upon this opinion of Gourtray’s disposition, the
watchful Hubert had formed a plan by which he
hoped eventually to procure the enlargement of Ed-
ward ; and judging the present evening of the go-
vernor's absence to be a good opportunity for open-
ing to Gourtray a conversation of the nature he
wished to have with him, he invited him into his
little apartment, saying—" Walk in, comrade;
you and I have not had a glass together since I
have held my office, so let it be this evening ; I
have a flask of choice brandy, which I will uncork
for the purpose.
Gourtray readily accepted the invitation, and they
seated themselves over Hubert's fire. With his
second draught, Hubert said—" Come, let us
drink to the health of the governor; not that his
health is any more to you or me than that of any
other man, except as being our employer, and it is
my maxim always to wish best to those I get the
most by.”
“ Thou resemblest me exactly,” replied Gour-
tray : “ if any one else would offer me a better live-
lihood than his wages afford me, I would kick him
off in a minute, I promise thee.”
This was exactly the sentiment which Hubert
wished to hear proceed from the lips of his compa-

our
nion, and he said “To my thinking now, I should
suppose,
that
you,
who are a native of this country,
and have not, like myself, the misfortunes of a
maimed leg and useless eye; might easily procure
for yourself some more lucrative employraent than
that of being a keeper in a prison.”
Why as to that,” returned Gourtray,
wages, you must allow, are well enough ; they are
no doubt made better than they would be, in order
to insure our fidelity to our master; and upon the
whole, the place would not be despicable, if our
prisoners were not so stripped by the cursed avarice
of the governor, that they have nothing left to fee
us for little services that we might render them, if
they could pay us for them.”
“I warrant me though,” replied Hubert,
if
you or I durst shew any of them the way to li-
berty, he'd manage to find us a reward worth the
trying for.”
“I can't think that any one confined here has a
reward in his power,” answered Gourtray; " the
governor pilfers them all as they come in-No, no,
they can have nothing left."
“ I would not wager my life on that,” returned
Hubert. “Misfortune makes men crafty, and there
are ways and means of cheating the keenest-eyed.
I dare be bound to say, that some of the captives
here have been thus cunning, and have either mo-
ney or valuables about them yet : but perhaps, if
you knew they had, you would not like such means
of earning an independent sum ?”

By saint Francis,” cried Gourtray, " I'd about
it this instant, if I thought there was one who could
make it worth my while. What, man, do'st think
I would not ? All we keepers of prisons have the
repute of being thieves and rascals, and we may as
well have it for something as nothing, according to
iny opinion.”
· Ay, it is but true,” replied Hubert, with a
smile, too true indeed ;” and again he put the
Alask to his comrade, who took a hearty draught,
and then spoke thus-
“Now who, to your thinking, is there amongst
all our captires that is most likely to have a golden
lining to his pocket ?"
Why, I have been so little amongst them till
within these few days,” answered Hubert, " that I
can hardly be so good a judge as yourself. Let me
see-you have an Englishman under your care,
have you not ?”
Ay, here hard by,” returned Gourtray:
“know you any thing of him ?”
“How should I ?" replied Hubert; “ you know
I have not been into his cell.”
“ Then how came you to mention him ?” asked
Gourtray.
" Why,” replied Hubert, “I have a pretty good
knowledge of the English ; they are a crafty people,
apt at stratagem, and I should not wonder, who-
ever he is, but he has managed to secrete the price
of a rescue somewhere about him."
“ Ay!” cried Gourtray, evidently animated by
the idea.
i

Why I think it very probable indeed,” went
on Hubert ; " and if you like to agree to give me
a small share out of what he might in such case
bestow on you, I'll go with you into his cell, and
sound him for you: I understand his language better
than you do, and I am also somewhat more ac-
quainted with the manners of the English than you
are."
Some time previous to the evening on which this
conversation took place, Hubert had taken one
hundred pieces of gold from his waistcoat, and put
them into a purse, which he carried constantly
about him, and which it was his intention, if he
could prevail on Gourtray to carry him with him
into Edward's prison, on the business of which he
had just given him the idea, to slip into Edward's
hand, judging that he could not fail to understand
their being intended for him to bestow on Gourtray
as the price of his liberty.
Gourtray continued silent for some moments after
the last proposition on the part of Hubert. He then
said—“ I approve thy counsel ; it is good, and
worthy to be tried : if the attempt fails of procuring
us any advantage, we can lose nothing by it, which
renders it doubly estimable—but this is not the pro-
per hour for the attempt. If the governor does not
return home before midnight, I will come and call
upon you to go with me to the Englishman's pri-
son ; if he does return, we must wait for the arrival
of some more favourable season;" and with these
Fords he rose from his seat, and staggered out of

Hubert's apartment, carrying with 'him the flask,
which contained but a small portion of the brandy
that had lately filled it, and of which he had drunk
by much the better half.
Hubert continued over his fire, anticipating the
joyful moment at which Gourtray would return to
conduct him to the cell of his respected master.
Meanwhile the Fleming, who actually possessed
all that cunning which Hubert, in order to favour
his purpose, had attempted to make him believe
the innate principle of his English prisoner, judging
it entirely unnecessary to make Hubert a sharer of
the profit that was to be reaped from the plan which
he had just proposed to him, proceeded alone, as
our readers have already been informed, to the cell
of Edward and his friend, where we need not repeat
the ill success that attended his attempt.
Gourtray, we must suppose, had never known
that Adolphus was the lover of the lady Belise, or
it appears unlikely that he should have refused to
carry her the ring; or we must suppose, that if the
circumstance had been known to him, the fumes of
intoxication had driven it from his brain. Whether
Gourtray, after his ill success in the prison of Ed-
ward, made a similar offer to any other of the cap-
tives, is a circumstance of no consequence to this
narrative; we have, in this instance, only to speak
of what refers to Hubert.
Each of the keepers of the prison took his turn,
by night, in attending in the hall, and letting in
such of the family as had, during the evening, been

absent from the building; and when every one had
entered, he was allowed to retire to rest.
On the present evening, this office fell upon Cour.
tray, and what hour he went to his post was not
known, as no one was absent from the prison but
the
governor, and none but such as immediately
entered the prison from the courtyard had occasion
to pass near the hall. Hubert did not retire to his
bed at the usual hour, but continued sitting in his
room, expecting the return of Gourtray. Tle had
beard the clock strike twelve some time, and as
Gourtray did not return, he opened the door of his
room to listen whether he was in his chamber on the
opposite side of the gallery: this he had scarcely
done, cre he recollected that it was Gourtray's turn
to keep watch in the hall. He found that he was
not in his chamber, and therefore concluding the
governor not to be returned, he was on the point
of shutting his own door again, when he heard the
bell from the gate sounding in the hall.
The distance of his room from the hall was con-
siderable, but the bell was powerful, and the echoes
natural to the vaulted roofs of the building carried
the sound powerfully through the air.-" That
bell,” conjectured Hubert, “ denotes the governor's
return : I shall probably then not see Gourtray
again to night.”
He entered his chamber, but did not shut his
door, as he felt a wish to speak to him when he
came to bed, and learn whether his resolution to
make an offer of enlargement to the English officer
still continued unshaken.

MISTERIOL'S FREE BOOTSR.
563
In a few ininutes the bell from the gate sounded
louder than before; a short silence again ensued,
and again the bell was rung with redoubled vio-
lence. Hubert felt at a loss to conclude from what
cause Gourtray had not given adinittance to the
claimant for it; and judging that if it was the go-
vernor, it became him, as he had heard it thrice
repeated, to attend to the summons, he took up
his lamp, and went down into the hall.
He saw not Gourtray in his way to the gate,
which, as he approached, the bell was rung a fourtii
time. Hubert unlocked the heavy gate, and on
drawing it back upon its hinges, the governor, and
three other men with him, entered.
" What is the reason,” exclaimed the governor,
" that I have been thus long detained at the gate ?
you shall repent this negligence.”
Hubert directly replied—“ Sir, the watch of to-
night is not mine : 1, by accident, heard the bell
sounded repeatedly, and on this account I came
down from my chamber to learn the cause.”
“ Oh, I perceive,” returned the governor, you
are not Gourtray—it is his watch. Where is he?"
Hubert was obliged to reply that he did not
know.
“ Go, call up some of the servants,” said the
governor; “ these friends of mine will sleep here to-
night, and they have not yet supped. Do your
best to assist in spreading the table immediately.”
At the command of the governor, Hubert pre-
ceded him and his friends to one of the liand somost

apartments in the house : at the foot of a flight of
steps, which led to it from the hall, lay Gourtray,
locked in an insensible sleep.—“How now, rascal l’’
exclaimed the governor; but he did not awake—
the weight of the brandy he had drank sat heavy on
him, and he was incapable of hearing or under-
standing.
At this time, some others of the keepers who
had been roused by the repeated ringing of the bell,
entered the hall ; and to these the governor gave in
charge to convey Gourtray to the dungeon, where
he commanded that he should remain a prisoner
till he judged proper to hear his defence of his con-
duct from his own lips—an order which those to
whom it was delivered durst not venture to disobey.
As the governor entered the apartment into which
he conducted his guests, the light of Hubert's lamp
upon his countenance, and Hubert perceived that he
appeared much agitated, although evident marks of
savage triumph were visible amidst the various pas-
sions that seemed to fill his breast. The guests
Hubert had only opportunity to observe, were in
the English dress: one of them was the person who
had been closeted with the governor in the morning.
According to the directions he had received, Hu-
bert called up some of the servants, whose business
it was particularly to attend to the governor's fa-
mily; and their presence rendered it unnecessary
for him to do more towards the preparations for the
entertainment of the guests, than to carry in some
wood, and to make a fire of it upon the hearth.

MYSTERIOUS FIERBOOTER.
565
At the first sight of the strangers, Hubert con-
cluded that one of them, at least, was a new vic-
tim doomed to the solitude of imprisonment within
the dreary walls he had just entered. He had ob-
served that one of the three was habited more costly
than the other two, and him he considered the un-
fortunate man, for no other reason except that per-
secution usually appears to exert itself with the
greatest energy against those who stand in a situa-
tion the most attractive to envy.
As he went into the room with the logs of wood
on his shoulder, the governor whispered to him
to demand the keys. of those cells which Gour-
tray had been accustomed to attend, and to visit
them in the morning with the first meals of the day
himself. This command was a cordial to the heart
of Hubert, and he promised with true fervour to
obey it.
As he was again quitting the room, the best
dressed of the three strangers crossed upon him by.
accident, in such a situation that he could not help
catching a full view of his countenance. He was
young and handsome, and Hubert felt confident
that his features were familiar to his sight. Again
Hubert turned his eye upon him, as he moved out
of the room, and became still more certain that
the contour of his face was by no means that of a
person whom he had never seen before ; and what
was still more extraordinary, he connected unplea-
sant ideas with the recollection, although he could
not recollect where he had seen him before. But
4 D

he had not proceeded many steps away from the
apartment, when memory came to his aid, and,
beyond all possibility of error, he remembered that
the man whom he had just seen a guest of the go-
vernor Garcias was Alwin, the page of lord Rufus
de Madginecourt, grown to the stature of manhood.
This conviction struck agony to the heart of Hu-
bert. Emissaries from the man who passionately
desired to possess the lovely and constant Rosalind,
and amongst these emissaries the youth who in a
particular manner enjoyed the smiles of his favour,
must portend evil to the unhappy Edward.
At first, his fears half distracted him : he knew
not whither to fly, what to do, or how to prepare
himself against any attack which might be made
upon Edward's life. Some minutes of deliberation,
however, seemed to promise him, that if his exist-
ence was in danger from their arrival, it was at
least safe for that night, as the governor would not
else have commanded him to visit the prison where
he was confined in the morning. Still he consi-
dered that this might be only a subterfuge to baffle
suspicion, if it were awakened in any mind, and he
resolved not to go to bed. He returned to his
chamber, from which he frequently wandered out
upon the gallery, and endeavoured, by action, to
calm his perturbed spirits. In the course of a couple
of hours, he heard the servants of the household
retiring again to rest; he made an excuse of fetch-
ing some water, which he pretended was for one of
the prisoners, and used the opportunity to inquire

567
if the governor and his guests were gone to
bed ?
He was told that they were not; that the go-
vernor had said he had some business to transact
with the strangers which would not admit of delay,
and had directed all the servants to return to their
chambers.
" Oh God !” exclaimed Hubert, mentally, “ is
it then their intent this very night to” he
durst not conclude his sentence even to himself.
Wretched beyond the power of any intelligence to
make him more so, or of any circumstance to add
to the torture of his mind, he resolved to go down,
and, if possible, to overhear some part of their
conversation.
Every step of the building he was well acquainted
with ; thus he was not under the necessity of carry-
ing a light with him, to expose himself to any one
whom accident might lead the same way, unlikely
as it was that any person besides himself should, at
that hour, be moving about.
His resolution was no sooner fixed than put
into execution. As he approached the apartment
in which were the governor and his guests, he
at some distance, heard their voices, apparently in
strong debate.
On arriving at the foot of the steps which led to
the door of the apartment, he had not occasion to
ascend them for the purpose of being an auditor of
their discourse ; either secure that they were not
attended to by any ear, or heated into loudness by

the interest of the subject they were discussing,
their words were easily distinguishable.
The first sentence which Hubert heard appeared
to be spoken by Alwin." Your captive,” he said,
“may die to-morrow, and where would then be the
annuity on which you set so high a value ? You
could not long impose on the lord baron de Mow-
bray by feigning him still alive; it is impossible he
should be thus deceived. Edward may die to-mor-
row, and"
“ 'Tis true,” replied the governor ;
" but he is
just as likely to live for many years to come.”
“ And where is the difference,” rejoined Alwin,
“ if your reward in either case be made equal ?”
Many more arguments of the same nature follow-
ed between the governor and Alwin ; at length the
former said" Well, let the two thousand pieces
of gold be given into my hands, and I will
consent."
Hubert heard a box unlocked, and he supposed
the gold was contained in it, for the governor then
said," I am satisfied."
" Well then,” demanded Alwin, “ when will
you give us the opportunity we require ?”
To-night I dare not do it,” returned the go-
vernor : “ the morning almost dawns, and some
of my people, I doubt not, are already risen-tuis
must be an action of secrecy. To-morrow, at the
hour of midnight, I will conduct you to his cell.”
" If we must submit to this delay, we must,” re-
joined Alwin ; but as we are so decidedly detert

mined, together that his death is certain, let me
entreat you to-night to write the letter I requested
of you to the baron de Mowbray, that we may to-
morrow dispatch a messenger with it to England,
as in the speed you use in conveying intelligence of
his ceasing to exist to lord William de Mowbray,
you most essentially serve him who sends you,
through me, the sum contained in that casket.”
“ Since we are agreed,” returned the governor,
“ I feel no hesitation in writing the letter. Fill
your goblets, and whilst you are emptying them
again, I will pen the epistle you desire."
Some minutes of silence ensued : the governor
then said “ Please to read what I have written,
and tell me if it meets your approbation.”
Alwin read thus :-
“ Garcias Xavia greets the lord baron de
Mowbray.—The prisoner named Edward, whom it
is now very nearly four years since the lord baron en-
trusted to his protection, through the means of his
deceased brother Sanchez, breathed his last on the
evening preceding that of which this epistle bears
the date : a violent fever carried him hastily to the
grave. Garcias Xavia trusts that the noble lord
baron de Mowbray will acknowledge him to have
been faithful to the trust reposed in him, and will
deign to accept his thanks for the liberality with
which he has rewarded the services he is proud of

having had it in his power to render to so illustrious
a noble.
" Ostend, 7th March, 1587."
“ It corresponds exactly with my wishes,” said
Alwin, " and to-morrow I will despatch one of
these, my friends, as a messenger with it to Eng-
land. Another day then we must remain your
guests, and to-morrow night at twelve-"
“ I will myself conduct you to his cell,” said the
governor.
“ And the instant our purpose in coming hither
is effected, you must lead us beyond the walls of
this edifice,” said Alwin.
" It shall be done,” replied the governor.
Alwin now requested the governor to conduct
them to their respective chambers; and on hearing
this, Hubert directly fled from the foot of the steps
to the gallery where he had left his lamp.
If the state of mind in which Hubert passed the
remainder of the night cannot be conceived by the
reader, the author's attempt to describe it must be
ineffectual. At length the morning arrived, and
the refulgent rays of the sun once more enlightened
the earth.
As Hubert was on the point of repairing to the
cell of Edward with his breakfast, and that of his
fellow-prisoner Adolphus, one of the keepers came
to him, and said, he was sent by the governor to

571
go with him into the prison of the English officer,
and bring away from it his fellow-captive, the young
Adolphus.—" The governor,” he said, “ had ex-
pressed himself to relent having so long condemned
him to a dungeon, when his crime had been only
that of love, and had resolved to give him a better
apartment, to which he and Hubert were to con-
duct him."
Hubert could not doubt that Adolphus was to be
removed from the cell of Edward, in order that he
might not be a witness of his intended murder.
“ 'Tis well,” he said, in reply to the information
delivered by the other keeper, and led the way to
the cell. Hubert perceived that Edward recognized
him; but the present was not a moment to acknow-
ledge that he did so, and he departed with Adol-
phus in silence.
The brain of Hubert had been racked during the
night with a thousand plans for the preservation of
his benefactor's life ; and that which seemed to pro-
mise the greatest hope of success was, if possible,
to find the means of persuading the avaricious go-
vernor, that if he suffered the life of Edward to be
taken away by the emissaries of lord Rufus de Mad-
ginecourt, he would eventually lose a much greater
reward than he had received as the price of his
death. The lure he conceived to be good, but the
difficulty was how to represent it to the governor.
Were he himself to speak upon it to him, he must,
at the same time, confess himself an impostor, a
friend to Edward, and that he had been a listener

to the conversation the governor had on the preced-
ing night held with the English strangers; and to
give him any anonymous information upon the sub-
ject he felt averse, as he feared that it would not
produce the effect of carrying conviction to his
mind. The idea, however, he considered as being
too good to be suffered to fall to the ground; he
accordingly resolved, that as he could not hold out
the temptation to him personally, he would de it
anonymously: to this end he wrote the following
letter:—-
*-
“Garcias Xavia, beware what you do!
You are, on this paper, addressed by a friend of
the lord baron de Mowbray, who writes to you in
consequence of a knowledge he has obtained that
you are at this moment entertaining in your house
emissaries from lord Rufus de Madginecourt, whose
visit to the continent, from the well-known passion
of that nobleman for the daughter of De Mowbray,
who is the wife of your prisoner Edward, cannot
but portend danger to his life. You are, therefore,
again told to beware what you do ; for although
the baron de Mowbray has not yet pardoned his
daughter's marriage, the day is, in all probability,
not far distant, when he will recall Edward to Eng-
land, and acknowledge him his son and heir :
thus you will, in such case, not only lose the re-
ward he would bestow on you for the preservation
of his life from his enemy De Madginecourt, but

have to answer for his death. Therefore, a third
time, beware! So enjoins you,
A MEMBER of THE ENGLISH CAMP.”
*º-
This letter Hubert put, early in the morning,
into a letter-box on the outside of the prison wall,
of which the contents were daily carried to the go-
vernor at his breakfast-table.
Throughout the day, it was the intention of Hu-
bert to watch the governor as much as opportunity
would permit him to do, and to endeavour to gather,
from his words and his features, whether his letter
had made any change in his resolution relative to
Edward.
Scarcely had Hubert removed Adolphus into his
new apartment, ere he was summoned to the go-
vernor in his private closet. Hubert judged it im-
possible that the deception he had practised should
have been discovered, or even suspected; still he
feared this might be the cause of his present sum-
mons into the governor's presence; however,
whether it was so or not, he could not do otherwise
than obey it.
He found Xavia pacing his closet, and when Hu-
bert entered, he quickly thrust a letter into his
pocket, which Hubert could not doubt to be the
one he had written to him in the night. The go-
vernor turned towards Hubert, and bade him shut
the door; his features betrayed a violent agitation

of mind." I have,” said he," a particular ser-
vice to require at your hands—the reward will be
ten pieces of gold. Will you promise me your se-
cresy ?” Had Hubert been less eager than he was
to learn the governor's secret, it became him, in
support of his present character, to pretend that
he regarded the gaining of ten pieces of gold wor-
thy of any hazard ; and he accordingly answered to
that purpose.
“But swear to me by thy Saviour,” returned
the governor,
" that what I am about to entrust to
thee thou wilt never communicate to any of thy
comrades.
If the secret related to Edward, Hubert wished
it, whatever it was, to remain one to his comrades,
as much as the governor could do ; if not, he could
have no motive for desiring to circulate it: hethere-
fore took the oath.
“ The reward which I now devote to thee,” said
the governor,
“ would have become Gourtray's,
had he not last night fallen under my displeasure;
I now transfer it to thee, as a recompence for thy
diligence in supplying his place at my return with
my guests."
Hubert made a suitable acknowledgement for
this consideration in his favour on the part of the
governor, who then continued speaking thus—"I
have, at this moment, those within my mansion
who have been sent hither to purchase of me the
life of my English prisoner; and I have already re-
ceived from them a sum of
money for
my consent

to the deed : but reasons have since arisen in my
mind, which point out to me that it is my duty to
preserve his life; and you must lend your assistance
to me in a plan which I have formed to that end.”
Hubert durst not reply, lest the tones of his voice
should discover the joy of his heart at the success
which had attended his letter to the governor.
Garcias Xavia proceeded by saying—“I have
promised them to administer an opiate to my pri-
soner during the course of the day, and to conduct
them to his cell at midnight, when he lies buried in
the arms of sleep. I have privately resolved, that
before that hour arrives, we will remove him from
his cell, and place in his bed the corpse of a young
Frenchman, who is now stretched in his coffin in
the chapel for interment. One hour, therefore,
after the bell has tolled for all the inhabitants of this
house to retire to rest, be you in waiting for me at
the door of our English prisoner's cell. I will leave
my guests, under pretence of ascertaining whether
every one is gone to rest, that they may with safety
proceed to the purpose of their coming hither; and
we will then use the moments of my absence from
them to accomplish the plan I have already made
you acquainted with.”
Hubert waited to say no more than an humble
promise of obeying the governor's orders, and re-
tired from his presence.
The extacy of Hubert's mind was almost too
great to leave him capable of performing the offices
of his station; thrice, during the day, he was un-

der the necessity of visiting the cell of Edward ;
but he constrained himself each time to maintain a
strict silence, which he, by signs, enjoined Edward
to do also. He dreaded lest an incautious moment
should now destroy the hope he had formed of the
adventures of the night. The governor had resolv-
ed that night to preserve the life of his prisoner-
Hubert believed that he should that night be en-
- abled to restore his benefactor to liberty.

The awful hour of midnight now comes on.
HERBERT.
WHEN the clock had struck eleven, Hubert left bis
chamber, and placed himself at the door of Edward's
cell. In a few minutes the governor appeared in
the gallery. “ All are in bed, I believe ?” he said,
as he approached Hubert. “ For nearly an hour
all has been quiet,” Hubert replied. “ Open the
door,” said the governor ; “ we need not fear be-
ing interrupted in our proceedings ; no one can over-
hear us, except it be some of the prisoners, who
have not the power of quitting their apartments.
As Gourtray is still in confinement for his last
night's offence, there is no keeper in this gallery
but yourself.

This Hubert already knew, but it was an addi-
tional satisfaction to him to hear the governor as-
sert it, and he obeyed his orders for opening the
door.
“Awake—awake l’” said Xavia, approaching the
pallet of Edward. Edward started up at this ad-
dress, and the governor continued—“We come to
conduct you to better faring.”
“The condition of my life is indifferent to me,”
replied Edward, “while I am denied the enjoyment
of liberty; it is even a cruelty to protract my days,
by bettering my condition, while you deny me all
for which I wish to live.”
The governor did not answer this address on the
part of his prisoner, but having liberated him from
his chain, commanded Hubert to assist in leading
him to another cell. The present moment was the
first time of Edward's beholding the governor since
the night on which he had been conveyed, with
Adolphus Biron, to the cell he was now about to
quit. When he had first replied to the governor's
exclamation, he had not, in the moment of his
hasty waking, perceived who it was that he was ad-
dressing ; now he discovered it to be Garcias him-
self who was leading him along, he could not for-
bear making an invocation to his humanity, fruitless
even as he believed the appeal would be.
A few minutes brought them to an apartment
which Edward was commanded to enter, and the
lock immediately turned upon him.—“Leave the
key in the door,” said the governor to Hubert,


## p. 578 (#612) ############################################

578
MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
" for we shall reconduct him to his former cell as
soon as the business of the night is concluded."
This done, the governor and Hubert immediately
proceeded to the chapel where lay the young French-
man of whom the governor had spoken in the morn-
ing, prepared for interment on the following day:
taking him up in their arms, they bore him to Ed-
ward's vacated cell, and binding the chain round
his waist, they placed him on the pallet, and threw
a coverlet over him. The governor then command-
ed Hubert to retire to his own room, saying, that
when the emissaries from England had, as they
supposed, performed the deed of death for which
they had been sent into Flanders, and he had con-
ducted them beyond the outer wall of the prison,
he would summon Hubert to assist him in replacing
the dead body of the young Frenchman in its pro-
per situation in the chapel, and in reconducting
Edward to his cell.
Hubert obeyed Xavia's command of retiring to
his chamber, while Garcias himself proceeded to
the apartment where he had left Alwin and his com-
panion. He who had made the third on the preced-
ing evening had set out that morning for England,
with the letter written by the governor to the lord
William de Mowbray, to inform him of the death
of his hated son-in-law,
“ Come forth boldly,” said the governor, ad-
dressing them ; “ you will meet with no interrup-
tion in your proceedings.” They left the apart-
ment, and followed his steps.

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
579
Arrived at the cell where Edward had lately been
a prisoner, the governor said—“You need not fear
his waking; he has swallowed a potion that will
ensure your security.” The governor continued to
stand at the door of the cell, extending his hand
which bore the lamp into it, and pointing with the
other to the pallet where lay the dead body. Al-
win's companion continued also at the door, stand-
ing by the side of the governor. Alwin himself
moved up to the pallet ; having fixed his eyes for
an instant upon the body, of which the single lamp
carried by the governor was too faint a light for him
to discover the features, he drew a dagger from the
folds of his mantle, and having run it twice into the
body of the supposed Edward, he exclaimed
“ Farewell ! thou wilt never tell tales of him who
sent thee to thy account !” He let the dagger fall
from his hand as he spoke these words, and leaving
the cell, he addressed Garcias Xavia, desiring that
he would immediately conduct him and his compa-
nion out of the prison.
The moment their receding steps were no longer
audible to Hubert, he darted into the gallery, and
entering the apartment where Edward was, he ex-
claimed—“My master! my benefactor! Your li-
berty, your life depend on the present moment !
Follow me, follow me!”
The heart of Edward beat a tumult of joy on
these welcome sounds from the lips of the honest
Hubert, and he was satisfied to act under his direc-

tion, without that explanation for which theurgency
of the moment afforded no opportunity.
Hubert led the way back to his own chamber,
and the instant they were both within it, he said
“ In a very short time the governor will come hither
alone, to summon me to his aid, in a point which
shall hereafter be explained to you; the moment
he appears, assist me to secure him, and we tri-
umph over our enemies."
A few minutes of awful and torturing suspense
succeeded. The soul of Edward almost sickened
between the extremes of expectation and the dread
of disappointment; the feelings of Hubert were
wound to a pitch of the most nervous hope and
exultation.
The door of Hubert's chamber was at length
pushed open by the hand of the governor—"Now
then !” exclaimed Hubert. Edward understood
the meaning of his exclamation, and both darting
at the same instant upon the astonished Garcias,
made him their prisoner.-—“ This way with him!”
said Hubert, and they had led him to the door of
the cell where Edward had so lately been a captive
ere he was sufficiently recovered from the surprise
in which the unexpected treatment he was receiving
had thrown him, to be able to command the power
of utterance.
When he did speak, it was only in broken sen-
tences that his astonishment and passion could gain
a passage through his lips.--" What means this ?”

he exclaiined. “ Am I betrayed ? Wretches, ye
shall repent-ye shall experience torments-ye
shall-Help !-Help!- What, no help !”
Edward started with alarm at the sound of his ex-
clamations.
Fear nothing from his cries,” said Hubert ; “ he
has already informed me that no one can overhear
us here, but prisoners who cannot quit their apart-
ments.
"Oh, mercy, Jesu!—Jesu !” exclaimed Garcias :
ye will not murder me ? - What is it ye will do
with me?"
“Let you live to repent the crimes of your life,
and prepare yourself to meet a more awful admi-
nistrator of justice than you behold in either of
us ;” and having said this, Hubert thrust him into
the cell, and closing the door, turned upon him
the lock.
“Now then let us be gone,” said Hubert ; “ the
key which you saw me snatch out of his hand at the
moment we first seized liim is the master-key of
every lock which could impede our escape from these
accursed walls."
“ Yet one instant stay,” responded Edward: “I
have a friend within this edifice, Adolphus Biron his
name, the youth whom you this morning led away
from the cell in which I was then a prisoner. Dur-
ing the melancholy period of our captivity, we
made a promise to each other not to accept the bles-
sings of liberty singly—he must be the companion
of our flight.”

The apartment to which Adolphus had that morn-
ing been conducted was near the spot where they
were standing; and, by the assistance of the master-
key, Hubert directly admitted Edward into it.
It is needless to describe with what joy Adolphus
beheld his friend, and heard the purpose of his mid-
night visit; and the moment the first burst of ecstacy
which had been poured into his soul by the promise
of freedom had subsided, his thoughts turned to
his Belise." I cannot depart to leave her here,”
he said.
“ If you mean that lady Belise who is daughter-
in-law to the governor,” returned Hubert,
" she is
not within these walls ; she has fled from hence
some days.
“ Fled !” echoed Adolphus.
“Yes,” replied Hubert ; “ on the death of her
mother, which happened about a fortnight ago,
the governor's threats of uniting her to an old
man, who had for some time past been her suitor,
but into whose arms her mother had, during her
lifetime, withheld her from being forced, produced
such an effect on her mind as to induce her to fly
from the misery she dreaded, and she has not since
been heard of.”
Unhappy, beloved Belise!” exclaimed Adolphus.
“ Come then, let us instantly hence. Adolphus
shall know no rest, till he has found the mistress
of his soul."
Conducted by Hubert, they quickly found them-
selves on the outside of the prison-wall! in pass-

583
ing through the court which led to it, Hubert dis-
encumbered himself of his wooden leg, and the
bandage which he had worn over his left eye for the
sake of disguise.
To avoid the city of Ostend, Hubert said, must
be their first care, as there would, undoubtedly,
be made the first search after them in the morning,
as soon as the governor was released from his pre-
sent confinement, and should disperse abroad in-
telligence of the occurrences of the night. To-
wards the coast he considered it equally dangerous
for them to proceed, lest they should encounter
Alwin and his companion, who had, doubtless,
sought it immediately on quitting the prison, in
order to embark without delay for England: he
therefore advised that they should entirely avoid
the coast, and endeavour to push their way into
Germany, from some part of which empire they
might stand a chance of procuring a passage to
England, without exciting suspicions of any kind
concerning themselves. It might, perhaps, be said,
delay their arrival in that kingdom a couple of
months beyond the time in which they might reach
it, were they to sail directly thither from any part
of Flanders ; but he judged that Edward, having
once obtained his freedom, with the difficulty and
perils with which it had been gained, no caution
could be too great to ensure his not being again de-
prived of it.
Adolphus, uncertain whither his road lay, felt
only convinced that it became him to get away as

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
speedily as possible from the neighbourhood of Os-
tend; and accordingly agreed to pursue the road
of his friend and Hubert, for at least a day or two.
“ As we shall undoubtedly be sought near the
coast,” remarked Hubert, as soon as our escape
is discovered, let us use the night to proceed, with
all possible expedition, as far as we are able, in an
exactly opposite direction ; at the first town where
we shall arrive in the morning, we will procure some
conveyance to transport us towards a spot of greater
security.”
“But how, good Hubert, are our expences to
be defrayed ?” asked Edward.
Hubert explained to him, that he was in posses-
sion of above five hundred pieces of gold, which
were all devoted to his service; but be forbore to in-
form him how that sum had become his.
Edward began to pour forth to him those eu-
logiums on his generosity which the gratitude of
his heart dictated to his tongue, but Hubert in-
terrupted him by beginning to relate some of the
occurrences of his own life since Edward and he
had parted.
“ And didst thou leave thy native land purposely
to seek me out ?" exclaimed Edward, “and hast thou
past all these months in the meanest capacity, in or-
der to be near me, and watch a moment for my en-
largement from captivity ? Oh, generous, worthy
man!-what benefit had I ever conferred on thee, to
demand a return of the exalted nature thou hast
made me ?"

“Had you not acknowledged me a man,” replied
Hubert—“a being possessed of the same feelings
and the same wants as yourself, although placed by
destiny in an humbler sphere of life 2—and did you
not, by every means in your power, endeavour to
equalize my comforts with your own 2 Yes, yes,
you had done this to me—could I, in return, do too
much for you?”
Tears are expressive of the weakest, as well as of
the noblest sensations of the human mind; those
which burst into the eyes of Edward, at this address
from the excellent Hubert, were of that nature
which bespoke him possessed of a heart upon which
the eye of Providence might glance in exultation,
and declare itself well pleased with its created being.
Hubert had remained in England so short a
time after Edward's quitting it, that he had but
little to inform him concerning those whom he had
left behind, with which he was not himself already
acquainted. The only occurrence of importance
which had taken place, during the few months that
Hubert had continued in Cumberland after the de-
parture of Edward for Flanders, was the birth of
Rosalind's child; and Hubert had reasons, which
will hereafter be shewn, for confining this event, for
the present, within his own breast.
As Hubert proceeded to relate the adventures of
the two last days, the arrival of Alwin and his com-
panions at the prison, the false intelligence which
had been dispatched of Edward's death to lord
William de Mowbray, and the use he had made of the

knowledge which he had acquired of these circum-
stances, not only for the preservation of Edward's
life, but also for gaining him his enlargement from
the tyranny of the vile Garcias Xavia—the de-
sponding husband of Rosalind expressed the deepest
apprehensions lest, immediately on the fabricated
news of his death reaching England, her father
should force her into the arms of the hated lord
Rufus.
Hubert replied, that he conceived his master (as
he was still resolute in calling Edward) to have
nothing to apprehend on this score; for as the letter
from the governor could not yet have reached En-
gland, and as the baron de Mowbray, on the re-
ceipt of it, would doubtless allow a due portion of
time to the claims of decency, before he compelled
his daughter to enter into a second marriage, there
was little doubt of their reaching Cumberland before
any step of the kind had been taken, how resolutely
soever it might have been determined upon between
lord William and de Madginecourt.
Edward derived little satisfaction from these ar-
guments; but he was loath to return only murmurs
to Hubert for the zeal he had shewn in his cause ;
and, therefore, as he knew all complaints to be use-
less, he constrained himself to keep his thoughts
locked up in his own breast.
A friendly moon, which rose soon after our tra-
vellers had quitted the precints of the prison, guided
them on their way, till the light of day eclipsed
the silver splendour of the fainter orb : they had

continued to move forward without a single moment
of delay, and about an hour after the rising of the
morning they found themselves at the mouth of a
valley wüich led to a knot of cottages, in the midst
of which a church spire, raising its head above the
thatched roofs, bespoke it a village of inferior note.
At this village they procured some refreshment,
and a conveyance to the next stage, upon the road
which Hubert had resolved to be the most judicious
for them to pursue. They continued to travel on
without interruption, and about four in the after-
noon of the following day they reached a town,
where they learnt that there was on that day a fair :
they entered a house of public entertainment, and
were vexed to find that the room they were con-
ducted into fronted a square, where the fair was
held. As they dreaded a pursuit, they dreaded
equally to be seen, and accordingly kept on the
side of the apartment farthest removed from the
windows, whilst they were constrained to remain in
the house, which was during the time that fresh
horses were providing, and a hasty meal was pre-
paring for them.
Amidst the other sounds that ascended to their
apartment from the fair, in the course of a few mi-
nutes they heard the voice of a female, whom they
supposed to be a common ballad-singer, chanting
to the sweetest melody the following song:-
What is power, what his wealth ?
Can they free the heart from pain,
Or bestow soft blooming health,
Where disease and sickness reign !

See yon mountain's rugged brow,
Frowning o'er the crystal stream,
While its crumbling honours shew,
Life's a gay fantastic dream.
Mark ambition, ceaseless toil,
Looks with scorn on humble worth ;
Humble worth, unhurt the while,
Pity feels for wealth and birth.
In some sweet sequester'd glen,
Deep embower'd from haughty pride,
Far remov'd from envious man,
Let my life but smoothly glide;
There I'll watch the setting sun,
While soft memory brings to n.ind
Lays when happiness begun
Days ala s ! left far behind.
Adolphus displayed violent emotion whilst the
songstress pursued her ballad : in the midst of the
fifth stanza he rose from his seat, and approached
the window, and whilst her last cadence vibrated
on the air, he exclaimed—“ It is she-'tis she, by
Heaven! my beloved, my adored Belise !” and
with these words he darted out of the apartment.
Edward supposed that his friend had been mis-
taken in the opinion he had formed of the songstress;
but a few moments afforded him another proof of
how keen are the senses of a lover, for Adolphus
returned to their apartment, bearing in his arms,
neatly habited in the dress of a Flemish peasant,
his Belise, who had fainted with the joy and sur-
prise she had experienced at so unexpectedly meet-
ing him.

LIYSTIRIOUS PRIEBOOTER.

When Belise was suficiently recovered to col-
lect her ideas for speech, she corroborated those
particulars which Hubert had already given for the
cause of her flight from her father-in-law; and add-
ed, that having kept herself concealed, after her
first departure from the prison, in a wood in the
vicinity of Ostend, till she believed the heat of the
pursuit, which she doubted not was set on foot after
her, to have subsided, she had emerged from her
retreat, had put on the disguise in which we saw
her, and was pursuing her way to a relation of her
deceased father at Maestricht, whom she meant to
inform of the governor Garcias Xavia's cruelty to
her; and the imprisonment of Adolphus Biron, and
implore his intercession in her behalf, as she des
paired, by any other means, of preserving herself
from an union with the man whom her father-in.
law had selected as her husband, or of produring
the enlargement of him who possessed her affections.
“ But this habit,” said Adolphus,“ is, my dear
Belise, only a change of dress, not the least dis-
guise to your person.'
.
... Is it not ?”. she replied—“ I had hoped that it
would be ; but no matter-its use is now over.. But
to tell you the truth, the principal cause of my
putting it on was not with regard to disguise, but
to procure myself a maintenance on my journey. I
had but one single ducat in the world at the time of
my escaping from the old governor, and as I knew
it very inadequate to support me all the way on
my journey to, Maestricht, I put on this dros,

590 MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER.
which I happened to have in my possession at my
departure, and trusted to my voice and lute to
earn me my livelihood in the towns and villages I
had to pass through.”
After Adolphus had in his turn gratified the cu-
riosity of Belise, respecting the mode of his escape
from the prison, she said, “As I know that we
are equally poor, I recommend that we pursue my
intention of proceeding to my relation at Maestricht,
and entreat his interposition in procuring for me,
out of the hand of Garcias Xavia, the sum of money
which I inherited from my father at his decease, and
which, I fear, my mother, before her death, was
sufficiently inconsiderate to trust in the hands of the
governor; without the intervention of a friend, who
is acquainted what measures ought in this case to
be pursued, I am convinced I shall never be able to
call it mine.”
Adolphus joined in her opinion ; but the difficulty
which still presented itself to them was, how even
their journey to Maestricht was to be performed, in
the pennyless state they were both in.
This difficulty the generous Hubert easily settled
for them : taking from his trusty waistcoat one
hundred pieces of that gold of which it had for years
past been the guardian, he begged them to accept
it as a tribute of friendship, not from him, but from
his master Edward.
“No, no,” said Adolphus, “it may never be in
my power to repay you.”
“You wrong the disposition which makes you

591
this offer,” returned Edward, " in the cause from
which you hesitate to accept it: his is a heart of
that nature which cannot be more highly gratified
than by proving itself useful to his fellow-beings.”
Adolphus and Belise poured forth their joint
thanks to a benefactor, from whom they had so
little expected so useful a service. The grateful
Belise seized his hand, and imprinting on it a kiss,
exclaimed “Be this the bond, that I owe to you
the happiness of possessing my Adolphus, and—-"
the tears prevented her further utterance.
“ Depend upon it,” cried Adolphus, concluding
the sentence which she had been unable to finish,
" that whenever fortune shall smile upon us-
“ I,"exclaimed Hubert, interrupting him, “ shall
experience an additional pleasure to what I now
feel, in considering that I have perhaps laid the
first stone of
your future independence."
Their repast was now brought in; and after they
had partaken of it, they rose to bid each other fare-
well. The route of Belise towards her relation lay
in an opposite direction to the one destined to be
pursued by Edward and Hubert. A lack of words
is sometimes the most expressive sign of true regret
at parting: such was the separation of Edward with
Adolphus and Belise; and as their full hearts pro-
nounced blessings on each other, not the least fer-
vent were those which Adolphus and Belise coupled
with the name of the exalted Hubert.

It would be uninteresting to the reader to accom-
pany. Edward and Hubert in their wearisome-jour-
ney into the German empire: suffice it to say, that
many unpleasant causes conspired to oblige them
to pursue the greater part of it on foot, and that,
after the expiration of nine long weeks, they found
themselves at the port of Hamburg.
Here, in the course of a few days, they procured
a passage on board a Freneh ship, which had been
sent thither to load with merchandize, which she
was destined to carry to Newcastle. The harbour
of her destination appeared to Edward as desirable
a spot for his landing as he could have fixed upon,
had he himself been consulted relative to her course ;
and with a heart light as air, now borne on the
buoyant wings of expectation towards his adored
Rosalind, he went on board the vessel.

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTIR.

For the three first days their royage was pros-
perous ; on the evening of the fourth, the English
shore having for the greatest part of the last day
been in view, the captain made towards it, with an
intention, as he said, of coasting it up to the mouth
of the Tyne. About the time of sunset, the wea-
ther was remarkably serene for the season of the
year; the golden beams of the grand luminary of
earth had quivered on the waves, till it had sunk
into the ohscurity of its watery bed; and the cap-
.tain, drawing his conclusion from the proverb, had
foretold a morning of equal serenity and brilliancy.
But proverbs are not always infallible : towards
midnight the wind suddenly veered round to the
south; it rose in short and angry gusts, and in the
course of a few hours swelled into a tempestuous
hurricane, which drove the vessel off the coast:
with the morning a thick rain began to fall, which
obstructed all observation at the distance of half a
furlong from the ship; the English shore was no
longer visible, and the compass their only direction.
The gale continued to blow with equal violence
throughout the day : a hope was entertained by the
mariners, that about the hour it had arisen on the
preceding night, it might abate on this ; but their
expectations were deceived, and the captain pro-
nounced, that if the wind continued to blow twelve
hours longer in the same point of the compass that
it then did, they should be driven farther into the
North Sea.
The next night came, and brought with it no

change but that of the wind having veered in a tri-
fling degree to the westward. Again the morning
rose, and ushered in a day equally stormy as the
preceding one had been ; at every fresh gust the
billows ran mountains high, and the vessel truly
seemed the sport of the waves, which, at intervals,
rolled in curling circles over the deck, breathing, as
it were, vollies of smoke in their hasty passage.
The wind now flew to the eastward of the south : all
power of directing the course of the ship was at an
end, and she had nothing to trust to but the chance
of escaping rocks and sands. In the afternoon, a
leak of considerable size was discovered in the hold;
the pumps were immediately set to work, but their
efforts were soon found to be very inadequate to dis-
charging the quantity of water which was forcing
its way into the ship. To add to the horror of the
scene, two men, who were about this time employ-
ed in endeavouring to take in some of the canvas,
fell from the yard-arm into the sea, and were seen
to rise no more. Every individual on board conti-
nued to work at the pumps with a fervour which
nothing but the desire of preserving life could have
given them strength or spirits to have done. Night
was yet distant, and still the darkness of the atmos-
phere increased with every minute; and, as if the
terror of the scene was not already enough to gratify
the spleen of nature, the thunder began to roll in
tremendous cracks over their heads, and the forked
lightning to cut the heavy clouds on every side.
In this extremity, not only the mariners (with

595
the exception of only two men), but the captain
himself, lost their resolution, and ran for the sup-
port of their courage to such strong liquor as the
vessel had on board. Every added draught seemed
insufficient to steel their minds against their ap-
proaching death ; and, in a short time, the re-
sources of their cowardice had so far driven out
sense, that none were capable of working the pumps
but Edward, Hubert, and the two mariners, who
possessed a sufficient command over themselves to
refuse the invitation of their companions to drown
thought in drunkenness.
These in a short time found themselves entirely
inadequate to the proper exercise of the pumps;
and one of the two mariners declaring that he was
certain the vessel must, in another quarter of an
hour, go down, so rapidly was she filling with wa-
ter, they agreed to launch out the boat, and in this
perilous situation to trust themselves to the mercy
of the waves.
At the moment they entered the boat, a crack of
thunder rent the air : it appeared to be the master-
effort of Nature to dispel the horrors which clouded
her face; and a short time proved it to have been
So, for, from that instant, the gusts of wind be-
came less violent, the awfulness of the thunder
seemed to recede in hollow murmurings, and the
lightning was but a faint image of its former fierce-
ness.

which the sailor had given her to remain above water
was expired.
It was now about eight in the evening, and al-
though the blackness of the clouds was less threat-
ening, the darkness of night was stcaling so rapidly
upon the day, that the obscurity of the scene was
becoming gradually thicker every moment. Could
thiey defend their little bark from being overset by
the violent motion of the waves, it was all they
hoped or expected till the day should rise, and fur-
nish them with light to guide their course. They
continued to buffet about in all directions, till about
two hours more, as nearly as they could conjecture,
had passed by ; about this time, the sailors said
that they guessed, from the direction in which the
boat was driving, that she was running into some
creek, which they almost ventured to believe would
carry her ashore.
"The violence of the wind continued to abate; their
boat rode with more safety upon the waves ; the
blackness of the night began to fade into a paler
grey, and even accidental stars to peep from the
atmosphere. At length the mariners, whose sight
use hadi rendered more expert than that of Edward
or Hubert, declared that they were within a cable's
length of land.
On the sound of this intelligence, an exclamation
of joy was pourėd from every mouth, and every eye
bent towards the land, which in a very short time
became discernible to all. :

pre-
The wind lying on their stern, shortly drove the
boat upon the coast : and when the water became
too shallow for her to be carried farther up the land,
they quitted her, and forded their way to the dry
ground.
Edward was no sooner landed, than a thanks-
giving to that Power, which had so frequently tes-
tified its favour towards him in the many acts of
servation he had experienced at its hands, burst
from his lips : the soul of Hubert was not less grate-
ful than that of Edward, but his gratitude was con-
fined to the silence of his breast. The two mariners
also, who had escaped with them from the wreck,
sunk upon their knees, and fervently raised their
voices to Heaven.
When their devotions were concluded" Which
way shall we proceed,” said Edward, “ with the
hope of reaching any habitation ? We are probably
at a considerable distance from any town or village.”
The mariners replied, that they had never before
sailed near that coast on which it had now been their
fortune to be wrecked; that they conjectured it to
be the coast of Scotland, but could form no idea
upon what part of it they were now standing.
While they were deliberating how to proceed-
" Hark !” exclaimed Hubert.
They immediately became silent, and, in the
space of about half a minute more, they heard the
toll of a bell." I was not mistaken,” cried Hu-
bert; “ there it is again."
“ A bell at this hour! a bell at midnight !” ex-

claimed one of the sailors; “pray the holy Jesus
we be not treading on ground that is witched?
“ I have lost both my beads and my missal !"
said the other;
mercy, mercy, good saint James !
protect me, holy martyr! for I have no power of
defending myself against evil spirits !''
Edward was too well acquainted with the super-
stitious minds of seamen to be moved by what they
said ; he endeavoured to convince them, that un-
usual as the hour was for the bell of any religious
house to be tolling, yet that such certainly was the
sound which they had heard, and which still con-
tinued to vibrate at intervals upon the air : that
some monastery probably was nigh, and that, if
they followed the sound, it doubtless would lead
them to a spot where they might obtain relief and
comfort, after the extremities to which they had
been exposed.
Having said this, Edward directly began to pro-
ceed in such direction as the sound of the tolling
bell invited him to pursue ; and the sailors prefer-
ring, probably, rather to run into the jaws of danger,
agreeably to their own opinion, in good company,
than to remain where they were with no other coun-
sellors than their own coward hearts, followed close
behind him, repeating, with inost audible voices,
prayers to their tutelar saints.
They moved on for nearly half a mile, the strength
of the sound increasing at every step upon their
ears, till turning out of the path in which they were
proceeding, in order to avoid some piles of stones

which choked up the road, they caught a view of
lights at a short distance.
The
progress of a few minutes more served to
shew them that these were torches in the air, the
flames of which played above a wall that intervened
between them and our travellers. Advancing to-
wards this wall as rapidly as they were able, they at
length reached a spot of sloping ground, which led
immediately up to it: as they ascended this, the
sound of female voices became audible; they were
chanting a hymn, of which Edward distinctly heard
the last lines
}
Nurs'd on Heaven's ethereal breast,
Our sister tastes celestial rest;
Freed from the pangs she knew on earth,
The ehild of innocence by second birth.
Angels hover round her head,
Angels deck her snow-white bed;
Sister, farewell! more blest than we,
For thou hast gain'd eternity!
After these words had been sung, a solemn si-
lence ensued, the ball ceased to toll, and the lights
began to move along. Edward and his companions,
who were now divested of all supernatural fears,
went up to a gate of iron-work, which they disco-
vered in the stone wall that divided them from those
whose voices they had heard, and on looking through
it perceived a procession of nuns, headed by their
priest, and lighted by the torches of which they had
for a long time past seen the flames in the air, en-
tering, with slow steps, a vaulted door, which led
into the hall of a convent. In the midst of the nuns

they beheld a man, who appeared not many years
to have exceeded the prime of life, led by the abbess
of the convent, and a youth, whose dress bespoke
him the sacristan. - -
The sight of any male attending on the funeral
of a nun excited the surprise of Edward, particu-
larly as lie appeared too much in years to be a
lover, and as, at the same time, his demeanour
bespoke him weighed down with grief. -
When the procession had entered the convent,
Edward looked ronnd to see upon whom he should
call, to request admittance into the holy building,
because, although he had seen enough to know it
to be the dwelling of religious females, he doubted
not, that on account of its proximity to the coast,
some part of it was dedicated to the services of hu-
manity and charity, out of compassion to ship-
wrecked mariners, who, like themselves, might be
cast upon its shores.
He saw a couple of men busily employed in
throwing the earth into a grave, where, from every
circumstance he had observed, it was evident one
of the sisterhood had that night been returned to
her kindred clay. He accordingly hailed them;
they immediately advanced to the gate, and de-
manded the business of those they saw without it.
Edward explained their situation, and inquired
where they were 2 To this question one of the men
replied, that they were cast upon the island of
Auskerry, one of the most eastern of the Orkneys;
and that the building, on the outside of which they

stood, was the convent of saint Agnes. Edward
next demanded if it would be permitted them to re-
ceive from it the offices of humanity due to their
necessities, of which the most grateful would be a
place of repose for the night?
His demand was replied to in terms that proved
that his conjectures concerning the provision which
had been made by the founder of the edifice in be-
half of the unfortunate were not erroneous. The
man said he would instantly acquaint saint Matilda,
the lady abbess, of their arrival, and bring back
with him the keys of the gate to admit them within
its walls.
In a short time he returned, and with him came
the portress, who, though a nun and a virgin, no
danger could have been apprehended from her being
presented to the gaze of a seaman who had per-
formed the voyage round the world, without having
encountered a female during the whole of the cir-
cuit ; for her age was at least seventy, her teeth
were gone, one side of her body she was obliged to
support on a crutch, and, in short, no part of her
composition appeared to retain the vigour of which
it is but natural to suppose the whole had once been
possessed, except her tongue.
The moment she had unlocked the gate, old sis-
ter Judith began to display her best point, by im-
mediately putting into motion her valuable weapon :
she inquired whence they came ? how long they had
reached the shore? whither they had been sailing ?
what was become of the rest of the crew ? and many

filled up,
more questions, between which she made no pause
for a reply.
Edward made her merely such answers as he
deemed necessary, in order to win her willing ser-
vices towards himself and his companions. Hubert
spoke not; and the sailors, unable to converse in
her language, were satisfied to follow the fortunes
of him who could make known their wants for them.
“ Well,” cried sister Judith, as they crossed the
burying-ground, you are come on a memorable
night; we have had a heart-rending funeral. There
lies,” pointing to the grave, which was not yet
one of the sweetest flowers that ever
bloomed in Scotland.”
" Who was she? I pray you tell me,” said Ed-
ward.
“ No other,” returned sister Judith, “than the
bonny Mabel Monteith.”
“ I do not recollect ever to have heard of her,"
replied Edward.
“ Not heard of her!-why, where have you
lived ?” cried Judith-" not in Scotland, I am
sure, nor in England, I should almost think. You
must have heard of her, and her cousin, lady Mar-
garet Murray: the first the niece, and the other
the daughter, of the powerful laird of Lednoch, who,
in the last pestilence which raged in our couutry,
fled from the world to the mountains of Athol,
where they secreted themselves in a mean hut,
partly of their own building, and there escaped the
plague, while every body thought them dead of it.

But you see, you see,” continued she, emphati-
cally, “if we contrive to put off the evil day ever
so long, it will come at last. Yes, bonny Mabel
Monteith was buried in that grave to-night.”
Edward had now some faint remembrance of hav-
ing heard the story when a boy, and mentioned it
to sister Judith.
“Man, woman, and child know their story,” re-
joined she ; “it has been told twenty different ways
in verse;” and as she uttered these words, they en-
tered the hall of the convent, where saint Matilda
met them. She received them with that kindness
and courtesy of expression which give the highest
value to benevolence and hospitality; and perceiv-
ing Edward to be of superior rank to his compani-
ons, she addressed herself particularly to him, to
inquire in what manner she could be serviceable to
him in his present unfortunate situation ?
Having told her as much of his history as it was
necessary that she should be made acquainted with,
she replied that the French sailors had better re-
main in a cottage which she would dispose to re-
ceive them in the village hard by, till some vessel
bound to the continent should touch upon the is-
land for water or provisions, which, she said, was
generally the case every fortnight, or sometimes
more. For himself, she said, she would willingly
supply him with money, if he wanted it, which she
supposed to be the case, and put him into the road
for England, instructing him how to travel it, with
the least inconvenience to himself—Of money, he

informed her that he did not stand in need, as his
companion, pointing to Hubert as he spoke, had
some about him at the time they had been obliged
to quit the foundering vessel. For her instructions
how to pursue his route into Northumberland, he
should be very thankful; but added, that he felt
himself so much weakened and fatigued by the pe-
rils he had encountered in his voyage, that he
should, in all probability, be compelled to intrude
for two or three days at least upon her hospitality,
before he should be able to pursue his journey into
England.
“ ' My son,” replied saint Matilda, “it is not to
me, but to the founder of this mansion, that you
are indebted for such comforts as it can afford you;
if my welcome to it can add to thegratification with
which you receive them, you have it from my
heart : this is all which you will owe to me, should
you reside with us a month."
Edward returned the abbess thanks, suitable to
the benevolent temper of her mind; and having
partaken with Hubert of some refreshments that
were sct before them, they requested to be shewn
to their respective chambers.
At the hour of breakfast, sister Judith called
them to their meal, and while they were seated at
it, saint Matilda, who did not appear entirely to
have forgotten the world, or to have lost her relish
for society, visited them: she congratulated them
on finding them better, she said, than she expected
to have done, from their haggard and weary looks

on the preceding night; and told Edward, that if
he was able to travel in two days' time, she could
recommend him company as far as Perthshire-for
that there were, at the present moment, a gentle-
man and his servant in her convent, who were at
that time to set out on their journey thither.
Edward replied, that he doubted not being well
enough to undertake the journey, and inquired who
the gentleman was at whom she had hinted as a
travelling companion for him ?
“ It is,” answered saint Matilda, " the laird of
Glenross, the disconsolate widower of our sister,
bonný Mabel, as we have always called her, im-
mediately after whose funeral you arrived last night.
“ A wife, and still a member of your sisterhood !"
exclaimed Edward.
“ Even so," returned saint Matilda. " I do not
wonder that you express surprise : for seventeen
years she had been one of our sisterhood, ere I dis-
covered who she was, or learnt that she had ever
been a wife. At the time of her making this dis-
covery to me, she was on her deathbed. Heaven
grant that the portion of charity which I felt for
her, on learning the imposition she had practised
upon me at the time of her becoming an inhabitant
of this convent, be not less of religion than the se-
verity with which most women, who are placed in
situations of authority like myself, would have
treated her! If I have erred, I am satisfied that my
error has been on the side of humanity.”
A pause ensued; the abbess broke it-" I doubt

(
not that she would have died, without confessing
to me the secret of her having ever been married,
had she not been tortured with remorse for her un-
just conduct to her husband, and felt it necessary
to the peace of her last moments to see him, and
obtain his pardon, ere she quitted life.”
The abbess was at this moment called away from
the apartment, and Edward, moving towards the
window, saw the same man whom he had on the
preceding evening observed to be led from the fune-
ral of the deceased nun, by saint Matilda and the
sacristan, standing by the side of the grave, with
his hands clasped, and, his eyes raised to heaven,
as if imploring its charity for her whose earthly part
lay concealed beneath the turf at his feet. As Ed-
ward continued to observe him, he could not forbear
drawing a comparison, which communicated plea-
sure to his feelings, between himself and the laird
of Glenross.-" Thou lamentest an inconstant and
departed wife,” he said ; “ I anticipate the bliss of
again 'clasping to my heart one who lives but for
me, and whose existence the fates have spared her,
again to behold me in her arms. Destiny is still
kind, and I will not arraign her dispensations.
Sinfulare those who murmur, when one gaze around
the world will ever present to their view beings
more unfortunate than themselves."
In the evening saint Matilda again visited Ed-
ward : she informed him, that she had mentioned
to laird Archibald the plan which she had proposed
to him of their journeying together, and that he

had acceded to it with pleasure, and had agreed to
breakfast with Edward on the morning of their set-
ting out, but that he had declined an introduction
to him till that time, wishing to pass his hours until
that period in solitude, dedicated to the memory of
his deceased wife.
Edward began to remark to the lady abbess on
such parts of the bonny Mabel's story as the prat-
tling old Judith had made him acquainted with on
the preceding night; and saint Matilda replied-
“ Her life has, in many instances, been a romance.
If it will afford you any pleasure to hear such par-
ticulars of it as I am acquainted with, you shall sit
an hour with me in my own parlour after vespers,
and I will relate them to you.'
Edward replied, “ that not from idle curiosity to
learn the concerns of others, but from the religious
content with which it ever inspired his own mind to
hear in what manner the hand of Providence had
interfered in regulating the destiny of his fellow-
beings, her offered recital would give him satisfac-
tion.”
“ Thou art wise, my son,” returned saint Matil-
da : “ the great book of learning is the human
heart—to study its workings, and to observe in
what manner the indulgence and restriction of its
passions have been instrumental to the honour or
disgrace of such members of society as have pre-
ceded us upon the stage of life, is an inquiry wor-
thy of the most exalted philosophy, and a curiosity
which cannot be deemed a vice. Experience is the

mother of true wisdom, and it is only to be ae-
quired by attention to the conduct of others. I am
not talking,” she added with a smile, “like one
immured for life within the walls of a convent—at
least you may judge these sentiments not to be ap-
plicable within one ; but trust me, that even here,
in our small community, where you may perhaps
imagine that none of the errors which exist in the
world at large are to be found, example has too
much sway for the happiness of many—because,
my son, it is a sorrowful truth, that such is the
force of example, that it does not alone find follow-
ers when its actions are praiseworthy, but begets
imitators equally of its impurities.”
The bell now tolling to assemble the nuns to their
evening devotions, the abbess went to join them in
the chapel; on her return from it, Edward was
summoned to her parlour by sister Judith, and
saint Matilda executed her promise of relating to
him the history of the laird of Glenross and his
faithless wife, the bonny Mabel Monteith.

CHAPTER 1.
They bigged a bower on yon burn-brao,
And thick'd it o'er with rashes.
ANCIENT BALLAD.
. IT was one evening in the early part of spring,
that laird Archibald Glenross, having been sepa.
rated from his companions in the chase, found
þimself alone, and at the distance of several miles
from his own castle, in the northern and moun-
tainous part of the county of Perthshire. As no
trodden path pointed out to him a ready way for
gaining the highroad, the more he strove to extri-
cate himself from the intricasies of the chain of
mountains he was riding amongst, the more entan-
gled he became ; and the dusky clouds of departing
day beginning to descend to the earth, he despaired
of reaching home that night, and thought only of
finding some humble cottage to repose at.
“ As the evening closed in, a heavy rain began
to fall, and laird Archibald wet through all his
clothes, before a friendly, though distant, light

gave him the comfortable assurance of his be-
ing within sight of some habitation. With all speed
he made up to it, and alighting from his horse,
knocked with his fist upon the door, and implored
admittance. He could distinguish the whispering
of voices within, but still he heard not the fall of
steps, nor any promise of his request being com-
plied with.
“Again and again he hit his hand upon the door,
and between the intervals of the roaring gust he ex-
plained his hopeless situation, and entreated shelter
from the inclement weather and the biting air.
“The laird of Glenross had at that time just
completed his twenty-fourth year; his person was
handsome, his figure good, his manners universally
allowed to be of the most generous and persuasive
kind; and by the late death of his father, he was
just become the representative of his house; and
the benevolent actions which had attended his ac-
cession to the dignity of his station, he believed to
have rendered his name not alone known, but res-
pected, in the neighbourhood where he resided;
accordingly, he failed not, in his petition for ad-
mission into the cottage at the door of which he was
now standing, to inform its inhabitants who was
their petitioner.
“Laird Archibald looked around him, in the
hope of espying a second light in some other cot-
tage, whose inhabitants might prove more impres-
sive to the call of humanity, but he could discover
none ; indeed, when he turned round his head

from the shelter which the little building he was
standing under the cover of afforded him, no object
was discernible through the thick darkness of night;
nor did he find it scarcely possible to open his
eyes
at all, on account of the driving rain and sleet,
which were borne through the air on the wings of a
keen northerly wind.
“ Laird Archibald did not quit his station, for
even the outside of the cottage was a defence to him
against the weather, which he knew not where else
to seek ; and at intervals he continued to repeat
his petition for admittance : after he had passed
nearly half an hour in this disagreeable situation, a
female voice within the house replied—We come.'
“Of the most delightful nature was the sound;
he placed his foot upon the threshold, and the door
was opened by a person whose appearance filled him
equally with surprise, as did the delay with which
the humane action had been performed : it was a
lady habited in the deepest mourning; and behind
her stood another female dressed exactly the same
as herself, and whose appearance denoted her to
be of equal rank as the first : the latter held in her
hand a lamp; the former, the moment she had
opened the door, thus addressed laird Archibald-
• Enter, my laird ; as we know you to be a knight
of Scotland, we trust that you will not sully the
name, by forgetting the respect due to two unpro-
tected females ; we therefore admit you beneath
our roof.
• Good Heaven !' exclaimed Glenross, fixing his

eyes upon them, I cannot be mistaken-surely
I behold the niece and daughter of the laird of Led-
noch ?
· The same, the same!' they both replied : 'here,
in this seclusion, have we lived, while the world
has thought us both long dead. We are at present
the sole inhabitants of this cottage ; when you hear
this, you will not be surprised that we were scrupu-
lous about admitting you into it at this hour of the
night.'
' And may I lose every claim to the honour of
manhood, ejaculated laird Archibald, if I forget
the reverence due to my benevolent entertainers !'
'Enter, enter freely,' said the daughter of Led-
noch ; 'we have heard much spoken in your praise,
and doubt not to find you equal in honour to the re-
port you bear in the world.'
They immediately placed a chair for their guest
opposite to the fire; and as they had no change of
garments to offer him, they heaped additional logs
upon the hearth, and produced a cup of wine, which
he drank at their invitation.
" When some time had been passed in necessary
attentions to the comfort of the wheatherbeaten
laird Archibald, he besought his fair entertainers to
inform him by what miracle he saw them alive and
in health, when they had for some months past
been supposed to have fallen victims to the pes-
tilence which had at that time raged in Scotland.
“ He had once visited with his father, at the
Castle of Lednoch, in Aberdeenshire; its laird was

613
then a widower, with one son, sir Alexander, a
daughter, the lady Margaret, and an orphan niece
of the name of Monteith, whose beauty had acquired
her the title of the bonny Mabel.
“ Since the time the pestilence had carried
ofi the laird of Lednoch, and his son; his daughter
and niece had been reported in the world to have
fled from Aberdeen, where the disorder had raged
with the greatest violence, but, nevertheless, to
have sunk under its power : he now rejoiced that
common fame had been a false intelligencer in the
instance of their fate, and received from their lips
an account of their preservation.
Lady Margaret satisfied his curiosity in these
words :-
' A very short time after the breaking out of that
pestilence, to which there is scarcely a Scottish
family who does not owe the privation of some loved
relative, my dear father and brother having both
fallen victims to its fury, my cousin Mabel and my-
self, at their death, having no one left us in the
world to.whom we were bound by the ties of affinity-
no one but each other to look up to for the mutual
kind offices of friendship and consanguinity, be-
thought us alone of what steps we might pursue
that seemed to promise us the preservation of both
our lives, which we wished to ensure, more, I be-
lieve, for the sake of each other's happiness, than
our own love of existence.
. We heard of many who fled from the cities to-
wards uninhabited spots, and died in their way to

what they had regarded as places of security; but
this did not discourage us—we hoped that all might
not be alike unfortunate; and esteeming the chance
of prolonging our existence to depend alone on our
quitting Aberdeenshire, where the plague raged in
its hottest fury, we resolved on setting out for the
mountains of Athol, where we knew our old nurse,
Mause, to reside in a lonely cot, although we were
unacquainted with the exact spot on which her
dwelling stood.
' After some days of weary travelling, we reached
the mountains, and with little difficulty discovered
the humble cot of old Mause ; with surprise she saw
us step upon her threshold, and with humanity and
love she received us as her inmates, till the fury of
the raging pestilence should be abated.
Here we have now resided five month, old
Mause having occasionally gone to a neighbouring
village to procure us provisions, and bring us the
report of the times ; upon this business she is now
absent, and will not return till the morrow; on
this account you find us here alone, and unattended.'
“ Laird Archibald congratulated his fair entertain-
ers on the object of their seclusion from the world
having been granted them, in the health which he
saw them enjoying, and assured them that they had
now nothing to apprehend from 'quitting their con-
cealment, as the alarming disorder from which they
had fled was entirely subdued.
" When the hour of retiring to rest arrived, the
laird of Glenross insisted that they should occupy

615
their accustomed chamber, declaring that his repose
would be equally good in a chair before the fire, as
if he were pressing the finest down in the universe;
accordingly, having rendered his resting-place below
as commodious as it lay in their power to make it,
they ascended to their bedchamber, and locked
themselves in for the night.
“ Glenross, when left to bis reflections by the
retiring of the fair recluses, felt more inclined to
indulge himself in thought than sleep. At the time
of his visit to the Castle of Lednoch with his father,
the charms of the bonny Mabel had inspired him
with feelings which nothing could have damped but
the report which had so shortly after been circulated
in the world of her death ; they now blazed forth
again with additional warmth, and circumstances
had added such strength to his passion, that he al-
most feared to sleep, lest his dreams should deny
him that bliss of beholding the bonny Mabel through
his mind's eye, which his waking reflections
afforded him.
“ At bidding him good-night, the lady Margaret
Murray had placed a few books upon the table by
his side. —'Should you not be able to sleep the
night through in your chair,' she said, “you will
perhaps find something in these volumes to entertain
you.'
“ A short time after their departure, laird Archi-

king Richard Cour de Lion and his queen Matilda,
he paused, for lovers feel it a devotion to dwell
upon the pages th
pages that treat of love ; and as he turned
over the leaves, a paper fell from them, upon which
he at the first glance discovered the characters of a
female pên ; he laid down the book, and unfolding
the sheet, he perceived that they were lines of poe-
try
which it contained, and which were thùs in-
'scribed :-
On seeing the Funeral of a young English Officer, toho fell a Viclim to the
Plague in Seotland, where he was entirely a Stranger.
Behold the thronging crowd in yonder street,
Where expectation strains each eager eye ;
Think they the warrior's dauntless brow to meet,
Crown'a with the laurel wreath of victory?
!
Alas! no shout of triumph bribes the gale,
To boast of conquest with exulting breath;
The solemn dírge explains the mournful tale,
And chants the final victory of Death!
Ah, what remains of that which once had liſe ?
Mute is the voice that wak'd at pleasure's call;
Youth with the tyrant held unequal strife,
To break the woof that wove the fun'ral pall.
The helmet, once that brac'd his youthful brow,
To fancy's eye his well-known face pourtrays;
The harmless sword directs no fatal blow,
The martial belt but mimic show displays.
The warlike horse, with fun'ral trappings proud,
Paws the rude earth, and champs the frothy reins,
Mistakes for joy the tumult of the crowd,
And fancies still his master he sustains.

No-ear paternal caught his partiog breath,
No friendly hand reviving cordials gave ;
No lifted finger hush'd the voice of Death,
When in harsh tones he call?d him to the grave.
The half-form'd wish his trembling lips betray'd
Unheeded fell upon a stranger's ear ;
His sinking frame no kindred eyes survey'd,
To claim the birthright of the kindred tear.
Perhaps my wand'ring feet his grave may seek,
May find the spot where his cold ashes lie;
Then shall a sigh from memºry's impulse speak
A stranger's pray'r for frail mortality.
“ These verses had been written by the lady
Margaret Murray, who was as highly gifted with
the qualifications of the mind, as was her cousin
Mabel with those of the person.
“ The laird of Glenross had read them with the
utmost pleasure: he was himself a man of refined
sense, and he hoped to learn that they were the
effusions of his beloved Mabel: the morning brought
him the conviction of his error from her own lips.
- Oh no,' she replied to his inquiry if the verses
were hers, I never wrote a line in
my
life.'
“ He felt rather disappointed, but the confession
was made by Mabel with a smile which compen-
sated, by excess of beauty, for every deficiency in
poetical skill.
“ Laird Archibald readily accepted the invitation
of his fair entertainers to breakfast at their cottage;

and a short time after their repast was ended, old
Mause returned home; she confirmed the informa-
tion which the laird of Glenross had given them,
that all danger from the late pestilence was removed,
and that they might with safety again emerge into
the world.
“ All obstacles to their quitting the seclusion of
the mountains being thus obviated, Glenross pro-
mised to go himself in person, on the following day,
to the Castle of Lednoch, and having assembled an
escort of their own servants, to return with them
as soon as possible to the cottage, and be himself
one of their conductors to their parental habitation.
“ With many acknowledgments they accepted
his courtly offer ; and he then departed, leaving
the bonny Mabel suspicious of the sentiments which
she had created in his heart, and by no means dis-
pleased at the prophecy of her own.
“ Early on the fourtlı morning, the winding of
the horn over the mountains of Athol announced the
approach of the laird of Glenross with his promised
escort ; and the ladies Margaret and Mabel were
conveyed back to the Castle of Lednoch with all the
state becoming their rank and birth; where they
were received with every demonstration of joy by
their assembled clans.
By constant intercourse with the object of bis
adoration, laird Archibald's passion became too vio-
lent to be confined to his own breast, and he breath-
ed the confession of his love into the ear of the bonny

Mabel, who acknowledged him the lord of her
affections, with blushes that heightened the charms
which had inspired him with the consuming fire.
When a due time had been given to the prepa-
rations for their nuptials, they were united at the
altar of Lednoch Abbey. By their union, the clans
of Glenross and Monteith became consolidated into
one vassalage, and the Castle of Glenross was fixed
upon as their place of residence.
“ The lover has no eyes except for the outward
perfections of his mistress—the husband searches
for those of the mind. When nearly half a year
had passed over the heads of the bonny Mabel and
her laird in their married state, and the affection he
bore her began to calm into the sedateness of a
friendly esteem, it was not without regret that he
discovered her mind to be as unadorned as her per-
son was richly ornamented ; while in the lady Mar-
garet, whose person was plain when compared with
that of her cousin Mabel, the alluring graces of a
highly-cultivated understanding shone with extra-
ordinary brilliancy.
“ To the Castle of Lednoch, which was her pa-
rental inheritance, the lady Margaret felt averse to
retiring as a residence, saying that she should infi-
nitely prefer being allowed to constitute a part of
their family, to the solitude which she must expe-
rience as the mistress of a castle-a decision which
the laird of Glenross heard her make with pleasure,
as it ensured him many hours of satisfaction in the
enjoyment of her conversation.

“ But let it not be understood that laird Archi-
bald regarded the lady Margaret in any other light
than as a woman whose universal knowledge it gave
him pleasure to possess an opportunity of referring
to, with the familiarity he had the power of doing
to hers. Where the tenderer emotions were con-
cerned, no woman had ever, for one single instant,
entered his heart in competition with his Mabel :
but love, even with the most heavenly object, will
not always satisfy the mind of reason; it must also
banquet on that food in which the understanding
holds a share ; and this repast of reason none could,
in the opinion of laird Archibald, spread in richer
delicacy to the senses, than lady Margaret Murray.
• She was,' remarked saint Matilda, 'a woman
possessed of an uncommon understanding for the
age in which she was educated ; and was, besides,
gifted with that strength of mind which it is very
unusual to find the inmate of a female breast.'

period at which our unfortunate queen Mary gave
her hand to the earl of Darnley. In compliment to
her people, who expected some expenditure from
the royal coffers to be made on this occasion, a week
was set apart for sports and tournaments, to be
held at Kinnavain Castle, in the county of Dum-
fries, and to which all the nobility and gentry of
Scotland were invited'; of the number of the guests
were the laird of Glenross, with his wife and the
lady Margaret.
“ What were the diversions of the first day, I
know not; that of the second was a tilt, at which
twenty pairs of knights were to display their skill in
the wielding of the lance. On the morning of this
day, the queen herself put into the hands of such
of her female guests as bore the rank of nobility,
elegant scarfs and chains, with which to reward the
conquerors of the hour; and the manner in which
she directed the prizes to be distributed was not the
common method of each lady presenting the emblem
of partiality to any victorious knight whom it best
pleased her so to honour, but for such knights as
conquered their opponents to kneel for their reward
at the feet of whatever lady they deemed it the
highest gratification to receive the mark of their
conquest from.
“Of the third pair of knights who contended for
the prize which conquest gave them the right of
claiming from the hand of beauty, the appearance
of one was extremely remarkable ; he best rode a
charger of the brightest black, with a flowing mane

and tail, that greatly increased the beauty of its
form ; his dress was an entire suit of sable armour;
at his back flowed a cloak of lion's skin, which was
fastened upon his shoulders with the paws of the
animal in sparkling silver; and upon his head he
wore the vissage of the lion, cast in massive silver,
around the brows of which depended the real name
of the beast. -
“During the combat, like the rest of the knights,
he wore his visor down. -
“Three rounds were allowed to each pair of com-
batants for the trial of their skill; in the two first of
which he broke the lance of his opponent, and in
the third he unhorsed him. His victory was the
most complete of any one gained that day; and
when he ceased to wield the lance, he threw him-
self at the feet of the lady Glenross, for the reward
of his prowess and skill.
“At the evening board which succeeded the pa-
geant of the day, the victorious knights appeared
doffed of their armour, and amongst them he who
had worn the suit of sable with the cloak of lion's
skin: he was tall, handsome, well shaped, and in-
sinuating in his manner. The moment his eye fixed
upon the bonny Mabel, he approached her, and
entered into a conversation, for which the arrange-
ments of the morning had given no opportunity.
“On the fourth day, the claimant for the hono-
rary scarf and chain in the gift of the lady Margaret
Murray was a sir James Lambrun, a youth firmly
attached to the family of the Stuarts, and in parti-

cular to its present head, the universally beloved
queen Mary.
“The laird of Glenross observed the marked at-
tention of sir James to his cousin Margaret, and
also of the sable knight to his wife, and they both
afforded him pleasure : he judged that Margaret
might be beginning an acquaintance which might
eventually lead to the happiness of her life; and it
flattered his love for his wife, to see her the object
of admiration that she was.
“The bonny Mabel was more charmed with the
attentions of the sable knight than her lord suppos-
ed; he judged the indulgence of her vanity to be
guarded by the innocence of her heart, and he for-
bore to remark upon it to her. The sable knight,
on the contrary, persuaded her that the silence of
her husband proceeded from indifference; and fa-
vouring her own inclination, she trusted to the
voice of a new acquaintance, without seeking the
advice of an old friend. But I must not anticipate
her story—Immediately on the first commencement
of her acquaintance with the sable knight, she had
inquired his name ; this the laird Archibald had also
done, the moment he had seen him kneel to his
wife for the pledge of her favour; and to the inqui-
ries of both, it had been replied by the chamber-
lains of the court, that his esquires had announced
him as sir Allanrod.
“The festive week passed on in the utmost joy
and hilarity; a splendid ball on the sixth evening
concluded the revelry; and after having attended

the queen and her newly-espoused consort to their
devotions at the abbey of Grey Friars, at Dumfries,
on the Sunday, the nobility were expected to leave
Kinnavain Castle, and the royal pair to return to
Edinburgh.
“ When the dance was breaking up, the laird of
Glenross not perceiving his wife in the ranks of the
dancers, concluded her fatigued, and gone to her
chamber; and, under this idea he repaired thither
himself. She was not there; and supposing that
he had overlooked her in the ball-room, he did not
choose to return to it, but sat down to await her
coming. Nearly an hour passed away; and as she
did not appear, he resolved on going down once
more himself ; taking up his lamp for that purpose,
his eye fell on a letter, upon which, as it appeared,
he had set down his lamp at first coming into the
room ; he took it up, and found it directed to him-
self, in the handwriting of his wife. Hastily he
tore it open, and read nearly these words :-
I have for a long time perceived
that you have preferred the conversation of my
cousin Margaret to myself; you may now enjoy it
without interruption ; you will experience no far-
ther restraint in your inclinations from
• MABEL GLENROSS.'

“The emotions of grief, surprise, and vexation,

with which laird Archibald read these lines, you
may easily imagine : how did he lament the impro-
per construction which his wife had put upon the
pleasure that he had enjoyed in the society of lady
Margaret ! how did he execrate the villain who had
robbed him of her charms !
“ He could not doubt with whom she had fled
from him—it could be no other than the sable
knight, sir Allanrod. He hastened to the porters
of the castle, and inquired how long they had passed
the gates ? The confusion of the evening had been
such, that no one was able to reply to his inquiries.
He returned to the castle hall, and amidst the as-
sembled esquires and chamberlains, he demanded
who was sir Allanrod, and where he dwelt ? No
one could reply, with any degree of satisfaction, to
his questions.
« In the distraction of his doubts he ran to the
queen, and of her, and her royal husband, he made
the same inquiries ; but they could not give him
the information he desired-sir Allanrod was known
to them only as a knight, whom the general invi-
tation they had issued to all the Scottish nobility
and gentry to join in the festivities of the week,
had brought to Kinnavain castle.
" The senses of laird Glenross were so far be-
wildered by his loss, that but for the unremitting
care and attention of the lady Margaret Murray,
some rash act had, in all probability, been the con-
sequence of his grief: on the following morning he
returned with her to his castle, hardly conscious of

the change of place he was making; and as every
inquiry after the bonny Mabel and her vile seducer
proved fruitless, he sunk into a melancholy compo-
sure, which threatened a more unhappy termination
than had the violence of grief which he had display-
ed on the first discovery of her inconstancy.
“ How did he lament that he had ever felt plea-
sure in the innocent society of lady Margaret ! and
at times he was almost repentant of having married
with regard only to the perfections of the face, and
having trusted his happiness in the power of one
who had shewn herself so little capable of estimating
the affection of a husband who had most tenderly
loved her.
“ One year having been completed, without a
single breath of intelligence reaching him concern-
ing either his wife or the mysterious sir Allanrod,
with whom she had fled from him, having lost all
taste for the world and its inhabitants, he resolved,
from that moment, to consider himself as a widow-
er, and to become a member of the monastery of
White Penitents at Perth. Accordingly having
witnessed the marriage of lady Margaret Murray
with sir James Lambrun, at which ceremony he
performed the part of father to the bride, he retired
from the world, as he then believed, never for a
day again to emerge into its deceitful scenes.
“I must now," said saint Matilda,
a while from laird Archibald, and pursue the nar-
rative I am giving you in my own character.-In the
retirement in which I live upon this island, and

within the walls of this religious building, the events
of the busy world, as you may suppose, seldom
reach my ear.
I had heard of the manner in which
the lady Margaret, and her cousin, the bonny Ma-
bel Monteith, had preserved themselves from the
pestilence, for it had been chanted all over the
kingdom in lays and ballads, but farther I had ne-
ver heard their names mentioned ; that such a noble
as the laird Archibald of Glenross existed I was not
even acquainted : thus it was impossible that I
could know any thing of her marriage.
“ About two years after her elopement from her
laird, that is ncarly twenty years from the present
time, one beautifully serene evening in the middle
of summer, a female pilgrim rang at the gate of the
convent; and when sister Judith replied to the sum-
mons, she requested to see the lady abbess.
“ I accordingly received her in the very apart-
ment where we are now sitting. The inoment she
entered it, she said—' I come, good mother, to
enclose myself for ever, an inhabitant of these sa-
cred walls ; I know the sum which it is required of
me to offer up to saint Agnes for the obtaining of
my grant, and I have brought it with me, although
not in money; these jewels, I trust, will be ac-
cepted as a donation of sufficient value to ensure
me my petition.'-And with these words she put
into my hand a casket, which contained some large
and brilliant diamonds, and a variety of other pre-
cious stones.
· Who art thou, daughter?' Idemanded, 'Whence

comest thou, thus unattended, and, at the same
time, mistress of these valuable articles ?'
"You have heard of me, I doubt not,' she re-
plied, although you knew me not till now: I am
the daughter of the late earl of Monteith, whose es-
cape, with that of my cousin Margaret Murray,
from the pestilence which raged three summers ago
in our kingdom, has been celebrated in many songs
and ballads.'
• Indeed!' said I, are you that Mabel Monteith ?
What is your motive for retiring from the world ?'
My cousin Margaret,' she answered, 'is lately
married to sir James Lambrun, a man in great fa-
vour with our sovereign, and constantly about the
court ; and as she is so entirely devoted to him as
never willingly to be deprived for a day of his so-
ciety, and as my disposition lies far away from the
busy scenes of the world, I have judged this habi-
tation to promise me a happy resource against the
solitude in which I must else live, now I am sepa-
rated from iner.'
* But why, my daughter,' I asked,' are you here
alone ?—where are your attendants ?'
'I parted from them all, for ever,' she answered,
in the vessel which brought me to this island; I
forbade them to follow me on shore, well assured
of receiving from these holy walls the protection
which I ask of them.'
Why did you seek this convent in preference to
any other?' I demanded,
. Because,' she replied, there is one sister in it

629
who knows my family well, although we have never
seen each other; and, standing almost alone as I
do in the world, it was an inducement to me hither,
to reflect that I should live beneath a roof which
sheltered one to whom my parents had been known.
She to whom I allude was the first cousin of my
mother, and I remembered to have heard that she
had taken the veil, at a very early age, in the con-
vent of saint Agnes, in the island of Auskerry; her
name was Bertha Lennox-isshe still living amongst
your sisterhood ?
“ I replied in the affirmative; she testified great
joy at hearing that our sister Bertha was still alive,
and requested to see her ; I complied with her peti-
tion, by introducing them to each other, and the
aged nun appeared to derive much satisfaction from
embracing the child of the friend of her youth.
Feeling thus convinced that the bonny Mabel
was no impostor, I accepted the offering which she
had dedicated to our tutelar saint; she was inme-
diately admitted to her noviciate, and at the regular
period took the vows of our order.
“ The turn of Mabel's disposition appeared to be
a settled melancholy ; I knew not whether to be-
lieve it her real temper, whether to imagine that
she had any secret lying at her heart, which gave
her pain, or that she was dissatisfied with the reli-
gious life upon which she had voluntarily entered.
I frequently spoke to her upon the subject, as did
our sister Bertha ; and her constant reply was—'I
am very happy, quite happy, more happy here

than I could be any where else;'-- which words al-
ways left a doubt on my mind, whether she meant
to express her heart at ease, or religiously resigned
to her fate.
“ About ten years after her becoming an inha-
bitant of this holy mansion, our sister Bertha died;
Mabel and myself were by the side of her bed when
her spirit fled from the earthly form which it had
just before animated.- Oh, what a happy death !'
exclaimed Mabel, as she bent over her lifeless rela-
tive; ‘thy endurances are all past, and thou hast
no sins to account for in the world to come.'
· Nor hast thou, my daughter, I hope and trust,'
I said — Hast thou?' I added, for her words had
increased those doubts concerning the tranquility of
her mind which I had before entertained.
'I hope my good mother cannot think otherwise
of me than as one fully confident in the mercy of
Heaven,' she answered, with a smile ; and I again
thought I had wronged her in my former opinion.
“ The years passed on, unmarked by any mate-
rial occurrence, till about two months ago, when
the bonny Mabel was seized with an illness which,
from the first moment of her being assailed by it,
seemed to threaten the termination of her existence.
In a very short time, our good father confessor,
who is alike the practiser of physic in our convent,
pronounced it as his decided opinion that her ma-
lady must prove fatal.
“ I have ever judged it a mistaken kindness to
withhold from the sufferer on the bed of sickness

631
the knowledge we may have of his trembling upon
the margin of the grave, and I therefore disclosed to
her that the period of her days would be short.
· Am I then about to die ?' she cried: 'endue me,
Heaven, with fortitude !—and do thou, my kind
mother, summon hither the good father David, and
receive, with tenderness and compassion, the con-
fession of my wretched heart.'
“I complied with her request, and sent to call
the father David to her chamber. When we were
alone with her, she imparted to us the secret of her
marriage with the laird of Glenross, her subsequent
infidelity to him with the sable knight, sir Allanrod,
and concluded by informing us, that having repented
the act of shame which she had committed, and
not daring to return to her husband, she had found
means of flying from her seducer, and getting her-
self conveyed to our convent; to enter which, un-
der a false relation of her circumstanees, she had
judged, she said, to be her only means of procuring
herself an asylum which could be grateful to her pe-
nitent feelings.
" It was too late to chide all that remained for
us to do was to exhort her to prayer; but she re-
fused to compose her mind for devotion, till I had
given her my solemn promise to send a petition to
her husband to come and visit her on her deathbed.
Did she not see him, and receive her pardon from
his lips, she added, she should die without hope of
forgiveness in the world to come.
• The moment I had dispatched a messenger to

the laird of Glenross, she applied herself, in the
most contrite manner, to acts of devotion. Thus
passed on five weeks, nature growing every day
weaker within her : at the expiration of that time
arrived laird Archibald : never did I behold so af.
fecting a countenance as his was at the moment of
his first entrance beneath the roof where lay his
perjured Mabel, still beloved, although so many
years, blackened by infidelity, had passed since he
had beheld her.
“ I conducted him to the door of her chamber,
and there I left him ; he requested that their inter-
view should be private.
Nearly two hours passed before he returned to
my apartment: with the placid sadness of one re-
signed to misfortune, he then informed me of the
frailty of his Mabel, told me that she had with
frankness confessed to him her crime, and alleged,
as the reason for her having voluntarily plunged
into sin, the jealousy which his innocent attentions
to the lady Margaret Murray had excited in her
breast, and of which she had not, till too late, al.
lowed herself to investigate the cause.
The mar-
riage of the lady Margaret with sir James Lambrun
and her husband's seclusion from the world, had
opened her eyes to the fallacy of her opinion con-
cerning the nature of the esteem they entertained
for each other; and no sooner had this conviction
reached her mind, than it was followed by a sense
of her own guilty conduct, in having yielded to the
delusive persuasions of sir Allanrod; and, thus cor-

633
rected in her vicious course by the redawning of
her reason, she had formed and executed a plan of
immediately flying from her seducer, to the retire-
ment of a religious seclusion from the world, devo-
ting the remainder of her days to the attempt of
making her peace with Heaven. By the most strict
observance of every religious duty since her becom-
ing an inhabitant of the convent of saint Agnes,
her mind, she said, had been cheered with a faint
hope of forgiveness in a future state; but still she
felt her death would be a most wretched one, unless
she were permitted to implore and to obtain the for-
giveness of her injured husband, ere her departure
from life.
“ This forgiveness the excellent laird Archibald
had already granted her, and now added to it his
prayers for her happiness in a future state.
“ In a short time I returned with him into the
chamber of the expiring Mabel.-" If true repent-
ance,' she said, “ be the washer out of sin, fear not
for the happiness of my soul, my friends : Heaven
is witness how contrite a heart I have, for the last
twenty years, borne within this breast. I have
repented from a conviction of my crime, not from
the awe of future retribution. Oh, most exalted
husband,' she added, " there is no reward which
Heaven can bestow, too great for thy excellence !'
“ She closed her eyes as she pronounced these
words, and we believed her in silent prayer ; but a
few moments convinced us that her spirit had fled
from its earthly habitation.

“The laird Glenross sunk on his knees by the
side of the bed, on which she lay extended in death ;
his hands were clasped, his eyes closed, and his
head bent downwards; the whisperings of a fervent
devotion burst from his lips. When he rose from
his kneeling position, he fixed his eyes for a few mo-
ments upon the corpse in the most expressive silence;
then addressing himself to me, he said—‘I have
hitherto confined the weakness which I feel within
my own breast, but it can no longer be restrained.’
“With these words he burst into a violent flood
of tears, and suffered me to lead him away from
the chamber.
“Here ends the story of this unfortunate pair,’
said saint Matilda: “the grief of the unhappy hus-
band, after the interment of his wife, was as great
as if she had never broken to him her vow of fidelity,
and the prayers which he has poured forth at the
altar of her saint for the happiness of her soul, as
fervent as the most spotless virtue could have drawn
for its reward from the lips of a lamenting husband.”
The midnight hour was on the point of sounding,
when the abbess concluded the history of the bonny
Mabel, and Edward thanking her for her relation,
retired to his chamber; but it was some time before
sleep visited him after he had entered his bed; he
lay reflecting on the basenesss of sir Allanrod's cha-
racter, and considering that an equally vile seducer
might be endeavouring to undermine the principles
of his beloved Rosalind; so certain was he, how-
ever of her faith, that he had no apprehensions on

the score of her constancy, and only lamented the
unpleasant trials to which the persecution of lord
Rufus de Madginecourt, or any other rival of his
virtuous love, might expose her constancy. And
whilst he was pronouncing expressions of wrath and
indignation against the unknown sir Allanrod, mere-
ly as being the seducer of that sex of which he had
been born to be the protector, rather than the be-
trayer, he little imagined that, ere he should again
clasp his Rosalind to his heart, she would be driven
from the castle of her father by the savage attack
made upon it by the freebooters of that very sir Allan-
rod, whose character and conduct another instance
of his vicious nature was leading him to execrate
and condemn.
At the hour on the following morning appointed
for the laird of Glenross and Edward to become tra-
velling companions, they met at breakfast in saint
Matilda's apartment ; they were introduced as
strangers to each other, and conversed as such till
they had crossed that arm of the sea which brought
them to the main land of the Scottish kingdom.
Here laird Archibald resumed the dress of the order
of the White Penitents, of which he was a member;
and shortly after, as they pursued their journey, he
spoke of his own story, and the death of his bonny
Mabel.
Edward soon found that the abbess of the convent
of saint Agnes had informed the laird of Glenross
of her having communicated to him the principal
events of his life ; and he found also that he was

not displeased at his having acquaintance with
them ; and as his own words gave Edward encou-
ragement to speak upon the subject, he inquired
of him, if he was acquainted whether the base sedu-
cer of his wife were still in existence ?
Laird Archibald replied, that he believed him to
be alive.
“ You will doubtless seek him out then,” re-
turned Edward, " and revenge on him the infidelity
of a wife who was lured by his seductive tongue from
the path of duty.”
Never, never !” answered the laird of Glenross,
“ with the assumption of this habit, I made a vow
of holding universal peace with man ; it becomes
my present character, therefore, not to persecute
him for the evil he has done me, but to offer up my
prayers for his forgiveness.
Edward, in the warmth of youthful feelings,
judged this, if not a mistaken piety in the laird of
Glenross, at least a religious forbearance which he
should himself have been averse to have exercised in
a similar situation for the ardent glow of his mind
heated by the expectation of again clasping his Ro-
salind in his arms, rendered him so sensitive to the
passion of love, that he trembled with fancied
agony,
even at the tale of a seducer's triumph.
“ Had you known where to have met sir Allanrod
ere you had pronounced the vows of seclusion from
the world, you had not spoken thus forbearingly of
the injury he has done to you,” returned Edward.
Probably not,” rejoined laird Archibald, “ for

I should then have acted without that discretion
which the intimate acquaintance that I have since
that time gained with religion has taught me to be
essential to a life of future happiness ; suffice it,
that I know him to be a wretch too infamous to en-
gaye the regards of the virtuous man, even in his
chastisement, for to the villanous name of a seducer
he adds those of a rebel and a robber.”
Here laird Archibald paused ; these particulars
of sir Allanrod he had learnt from the deathbed con-
ſession of his wife ; but he refused to acquaint Ed-
ward either of what country he was a native, to
what government he was a rebel, or where he held
his residence.--"According to the present religious
ideas to which bis monastic vows compelled him,
he did not,” he said, “ consider himself authorized
to expose any human being, however unworthy he
might himself know him to be, to the contumely of
those he had not wronged."
“ Are she who was the lady Margaret Murray,
and her husband, sir James Lambrun, still alive ?”
Edward inquired.
“Yes, they are,” replied the laird of Glenross,
“ but it is some time since I have heard of them,
and I know not whether they are at this moment in
Scotland or not; their happiness has been materially
broken in upon by the misfortunes of our unhappy
queen Mary, to whom their attachment was of the
warmest nature. Perhaps, as you say that you are
lately from abroad, you may not yet have heard
that our injured monarch has fallen a victim to the

hatred borne her by the queen of England. It is
now nearly six weeks since she bowed her innocent
head beneath the axe, which was raised against it
by the cruel commands of Elizabeth. During the
whole period of her imprisonment, sir James and his
lady were her constant companions; and the only
consolation which she tasted-for many years pre-
viously to her death, arose from their steady friend-
ship.”
The death of Mary had not yet reached Edward,
and he feared that, in the tumult of her state affairs,
Elizabeth might not have had leisure to attend to
the appeal of her goddaughter, Rosalind, upon her
for protection, if to such an extremity she had been
driven by the cruelty of her father, or the impor-
tunities of de Madginecourt ; and upon this idea he
became still more anxious than ever to reach Eng-
land, that he might at least be relieved from the
torturing apprehensions occasioned to him by his
present suspense. .
A few days travelling brought them into Perth-
shire, where they parted, the laird of Glenross tak-
ing his road towards the monastry of the White
Penitents, and Edward pursuing his course towards
Northumberland.
Laird Archibald had known no more of Edward's
history than that he was upon his return to a be-
loved wife, whom he had not for many years beheld;
and when they bade each other farewell, he promised
Edward to tell his beads for his prosperous journey,
and safe meeting with the lady of his affections.

Edward pursued his way with all the speed he
was able to make; and in the course of another week
his faithful companion Hubert congratulated him on
the happiness of once more treading on English soil.
CHAPTER III.
Fortune is weary of oppressing me :
Thro' my dark cloud of grief, a cheerful ray
Of light breaks forth, and gilds the whole horizon.
FRANKLIN.
On the first night of their arrival in England, when
they had retired to a private chamber in the ha-
bitation of a peasant by the road side, where they
had obtained leave to repose themselves, Hubert
thus addressed Edward :-" In two days more my
dearest master, we shall reach Cumberland ; it is
therefore better to form the plan of our proceedings
now, than to defer it till that time. You must be
well aware that it becomes you to advance with the
utmost caution towards De Mowbray Castle; you
cannot want to be told, that to approach it at all
will be a task of danger, with your Rosalind for
your
sole friend within its walls : with her, there-
fore, it must be your first attempt to gain an in-
terview, as the single person on whose services you
can rely ; and having communicated to her the joy-
ful intelligence of your existence, let her advice
regulate your future conduct.”

“ But,” returned Edward, “ there are no means
of my gaining access to her without my being seen
and probably recognized, by the servants and sol-
diery of the castle, if I am so fortunate as to escape
the observation of the lord baron de Mowbray him-
self.
" Ridicule not the method which I have devised
for your safeguard to her presence,” answered Hu-
bert, “but consider that the exigency of the case
requires desperate means to be opposed to it. As
we travel through Northumberland, I will step
aside from the road, to a town near which we shall
pass, where I will procure you a suit of armour,
such as was worn by the English soldiery on their
expedition into Flanders, and as similar as possible
to the one in which you left Cumberland; habited
in this, you shall approach and enter De Mowbray
Castle ; but not as the living Edward--you must
represent the apparition of the man you are, and by
striking fears of a supernatural nature into the
minds of such as shall behold and recognize your
countenance in your disguise, you will be allowed to
shape your course to your own wish, uninterrupted
by any one, as a religious awe will withhold every
hand from stretching itself out to your molestation.”
“ Surely this invention will not impose upon the
senses of all ?" replied Edward.
“ Can you, my dear master, who are so well ac-
quainted with the timid and superstitious natures
of the inhabitants of Cumberland, doubt it ?” re-
turned Hubert. " Any supernatural appearance, I

am certain, would be more terrible in the eyes of
them all, than a legion of Scottish freebooters
drawn up against them in battle array: that which
assumes the person of one who has been so well
known to the greatest part of them, cannot fail to
render them sufficiently cowards for the purpose
you require ; and having once gained admittance
within the castle, by means of your disguise,
you are too well acquainted with its secret turns and
windings to require from me instruction where to
conceal yourself till a favorable opportunity shall
arrive for you to approach your Rosalind.”
It required much persuasion on the part of the
wary Hubert, to induce Edward to adopt the advice
he gave him:--It was true, Edward considered, that
he had found him, with regard to his own enlarge-
ment from the prison in Flanders, apt at stratagem,
and cautious in the construction of his plans; but
still he could not immediately reconcile himself to
the one he had, in the present instance; devised
for his approach to his beloved Rosalind.”
“ Do any other means, which promise you the
accomplishment of
er security and facility to yourself, offer themselves
to your imagination ?” Hubert inquired of him.
Edward replied reluctantly in the negative.
“ Then be at least willing to make experiment
of the best method which presents itself,” rejoined
Hubert; "and listen to a second inducement which
I shall give you, strong as the first, for its adoption.
Should the vile Alwin, who was commissioned by
with great-
your desired
purpose with

De Madginecourt to be the instrument of your in-
tended death, or the lord Rufus himself, behold
you in your wanderings round the castle walls,
while you shall be awaiting an apt moment for en-
tering within them, it is more than probable that
your appearance may strike terror to their guilty
souls, and draw from their lips a confession of their
crime : nay, if it be even heard by them that such
a shape has walked by night, their caution may
bend to their apprehensions, and the truth burst
from their lips.
Edward was of course ignorant of the disagree-
ment which had taken place between lord William
and De Madginecourt during his absence from Eng-
land, and replied—“ I cannot admit the slightest
doubt of lord Rufus and his train being at this time
inhabitants of De Mowbray castle : for what pur-
pose could he have sent emissaries into Flanders,
to deprive me of life, but the end of becoming him-
self the husband of my Rosalind, in which desire
he knows that he is possessed of her father's
favour?"
“ And does not this very supposition point out to
you,” returned Hubert,
" that certain danger must
await your approach to the castle, in any form but
the one I have proposed to you? If De Madginecourt
and his attendants are the guests of the castle, will
not any rumour which may be conveyed to him of
the living Edward having been seen near it cause
him immediately to issue a reward for the certain
performance of that act of death, in which he had

643
been once foiled ?-and will not lord William equal-
ly, if the intelligence of your return should meet
his ear, redoom you to the imprisonment from
which you have escaped ?—You must, you must
pursue the plan I have marked out for you to fol-
low."
But,” inquired Edward, “ where will be your
station, while I make the attempt of gaining admit-
tance to the presence of my Rosalind ?”
“ On our arrival in Cumberland, I must imme-
diately quit you,” answered Hubert ; “ question
me not, my dear master, upon what business I
leave you, or whither my steps will be bent when
we part; but be satisfied that it is for your eventual
happiness that I shall for some time be separated
from you."
Edward forbore to trespass upon the request of
the generous Hubert, and endeavoured to compose
himself to sleep.
On the following morning they again pursued
their journey, with the same energetic spirit which
had marked their steps ever since they had escaped
from the prison of Garcias Xavia. At a small town
upon the confines of Cumberland, the suit of ar-
mour, of which Hubert had spoken was purchased,
and Edward induced to equip himself in it, accord.
ing to the directions of his faithful companion.
Edward having agreed to assume the appearance
of his own spirit, the deception could not be ren-
dered too complete, and accordingly Hubert pre-
vailed
upon him to mark his left cheek with a streak

of blood ; and for this reason—he had, from the
chamber in his prison, heard enough of the conver-
sation which had passed between Alwin and the go-
vernor while in the cell of Edward, to know that
the first time Alwin had wounded the corpse of the
French captive who had been placed upon Edward's
pallet in the prison, his tremulous hand had unin-
tentionally struck the dagger into its cheek; and
therefore thought that a representation of this
wound upon the cheek of Edward would be a mark
that must at once convey the history of the sup-
posed spirit, and its appearance on earth, to all
such as were in the confidence of De Madginecourt,
and his adherent Alwin.
Edward's equipment took place towards the close
of evening, on the skirts of a wood which divided
Cumberland from the more northern county. But
three hours travelling lay between Edward and De
Mowbray Castle, and he resolved to approach it
under the cover of the shade of night, a time which
Hubert, with a smile, enjoined him always to
choose for leaving his spots of concealment, as a
necessary observance for sustaining his present cha-
racter.
“Here then, for a while, we part,” said Hu-
bert ; and he again repeated—“Question me not
on the business that takes me from you, but rely
on my being employed for your eventual happiness.”
“When and where shall we meet again?” asked
Edward.
“When,” answered Hubert, “ I cannot with

exactness determine; the spot will, in all proba-
bility, be De Mowbray Castle.”
Hubert having then made a transfer of part of the
gold which he had still remaining from the safehold
of his trusty waistcoat to the pocket of Edward,
they bade each other an affectionate farewell, and
took separate roads.
The agitated mind with which Edward pursued
his way may be easily imagined. Again he felt
dissatisfied with the disguise he had assuined, and
anxious to exchange the plan for some other ; but
he could devise none, nor had he the means of put-
ting any other into execution, if even it had en-
tered his imagination.
Just as the castle clock struck eleven, he reached
the moat : his heart beat with rapture at beholding
the walls that enclosed his Rosalind ; but the possi-
bility of her having been already forced into the
arms of another, on the report of his death, suddenly
turned his tide of rapture into the most acute pain.
In a short time he saw a man approaching towards
the spot where he stood: he moved up to him, in
order to try what effect his disguise would produce
upon him; an exclamation of terror burst from his
lips, and he fled. Edward was thus satisfied that
his appearance was answerable to the expectation
which Hubert had formed of it; but he was sorry
that it had frightened away from him his old friend
Ambrose to whom he should have felt little reluct-
ance in confiding his secret.
The alarm which was occasioned to Ambrose,

and to the sentinel, Simon Williams, by their ob-
servation of a figure in armour wandering on the
outside of the castle walls, has already been men-
tioned, and its cause explained in what we have
just related of Edward. Suffice it to say, that after
having undergone the necessity of hiding himself
for three successive days in a cave with which he
was acquainted, in the neighbourhood of the castle,
on the fourth evening after his separation from his
friend Hubert, chance favoured him in his attempt
at crossing the drawbridge, after lord William and
his men had passed over it, at the time of their
setting out on their march against the advanced body
of Allanrod's troops.
The additional effects of terror which were pro-
duced on old Ambrose, and Philip Watkins, the
sentinel of the hour, at the foot of the bridge, by
beholding what they believed an aerial being, bear-
ing a resemblance in its countenance to the lost Ed-
ward, and disfigured with a bloody gash down its
left cheek, have also been detailed to our readers;
we have, therefore, in this place, only to speak
of Edward himself.
Not alone from the testimony which Edward had
received that the appearance of his person had
struck terror into the minds of all who beheld him,
but also from the observation he had made from his
spot of concealment hard by, that a large number
of the baron's soldiery had quitted the castle that
night, from which cause he knew that the ramparts
would be less thickly planted with sentinels than

they at other times were, he ventured boldly to
pursue his way towards a part of the glacis from
whence arose a portion of the rampart wall that en-
circled the terrace walk, upon which opened a door
communicating with the apartment that had at his
departure from the castle been occupied by Rosalind.
From the glacis he immediately began to climb
the intervening wall : the moment his head was
raised above it, his eyes fell on a female at a short
distance from him, which the glow of his heart in-
stantly informed him could be no other than the
mistress of his affections. Trembling with the emo-
tion raised in his breast by a variety of contending
feelings, he could not, on his first attempt to address
her, command his utterance at all; a second at-
tempt enabled him faintly to pronounce her name,
and the instant that she turned her head towards
the spot where he was stationed, he heard a door
open, and a voice, which the apprehension of a
discovery from an enemy prevented him from recog-
nizing to be Gertrude's, addressing her. Thus
fearful of detection, he immediately disappeared;
and when the return of silence encouraged him again
to ascend to the top of the wall, Rosalind was not
only gone, but the sentry of the night placed before
the turret through which lay the passage from the
rampart to her apartments.
Disappointed, but not discouraged, he turned
his thoughts to the reflection of where he should
conceal himself during the next day: he had now
passed the drawbridge, and the cave, which had

before been favourable to his retreat from observa-
tion during the hours of day, was no longer attain-
able. He remembered the communication leading
from the northern ramparts to the vaults beneath
the castle, and thence to the chapel, through which
his friend Hubert had conducted him to his conceal.
ed interviews with Rosalind, when he had stolen
by night away from the tower in the village. To
the privacy of these he resolved to commit himself ;
and having, with the use of the utmost caution and
slow proceeding, reached them without attracting
the observation of any individual, he believed him-
self, for a time at least, once more in safety.
The morning was already beginning to break, ere
Edward reached the interior of his hidingplace; he
therefore resolved not to emerge from it into any of
the avenues which led towards the chapel, till the
succeeding night should again have spread the veil
of darkness over the earth.
When the hollow-toned clock of the castle had
once more sounded the hour of midnight, Edward
directed his steps towards the chapel; the beams
of the moon peeping through various slender chasms
in the rocky ceiling of the vaults through which he
was moving, and gliding through the frame-work of
the decayed cloisters, which ran at intervals along
the side of his path, guided him to it. The full
disk of a resplendent moon shone through a spiral
window at one end of the building, and its refulgent
light rested on the altar at the opposite extremity.
The eye of Edward fell on it, and he stood for some

649
time resigned to an overpowering sensation which
filled his mind, as he gazed upon the shrine at which
he had become the husband of Rosalind.
Places where the most interesting events of our
lives have taken place, when beheld at any remote
period from the time of their happening, excite in
us sensations of the most acute nature. Imagination
places around them the same personages, causes
thern to react the same scenes which are impressed
upon our memory, and we encourage the delusion
with a warmth amounting almost to the real joy or
pain which we experienced at the memorable mo-
ments that have inscribed them on our recollection.
By Hubert Edward had been supplied with the
implements for striking a light, and by their means
he now applied himself to illumine one of the lamps,
of which there were always several dispersed about
in various niches in the walls, ready for burning on
any solemn occasion which required the evening use
of the chapel.
From the chapel he had resolved boldly to pursue
his way through the castle to the chamber of Ger-
trude, and having made himself known to her, em-
ploy her to announce his existence to his beloved
wife ; accordingly, the moment his lamp was light-
ed, he proceeded to the massive door which opened
into the passage communicating with the corridor
that led into the great hall of the castle.
To his severe disappointment, and contrary to
former custom, he found it locked, and impervious
to every attempt he made to open
ito

We have already said, that as the incursions of
the borderers became more determined, it had been
deemed dangerous to suffer it to remain unsecured,
and that, on this account, its key had been added
to the number of those which it was the duty of old
Ambrose, as the porter of the castle, to keep in his
custody.
In disappointment and reflection, Edward sunk
down upon the base of a pillar, which afforded a
resting-place for his harrassed and enervated frame.
After some time passed in thought, he recollected
that at the time of his quitting England, Rosalind
had been in the constant habit of praying, once in
the course of every revolving day, by the side of
her deceased mother's tomb: the intimate acquain-
tance which he had with the virtuous and steady
principles of her heart led him to suppose that the
calamities, which she had since that period been
doomed to experience, would, if possible, have
strengthened her constancy and fervour in her for-
mer habits of devotion; and thus assured, in his
own opinion, that there could not be the slightest
doubt of her accustomary visit to the grave of the
lady de Mowbray being performed in the course of
the following day, his first resolve was to remain
in the chapel till she should appear in it; but a lit-
tle further consideration pointing out to him that
she might come to it, attended by those over whose
conduct she might not have sufficient power to re-
strain them from bearing intelligence of his exist-
ence to his enemies, his final determination was to

place upon the marble tomb which enclosed the
ashes of the late baroness, the cross of rubies which
she had bequeathed to him by the name of mother,
and which he had vowed to Rosalind never to part
from but in death.
This cross he had constantly worn upon his breast,
from the first moment of his receiving it at the hand
of lord William, a short time after the death of the
lady de Mowbray; and he concluded it impossible
that Rosalind should not behold it, as she knelt in
devotion by the side of the tomb, and equally so
that she should not conclude its being placed there
a testimony of his existence, and of his not being
far distant from the spot where she should find it.
The issue of this plan, he doubted not, would be
her devising some means of seeing him alone in the
chapel, or of conveying to him instruction concern-
ing the conduct which it would be becoming in him
to pursue, for their mutual safety and happiness.
Thus resolved, he took the cross from the rib-
band by which it was suspended round his neck,
and having placed it upon a white speck of the
marble which composed the tomb, he returned again
to his concealment amidst the vaults.
Night after night, with increased anxiety, he
visited the chapel; and to his inexpressible aston-
ishment and grief, the cross was still unmoved
from the situation in which he had placed it. This
repeated disappointment of his highly-raised hope
of beholding his cross exchanged for some token
placed on the spot for him to find by the hand of his

652 MYSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER,
Rosalind, rendered him not alone uncertain what
to conjecture of her fate, but equally so how it be-
came him to proceed for gaining any information
concerning her, or obtaining an interview with her.
To this end his soul was day and night upon the
rack of thought; but in every point of view in
which he could place it, the idea of his emerging
from his present concealment, or attempting to en-
ter into conversation with any of the inhabitants of
the castle, appeared so replete with danger both to
himself and the wife of his affections, that he was
compelled to decide it an insurmountable necessity
for him to keep himself a close prisoner in the vaults,
till he should either again see Hubert, or receive
intelligence from him.
At parting, Hubert had informed him that their
next meeting would be at De Mowbray Castle, al-
though he had not fixed any time when that meeting
was to be expected: earnestly he prayed that his
arrival might not be long protracted ; and as he
doubted not, let Hubert come to the castle in what
character he might, that the story of an alarming
spectre having passed the drawbridge would reach
his ear, and be to him sufficient information that
his master was secreted in some part of the fabric,
the hardships of his case were somewhat softened
by the assurance that Hubert would lose no time
in discovering his retreat, and console him at least
with his friendship, if it was not in his power to
conduct him to the happiness at which he aspired.
To the wretchedness of his mind were added

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 653
bodily inconveniences, which heightened the un-
pleasantness of his situation; his bed was of no
softer material than the uneven clods of earth which
compesed the floor of the vaults, and his provisions
such as he contrived by night to steal from a store-
house near the entrance to the vaults from the
rampart, where bread of the coarsest kind was pil-
ed on the days of its being baked at the castle,
against it should be fetched away by a person ap-
pointed for that purpose, to the tower of strength
in the village, for the use of the soldiery it contained.
It will be remembered that Rosalind visited the
chapel on the morning succeeding the departure of
her father from De Mowbray Castle; and that
morning, it will be perceived, was the one previous
to the night in which Edward placed his cross upon
the tomb of the deceased baroness. In the course
of this very night occurred the illness of Gertrude,
which our readers have already been informed with-
held Rosalind for seventeen mornings from paying
her accustomed devotions in the chapel: on the
eighteenth, the amendment of Gertrude's health
was such, that she again repaired to that spot where
her devotions were performed with the greatest
satisfaction to her own mind. With her finding
the cross, and her subsequent resolution of visiting
the chapel by night, at the hour she had, previously
to her marriage, been accustomed to meet Edward
in it, our readers are also acquainted, and with the
sudden discovery of the approach of the freebooters

to an attack upon the castle, at the moment she
had reached the greatshall in her way towards it.
At the same moment of time that Rosalind was
descending from her chamber, Edward, who did
not relaxin his nightly visits to the chapel, although
increasing disappointment alone marked the periods
of his entering it, made the joyful discovery of his
cross being removed from the spot where he had
placed it; but scarcely had the rapture which had
been admitted at his eyes communicated itself to his
heart, ere his ears were assailed by the blast of the
trumpets blown from the advanced body of the ene-
my, and replied to by similar sounds from the heights
of the castle.
For a time he supposed that the sounds might
predict the return of that body of men whom he
had seen march from the castle on the night in
which he had gained a passage over the drawbridge;
but when the clangour of contending arms ran
through the air, with the discovery of his error he
felt himself entirely at a loss to decide what could be
the cause of its present hostilities, as he did not
suppose that the audacity of the moss-troopers had
arisen to a sufficient height to encourage them to
hazard a regular attack, such as he could discover
that which was now passing to be.
A prey to the most torturing suspense of mind,
Edward wandered about the chapel—a thousand
different ideas crowding into his brain, a thousand
various plans entering his imagination, and un-

655
decided which to select, or indeed whether it be-
came him to put any one of them into execution or
not: at one moment, trembling for the safety of
his Rosalind, he resolved to rush boldly into the
castle, to search her out, and present himself as her
lawful champion; at another, he determined to issue
from the vaults, and ascertain who were the enemies
of the castle : cooler reflection then represented to
him that he had not the power of entering the castle
walls, and that by issuing out from the vaults, he
should expose himself, without the possibility of
benefit accruing either to himself or his Rosalind
from such an exposure, to the fire and arrows of
the soldiers upon its walls.
At length he recollected that from a dormitory,
now ruinous and in disuse, behind the chancel of
the chapel, there had once been a communication
with a small bastion, which had been a spot of de-
fence to the building in its monastic state, but
which was now entirely neglected, since it had be-
come a regularly.fortified castle. To this he resolv-
ed, if possible, to trace out his way, in the hope of
obtaining from it a view of the contest which was
passing without, and which he considered, by his
being able to form a judgment of it only from the

his imagination.
w With some difficulty he found the steps, the en-
trance to which he had once before seen, but never
yet attempted to ascend; the iron hand of time had
so far misshapen and despoiled them of their former

properties, that no one, without the spur of feel-
ings like those by which Edward was at the moment
actuated, could have made his way up the ascent
which they had once afforded; with much time and
labour he effected it. On looking out from the
ruined bastion, he found the day already to be ris-
ing, and the contention of arms to have ceased; his
situation was not a favourable one for viewing the
ramparts, being too much confined within the
walls of the castle; and as the enemy were not
visible without the moat, he concluded them con-
querers, and already within the building.—“Al-
mighty God, preserve my Rosalindl” burst in qui-
vering accents from his lips; and scarcely had the
exclamation escaped them, ere he perceived a vehi-
cle, which was drawn by four horses, and attended
by some men on horseback, passing over the draw-
bridge. A secret instinct, inexplicable, except it
be that every circumstance of which we know not
the exact cause gives us additional anxiety for the
safety of those about whose fate we are uncertain
and at the same time most anxious, instantly caus-
ed Edward to believe his Rosalind confined in the
carriage he had seen; and without any decided plan
in view, he made a hasty effort to retrace his way
from the bastion to the dormitory below; and in-
cautious with regard to the ruinous path he had to
tread, he fell, and his head struck with such vio-
lence against the wall of the turrett, through which
he was descending, that the blow deprived him of
all sense.

When Edward recovered the power of recollection,
and again raised himself upon his feet, the first
sound which he heard was the castle clock striking
the ninth hour of the morning; and when its hollow
tones had died away upon the air, a solemn silence
prevailed. He returned to the chapel, and his eye
falling upon the altar, he found it despoiled of the
tripod lamps of silver which had before stood on
marble pedestals on the sides of the sacramental
table; and the golden eagle, upon which the sacred
volume had hitherto been supported, was likewise
gone: and these observations convinced him that
whosoever had been the enemies of De Mowbray
Castle,' theirs had been the victory.
He moved towards the door of the chapel leading
into the body of the castle ; he found it burst from
the lock, and standing open. He approached it,
and as he stood listening with eager desire to catch
some sound which might convey to him information
whether or not the enemy had yet quitted the place,

he leaned for support upon the open door, for a
faint sickness oppressed him; and although he at
present felt little anguish from the blow which he
had received upon his head, he was sensible of an
aching numbness, which seemed to be the forerun-
ner of much acute pain.
For above two hours he continued to wander at
the distance of a few feet from the door of the chapel,
near the entrance into the vaulted corridor leading
into the great hall of the castle; and as no sound,
either within the building, or on its exterior, met
his ear, save the periodical voice of the clock, he
began to imagine the castle deserted; for even in
his concealment in the vaults, he had scarcely ever
passed five minutes together without some sound
reaching him, either from the sentinels on the walls,
the closing of doors within the castle, or similar
causes of noise.
Another hour, passed in the same uninterrupted
stillness, convinced him that the inhabitants were
fled, and he began to proceed towards the marble
hall; arrived there, the same scene of devastation,
which we have already described lord William to
have witnessed on his return to his castle from the
stronghold of the freebooter Allanrod, met the eye
of Edward,
With grief and astonishment he contemplated the
scene before him: how altered the appearance of all
around him, since those happy days when he had
lived the friend of Rosalind, and the friend of the
baron! He ascended to her chamber, and it af.

forded him a slender gratification to behold the
various articles of furniture which it contained,
with most of which he had, as it were, an intimate
acquaintance, and which still remained in their ac-
customed places, having been considered of too
little value by the enemy to be made part of their
pillage.
Burning with thirst, for the fever into which the
agitation of his mind had thrown his blood was in-
creased by the pain which was the consequence of
his fall, he descended into a lower part of the build-
ing, and proceeded towards a marble cistern, at the
extremity of one of the corridors branching out from
the great hall; the gilt cups which had been wont
to be found in the basin had been rent by the de-
spoilers of the castle from the light chains by which
they had for years past been fastened to it, and Ed-
ward, taking off his casque, received into it the
grateful stream for which his parched throat panted.
As he raised his eyes from the casque after his
draught, they fell upon the figure of a man in an
attitude of surprise, at the opposite extremity of
the passage, who almost instantly uttered an ex-
clamation of alarm, and fled.
Scarcely had the man disappeared, ere Edward
recollected both his countenance and his name; he
was the very Philip Watkins who had been the sen-
tinel at the drawbridge on the night that Edward
had passed over it in his disguise, and as Edward
was still in the same suit of armour, with the same
representation of a streak of blood marked upon his

left cheek, he was not much surprised to find that
Philip fled from him ; what most surprised him
was, that he alone should be remaining in the cas-
tle when every other inhabitant appeared to have
fled from it.
It had so chanced, that on the night of the free-
booters' attack upon the castle of De Mowbruy,
Philip Watkins had been the sentinel at the watch-
tower; at the approach of the enemy, he had exert-
ed his lungs with due effect, and blown a hearty
blast of alarm to the inhabitants of the castle ; and
whether he conceived that he had performed all his-
duty in so doing, or whether he had any particular
aversion to oppose the enemy with more substantial
efforts than the wind which he had sent at them
through his trumpet, is not exactly ascertained-
all we are informed of the business is, that when the
attack was over, and the castle had surrendered to
the enemy, Philip was still safe and snug in his
watch-tower, from whence he had seen such of his
comrades as had fallen in the contest, buried be-
neath a tumulus cast up for that purpose on the out-
side of the walls, and those who had survived led
away prisoners by the conquering party. I
The same vaulted passage or corridor, at the ex-
tremity of which was the cistern, led also to the
kitchens of the castle, and towards them Philip was
proceeding, in order to examine whether the free-
booters had left him a dinner ; his first glimpse of
Edward filled him with terror, but scarcely had he
fled from him, when recollecting that he had always

heard it affirmed that spirits never were visible ex-
cept by night, he assumed courage to take a second
look. For this purpose he returned cautiously to
the
passage,
and the moment he again appeared in
sight, Edward hailed him.
“You are Edward alive!-Are you not Edward
himself alive ?” replied Philip to his exclamation.
Edward advanced hastily towards him. “ Yes,
I am,” he said ; "keep my secret, and you have
nothing to fear from me; but should you disclose
it, you may work my ruin, and thus merit my re-
sentment.”
Alas !” replied Philip,
" there is no one left
within these walls for me to communicate it to;
wheresoever you may have been concealed about
them, you must have heard the attack that has been
made during the night; all the survivors of the
siege are the prisoners of the freebooter Allanrod.”
“ Allanrod !” exclaimed Edward, for the seducer
of the bonny Mabel immediately recurred to his
memory, as did the epithet of' robber,' which laird
Archibald Glenross had given him: “ Allanrod !".
he repeated.
Philip immediately began to explain the terror
which this mysterious freebooter had, for some time
past, been to the English borders, and to recount:
lord William's marching against him, and the ill
success which, it was conjectured, from his not hay-
ing since that time returned to his castle, had at-
tended his expedition ; but Edward, scarcely listen-
ing to his words, or permitting him to utter them,

urged the most impatient inquiries after his Rosalind.
With astonishment he heard from Philip the en-
mity which had broken out between lord William
and lord Rufus de Madginecourt, and with rapture
did he learn that no other suitor had been forced
upon her by her father: but the tide of joy which
filled his heart on gaining this information was
quiekly turned into an opposite feeling, upon the
recollection that she was now the prisoner of the
infamous, the villanous Allanrad-perhaps already
the victim of his lust, or loaded with chains within
his stronghold ; and with the wildness of delirium
he expressed aloud his apprehensions.
Philip Watkins was one of those to whom Ed-
ward had in his boyish days been indebted for his
first knowledge of military exercises: when the sol-
diers of the castle had been drawn out on the ram-
parts for inspection or exercise, Philip had often
indulged him, by suffering him to bear his pike
for a short time on his shoulder, and sometimes
had given him a lesson in the management of the
crossbow. These kindnesses had made an impres
sion on the heart of Edward ; and when the baron,
some years after, doubled the nuniber of his troops,
as the incursiors of the moss-troopers became more
formidable, Edward procured for Philip an ad-
vance in his profession, which Philip had ever felt
pleasure in acknowledging that he owed to the in-
dulgence he had shewn Edward when a boy.
So great had been the esteem in which the ur-
banity of Edward's manners and the benevolence of

663
his heart had caused him to be held at De Mowbray
Castle, that at the time of the false intelligence of
his death being circulated in it, few of its house-
hold did not let fall a tear to his memory; and
amongst the most sinceré mourners for his fate,
next to his afflicted wife, one in particular had been
Philip Watkins : his joy, therefore, at seeing him
still alive, was at least equal to the sorrow he had
felt for his supposed death ; and he instantly de-
manded how he could be of use to him, declaring
himself entirely devoted to his service.
Edward remembered, with equal satisfaction as
Philip bore it in his memory, the intimacy which
had subsisted between them, when he was about
half the length of the pike which he had been so
emulous of handling; and Philip being, besides, al-
most the only person whom he had ever heard
Hubert speak of as an honest fellow, he felt no
repugnance, situated as they both were at that
moment, to give him a short sketch of what had
befallen him since his departure from England.

ventures to interest Philip in his fate now, if
thou wouldst indeed serve me, devise some means
for bringing me into the presence of my Rosalind;

of the freebooter Allanrod."
Philip repeated, that howsoever it was in his
power to serve him, he might command him.--He
then proceeded to inform Edward, that he did not

believe the lady Rosalind had been conducted to
the fortress of the borderers : from his elevated
situation in the watch-tower, he had, he said, been
able to command an extensive view of the country.
She had, as Edward had imagined, been carried
away from the castle in the vehicle which he had
seen pass over the drawbridge ; but it had proceed-
ed towards the south, inanexactly opposite direction
to the tract followed by the victorious freebooters,
when they had borne off in triumph their prisoners
and spoil-they had moved directly north, and
from the north they likewise had marched when he
had first beheld them in the night, approaching to
their attack upon the castle ; it therefore appeared
to him, he said, that the lady Rosalind had, by the
order of the chief of the horde, been conveyed to
some place less repugnant to the feelings of a deli-
cate' female than the fortress of a banditti must have
proved to them, where it was his design to detain
her till a ransom was offered for her person.
All the haunts of the moss-troopers were known
to be upon the borders of the Scottish kingdom-
few had even ventured to settle themselves upon the
confines of England: the idea accordingly formed
by Philip, of Rosalind's destination, appeared pro-
bable to Edward, and he immediately expressed his
wish to 'endeavour to trace out the road by which
shc had journeyed, in order that he might learn the
spot wbere she was detained, and, if possible, by
his presence, corroborate that idea of his being
still in existence,' which he doubted not she must

have conceived upon finding his cross on the tomb
of her mother; and that by her the cross had been
removed from the spot where he had placed it,
Inilip had convinced him, by assuring him that no
one but herself ever entered the chapel, except on
the Sunday.
All carriages were at that time so rare throughout
the kingdom, especially in the more remote north-
ern counties, that Philip did not despair of very
easily gaining information where such a one had
passed, provided its route had been taken within
view of any of the cottages or sheepfolds, which
were scattered about the country.
Accordingly, having prevailed on Edward to take
some refreshment (to induce him to allot a portion
of his care to the hurt he had received on his head,
and which was now so much swelled as to prevent
him from wearing his casque, he was unable), they
set out, Edward having thrown a plain surtout over
his suit of armour, and put upon his head a sol-
dier's bonnet as a substitute for his casque.
For more than two leagues they were able to pro-
ceed from the observations which Philip had made
upon vehicle in its progress from his situation
in the watch-tower, which were greatly assisted by
the track of the wheels, which was discernible on
the sandy roads over which it had passed. Early
in the evening, Philip prevailed on his companion
to stop for the night at an hospitable cottage, which
afforded them accommodation as weary travellers, and
whose owner, at the entreaty of Philip, called in a

neighbour who had some little skill in surgery, and
who applied a healing medicine to the bruise on
Edward's head, of which he was himself too care-
less for his own safety ; so true is it, that the wounds
of the body are not felt, at least not regarded, when
he who bears them suffers at the same moment un.
der any mental calamity.
Pursuing their journey on the following day, by
the information which they were able to gather from
the shepherds, who had seen the vehicle which they
described pass their folds, and, at intervals, as-
sisted by the marks which the wheels had left of
their passage, towards evening they came up with
a party of pilgrims, who were returning to their
homes from a pilgrimage they had been making to
the lady at Walsingham, and whom, with their
minstrels and some other travellers who had joined
company with them, in order that their number
might prove a defence to them against the free-
booters, of whom there was a general terrorthrough-
out the northern parts of the kingdom, they found
seated on the side of a shady hill, regaling them-
selves on the contents of their wallets.
With the hospitality customary to their profes-
sion, the pilgrims invited Edward and his compa-
nion to partake of their homely fare: they were
faint with travelling, and readily accepted the offer-
ed kindness. Whilst they sat amongst them, it
entered the imagination of Edward, that any dis-
guise must be preferable for him to attempt gaining
an interview with his Rosalind in, to the suit of ar.

667
mour which he now wore, and which might render
him, he judged, a suspicious character to her
guards; accordingly, producing some of the gold
with which Hubert had, at their last parting, fur-
nished him, he privately offered a couple of pieces
to one of the pilgrims, who had informed him that
he had now but one more day's journey to his house,
in exchange for his robe, his staff, and his hat.
The pilgrim had no objection to so advantageous a
sale of articles of which he sincerely hoped he should
never stand in need again, and the bargain was
without hesitation struck.
Having equipped himself, Edward endeavoured
to make a similar purchase for Philip, but no other
of the pilgrims was sufficiently near home to autho-
rize his quitting the dress of his present profession;
and therefore he found his desired end of habiting
his companion like himselfunattainable: but Philip,
entering into Edward's idea, meanwhile made so
successful a suit, by the powerful argument of gold,
to one of the minstrels, who he found loved money
better than music, even in the holy service of light-
ening their way to journeying pilgrims, which was
his avocation, that he obtained of him the promise
of a spare doublet and cloak, with which he was
furnished in a knapsack at his back, and likewise
a lute, in playing upon which Philip possessed
some little skill; and he judged that it might not
prove an unacceptable passport for them to the pri-
son of the lady Rosalind, if she was at the present
nament the inhabitant of one. Accordingly, hav-

ing made his agreement with the young minstrel,
he applied to Edward for the purchase-money of his
new accoutrements; and Edward having rewarded
the minstrel as liberally as he had done the pilgrim,
the lad, on seeing the money, said—“Indeed you
have the worst of the bargain, for I shall reach my
own town to-morrow, where I can buy all the same
articles I have sold to you for two-thirds of the
price you have paid me for them.”
“The better luck for thyself,” said Philip, satis-
fied that Edward's wish had been gratified in the
obtaining of their disguises; and they then bade
farewell to the party of travellers by whom they
had been regaled, and set forward.
About noon, on the fourth day after their quit-
ting De Mowbray Castle, as they ascended an emin-
ence in the road, the sea, at a short distance, burst
upon them; and Edward, on perceiving it, began
to suppose that they must, after all, have pursued
a wrong track. Whilst they were in debate toge-
ther, some villagers of different sexes approached
them, dressed in what appeared their holiday ap-
parel. Philip addressed them, for it had been
agreed between him and Edward, that lest Edward
should in his speech betray himself to suspicion,
he should pass for the dumb brother of his compa-
nion.—“What castle is that ?” asked Philip.
“Rockmount,” they replied, “the castle of lord
Rufus de Madginecourt.” -
Edward gave an involuntary start at the sound.
“We are all going thither,” rejoined one of the

ſemales, to celebrate the birthday of the old
housekceper, dame Edith, who is to-day one bun-
dred years old.”
Then, I suppose, my lord himself is not at the
castle ?” inquired Philip.
“ I don't know,” replied the female who had be-
fore spoken.
“ But I do,” cried one of the males : “ lord Ru-
fus left it this day, at early morn, and it is thought
that he is gone to London, to ask our queen's ad-
vice about a young lady that he has rescued from a
band of moss-troopers.
" The queen's advice !” said Philip.
Ay,” returned the man, “ the young lady
whom he delivered from her enemies is our graci-
ous queen's own goddaughter: her name is De
Mowbray, the daughter of the richest and greatest
noble in all Cumberland."
This act of humanity, on the part of the hitherto
unfeeling De Madginecourt, to the woman who had
slighted his addresses, was surprising information
to Edward; it exceeded all the enigmas in which
his life had hitherto been involved.
Perhaps,” said Philip, as there is to be a
merry meeting at the castle, a little of my music
would prove acceptable ; and it would be a great
charity done to my poor brother and myself, if they
would admit us for a short time within its walls."
Oh, I doubt not but ye will be welcome,” re-
plied the young man ;
" I have interest with the

old housekeeper's niece, who is one of the domes-
tics, and you shall have my recommendation.”
They trudged on towards the castle; the villagers
walked boldly over the drawbridge, telling Edward
and Philip to remain at its foot, till they had given
intimation of them at the castle, saying that they
would shortly return and inform them whether their
presence would be agreeable within it.
The few minutes that Edward and his companion
were left alone, they passed in imperfect surmises
on the unaccountable information they had just re-
ceived, of Rosalind being under the protection of
lord Rufus de Madginecourt: thankful, however,
that he had gained knowledge of the place of her
retreat, all Edward at the present moment desired
was permission to enter the walls within which she
was enclosed.
In a very short time, the young peasant who had
promised to be their advocate with the servants of
the castle, returned, at the head of about a dozen
of them, who gave the supposed minstrel and his
brother a most cordial invitation to enter, and con-
ducted them to the great hall, where they were to
be regaled with dame Edith's treat.
Philip Watkins was but an indifferent performer
on an instrument, and the voice with which he ac-
companied it was by no means one of the best, but
he was well stored in old ballads and romances, and,
luckily for him, it appeared that his audience infi-
nitely preferred the matter which was sung to the

671
manner in which it was executed; thus he proved
exactly the musician suited to their taste. What
most puzzled him were the questions which they
were continually asking of him concerning his bro-
ther-as, whence arose his dumbness ?-whither
he was conducting him ?-and various other inqui-
ries of the like nature.
When the night began to advance, Philip excus-
ed himself from singing any more, saying that he
was exhausted with the amusement he had already
given them, but that if they would suffer him and
his brother to sleep at the castle that night, he
would willingly play and sing to them the whole of
the next day, if it gave them pleasure. To these
terms they agreed with much satisfaction, and Phi-
lip and Edward were accordingly served with their
supper, and shewn to a chamber.
Concealed under his pilgrim's garb, Edward still
wore the suit of armour which had been provided
for him by Hubert. Beneath the roof of lord Rufus
de Madginecourt, where it was probable to suppose
that the villanous Alwin was existing, he consider-
ed that the supernatural appearance which he had
assumed on his entrance into De Mowbray Castle,
was, of all other places, the one most likely for
him to derive the safeguard from it which he de-
sired it to afford him : the present night, he also
reflected, might be the only one which he should
have the liberty of passing within the walls of Rock-
mount ; thus, if he did not use the passing hour for
venturing forth into the castle in quest of the apart-

ment of his Rosalind, he might lose the only oppor-
tunity that would ever be granted for endeavouring
to gain an interview with her.
Acting under this idea, the moment he believed
the inhabitants of the castle retired to rest, he is-
sued from his chamber; he had no clue by which to
guide his steps, save a single expression which had
fallen from the lips of dame Edith on quitting her
guests.--"I must now,” she had said, return
to my charge in the western gallery.”—This charge
he could not doubt to be Rosalind, and therefore
towards the western gallery he resolved to bend his
course.
Contrary to the opinion which Edward had form-
ed, previously to his quitting his chamber, of all
the castle being already locked in sleep, he had
proceeded but a very little way in his search of the
western gallery, before the sound of voices struck
his ear; and before he had time to decide from
whence they had proceeded, a door opposite to him
was opened, and from it issued about half a dozen
of the domestics, in the act of leading to bed two
of their fellows, for the strength of whose brains
the mead with which dame Edith had regaled them
had proved of too potent a nature.
Edward was immediately seen by one of the par-
ty, who, with a dreadful outcry, proclaimed his
cause of terror to the rest : the cries of fear burst
from every mouth—those who were able fled, and
those who required support in their movements fell
to the ground.

673
Not doubting that an alarm would be raised
throughout tne castle, Edward, with all precipi-
tancy, returned to his chamber, and giving Philip
a hasty command to preserve silence, he drew on
his pilgrim's habit, blew out his lamp, and threw
himself upon his bed.
The stillness of the mansion continued unbroken,
no sound reaching the chamber of Edward and his
companion but the hoarse voice of the waves, which
beat against the rock it stood upon, and Edward
began to suppose that the domestics had not aroused
any of their fellows in consequence of the alarm
they had experienced from beholding him, but he
durst not again venture to quit his chamber that
night, upon the same business which had before
led him from it, and he lay beseeching Philip to
exert himself to the utmost on the following day to
entertain the servants, in order to give them a
chance of being invited to pass a second night in
the castle,
As soon as they arose in the morning, a relation
was given of the horrible apparition which had
been seen by a party of the servants in the night,
and Edward could scarcely refrain from a smile at
the many exaggerations with which the simple fact
was now increased into the most terrific of all ter-
rible histories. To dame Edith the story was also
recounted, and by her, it will be remembered that
intelligence of what had been seen was conveyed to
Rosalind, who experienced some degree of surprise
at the similarity of the appearance to that which had

a short time before been witnessed at De Mowbray
Castle, still little suspecting how nearly the interest
of herself and the spectre were connected.
Philip took advantage of the impression which
the story of the spectre had made on the minds of
the inhabitants of Rockmount Castle, and sung to
them many monkish traditions of ghosts and gob-
lins, which, to his desire, brought on evening
again without any hint having been given to him
and his nominal brother to quit the place; accord-
ingly, he petitioned that they might have leave given
them to retire to their resting-place of the former
night, for which permission was scarcely granted
them ere a great bustle was occasioned in the castle
by the return of lord Rufus and those who had at-
tended him in his expedition.
The pleasure with which Edward had looked for-
ward to the hour of retiring to rest was entirely
overthrown at the arrival of the anticipated period,
for he then found that a second bed, in the eham-
ber where he and Philip Watkins had reposed on
the preceding night, was to be occupied by two of
the grooms who had returned to the castle along
with lord Rufus. Thus circumstanced, he per-
ceived that it would be impossible for him to repeat
the attempt in which he had on the foregoing night
failed, with any hope of greater success attending
upon it, and he lay stretched on his pallet, a vic-
tim to the agonies of despair. He considered that
as soon as the morning should arise, and they should
again descend into the hall of the castle, they would

be told to depart, and thus every chance of his de-
sired end in coming thither cut off At one mo-
ment he resolved boldly to stalk forth in his dis-
guise, and enter the presence of lord Rufus and his
villanous associate, Alwin : he doubted not but that
his appearance would strike terror to their souls,
and wring from their lips a confession of the mur-
der which they believed themselves to have com-
nuitted ; but he at the same time reflected that the
deceit could not long pass upon their senses, and
that the spot he was now on was one which would,
of all others, be the most favourable to his enemies
for completing the purpose in which they had once
been foiled, and this reflection withheld him from
venturing into their presence.
When they arose in the morning, and returned
to the hall of the kitchen, the first words they heard
from the domestics informed them, that an enemy
was shortly expected to besiege the castle, and that
every preparation was to be made within it, with
all speed and industry, for repelling the attack.
Philip inquired who the dreaded enemy was.
“The united bands of the moss-troopers,” was
the reply, “who had vowed vengeance against
lord Rufus de Madginecourt, for having rescued
the lady Rosalind de Mowbray from Allanrod, who
was one of the most esteemed chiefs.”
Again Edward was thrown into astonishment, by
hearing lord Rufus named as the protector of his
Rosalind.—" Could it be possible,” he reflected,
“that Rosalind would submit to owe her protection

to the man who had been the cause of all her mise-
ry in life—now, too, when enmity had broken out
between him and her father?”—The mystery which
he had before been unable to solve was now become
still more obscure; the only thing of which he was
certain was, that if lord Rufus was indeed the true
friend of his Rosalind, there remained no doubt,
from the attempt which had been made to take
away his life, that he was still his decided enemy,
and this conviction made him infinitely more sus-
picious of the friendship which he was making a
display of rendering her. -
“ If the freebooters are advancing from their
strongholds to an attack upon this castle,” rejoined
Philip, “I pray you to permit us to remain within
its walls till the contest be decided, for our road
lies north, and should we encounter them, little as
it is that we have to be plundered of, I very much
fear that they would not spare us; I beseech you,
therefore, kind masters, to let us abide here till we
can proceed with more safety.”
His petition produced the desired effect; the ser-
vants took pity upon him and his helpless brother,
as they considered Edward, and consented to their
remaining at the castle till after the siege.
During the course of the two following days,
Philip, in his intercourse with the domestics, lost
no opportunity of introducing into his conversation
the name of the lady Rosalind, and endeavouring
to gain some tidings concerning her; but all he
could gather relative to her was, that lord Rufus

had declared he would sooner part with his life or his
liberty himself than surrender her into the hands
of the freebooter Allanrod, and that the servants had
discovered that she no longer inhabited the apart-
ments in the western gallery, which had been set
apart for her use on her first arrival at Rockmount;
and that, from the little fear which their lord testi-
fied for her personal safety during the threatened
siege, and the sudden disappearance of dame Edith,
and her grand-nephew, Zachary, from the inha-
bited parts of the building, they conjectured her
to have retired, at the advice of lord Rufus, for
protection to some subterraneous vaults on the left of
the castle, in which, they said, there were an apart-
ment or two, which had formerly been fitted up
as a dwelling.
The moment the arrival of the freebooters on the
outside of the castle called its inhabitants from the
interior parts of the walls and ramparts, in order
to repel the attempts of the besiegers to subdue
it, Edward and his companion, left without any
observers of their actions, immediately began to
search for the entrance into the subterranean vaults,
of which the servants had spoken to Philip Watkins.
They proceeded towards the left, in which di-
rection the conversation of the servants had in-
formed them lay the object of their search, and,
after some time, they discovered a long and vaulted
passage, growing gradually narrower as they drew
towards its extremity, and which, from the singula-
rity of its form tallying with the description which

theirkitchen friends had given of the entrance of the
vaults, they could not doubt to be the same of
which they had spoken. But when they had
reached the end, although assisted in their search by
the light of a lamp borne by Philip, no door was
discoverable in the wainscot, although the hollow
sound which it returned to a blow struck upon it
by the hand of Edward, convinced them that there
was an extensive vacancy beyond it.
It has been already said, in a foregoing part of
this history, that the door which formed the en-
trance into the subterraneous vaults leading to the
grotto, opened with a spring; with the situation of
this spring Edward and his companion were unac-
quainted, and, without possessing this knowledge,
it was utterly impossible that they should gain ac-
cess to them. Still, although unsuccessful in their
attempts, they did not relax in their endeavours to
effect a passage into the subterraneous dwelling,
nor could Edward endure the idea of quitting the
spot over which Hope stretched out her balmy
pinions.
At length the tumult of the war ceased, and the
riot of conquest was heard pouring through the cas-
tle. In a very short time, several members of the
freebooters’ band appeared in the vaulted passage,
bearing flambeaux; they passed by Edward and
Philip, with a sneer upon them, as cowards who
had skulked into this recess for safety during the
siege, and bursting their way, with the butt-ends
of their matchlocks, through the wainscot pannel-
ling, they entered the vaults.

The heart of Edward now turned to ice in his
breast, the most agonizing of human sensations
assailed his brain; the moment was approaching at
which his Rosalind might be lost to him for ever,
and, still more torturing idea, he might be a wit-
ness of her misery, without the power to save her.
These reflections were but the transitions of a mo-
ment; he was awakened from them by the voice of
one of the freebooters, who appeared to possess
some degree of command over his fellows, and who
called to them to return quietly to the great hall
of the castle, and to remain there till he should
announce to them that the lady Rosalind was be-
come the wife of their chief, to be a witness to
the solemnization of which ceremony he was him-
self going to proceed to the chapel.
Edward formed the instant determination of fol-
lowing his steps ; the darkness of the hour favoured
his design, and he moved along securely in the
shade, guided by the rays of the lamp carried in the
hand of the freebooter, in whose path he trod.
Arrived at the chapel, he secreted himself behind a
tomb, by raising his head above which he could
command a view of the altar, at which he saw
the priest already standing.
Resolved to make an effort for the preservation
of his Rosalind, even though his life should be the
price at which he made it, he considered that, alone,
opposed to a body of savage freebooters, with whom
the spilling of his blood would not be a feather's
weight in the scale of those enormities which

marked their character, the only chance on which he
could rely for being able to afford assistance to his
Rosalind, or ensure safety to himself, must be the
effect of the disguise which was concealed beneath
his pilgrim'sgarb, and which he entertained a slight
hope might produce the same terrific effect on the
freebooters which it had done on the servants of the
castle. It was, however, alast hope to preserve the
honour of a beloved and suffering wife, and he
resolved to hazard. Accordingly, he threw off his
pilgrim's habit and hat, and replaced on his head
the casque corresponding with his suit of armour,
which he had worn slung by his side, and concealed
beneath the folds of his garment, during his resi-
dence in Rockmount Castle. He was still possessed
of the crimson dye with which the gash on his left
cheek had been represented; and having found that
those who had been alarmed by him in his dis-
guise had been most terrified by the streak of blood
down the side of his face, he again applied the li-
quid to his countenance, in the same situation as
before, and, this done, he awaited, with the most
torturing anxiety, the approach of his Rosalind and
the villanous Allanrod.
At length the dreadful moment arrived at which
he beheld his Rosalind-that Rosalind so tenderly
beloved, and on whose adored image his desiring
eyes had not rested for five long years, led into
the chapel by two of the banditti. Scarcely had
she reached the altar, ere, from the other extremity
of the chapel, advanced a figure of height and

strength, whose habit would have bespoke him to
be Allanrod, had he not moved to the altar, and
taken the hand of Rosalind in his, as the treasure
which the voice of the priest was to make his own.
“Second my endeavours, thouprotecting God of
the innocent and oppressed t” Edward breathed
forth in silent prayer; and, darting towards the
altar, he rushed between the wife of his sacred
affections and the villain who was about to rob him
of his earthly paradise. The protecting God of the
innocent and oppressed did second the endeavours
of him who had prayed to him in agony of heart,
for even the savage Allanrod and his bloody horde
shrunk back, appalled with supernatural dread as
they beheld him; and Edward, snatching to his
arms the only blessing of his existence, bore her,
with the rapidity of lightning, from the presence
of her astonished enemies.

CHAPTER V.
I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
Hadst thou but sheok thy head, or made a pause,
When I spoke darkly what I purposed,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fear in me;
But thou didst understand me by my signs,
And didst in signs again parley with sin,
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And, consequently, thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
KING John.
We now return to the lord baron de Mowbray, whom
we left extended, in the acutest agonies of mind, on
a couch, in the sable gloom of the funeral chamber,
in his despoiled castle. To those whose hearts are
rent with remorse, it is an imaginary relief to pour
forth their souls in exclamations bespeaking the
wretchedness of their feelings. Thus impressed, or
rather almost insensible that sounds proceeded from
his lips, lord William raved forth the racking sen-
sations of his breast.—“Oh that the child of my
Rosalind had been spared by me!” he exclaimed;
“the miseries which have fallen upon me and my
house had not then, perhaps, overwhelmed me—
the stings of conscience which I now feel had not
then pricked my bleeding heart—I might have

risen from the calamities brought upon me by an
unjust foe, to future peace of mind-But now, oh
God! oh merciful Providence! when, when shall the
murderer taste peace ?”
“When his crime is expiated by death!" exlaimed
a voice.
The baron sprang from his couch, but his lips
refused their office, and he sunk down again upon
it: he turned his eyes around the apartment, and
they fell upon a dusky substance which was approach-
ing slowly towards him from the dark shades which
enveloped the opposite end of the chamber.-—" Who
art thou ?” he fearfully demanded.
Hubert,” returned the voice.
“ Hubert !” echoed De Mowbray ;
" art thou
living, or hast thou forsaken the confines of the
grave, to burst upon my miseries with thy fearful
sight ?”
The figure approached close to the baron, and
the remaining light of day was just sufficient to
shew him the features of the living Hubert.
" Alive I am,” replied Hubert, " but I come to
thee resolved on death."
“ If it is my life thou seekest,” returned lord
William, “ take it-I am sunk so low into the
abyss of misery, that it will not cost me one pang
to yield it to thee."
No, no,” rejoined Hubert,“ it is no second
murder that I seek to do ; the death which I demand
is a forfeiture of existence due to justice, the only
expiation of guilt which this world can grant, the

only act which can make me quit it devoid of the
horrors which a murderer's conscience is so justly
cursed with. Are you prepared to die ?”
“ I know not what you mean," replied De Mow-
bray; " I tell you take my life freely—you refuse
to stain your hands with my blood, and still demand
of me if I am prepared for death."
• Death on the scaffold I mean, ” exclaimed Hu-
bert: am I understood by you now?”
“Not understood, upon my life,” returned the
baron, scarcely able to articulate.
“ Did you not,” asked Hubert, in an impressive
and solemn tone,“ seduce me into a promise to
murder a helpless innocent babe pº
“ You accepted six hundred pieces of gold for the
deed," answered the baron.
Ay, likely I might," cried Hubert,“ but they
cannot heal the wound which that devil's act has
left upon my conscience. You tempted me to evil,
when your better state in life should have taught
you to instruct me in what was good, and not to
have lured me into the path of wickedness. You
saw me poor, and bribed my necessity into the per-
formance of guilt, when it became your station and
knowledge to have given me the means of avoiding
that which might lead to my eternal ruin.”
The baron groaned aloud.
Hubert continued thus:-" That sense which
was denied to me from education, I have gained
from repentance. The comparison of my own
iniquitous heart, with that of other men whose

lives have been innocent, makes me recoil with
horror at myself ; I see them happy all the day,
the night repairing to them, with an easy slumber,
the labours of their waking. With me the days
are irksome, full of fear-the nights are passed in
waking misery : each man, I think, suspects me
for the criminal I am--a murderer!-and of what
degree?--the most atrocious in the scale of mur-
derers—that of an innocent babe, without the
means of defending itself from the attacks of vil-
lany !- On him,' methinks men cry, 'rests the
stain of vice-his hands are dyed in infant blood :
avoid him-shun shun the contagion of his breath,
the horror of his eye ! leave him an outcast to the
pangs of conscience !'-Thus do I feel as if these
sounds were hourly breathed upon mine ear.”
“ But they are not-are they, good Hubert ?"
asked the baron, doubtfully.
Only by mine own conscience,” he replied ;
“ the deed of horror hitherto lies buried in ignorance
on earth : but it cannot be hid from heaven; and if
such would be man's horror of the act, what must
be the detestation in which angels hold it ?- Where
must we expect to go?-what recompence to await
us, when the skreen of earthly existence no longer
defends us from retribution ?”
“ We will repent! we will repent !” exclaimed de
Mowbray,
Ay, and suffer to,” replied Hubert, or our
repentance will be an unsatisfactory reparation for
the crime it follows. Where is the punishment of

the guilty-where the terror of the wicked—if they
shall commit a deed of villany, veiled by their ma-
chination from every earthly eye, and silence all
their fears of future retribution, by saying to them-
selves —— I will repent ?'—Thus cannot I stifle the
goadings of remorse ; I feel that an exposure of
my guilt, and my abettor in guilt, to the world is
necessary to the happiness of my soul, and, thus
resolved, I come to seek you out, that we may
together expiate our crime by that death which will
give a lesson of caution to those we leave behind us.”
“Hear me, I conjure you, hear me!”.exclaimed
the baron; your terrors hurry you beyond your
reason.
“ I will hear you," returned Hubert; but un-
“ dertsand that it is my reason which prompts my
utterrance, and renders me insensible to all terrors
but those I experience in the concealment of my
guilt.”
“ Is not God our only judge ?” asked the baron ;
" are we accountable to men for our actions ?"
“ A secret villain,” replied Hubert,“ living
amongst men, under the enjoyment of a fair re-
putation, is a serpent indued with sense, and unit-
ing the worser part of man with the evil qualities of
the reptile. Tho serpent is known to contain venom
in its sting, although its silver skin hides its destruc-
tive power. Against the secret villain, man has no
instinct implanted in his breast to teach him to fly
from him ; it must therefore be equitable, that at
his death, his skin should, like the venomous rep-

tile's be pulled off, and his poison exposed to the
sight, before he can be purified for a second state.”
Hubert, oh Hubert,” cried the baron, taking
the hand of him he addressed, “ in the name of
Heaven, I conjure you to become calm ! I am the
lord baron de Mowbray—reflect on that—the lord
baron de Mowbray a criminal on a scaffold !”
" The lord baron de Mowbray is a murderer,”
returned Hubert" reflect on that.”
Crimes like mine are committed,” said the
baron, “ when the heart is on the rack of torture.”
“The sufferings of those on whom they fall are
not on that account the less."
“ The aggravations which drive us to such acts,
are great."
" So is the crime that follows them.”
“ You once appeared my friend. Do you not
recollect, when by the tower in the village,
“ Name it not : then it was you worked
ignorance you should have instructed; we were then
equally fools, but you alone the villain. Fool you
were, to think it friendship in any man who
promised you assistance in iniquity-villain, to
tempt any man to that iniquity. I was a fool to
believe that evil could ever bring me good. Friends
indeed! If I then thought that we were so, I am
now grown wise enough to know that friends in
evil are mutual enemies."
“ After your promises, your oaths of friendship
-you, Hubert, are you my bitterest enemy ?"
groaned out the baron.

“ Need I again repeat to you,” replied Hubert,
" that I knew not then what it was to be the victim
of a goading conscience?—that my present actions
are the result of reason and religion ? Enemy I
am not-1 am now, indeed, your friend; for in
delivering your life up to justice, I preserve alive
the happiness of your soul.”
Surely I dream,” exclaimed the baron; visions
are floating before my eyes, and imaginary sounds
assail my weakened senses. Thou canst not be
Hubert-impossible that thou, entrusted with the
secret of my soul, shouldst use thy knowledge thus
to goad the victim in thy power. Whence dost
thou come ?-how arrived here at this critical mo-
ment of my wayward fate? Speak-explain, I
entreat thee--my brain and heart are alike upon the
rack."
Ofmy history anon,” replied Hubert: “I shall
return to you ere long, perhaps pass the night
with
you. I would prepare you for the fate that
awaits you, and shall not consider any portion of
time lost which I use in giving instruction to you,
though you poured a baneful doctrine into my de-
luded senses. I shall be here again presently.”
Hubert moved towards the door ; it was now be-
come too dark for the baron to follow him to it with
his eyes, and he stood for a few moments entranced;
but the shutting of the door on the part of Hubert,
and the sound of the key moving in the lock im-
mediately after, startled him, and he sprang to-
wards the door, which he hasily endeavoured to

open, but it resisted his efforts: he called aloud
upon Hubert, but no answer was returned to his
cries ; his knees trembled under him, and he fell
against the wall, upon which he leant in a state of
existence that could hardly be termed life.
CHAPTER VI.
-The great King of kings
Hath in the table of his law commanded,
That thou shalt do no murder : wilt thou then
Spurn at his edict, and fulól a man's ?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
KING RICHARD III.
The situation of the baron de Mowbray was now
even more wretched than it had been when a pri-
soner in the fortress of Allanrod. What was he
to expect from the dreadful menaces of Hubert ?--
the enforcement of his threats, or that argument
might still be able to soften his intentions ?-
Whence could Hubert be come ?--how was he alone
in the castle, at an hour when the fury of the spoil-
er had driven from its walls every other inhabitant ?
-whither was he gone?—when would he return ?
—and what was his immediate design with regard
to himself.
These points alone occupied the mind of lord
William ; and now indeed was his repentance sin-

cere for the death of his grand-child, iſ that repen-
tance which proceeded from terror might be allowed
the appellation.
Nearly two hours had passed, and still Hubert
returned not; the curtain of night was drawn over
the earth, and no speck of light cheered the apart-
ment where lord William was confined: he searched
out his way to the door, and endeavoured by the
imposition of his weight upon it, to force it open ;
but the hard oak resisted his efforts. Pride and
anger began now to mingle themselves with the
other sensations which preyed upon his mind. For
lord William de Mowbray to be a prisoner in an
apartment of his own castle, and made so by one of
the meanest of his dependants, was an idea almost
as painful as the disgrace and punishment with
which that dependant threatened him.
At length a footstep was audible in the gallery,
and the baron, who had strayed to the farther end
of the apartment in the wanderings of his hurried
brain, saw the door opposite to him open, and a
figure, which could only be Hubert, enter, with a
dim lamp burning in a lanthorn in his hand.
“ Hubert !” exclaimed the baron.
“ Hubert hears you," he returned.
Hubert,” repeated the baron, “hast thou for-
gotten me for thy lord ?”
“ I acknowledge you as the lord baron de Mow-
bray,' returned Hubert.
“ Well then, rejoined the baron, “
my power of giving happiness, cannot be unknown

to thee; thou canst not be ignorant that my riches
are still great, notwithstanding the spoil which has
been drawn from my castle by a savage enemy. If
it is thy intention to exact from me a greater reward
for the service I have received at thy hands than
that I have already conferred on thee, why dost
thou not demand it in terms of respect, of friend-
ship ?-why threaten thy superior, when thou hast
but to ask of him, and to receive ?”
“ Have I not already explained to you, my lord,”
replied Hubert, calmly, “that nothing this world
is capable of bestowing can restore me to happiness,
or set me at peace with my own mind—that I place
my hope of forgiveness, after death, on the expia-
tion which I shall make of my crime by the forfeit
of my life--and that worlds should not bribe me to
forego the ray of comfort which this idea glances on
my desponding heart ?”
“ If thou art thus madly bent upon thine own ruin
and disgrace,” exclaimed the baron, becoming for
the first time impassioned, “ on what authority
dost thou unite me in the rash act thou hast re-
solved upon ?”
“ I shall die but half purged of my iniquity,” re-
turned Hubert,“ if I suffer him to live unsuspected
who instigated me to the crime.”
“ Hubert,” roared out the baron, “I command
enlargement from this apartment.”
“ It cannot be, my lord, till we are both fetched
hence by the officers of justice,” rejoined Hubert.
“ The officers of justice summoned hither!" cried

lord William ; “ thou threatenest me with false.
hoods.”
“ Time will convince you that I am not deceiving
you: the officers of justice are summoned bither by
me, and apprized that they here will find us both,"
Hubert replied.
“ Villain !” exclaimed De Mowbray, or thou,
or I, shall not live to see that hour-unless-
The violence of his emotions choked his utterance.
“ Unless what ?" asked Hubert.
“Give me the key thou monster of iniquity!'
roared out the baron, darting towards the door.
Never,” replied Hubert, calmly.
The baron put his hand to his side—he had for-
gotten that he was unarmed—no sword met his
hand. He muttered an exclamation of mingled
curses and regret, and again threw himself with his
whole weight upon the door, in the hope of forcing
it from the lock.
Hubert continued standing by the side of a couch
upon
which one of his hands was rested.
“Give me the key,” repeated the baron," or
by that God whose vengeance thou dost dread, thy
life shall answer the refusal !”
Hubert continued unmoved.
“ Villain, the key !-I say the key !" a third
time shrieked forth the baron, and sprang with the
fury of a tiger upon the neck of him whom he ad-
dressed.
“ Forbear, my lord,” said Hubert, “or I must
defend myself.

The baron was unmindful of his admonition.
“ Lion!” said Hubert, and immediately lord
William felt himself pinioned down to the ground
by his cloak.
The baron turned himself round to inquire by
what force he had been torn from the neck of Hu-
bert, and perceived the glaring eyes of a dog, Hu-
bert's faithful attendant, which met the light of the
lamp that was placed upon the table, and gleamed
with terrible ferocity. The baron shrunk in terror
from the sight.
“ Fear nothing, my lord,” said Hubert ; " he is
under my absolute command, and will not harm you
without my order, which I trust you will not drive
me to the necessity of giving hini, since you see I
am prepared with a friend against your attacks.-
Come off!” added Hubert, addressing the dog,
which immediately quitted his hold of lord William's
cloak, and returned peaceably to the side of his
master.
The baron lay groaning on the floor, his only
chance of escape, which had been in a trial of
strength with Hubert, was now taken from him,
and promised rewards the only sparks of hope which
were left him ; and from these he expected but lit-
tle friendship, in the present determined state of
Hubert's mind.
Mingled promises, threats, and arguments, burst
from his lips, but Hubert was not to be won to his
suit by any of them. The baron sunk upon his
knees before him.-" In this posture of humiliation,

canst thou refuse to grant my prayer ?” he ex-
claimed.
“ It pains me to see you in it,” replied Hubert,
“ but it pains me more to reflect on the crime
which has reduced you to it."
“ Thou art the cause of this humiliation,” re-
turned the baron, “and refusest to feel for the
wretch thou hast made."
“ And what a wretch have you made me?" re-
plied Hubert : “ reflect on that, and then ask your-
self if you can justify your wish to have me die
without an expiation of my crime.”
“ Heart of stone !” exclaimed the baron; “ may
tortures, powerful as its stubbornness, rend its
fibres !"
“It merits such punishment indeed,” returned
Hubert.
“ Weak fool !" roared out De Mowbray, may
curses stronger than those tortures follow thee from
the verge of death into eternity!"
“For your own sake, my lord,” said Hubert,
“ forbear to curse one whom you have already suffi-
ciently injured. Let me entreat you to give some
portion of this night to prayer.'
A silence of some minutes ensued. Lord Wil-
liam broke it.-" Tell me," he said—“ by thy
hopes of heaven, I adjure thee to tell me, does the
hand of justice pursue us ?”
By my hopes of heaven," answered Hubert,
" the hand of justice is stretched out towards us
bath, according to our merits !"

695
" Then God have mercy!” feebly articulated the
baron, and again sunk upon the floor, burying his
face in his cloak.
Hubert took a book from his pocket, and placing
himself opposite to the lamp, read.
In a short time the baron sprang up again, and
paced the room with the wild step of a frenzied
mind.
My lord,” said Hubert, compose your feel-
ings, and read some passages of this book.”
Lord William replied to him only with a deep
groan, and continued his pace.
Another silence ensued, which De Mowbray
broke.—"My thirst is excessive,” he said ; “ am
I to be confined here without the necessaries of
life ?"
Hubert immediately produced a basket of re-
freshments, and poured out for the baron a cup of
mead. Although he had impatiently demanded it,
he scarcely touched it with his lips, and refused all
substantial nourishment. After the baron was
served, Ilubert himself partook of the contents of
the basket.
“How can you be thus calm?” asked the baron,
observing him.
“ Because my repentance is sincere," answered
Hubert.
“ You repent then of one crime, to step more
boldly into another,” said the baron ; it looks, in-
deed, much like repentance to be one of Allanrod's
banditti !"

If you
My lord, I do not understand you,” returned
Hubert.
“ Perhaps it does not suit your purpose to own
it; but I recognized you, even in the disguise you
wore when you entered my prison in his fortress,
bearing a lamp and a dagger in your hand. Confess
to me by what means I was conveyed into the sub-
teraneous vaults, where I again saw you passing
before me, and how you traced me hither ?
are resolved on dying, as you say you are, it cannot
avail you to keep these secrets.”
My lord, you rave,” replied Hubert ; I know
not what you are speaking of: the name of Allanrod
is to me unknown; a robber I have never been,
nor can I understand your words but as those of
frenzy.
If
you will not speak of yourself, reply but to
this one question," rejoined the baron : “ tell me
what mysterious conifexion it is that subsists be-
tween lord Rufus de Madginecourt and the freebooter
Allanrod ?"
My lord,” answered Hubert, “I can only re-
peat, that I know not the name of Allanrod.”
" Liar !” exclaimed the baron, in half smothered
accents, and continued to wander about the apart-
ment.
The clock of the castle now sounded midnight.
A feebleness of body and mind overpowered the
baron, and he once more threw himself upon a
couch.
Hubert trimmed his lamp, and resumed his book.

MASON.
Tus light of returning day had for some hours re-
animated the face of nature ere the baron de Mow-
bray, sinking under bodily and mental fatigue, fell
into a restless slumber; from this he was awakened
by the noise occasioned by the shutting of the door
of the apartment in which he lay extended
upon
the
floor, with his head rested against the foot of a
couch ; and on casting his eyes around, he found
that Hubert had left the chamber.
Again the most impetuous desire of effecting his
escape from the captivity to which he dreaded Hu-
bert had condemned him, entered his mind, and
again he sought the means of forcing his way out
of the apartment.
The upper compartments alone of the windows
in this chamber could be opened, and they were
moved by a cord fastened to a spring, which acted
upon them for that purpose. These upper divisions
were much above his reach, even when mounted
upon a table which stood beneath them, consequently

unfavourable to the hope of escape. Anxious to
obtain a view into the inner court of the castle,
which the painting upon the window glass prevent-
ed him from gaining through it, he dashed out the
panes from the lower frames.
The compartments of glass between the stone
work which intersected the long and spiral windows,
were too narrow to have adınitted his body through
them, if even their height from the ground had not
been so great as to have rendered it impossible for
him to have leapt down, without the hazard of frac-
turing some of his limbs in the fall. Whilst he
stood thus a prey to despair, his ove suddenly fell
on an armed figure which issued from one of the
arched portals leading into the court. The figure
he instantly observed to be in the dress of his own
soldiery ; two others, in the same attire, almost
iminediately followed, and with these was a man
in the raw and tattered garments which character-
ized Allanrod’s band of freebooters. His hcart
bounded with joy at the sight, and be was on the
point of calling to them, when the one whom he
had first observed turning his eye upon the case-
ment at which lord William was standing, and he
recognized in him his chief leader, Irwin, whom
he had believed to be still a prisoner in the fortress
of Allanrod.
“Do I behold my lord de Mowbray ?” exclaimed
Irwin.
Oh, Irwin !--iny friend !--my friend !” re-
turned the baron: “ blessed be Heaven that thou

art arrived to my aid !-Hasten hither instantly, I
entreat thee !"
“We come, my lord-We come,” replied Irwin,
and with his companions immediately disappeared
from the court.
The baron flew to the door of the chamber,
where he stood trembling under the alarming pos-
sibility of Hubert not having left the key on the
outside of the door, but taken it with him. In the
course of a few minutes he heard the sound of foot-
steps in the gallery, approaching towards the cedar
chamber, and very shortly after he experienced the
ecstacy of beholding the door open. On entering,
Irwin immediately inquired from what cause he
found his lord a prisoner in that apartment.
The baron replied to this demand by explaining,
in as few words as possible, that the surly Ilubert,
whom he said Irwin could not but remember to have
been formerly one of the soldiery of the castle, had,
at a certain period a few years past, been intrusted
by him with the care of an infant, nearly connected
with himself, whom he had, for the most urgent
reasons, wished to have reared in obscurity, and
which office Hubert had taken upon himself, and
received a reward from him to perform.
" From
that time,” continued the baron, “ I had not seen
him, nor even heard of him, till he appeared to me
by night in the fortress of Allanrod, during my con-
finement in it: and at the moment of his second ap-
pearance in it, I was hastily conveyed away from
the spot, in a manner which I am not able to ex-

plain or account for. Let it at this minute be suf-
ficient for me to inform you, that I effected my
escape from the stronghold of my enemy; that on
returning to my castle, I found it despoiled, as you
now behold it; and that whilst I stood in this cham-
ber, fixed in agony, and lamenting the unhappy
fate of my daughter and myself, Hubert again
appeared before me."
Proceed, my lord,” said Irwin, for the baron
paused, and turned aside his countenance.
“ It appears from his account of himself,” De
Mowbray continued, " that the passion of avarice
stole into his heart, and tempted him with the de-
sire of possesing the sum with which I had furnished
him for the maintenance of the child, and to this
end he became its murderer. His conscience now,
it seems, reproves him with the deed, and wrings
his heart with tortures of such violence, that they
have induced upon his mind a state of frenzy, un-
der the influence of which he believes that I com-
manded the death of the infant, and that he cannot
taste salvation in a future life unless he delivers up
himself and me to justice in this. You cannot,
from this account which I give you, doubt the de-
rangement of his brain ; when he returns hither,
therefore, which I expect he shortly will do, you
must assist me to secure him, and I will then de-
liberate upon what steps it were most advisable for
me to take respecting him.”
Irwin heard these words on the part of the baron
with a degree of astonishment which he could not

repress. The baron’s faltering accents gave him a
suspicion that his heart was ill at ease within his
breast; and the recollection of Edward's hasty de-
parture from Cumberland, and Rosalind's impri-
sonment from the world, subsequent to that period,
connected with the baron's avowal that there had
been a child born, which he "had wished to con-
ceal from the public eye, carried with it a train of
strange ideas to the mind of Irwin, although he
forbore to give them utterance.--"Did you sup-
pose, my lord,” he said, “ that it was Hubert who
twice appeared to you by night in the fortress of Al-
lanrod, within the chest in your prison?”
“ I cannot doubt it," returned the baron.
“You are deceived, my lord,” replied Irwin ;
" it was myself whom you there beheld.”
“ You, Irwin 1-you !” exclaimed lord William,
in a tone of voice which bespoke him unable to give
credit to the words which fell from the tongue of
his leader.
“I will immediately explain to you,” returned
Irwin, “ what now appears to you a matter of
doubt. Did not you, my lord, whilst confined in
the fortress of Allanrod, throw from the window
of your prison a paper, containing a promise of a
thousand pieces of gold to whomsoever should
convey intelligence of the place of your confinement
to De Mowbray Castle ?"
“Yes, yes, I did," angwered lord William; " this
was an experiment for regaining my liberty which I
several times repeated."

: “One of these papers,” said Irwin, “was found
by the member of Allanrod's band whom you now
behold my companion, and he, as chance willed it,
was the very person destined to attend upon me in
my imprisonment.”
The baron stepped forward to behold the man
to whom Irwin alluded, and saw him standing
without the door of the chamber, with those two
of his own soldiery whom he had before observed
in the court below.
“Was it he who found that paper ?” said lord
William, returning to Irwin.
“The same, my lord,” replied the leader; “he
is a man whom poverty had urged, in opposition
to his natural inclination, to enter into the compa-
ny of the freebooters, and, burning with the desire
of obtaining a reward which promised him the means
of quitting their band, without exposing himself to
the miseries of famine, and still fearful of the tor-
tures to which Allanrod might condemn him, if he
were either detected in flying as a messenger to De
Mowbray Castle, or enlarging you from your prison
in the fortress of the freebooter, he resolved to in-
form me what was passing in his mind, and, having
done so, he questioned me whether I would equally
ensure to him the thousand pieces of gold, if he
gave me instruction for effecting your escape? Your
lordship cannot doubt that I instantly gave the
promise which he demanded. Our agreement being
made, he informed me that the point wherein the
greatest danger lay to whomsoever should attempt

your release, was the act of reaching the turret
where you were confined, but that if I were inclined
to hazard the undertaking, he would direct me in
the only way by which it could be done. I declared
myself ready to make the attempt, and at the dead
hour of midnight, putting a lamp into my hand,
and presenting me with a dagger for my defence, he
led me through the sepulchral vaults of the ancient
monastery, and bringing me to the foot of a narrow
and spiral staircase, he directed me to ascend it,
acquainting me that when I had reached the top I
should find bolts, which I must undraw, and then
raise up a certain portion of the wainscot, which he
told me formed the lid of an apparent chest in your
prison, and which private connexion with the bury-
ing-ground below he supposed to have been con-
structed in former times for the purpose of convey-
ing with the greater secrecy and ease into the vaults
beneath such persons as had been deprived of life
in the prisons above them—and of crimes of this
nature he said the place had been a frequent witness
in the days of religious persecution.
“I ascended the stairs, and he remained below,
hid in a dark corner of the vaults, which he had
chosen for the purpose of concealing himself from
view, should any one chance to pass that way.
Scarcely had I raised the lid of the supposed chest,
ere my companion, seeing a distant light approach-
ing towards the spot, and being fearful of a surprise
which might defeat our intention with regard to you,
gave me a signal, which had been agreed upon be-

tween us, to return to him; I instantly let fall the
wainscot partition, and ran down the stairs. He
hid my lamp in a lanthorn, which he had brought
with him for that purpose, and we knelt down be-
hind a mouldering tomb, where we skreened our-
selves from the observation of a freebooter, whom
my companion judged to be on his way to steal li-
quor from the cellars of Allanrod. The moment he
had passed us, I returned to my prison, and he to
his accustomed sleeping-place, as we judged it un-
safe to renew our attempt that night.”
“But on the following one you repeated it,” said
the baron, “did you not? for the armed figure,
which you now explain to me to have been your-
self, again appeared to me beneath the lid of the
chest.”
Irwin replied, that on the subsequent night, the
freebooters having nearly all left the fortress upon
an expedition of plunder, which he had now found
to have been directed against De Mowbray Castle,
the friendly borderer and himself proceeded with
less fear towards the baron's prison in the turret.
Having ascended the stairs, he raised the lid of the
chest as before, and that he had scarcely done so,
ere he perceived the baron suddenly to vanish from
his sight on the opposite side of the apartment.—
“In the greatest surprise,” continued Irwin, “I
immediately returned to my companion, and com-
municated to him what I had seen : equally aston-
ished at the intelligence I brought, as I myself had
bcen at what I had witnessed, he resolved to ascend

with me into the turret, and investigate the cause.
We directly entered the apartment which had been
your prison, and discovered a trap-door in the floor,
which had yielded to the imposition of your weight
upon it, and through which it was evident that you
had fallen.
“Upon perceiving this, I concluded that you
had been precipitated into the vaults which we had
just left, but my companion informed me that the
ancient burying-ground was intersected by a wall,
which ran immediately across the turret in which
you had been a captive, and that you had fallen on
that side of it to which we had not the power of
gaining access. Dreading that you might there
perish, in conscquence of the bruises you might
have received in your fall, I besought him to make
the experiment of conducting me to you. He de-
clared that it was impossible for him to serve you
in your prescnt misfortune, for that the ancient
tombs in the opposite division were used as the re-
ceptacles of such articles of value as were brought
to the fortress by the banditti, and that on this ac-
count the entrance to it was guarded by a man nam-
ed Frasier, and two others, whose fidelity to Al-
lanrod had been tried, and through whose sleeping
apartment lay the only passage which led to the
spot.
In this dilemma, we considered that the single
chance by which we could be able to afford you as-
sistance, must be that of effecting our escape from
the stronghold of the freebooters, and proceeding

with all the speed we were able to De Mowbray Cas-
tle, where it must be my business instantly to ool-
lect all your vassals capable of bearing arms, and
to lead them to an attack upon your prison. Thus
resolved, we stole out from the ruinous building,
with all the caution of men who dread that every suc-
ceeding moment may be the termination of their
existence, and having gained a dell at a short dis-
tance, we determined to hide ourselves in one of the
rocky cavities, of which it had many, till the ap-
proach of night should favour our proceeding on our
destined journey, for already was the sun beginning
to break from the clouds, and every moment bring-
ing with it the fear of a discovery. We had en-
tered but a few paces into the cave which we had
chosen for our concealment, ere we were alarmed
by the sound of voices and footsteps within it. In
a very short time, however, our fears were remov-
ed, by discovering that its inhabitants were the two
of your lordship's soldiers whom you now behold
before you, and who, like us, had effected their
escape from the fortress in the night, and were seek-
ing shelter from the light of day. They had been
more provident than ourselves, in bringing with
them provisions for their journey, and, by sharing
with them the contents of their wallet, our strength
and spirits were preserved for the undertaking of
the ensuing night.
“ At the hour of noon we heard sounds indicative
of the return of the victorious freebooters from their
expedition ; and as soon as the shades of night were

spread, we set forward on our way, resolving to re-
pose no more till we should have gained the spot of
our destination. On our arrival here, you may easily
imagine the consternation with which we beheld the
castle despoiled and deserted ; but our astonishment
and joy were still greater when our eyes fell upon
the countenance of its lord, for whose safety our
fears had been so strongly excited.”
In as brief a manner as possible, the baron then
recounted to Irwin and his companions all that had
befallen him subsequent to his descent into the
vaults, and the providential means by which he had
effected his escape from them.—“But what,” he
asked, “could be the light which I solong pursued ?”
The freebooter answered—“That he doubted not
it had been a lamp, borne either by Frasier or one
of his fellow-guards, who were suspected of paying
nightly visits, of not a very honest nature, to the
treasures which they were deputed to protect.”
These explanations having been made on both
sides, the recollection of the past was quickly driven
from the mind of the baron by the anxiety with
which he anticipated the future, and his doubts how
to act under the trying and perplexing scene with
which he was threatened. The only method by
which he could shield himself from the dreaded ac-
cusation of his enemy appeared to be that of becom-
ing himself the accuser of Hubert; and to persue
this plan, therefore, he fixed his determination.
The entreaties of Irwin could not prevail upon

lord William to quit the cedar chamber; he persist-
ed in remaining there till the return of Hubert,
having commanded the two soldiers who had arrived
with Irwin to secure him their prisoner as soon as
he appeared in it.
At the expiration of about two hours after the
arrival of Irwin and his companions at the castle, a
footstep was heard in the gallery, and in a few mo-
ments Hubert entered the cedar-chamber bearing in
his hand some refreshments, which he had brought
with him, for the breakfast of lord William. Im-
mediately on his coming into the chamber, the com-
mand which the baron had given was obeyed, and
he was seized by two soldiers ; the action, as well
as the presence of Irwin and the soldiers, appeared
to surprise him, but he still retained his composure
of countenance, and ere he had time to enquire why
he was thus assailed, the baron explained the cause
by saying " You are now my prisoner, nor shall
you again taste liberty till you have given such an
account of the death of the infant whom I entrusted
to your care as a court of justice shall deem sufficient-
ly satisfactory to acquit you upon.”
“ I have already, my lord,” replied Hubert,
expressed my desire to meet you in a court of
justice ; I am therefore rejoiced that you have re-
solved to accede to my wish.”
“ Does not my firmness shake thee from thy
mad purposes P” inquired the baron, after a pause.
“ No, my lord, it does not in the least cause me

to waver from my determination,” returned Hu-
bert.
Thy confidence is not less strange than thy
frantic intention,” replied the baron.
“ It is placed in the justice of Heaven," answered
Hubert.
CHAPTER VIII.

ROMEO AND JULIET.
We now again turn the page to Edward and his
Rosalind. With the rapidity of the lightning's flash,
shot from the resistless bolt of Jove, Edward sped
his way from the chapel, bearing the treasure of
his soul senseless in his arms. Entirely unacquaint-
ed with the intricacies of the building, he thought
only of removing her from the presence and power
of Allanrod and his vile adherents, and for this
purpose he retraced the only path of which he had
any knowledge, and which was the one that had led
him into the chapel from the entrance into the
subterraneous vaults. Here he paused an instant
in reflection how to proceed. In that instant the
wonted powers of her mind returned to Rosalind
with an exclamation, long and piercing, she shrieked
;

forth his name.--" Edward !” she cried, my
husband lives !-'tis not the pallid spectre of
the man I once was blessed in loving !—'tis he !-it
is himself that I am again permitted to throw my
trembling arms around, and hang upon for succour.
Oh God !-omnipotent and merciful God !-accept:
my gratitude for the excess of bliss that fills my
heart !”
With a fervour not less animated and devout
than the dying zealot holds to his breast the emblem
of his Saviour's suffering and his own forgiveness,
and presses upon it with religious ecstacy his fever-
ed lips, did Edward clasp to his breast the long-lost
wife of his affections; and as he held her in his
arms—" Rosalind !-dearest, persecuted, suffering
Rosalind !” he exclaimed, “ welcome, welcome, to
the heart that lives for thee, and thee alone !"
But the instinctive voice of danger quickly whis-
pered an admonition to the heart of Edward, not to
lose an instant in flying from the spot where he stood.
Various sounds were assailing his ears from every
side ; at one moment they appeared to be approach-
ing towards him, at the next to be again receding
from him. The darkness of the night was relieved
only by solitary lamps, which cast a pale reflection
on the lofty walls. After some hesitation which
way they should bend their steps, he perceived a
glimmering of light, which appeared of a different
nature to that emited by the lamps, and, in the
kope of its proving an outlet from the castle, they
flew towards it; as they approached it, they dis-

covered it to be a window at the end of a vaulted
corridor, through which the beams of the moon ob-
liquely shot a sickly light upon the white marble
floor beneath it. -
At the moment Edward was contemplating, with
a full heart, the disappointment of his hopes, the
eye of Rosalind discovered a second luminous
space,
through which appeared the full face of the planet,
whose beams had attracted them towards the win-
dow; and as they moved a few paces nearer to the
inviting scene, the breeze by which they were met
convinced them that no object here intervened be-
tween them and the air. In this conviction they
endeavoured to increase upon the speed with which
they were already moving, and in a few minutes
they found themselves arrived at a postern-gate,
leading out upon the ramparts, fronting the sea.
That their course had hitherta been uninterrupt-
ed, Edward was not surprised; those whom he had
left in the chapel he supposed to be withheld from
pursuing them, equally by superstitious fears, and
the attention which their lord, Allanrod, was re-
quiring at their hands, in consequence of the alarm
he had received. All the adherents of De Madgine-
court he concluded to be prisoners ; and he had
himself heard a command issued for all the free.
booters to assemble in the hall of the castle, and
there to await the tidings being brought to them of
their lord's marriage with Rosalind being solemniz-
ed. He wished that his friend Philip were still by
his side, but the wish was a vain one.

Having issued out upon the ramparts, they dis-
covered that they were on the opposite side of the
castle to that on which the drawbridge was situated:
nothing was discernible from this spot but the buoy-
ant waves rising above each other in silver swells
upon the murmuring bosom of the deep.--"Let us
fly to the beach, and secrete ourselves in some
friendly cavity, which one of the cliffs upon the
verge of the sea will not fail to afford us!” exclaim-
ed the anxious Rosalind.
“But how will it be possible for you to descend
the steep and rugged declivity which leads to the
margin of the ocean ?" inquired Edward.
“ I once wandered by day on this very rampart,”
replied Rosalind,“ and I then discovered a foot.
way down the cliffs, but a few paces to the left of
our present situation.”
“ But the moat-the moat !” ejaculated Edward ;
" how shall we pass the moat ? There can be no
doubt of the drawbridge being securely guarded, al-
though the ramparts on this side of the castle are
left naked and deserted."
Scarcely had Edward spoken these words ere the
sound of voices arrested his attention, and, on turn-
ing round his head in the direction from whence
they proceeded, he perceived two men moving
slowly along, upon what he, at the first glance,
supposed to be a part of the rampart wall ; but he
almost immediately discovered that he was deceived
in his idea, and this discovery rendered him wholly
at a loss where to suppose them walking, as they

appeared to be crossing the moat on a level with the
parapet wall. Rosalind confirmed him in his belief
that there was no second drawbridge communicat-
ing with that part of the castle, and he almost be-
gan to think that they moved on air.
Rosalind and himself were at this time concealed
by the shade of a high bastion, while on the two
men, the objects of their fear, their curiosity, and
surprise, the moon cast a vivid light. When they
had gained the ramparts, Edward could distinguish
from their dress that they were moss-troopers: and
from their conversation, as they passed before the
spot where Rosalind and he were standing, he found
that one of them had been wounded by a sling from
the castle, and that his companion had returned to
seek him after the victory, and to lend him his as-
sistance in reaching the walls of which they had
made a conquest. -
Instantly convinced, from what he had overheard,
that there must be some passage by which these
men had crossed the moat, and which might prove
instrumental to the flight of Rosalind and himself,
no sooner had the two moss-troopers turned an angle
of the walls, than with the trembling partner of his
anxieties he flew to investigate the spot. -
The moment they arrived at it, a surprise of the
most joyful nature presented itself to their sight;
they found that a temporary bridge had been thrown
across the moat, in order, as it appeared to favour
the rushing of the enemy upon the castle, at the
period of its defenders growing languid in their

exertions. Thankful for the beneficial aid it afforded
them, they gave but little consideration to the
cause of its existence, and having traversed it with
winged steps, they flew towards the beach, which
they gained in safety, and with overflowing ecstacy
of soul.
They moved hattily on, in search of some nook
where they might shelter themselves from the pur-
suit which they doubted not would shortly be set on
foot after Rosalind; and as they proceeded along,
they poured forth upon the delighted senses of each
other those sentiments of joy, of thankfulness, and
of astonishment, with which their hearts were filled
at the restoration to each other, with which they
were at that moment bleesed.
“ To be torn asunder now,” exclainied Edward,
“ would be a pang exceeding all the miseries that
I have hitherto endured."
“ Forbid it, pitying Heaven !” ejaculated the
tender Rosalind. “ Ob that we could at this instant
be waſted to the foot of our sovereign's throne !
that it were permitted us to kneel before my royal
godmother, and implore her protection for two un-
fortunate beings, whose natural protectors have cast
them off, and who have alone her clemency and jus-
tice to repose on for their future peace !"
“ Be of comfort, dearest Rosalind !" returned
Edward; “ the hand of Providence appears to be
stretched out in our cause, and it will protect us on
our journey towards Elizabeth.”
“ Alas !" replied Rosalind, “ you speak of the

journey as if it were possible for us to accomplish it
ere the morning : consider the distance from hence
to the abode of our royal mistress—the dangers, the
perils that await unprotected travellers, like our-
selves. Oh, pardon me, my beloved husband,
that at the moment thou art restored to me, my
heart should sink thus fainting in my breast.”
The voice of Rosalind faltered as she pronounced
these words; the tears burst from her eyes, and she
sunk fainting into the arms of Edward.
Words were all the comfort which he had it in
his power to bestow on her; and as he called upon
her in accents of the tendercst nature to revive, and
place confidence in the will of Heaven to preserve
them from their enemies, his attention was for an
instant called from the object of his anxiety, by a
rapid cutting of the waves behind him, and on mov-
ing round his head, he perceived that the noise pro-
ceeded from the motion of the oars with which a
man, whom he discovered in a small boat, was
rowing his little bark towards the shore.
On perceiving this man, a sudden thought, which
communicated both hope and rapture to his heart,
darted into his imagination. He had already wiped
the crimson stain from his cheek; and the instant
animation returned to the frame of Rosalind, leading
her towards the man who had just sprung from his
boat upon the shore, he addressed him, by saying
_" Fear me not-I am a man like yourself; you
have nothing to dread at my hands-benefit it is at
your option to receive from them, if you have a

the recompence due to a benevolent action would
provide you with the means of supplying. Carry
us southward from this spot, to any port or harbour
where it is probable that we may obtain a vessel to
transport us farther down the coast, and ten pieces
of gold shall be the compensation I will bestow on
you for your compliance, five of which I will now
give you, as an earnest of my promise being made
by one who will not break his word to you."
The fisherman, for such was the man he address-
ed, appeared not less surprised by the proposition
made to him, than by the sudden appearance, as
it seemed to him, of two beings, of the superior
cast, of which their garb bespoke them, by the
side of his boat.
He stared alternately upon each, without replying
to Edward's appeal ; but when Edward enforced
his petition by producing five of the pieces of gold
with which the faithful Hubert had furnished him
at their late separation, his tongue immediately be-
came untied; and having received them into his
own possession, and reminded Edward of the other
five which were to follow, he agreed to row them
down to a creek, at the distance of about a league
and a half, where, he said, small vessels, sailing
southward, were not unfrequently to be found.
The greatest inconvenience which they experienc-
ed whilst in the fisherman's boat was its owner's
curiosity to learn the cause from which they had

taken refuge in it ; and as Edward judged it most
safe not to give him their true history he was not
a little puzzled to find evasive replies to his ques-
tions, which were very numerous otherwise the
man proved both civil and kind. He threw a
wrapping cloak, which had been intended to defend
himself from the coldness of the night, over the
shoulders of Rosalind, and pressed both her and
Edward to partake of such food and liquor as he hap-
pened to have on board.
The tide being unfavourable to their progress,
day was beginning to dawn when they reached the
creek to which the fisherman had promised to trans-
port them. As they arrived near it, they discover-
ed some low cottages planted at the distance of a
few yards from the margin of the sea, but no vessel
of any description appeared in sight.
Having landed them, the fisherman recommended
to them to knock at a door, which he pointed out,
and which, be informed them, was the habitation
of a man who was in the habit of supplying such
ships as touched upon that part of the coast with
fresh water and provisions, and who was the most
likely person to inform them whether any vessel
was shortly expected to pass that way.
They followed his directions; and scarcely had
Edward struck his hand against the door, ere the
pilot, of whom the fisherman had spoken, followed
by a lad who was his son, came out ready equipped,
as it appeared, for the water. They stepped back a
pace or two in surprise, at the appearance of Edward

and his fair companion; and before they had time
to inquire their business, Edward signified what it
was.
The pilot replied, that if it was their wish to
get themselves transported to London, his son and
himself were then going to carry a sheep on board
a ship in the service of government, which was ly-
ing off at sea, about half a league from the shore,
and which was now on her way to the Tower of
London; " and this vessel,” he added, “ he doubt-
ed not, would readily receive them on board as
passengers.”
The desire which Rosalind had expressed to her
husband, at the moment of their reaching the beach
on the foregoing night, of being able to throw her-
self at the feet of her sovereign, and interest her
in their cause, had governed him in his actions
since that time; and hence arose the decision with
which, in his flight from Rockmount Castle, he had
still taken the precaution of making progress to-
wards the metropolis. "}
The light of day was not yet sufficient for them
to distinguish the ship of which the pilot had spo-
ken; they however trusted to his report of her,
and entered the boat in which his son and him-
self were going to row up to her.
As they advanced out to sea, the vessel gradually
became visible; and when they had reached her side,
at the request of Edward, the captain appeared
upon deck ; and a very few words ratified an agree-
.
ment for the passage of Edward and Rosalind to
London.

719
Towards the captain, Edward maintained the
same silence and secrecy, with regard to their
names and history, which he had done to the inqui-
sitive fisherman. His time was principally passed
in the cabin which was allotted to their use, with
his Rosalind; and their hours 'were spent in a rela-
tion of the adventures which had, befallen them
since their separation from each other, intermingled
with their doubts, their wishes, and their appre-
hensions, for the events of the future.
The ship had got under weigh almost immedi-
ately upon their coming on board ; and on the even-
ing of the third day they arrived at the mouth of
the Thames, where she anchored for that night.
As Edward and Rosalind had dwelt on past oC-
currences, one circumstance had particularly ex-
cited their surprise, and that was, the effect which
the sudden appearance of Edward, in his disguise,
in the chapel of Rockmount Castle, had produced on
Allanrod. It had by no means astonished them
that the lower orders of society, both at De Mow-
bray Castle, and afterwards at that of Rockmount,
should bave been alarmed by the appearance which
had been purposely planned to inspire with terror the
minds of superstitious and ignorant beholders; but
that Allanrod, a chief, even though of a banditti, a
situation which alone would have bespoken him of
no mean origin, even if the account of his courtesy
and accomplishments, which Edward had learnt
from the history of the bonny Mabel lionteith,
related to him by the abbess in the island of Aus-

kerry, had not meti his ears, should have experi-
enced so great an alarm from the sight as to have
sunk senseless at beholding it into the arms of his
attendants, was a fact for which he could not in
any way account, but that the consciousness of the
train of evils which had marked his iniquitous
life had rendered him more susceptible of fearful im-
pressions than a man whose days had been more in-
nocently passed.
About five in the afternoon of the fourth day after
their escape from Rockmount Castle, they were
landed in the metropolis of the kingdom; and Ed-
ward having satisfied the captain of the vessel for
the service they had received at his hands, they
proceeded towards that quarter of the city in which
stood the royal palace, and where they procured for
themselves the use of an apartment in its vicinity, on
taking possession of which they tasted the first mo-
ment of security with which they had been blessed
since their reunion with each other.
A night of undisturbed rest was a refreshment of
which the strength and spirits of Rosalind stood
peculiarly in need, ere she could be adequate to
the undertaking of entering the presence of her 80-
vereign, upon the painful, the difficult business,
for which she was to appear before her; and her
ideas relative to the reception she should meet with
from Elizabeth almost deprived her of the sleep ne-
cessary to enable her to go through the arduous
task of the succeeding day.
Kindly as she believed the queen would treat

her, and mindful, as she did not doubt to find her,
of those promises of love and protection which she
had made to her at the moment of her becoming her
sponsor at the holy font of Christianity, still the
unprecedented peculiarity of her situation, the de-
tail of extraordinary events for which she had to
implore her hearing, filled her with apprehension at
the idea of approaching her throne; and not least
painful to her imagination was the probability of the
queen considering the honour which she had con-
ferred on her, in becoming her god-mother, sullied
by the union which she had contracted with her
beloved Edward; she dreaded that Elizabeth might
merely dwell on the circumstance of her being be-
come the wife of an unknown, and be unwilling to
make any allowance of pity or indulgence for the
cruel extremities by which she had been driven to
that act.
When they arose in the morning, having, with
the assistance of their hostess, procured a change
of habiliments for themselves, of which some pieces
that still remained of Hubert's gold enabled
them to make the purchase, and Rosalind having
been careful to attire herself with the utmost sim-
plicity, they repaired to the royal mansion of Eliza-
beth. A chamberlain of the household appeared to
receive them, and in faint accents Rosalind re-
quested to be admitted to an audience of the queen.
The chamberlain replied, that her majesty was
in ill health, and unable to receive any visitors but

such as were honoured by her most intimate ac-
quaintance.
“I am one,” rejoined Rosalind,“ on whom
her smiles have hitherto fallen with the most con-
descending benignity. I entreat you to bear her
information, that her god-daughter, Rosalind de
Mowbray, implores permission to kneel before her.”
“ The name of De Mowbray,” answered the
chamberlain, 6s is indeed one that is most likely
to gain its suit. Your petition, lady, shall instantly
be conveyed to the ear of our royal mistress ;” and
having said this, he commanded some of the at.
tendants who were in waiting in the hall of the pa-
lace, to conduct Rosalind and her husband to an
apartment, whilst he proceeded to execute the com-
mission with which she had charged him.
During the time that they remained in this apart-
ment, awaiting the return of the chamberlain, some
domestics attended to place them chains, and throw
additional logs of wood upon a fire which was burn-
ing upon the hearth ; and of one of these who ap-
peared of a superior order to the rest, Rosalind
ventured to inquire whether the queen had been
long indisposed ?
He replied, that her majesty was not yet recover-
ed from the grief into which the death of her la-
mented cousin, the queen of Scots, had thrown
her.
Rosalind could with difficulty confine to her own
breast the surprise with which this account filled


## p. 723 (#763) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTRR. 723
her mind: queen Elizabeth had been the instrument.
of the fallen monarch's death; and therefore it ap-
peared to her indefinably strange, that she should
now be represented as mourning her loss.
The chamberlain presently returned, followed by
a venerable female, in whose person Rosalind recol-
lected the dowager lady Butler: she was a woman
of the strictest religious principles, and in her con-
versation the queen at this time found particular
delight. From the moment the fatal blow had been
struck, which had put a period to the existence of
the Scottish queen, Elizabeth had repented of the
step which she had taken to free herself from an
innocent rival; and thus impressed, she scorned
the consolation and the lessons of those priests,
who had a few weeks before urged her to the act of
which she now lamented that she had not withheld
the performance ; and to the pure doctrines of the
lady Butler she now alone listened.
By her Rosalind was conducted to the presence
of her sovereign; as she quitted the apartment
where she left Edward, he bade her farewell, with
a look in which was conveyed the earnest desire of
his soul for her appeal to the feelings of the queen
meeting such a reception as might prove a balm to
the suppliant's breast.—Rosalind breathed a sigh of
hope, and followed her conductress.
Passing through an antichamber into a retired
apartment, Rosalind here beheld the queen reclining
on a couch, pale, and apparently as ill in health
as the lady Butler had described her to be in mind.


## p. 724 (#764) ############################################

She was unattended, except by two young females,
who were embroidering in a distant part of the
chamber, beneath a spiral window of painted glass,
through which the rays of day were admitted, dyed
with yellow tints, that gave a jaundiced hue to the
scene, and increased the pallidness of Elizabeth's
countenance.
With tottering steps Rosalind approached to-
wards the couch, and, unable to give utterance to
the words in which she wished to address the queen,
she bent her knee, and prepared herself to fall at
her feet; but Elizabeth, who had raised herself
upon her seat as Rosalind had advanced into the
apartment, extending towards her one of her hands,
caught in it that of the trembling daughter of De
Mowbray, and withheld her by it from prostrating
herself before her.
“Rosalind de Mowbray !"" the queen exclaimed
" whence arises it that I thus unexpectedly be-
hold you in my presence? Where is the baron,
your father ? Can it be a truth that was reported
to me, that you are here wholly unattended ?”
" Oh, my beloved, my gracious sovereign !”
faintly breathed forth Rosalind, “ I am come hither
to implore your motherly protection; I am over-
whelmed with wretchedness and sorrow, and I fly
to you for advice and succour.”
“Can it be possible that Rosalind de Mowbray
stands in need of either pill returned the queen:
“ if it be, she has done wisely to recollect the
friendship which Elizabeth pledged to her infant
state, and to fly to her for relief and retribution.”


## p. 725 (#765) ############################################

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER. 725
Cheered by these consolatory words, the tide of
joy ran through the veins of Rosalind, and again
she would have sunk at the feet of her sovereign;
but Elizabeth, in the most affectionate and en-
gaging manner, placed her on the couch by her
side.
“Life is a scene of woe,” rejoined the queen,
“ and happiest they who can alleviate those pangs
of anguish which gnaw upon the hearts of others.
With all, it is a duty to perform this charitable part:
but in a sovereign like myself, it were a blasphemy
against the Deity, whose image and whose delegate
I live on earth, were I to neglect to act upon this
principle of benevolence. Yet I fear me, that in
one single instance of my life I have transgressed.”
She paused, and contended feelings appeared to
agitate her bosom. When she spoke again, she
reverted to the death of Mary, and even a tear fell
from her eye, as she recounted the godlike resigna-
tion with which she died. But still Rosalind, al-
though she endeavoured to check the idea, and
desired to believe the penitence of Elizabeth of the
most perfect and religious nature, could not forbear
imagining that she discovered her to be more re-
pentant of the stain which she dreaded that this
action had cast upon her fame, than of the priva-
tion of life which the queen of Scots had suffered
from it.
“I forget myself,” said Elizabeth, after another
pause—“ commence the appeal which you are
about to make to my heart ; and in contemplating

how I can serve you, I will endeavour to chase from
my remembrance the scene of affliction which is
ever present to my senses.
“I much fear,” replied Rosalind, " that how
ever you may pity me for the wrongs I have en-
dured, I shall still, in certain instances, appear to
my sovereign to have acted with rashness and with
weakness."
“ Let those condemn the weakness of their fel-
low-beings,” answered the queen, whose lives have
been a current of undeviating purity ; but such
there are not, although a blindness to their own
errors often leads the vain and the conceited to
think thus of themselves. Man is, by his nature,
prone to error; were he perfect, he were no longer
of this earth. You will be judged by a mortal,
Rosalind de Mowbray, when you open your heart
to me ; and, although a queen, I have the feelings
of a woman.",
As Elizabeth ceased speaking, she waved her
hand to the young women at the farther end of the
apartment, which signal they understood, and im-
mediately obeyed by quitting her presence ; the
lady Butler too, without receiving the same hint
for retiring, withdrew into the antichamber. By
their absence Rosalind felt emboldened, and as soon
as they were alone, again urged her to begin her
story.
Without further hesitation, Rosalind entered up-
on the recital of such events as had marked her
sorrowful life since the period of her former visit to

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER, 727
the court. She recounted the death of her mother,
and the impressive appeal which in her dying mo-
ments she had made to the feelings of lord William,
relative to the union of their daughter: she pro-
ceeded to the arrival of lord Rufus de Maginecourt
at De Mowbray Castle—to the offer which he had
made to her of his hand—to the cruel severity with
which her father had commanded her to receive him
as her husband—to the month of grace which he
had allowed her for preparing herself for becoming
his wife; and then to her solemn interview with
him in the cedar chamber.
Here the queen interrupted her.—“Is it possi-
ble,” she exclaimed, “that De Madginecourt pos-
sessed the hardiness to make you an offer of his
hand, and at the period too you mention?—at that
very period my frowns had driven him from my
court—vain, pitiable fool!—for know, Rosalind,
that De Madginecourt was once sufficiently pre-
sumptuous to believe that England's queen would
share her throne with him. It was an error in
which a sovereign could not permit a subject to ex-
ist, and I quickly opened his eyes to the delusion
with which his hopes were feeding him. Stung to
the soul by the mortification to which his own
weakness and folly had reduced him, he instantly
retired from London, conscious of taking with him
my displeasure; and I believed him lamenting the
presumption which had cast him from my good
opinion in the privacy of his own domains. It is
now explained to me that he was otherwise employed;


## p. 728 (#768) ############################################

728 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
and I am grieved to find that a noble, in whom
I had placed the faith which I have till this mo-
ment ever done in lord William de Mowbray, should
have fallen into the weakness of becoming the dupe
of so designing and crafty a heart as that which
animates lord Rufus. Not less surprised am I
that the baron your ſather should not, in whatever
union presented itself to the acceptance of Rosalind
de Mowbray, have deemed it a matter of necessary
compliment, if not of compunction, to have en-
treated her royal godmother to grace it with her
sanction, ere the alliance were attempted to be
formed.”
To the queen it appeared incontestibly evident,
that in seeking the hand of Rosalind, lord Rufus
de Madginecourt had only been planning the means
of ascending to a secondary step in the path tow-
ards royal favour, when foiled in his attempt at
mounting the most exalted station of honour and of
power; and it increased the contempt with which
she already regarded him. For the conduct of the
lord baron de Mowbray, in having omitted to re-
quest of her to honour with her countenance the
alliance which he had prepared for his daughter,
she could devise no cause, but that he dreaded lest
she should have been won to sympathize in the
feelings of Rosalind, and out of respect to her hap-
piness have withheld her consent to the marriage;
and regarding this procedure as a proof that he pre-
ferred being himself the agent of the plans for the
future life of his daughter, instead of submitting

M YSTERIOUS FREE BOOTER, 729
her to the acceptance of such provision as the
queen had it, unlimitedly, both in her power and
her intention to make for her, she became equally
incensed against the blind wilfulness of his conduct,
as she was against the united meanness and arro-
gance which had marked that of De Madginecourt.
Hitherto every observation made by the queen
upon the fate of Rosalind, and the authors of the
miseries to which she had been condemned, had
tended to assure her of the interest which Elizabeth
took in her happiness ; but when called upon to
pursue her narrative, her heart still sunk within her,
for the moment was now come at which it was ne-
cessary for her to confess to her sovereign her pri-
vate marriage with Edward. In accents almost
choked by contending feelings the declaration was
made.
Till the moment of her acknowledging herself a
wife, the queen had listened to her tale of woe with
the most compassionate and indulgent attention :
when these words fell from her lips, she impatient-
ly inquired on whom she had bestowed her hand 2
Trembling, Rosalind replied—“On Edward.”
To this reply naturally followed, on the part of
the queen, the inquiries of Who was Edward 2–
of what lineage 2—of what rank?
With increased agitation Rosalind recounted the
simple history of Edward previously to his becom-
ing an inhabitant of De Mowbay Castle, expatiated
on the brotherly affection which she had experienced
from him, and dwelt on the name of son, by which

her deceased mother had bequeathed to him the
legacy of the cross.
After Rosalind had ceased to speak, the queen
maintained a silence of some minutes, during
which the anxious pleader for her indulgence and
pity fixed her eyes upon her countenance, and be-
held in it marks of her being deeply engaged in
thought. At length Elizabeth, raising herself upon
her couch, spoke thus—“ That the goddaughter
of England's queen has both erred and degraded
herself, in contracting an union with one who, if
he be not unknown, is, at best, but the offspring
of an inferior subject of the realm, is a point which
admits of no controversy. But the pangs which
have rent her motherless breast, the painful extre-
mities which have driven her to the action, shall
not be increased by a want of feeling towards her
on the part of her sovereign. Elizabeth holds the
conduct of which lord Rufus de Madginecourt and
the baron de'Mowbray have been guilty in too des-
picable a point of view, to become in her own per-
son an imitator of their insensibility. Rosalind de
Mowbray shall not be excluded from a parental in-
terest in the heart of her queen, because she was
withheld from seeking her advice and friendship at
the moment of her affliction and necessity.”
At the sound of these words, the tears burst into
the eyes of Rosalind, and throwing herself at the
feet of her who had uttered them, she imprinted on
her extended hand a kiss of gratitude, which she
accompanied with an exclamation of rapturous

731
tion ;
thankfulness, rendered nearly inarticulate by the
sobs through which it was uttered.
“ Calm, calm your transports,” said the queen,
again rising her goddaughter from her humble posi-
“ while you merit my favour you shall share
it; I will never consider as a transgression of your
own an error into which the crimes of others have
driven you. But although I am thus resolved in
your cause, there are still worldly customs, of
which the universal benefit is too certain and too
great to be broken through incautiously by a sove-
reign like myself, whose example should be the ex-
citement of my people's just and honourable con-
duct; exceptions to beneficial ordinances in society
come with the worst grace from those the highest
in authority. But I will explain myself more fully
to you when you have unfolded to me the remainder
of your narrative; I must know all that relates to
you, ere my judgment can be formed with perfect
correctness. Suspend, if possible, your emotions,
till you have related to me where you have passed
your days—in what retirement, in what asylum
found refuge, since your ill-judged union : why
have you thus long delayed to present yourself be-
fore me?"
Again Rosalind resumed the thread of her cala-
mitous history: she spoke of the imprisonment in
her own apartment to which her father had con-
demned her after the departure of Edward from
England, and of the sufferings which Edward had
endured in Flanders ; she related the attack threat-

cned to be made upon De Mowbray Castle by the
freebooter Allanrod, the marching out of her father
with his chosen men to meet the divided forces of
the enemy, at the instigation of the deserter Do-
nald, and his subsequent defeat and captivity.
Thence she proceeded to describe the despoiling of
lord William's castle by the moss-troopers; the
almost incredible circumstance of her having been
rescued from them by the interference of lord Rufus
de Madninecourt; the demand which Allanrod had
made of her hand, and the determination of lord
Rufus rather to submit to the sacking of his castle
than to deliver her into the power of the freebooter:
lastly, she recounted her seclusion in the grotto;
the triumph of Allanrod in his attack upon Rock-
mount Castle ; her being dragged to the altar, and
placed there by the side of the dreaded chief, in
order to be united to him by the bond of marriage;
the sudden appearance of her Edward in the chapel,
and the 'rescue of her person from her enemies,
which his disguise had enabled him to accomplish.
"The queen heard Rosalind's account of such oc-
currences as had marked the latter years of her
own and her Edward's existence, with an interest
which their extraordinary nature excited for them
in her breast ; but the fact which most astonished
her was, the change which appeared to have taken
place in the sentiments of lord Rufus with regard to
Rosalind : 'upon this circumstance Elizabeth dwelt
with many 'an 'unsatisfactory surmise ; like Rosa-
lind, she could not induce 'herself to believe that

he actually repented of his former conduct towards
her, and that this repentance had been the cause
of the complacency with which he had lately treated
her; she did not doubt that some refined motive of
a self-interested nature lay concealed beneath his
shew of service, although she could not immediately
conceive what that motive was.
Although the dislike which the queen professed
herself to bear lord Rufus might have been supposed
to have prompted and encouraged Rosalind to the
disclosure of all she knew concerning him, it will
still be observed that the pure and virtuous sufferer,
incapable of falsehood, sacredly maintained the pro-
mise which he had exacted from her at the time
she was immediately in his power, within the walls
of his own castle, of not disclosing to Elizabeth
that any secret bond existed between himself and
the freebooter Allanrod ; he had informed her that
the disclosure of such a tie must inevitably cost
him his life, and her gentle soul recoiled from being
the instrument of depriving even an enemy and a
monster like De Madginecourt of his existence.

After several farther remarks upon the events
which the unfortunate Rosalind had recounted to
her, the queen recurred to those words which she
had before let fall—“ of there being certain bene-
ficial ordinances in society, which a sovereign
ought to be the last to break through;” and she
explained them by saying, that although she bore
no animosity, no anger to Edward as an individual,
still, it was impossible for her to admit him to her
court as the husband of the daughter of one of her
barons—that by such an admission she should be
countenancing the daughters of other nobles in
forming alliances derogatory to their rank in life,
encouraging them to contract unions with men of
inferior circumstances, who might become the poi-
son of the families into which they were admitted ;
and that she should likewise, by such a step, be

emboldening men of dangcrous and designing
minds to insinuate themselves into the hearts of
unsuspicious females, for the very purpose of
rising, through their means, to situations from
which they ought most carefully to be withheld.
Rosalind's heart acknowledged the justice of the
queen's observations, although she could not res-
train the tear from starting into her eye, whilst she
considered them as embracing the fate of one so
tenderly beloved, and whom it had been the most
anxious wish of her soul to behold bending his
knee at the feet of her royal godmother.
Upon the countenance of Rosalind the queen
read what was passing in her mind, and thus ad-
dressed her—“Do not suffer yourself to be cast
down ; I have already pledged myself a friend to
you, and I now make the same promise towards
him in whom you are most interested ; but for
the reasons I have already given you, my favour
cannot shine openly upon him, at least for the
present. I will make it my study to investigate
his character, to discern whether he is worthy of
the hand with which he is blessed ; and if I find
him thus deserving, circumstances may arise to
work a change in his favour, which, if too suddenly
brought about, could not add to the eventual hap-
piness of himself or you. In cases of this doubtful
nature, slow proceedings are the surest; hasty
acts lead the multitude to suspect them the veils
of improprieties.”
Having said this, the queen requested Rosalind

to call to her the lady Butler. When she entered,
Elizabeth took a key from her pocket, and directed
her to fetch her a purse of gold, which she informed
her she would find in a drawer of her escritoir.
Whilst the lady Butler was absent, executing
the queen's commission, Elizabeth, calling Rosalind
to her side, said—“The gold which will be brought
me hither is for the use of your husband. You
must, for a time, Rosalind, consent to be parted
from him; it is necessary for the accomplishment
of the plan which I have formed for your future feli-
city, and which I will presently explain to you, that
as you have now providentially escaped the toils of
your enemies, you should no more quit my palace
till I have brought them to account before me for
their conduct towards you.”
The lady Butler entered with the purse, which
the queen receiving at her hand, put into that of
Rosalind, accompanying her action by saying—
“Here are fifty pieces: retire into the anticham-
ber, where you will find the implements for writing;
explain to your husband at large all that has pass-
ed between us; give him those reasons which
withhold me from admitting him an inhabitant of
this mansion, as likewise those by which I am ac-
tuated in retaining you near my person; and having
done this, direct him to procure for himself an
abode in the vicinity of my palace; tell him that any
communication which he may desire to convey to
you, by letter, I will issue my commands for
having safely delivered into your hands, as likewise

into his such as you may wish to send him.
Acquaint him, moreover, that Elizabeth professes
herself the mother of Rosalind, and will not con-
sequently be the enemy of him in whom her
daughter lives.”
Infinitely would Rosalind have preferred to have
communicated with her own lips to Edward such
matter as the queen had commanded her to write
to him ; but averse to advancing any request
where so great indulgences were voluntarily granted,
she retired to the antichamber, and having com-
mitted a full account of her interview with the
queen to paper, she concluded by entreating him
to write to her, at least once every day, which
rule she promised to observe towards him, during
the period which it should be deemed necessary by
the queen for their separation to continue.
Having folded her epistle, the confidential lady
Butler was charged by Elizabeth with its delivery.
Edward having read the information which it
conveyed to him, had no alternative to quitting the
palace. With lingering steps, and a heavy heart,
he returned to his solitary abode, where his reflec-
tions were his only companions, and his sole em-
ployment that of placing them on paper, for the pe-
rusal of his Rosalind, who was meanwhile con-
tinuing to experience, with every hour, additional
kindness from the queen.
In the afternoon Elizabeth summoned into her
presence some of the members of her privy council,
with whom she had not conversed since the death of

Mary of Scotland ; and having passed nearly three
hours with them in her closet, she returned to the
apartment where she had left Rosalind ; she enter-
ed it leaning on one of her maids of honour for
support, and with the burning glow of fatigue paint-
ing her cheeks.
Rosalind advanced to meet her, and said, “Alas!
my gracious sovereign, it aíllicts me much that I
should be the cause of your suffering anxiety, to
which your health and strength are so ill adapted.”
“Oh no, no, you are mistaken,” 'replied the
queen, with a benignant smile : “ I trust that both
will be amended, by the powers of my mind being
called into action."
After she had some moments reposed herself on
her couch, she said " I have resolved, Rosalind,
that in the present crisis of 'affairs now under my
consideration, it is requisite that my first ster
should be the release of the baron de Mowbray from
his present captivity, and my next the utter sub-
version of the daring freebooter Allanrod and his
lawless band. In your father's attempt at uniting
you to lord Rufus de Madginecourt, without any
reference being made to me in the business, he has
shewn himself so far indifferent about any consider-
ation which it is in my power to evince for his
welfare and that of his family, that it is not from
any regard to him that I shall send a force to pro-
cure his enlargement, but in order to afford to the
other and worthier nobles of my kingdom, placed
in a similar situation to what his has been, a proof

of
that the arm of Elizabeth shall ever be stretched
out to redress the wrongs they may suffer in their
attempts to protect her kingdom from the ravaging
banditti with which it is at this instant intcsted. I
have therefore commanded, that with the rising
to-morrow's sun a proclamation be issued through-
out the city, announcing to my knights and cap-
tains round my throne, that I shall hold upon the
following day a public court, at which I shall select
the leaders of an expedition, which it is my purpose
without delay to send forth against the borderers.”
“ Ileaven grant that your royal ail come not too
late--that they find not my father deprived of life!"
exclaimed Rosalind; for it will be remembered that
she was utterly ignorant of his escape from the
stronghold of Allanrod.
“ Such is my prayer also," returned the queen.
“I wish to see him, and receive from himself the
motives which induced him to adopt so harshi and
unnatural a conduct as he had been guilty of tow-
ards a child so particularly favoured in the pledge
of protection which it received at its admission
amidst the members of Christianity; for it is but
equitable that both sides of any question be heard,
ere a decisive judgment is formed upon it,” she
added, with an expression that assured Rosalind
that they were only words of favour, and, in her
own mind, not the slightest doubt hung upon the
truth of the narration she had received from her
lips.
“ As soon as my deputed forces shall have

marched against the freebooters,” resumed Eliza-
beth, “
my next concern shall be to dispatch a
summons to lord de Madginecourt to appear before
In the recital which you have given me of
the calamities experienced by your husband in
Flanders, I have seen him guilty of an attempt to
deprive an English subject of his life ; and although
the crime is not amenable with his death, since it
was committed beyond the boundaries of my island,
it is nevertheless my duty not to suffer such a
transgression of the virtue of an English noble to
pass unreproved and unstigmatized with the censure
it merits. Where," after a pause, asked the queen,
“ is that Hubert, of whom you speak as having
been witness of the atrocious villany ?”
Rosalind informed the queen where Edward and
he had parted, and that Hubert had assured him
that they should meet again.
“ As he is in the kingdom,” replied Elizabeth,
“ he will no doubt easily be found, when he learns
that those to whom his cares are directed, are un-
der the immediate protection of Elizabeth.” And
to these words the queen added an eneomium upon
the nobleness of Hubert's heart, and the gratitude
he had evinced towards the benefactor of his youth.
_" He is one of those rare and brilliant examples
of true merit,” she said, “ on which it reflects the
highest praise upon majesty to confer a reward;
and he shall not be forgotten by me.”
As the queen continued to dwell on the circum-
stances which immediately occupied her mind, she

741
told Rosalind that she conceived the strongest proof
of De Madginecourt's sentiments, with regard to
herself, during her stay at Rockmount Castle, not
to have been of the innocent and friendly nature
which he had endeavoured to induce her to believe
them, was the attempt which he had made of de-
priving Edward of his life during his imprisonment
in Flanders, and his having again proposed himself,
immediately after his supposed death, to lord
William, as the suitor of her hand. Rosalind co-
incided in the opinion of the queen, and said, that
such had ever been her own idea ; and they both
agreed that Rosalind could not be sufficiently
thankful for having escaped with unsullied honour
from his power, although they were entirely at a
loss to conceive on what account he had spared her,
in her defenceless state.
Aſter a night, during which the balm of sleep
had been almost a stranger to her pillow, Rosalind
arose at early morn, and wrote to her Edward a
full detail of the resolutions which the queen had
formed on the preceding evening. When Edward
read the account of the forces which it was the in-
tention of the queen to send against the detested
Allanrod, and of the public court which she had
appointed to hold for the purpose of selecting the
leaders of the expedition, his heart beat a tumult
of desire within his breast, to be named one of the
envied number.
The anxiety which he felt to obtain a post amidst
the chosen was unconquerable, and he determined
5 c

to present himself before the queen, at her public
court, amongst the other captains who should ap-
pear there, as an officer that had borne her ma-
jesty's arms in Flanders, and to urge bis petition
to be enrolled in the present expedition.
After some debates with his own mind, he judged
it most advisable not to acquaiat his Rosalind with
his intention. He considered that, apprehensive
of his safety, she might endeavour to alter his de-
termination, or that, if such was not the case, she
might impart to the queen his wish, and that Eliza-
beth might raise obstacles to the accomplishment
of it, of the same nature as those which she had
advanced as reasons for not yet admitting him to
her presence.
He had both seen and heard so much of the vil-
lanies of Allanrod, that he absolutely felt as if the
chastisement of the freebooter would be incomplete,
unless his arm were one of those stretched out to
vanquish and to crush him. ,!
The whole of the present day he spent in prepa-
rations for his appearance on the following one.
He procured an armourer to polish the suit of mail
which had been his constant habiliment since his
arrival in England till the hour of his reaching
London. The purse which the queen had sent to
him supplied him with the means of procuring
whatever he deemed appropriate or necessary to his
equipment; accordingly he provided himself with
a surccat of scarlet cloth, on which was embroider-
ed an emblem of valour and hope, and in the front

of his helmet was placed a knot of waving
plumes.
Thus clad, when the hour of repairing to the ap-
pointed assembly arrived, he found no obstruction
offered to his entering the palace, and the way
to the presence-chamber was pointed out to him in
like manner as to the other suppliants for admission
to the presence of the queen, by the chamberlains
of the court, who were attending in the hall of the
royal mansion for that express purpose.
On entering the anti-room to the chamber of au-
dience, be found the crowd of those who were
pressing to throw themselves at the feet of their
sovereign so great as almost to impede his progress;
but in a short time his attempts to approach the
door of the presence-chamber were renderer suc-
cessful, by placing himself in the train of a body
of knights who were advancing towards it, and for
whom a passage was cleared.
Arrived within a few races of the spacious door
which was thrown back on its hinges, Erward
cast liis eyes through the aperture, and for the first
time beheld the queen of Englan:), the godmother
of his Rosalind ! At the extremity of a magnificent
saloon, Elizabeth appeared, scated on her throne,
beneath a superb canopy of criinson velvet, richly
embroidered and fringed with gold; she was sur-
rounded by a vast body of nobles, who were, with
herself, divided fronı the pressing throng by a seini-
circle of gilt wire, which was extended round them

at the distance of about ten feet from the base of
the throne.
Whilst he stood wrapt in admiration of the
majesty and grace which shone conspicuous
upon the countenance of the queen, a figure
habited in the marine dress of the times press-
ed before him. The eagerness which the person
thus clad testified to place himself immediately in
the door-way of the presence-chamber attracted the
observation of Edward, and, as he fixed his eyes
upon the stranger, he saw him draw from the folds
of his dress a pistol, which, with the utmost dex-
terity, he levelled at the person of the queen.
With the quickness of lightning, Edward darted
upon him, and dashed from his hand the weapon of
destruction. In the momentary struggle, it dis-
charged itself, and the ball with which it had been
loaded entered the ceiling of the saloon.
The report of the pistol caused a general con-
sternation and alarm throughout the court; every
one flocked to the spot, from whence it had pro-
ceeded, and those who were able to arrive within
sight of it observed Edward wresting a second pis-
tol from the offender, with which he had attempted
to put a period to his own existence, after having
been foiled in his attempt upon the life of the queen.
Elizabeth herself had been hurried by her nobles
into another apartment, but the natural firmness of
her mind had not been at all shaken by the danger
from which she had just been rescued, and learning
*

that the offender was secured, contrary to the ad-
vice of such members of her council as were present,
she commanded him to be brought before her, in
order that she might herself examine him.
The report of the occurrence had, in the course
of a few minutes, been conveyed to every part of
the palace, and no sooner did it reach the ear of
Rosalind, than she flew to convince herself that
her royal protectress was indeed in safety. Scarcely
had she reached the apartment to which the queen
had retired from the audience-chamber, ere, at an
opposite door to that by which she had entired, the
offender was led into it, in compliance with the
command which the queen had issued to that
effect.
No sooner did the eye of Rosalind fall upon the
countenance of the young man, for such he ap-
peared, than she discovered it to be one with which
her memory had acquaintance, and in a very few mo-
ments she recollected that the resemblance of his
person was extremely great to that of the female
whom, with her husband, she had received into the
grotto in the vicinity of Rockmount, and the latter
of whom had breathed his last sigh there, whilst
receiving acts of kindness at her hands; at the
same instant she also recollected the vow of which
her husband had spoken to her, the promise which
she had made to him of revenging the death of their
sainted mistress, and the mysterious declaration
which she had made to her at her departure—“that
she was a dying woman.”

The offender being placed opposite in the queen,
at a short distance from her persnn, Elizabeth said
"Who are you ? and upon what provocation
have you attempted to take away my life ?”
The person thus addressed replied—“Although
you behold me in this habit, I am, like yourself; a
woman--my name Margaret Lambrun."
A sudden emotion overspread the countenance of
the queen at the sound of these words, and she cast
a look of surprise upon those who were standing
near her—"Are you the lady Margaret Lainbrun ?”
she exclaimed.
“ I could not doubt that you would recollect me,”
returned Margaret. “ Till your inhumanity drove
every friend that loved her from sharing her prison
with the injured queen of Scots, you have otien
seen my husband and myself hovering round her
person,
with the hope of communicating a single
ray of comfort to her afilicted heart. When your
hatred towards her became more inflamed to cruelty
by the godlike resignation with which she bore your
injustice, and you deprived hier even of this slender
consolation, we returned to Scotland to lament the
fate which we could not amend, and endeavour to
serve her by our prayers, since we were denied the
gratification of dedicating to her our personal ser-
vices. But when we learnt that you had raised
your hand against her life, our anguish rose to
frenzy; our entire possessions we
distributed
amongst the various Catholic churches in Scotland,
to buy masses for the repose of her soul : this done,

my husband pledged a vow to Heaven to revenge
her death, by the extermination of your life, and I
resolved to profress myself an accomplice in the act,
that I might not survive him, but that my soul
might wing its way with his to a reunion with our
mistress in heaven !-Heartbroken with affliction,
he, on our journey hither, sunk into the sleep of
death, but not till he had received a promise from
my lips to fulfil the oath of retribution which he had
sworn. Arrived in London, I awaited with the
greatest impatience an hour when I should learn
that you were about to appear in some public situa-
tion, where I might gain access to your presence.
This day presented me with the chance I desired-
this habit gained me the passport that I belived it
would, into your palace; and had I, with the wea-
pon which I aimed at your heart, effected my pur-
pose, I was provided with a second, to free myself
from the punishment of your avengers.”
· Although the queen heard this hardy declaration
with astonishment, still her fortitude and wonted
presence of mind did not forsake her, and she re-
plied—“ Is it really possible that you could con-
ceive the deed of which you have attempted the
perpetration a duty ?”
Yes," a double duty,” returned Margaret :
you have deprived me of a sovereign dearer to me
than existence, and by her death you have also
caused that of my husband ; thus, in striking at
the root of your life. I endeavoured to revenge
both theirs at a blow."

“And what, upon your own grounds of argu-
ment,” asked Elizabeth, “must you consider my
duty to be towards my people, whom you have at-
tempted to deprive of their sovereign ?”
“Do you ask this question of me in the character
of a queen or a judge ?” answered Margaret.
“ After a moment's hesitation, Elizabeth said
" I now address you as a queen.”
“Then,” returned the offender, with the intre-
pidity with which she had before spoken,
“ if I
were the queen of England, I would pardon Mar-
garet Lambrun, that, by the performance of a mer-
ciful action, I might endeavour to re-establish my
fame, ere it be committed to the annals of history."
The queen, turning to some of her council, ex-
pressed her surprise at the singularity and hardiness
of the character before her, and then commanded
her to be carried to the Tower, for further exami-
nation at a future period.
The moment Margaret was withdrawn from her
sight, the queen exclaimed—" I have been an
abuser of time I have trifled away those moments
with the criminal object which ought to have been
employed in gratitude to my preserver. Where is
he who disarmed the hand of the assassin ?"
One of the lords in waiting by her side replied,
that he was attending in the audience-chamber.
" Who is he, and what is his name?” asked.
Elizabeth.
Upon these points no one present could give her
information. They said that he was a young man

in the garb of a soldier, but that his person was
not known to them.
· The queen commanded him to be instantly con-
ducted into her presence.
Every eye was turned eagerly towards the door
at which he was expected to enter, and when that
of Rosalind beheld in the préserver of her godt
mother, her queen, and her protectress, the liust
band of her tenderest affections," a lood' of 'joj
poured into her heart," which overwhelmed all sense
in ecstacy, and, with'a faint sigh, she sunk into
the-arms of the lady Butler, who was standing by
her side. 17. Tistinu
::By those who observed her emotion it was stipe
posed to be occasioned by the agitation of mind into
which the danger of the queen had thrown her,
added to the oppression of the heat caused by the
crowd of persons which filled the apartment, and
she was directly removed from it into purer airline
on Edward saw at his entrance but one object, and
that was the queen." With a' modest expression of
the satisfaction which glowed in his heart- beaming

"And is that the only recompence which thou
desirest for having preserved a sovereign's life ?”
exclaimed Elizabeth '79 whosoever thou art, thy
soul is noble, whether thy blood be so or not.

queen, -bending her looks alternately to the nobles
on either side, “I trust there is no Englishman
who does not rejoice in the preservation of Eliza-
beth; I trust therefore that no Englishman can
envy the honour awarded as the recompence of
England's joy. Elizabeth bestows on her preserver

“ Neither rank nor fortune, but my sword and
honour, madam,” returned Edward.
The queen took a sword from the hand of one of
her attendant lords, and having raised it over the
head of Edward, she said "From this hour thou
art possessed of both-rise a knight of England; and
for the support of thy title: Elizabeth bestows on
thee ten thousand marks of gola."!.!.!.!!
The keenest feelings are the most difficult to be
expressed; such was the case with Edward : joy
confusion, astonishment, and gratitude, met so
forcibly in his heart as to deny him the power of
utterance.
“ By what name shall I inquire for you when I
wish to take my leave of you, previously to your
setting out, and give you my wishes for success in
your expedition ?” asked Elizabeth.
“ Edward is my name, so please your majesty,”
he replied.
“ Sir Edward,” repeated the queen, with em-
phasis ; ;" and so farewell, 'my noble knight.”
- Elizabeth now quitted the apartment, and sir
Edward was directed to attend the queen's secre-
tary at war on the following morning, at the hour
of eight, to receive the documents of his march.

It must be unnecessary to expatiate on the rapture
experienced by sir Edward on having risen to the
favour of the queen by means so honourable and
gratifying to his feelings. With a heart light as
gossamer he returned home, to impart by letter to
Rosalind the overflowing joy of his soul. Scarcely
had he composed bimself for writing, ere one of the
chamberlains of the court entered his apartment,
and dresented him with a Bote, which contained
the following words :-
“'
Oh, my husband, our excellent queen
has learned that it is my Edward who is the pre-
server of her life; this knowledge has removed
every obstacle to your being admitted into her pre-
sence to hasten then to obey the summons of your
gracious sovereign and your affectionate Rosalind.”
When sir Edward raised his eyes from the paper,
the chamberlain who had brought it to him said,
“We wait, sir, to conduct you to our royal mis-
tress.”

: Sir Edward obeyed his signal for descending into
the street, where he found prepared for him to
mount, à horse, richly caparisoned, and a royal
guard to march on either side of him, 'which the
love and loyalty of the people rendered a most used
ful precaution, as the ardour with which all ranks
pressed to behold him would, but for the resolution
of the guard, have entirely obstructed his progress
to the palace.
On arriving there, every idea which he liad ever
before been able to form of happiness was exceeded
by the gracious reception which he received from
Elizabeth, by the shouts of joy which issued from
the lips of the grateful multitude, and; most of all,
by beholding the reflection of that honest pride with
which his own heart was filled in the eyes of his
Rosalind. The sensation was such as none could
have felt with the strength with which Rosalind and
her Edward were impressed by it,' but those who
had, for an equal period, like themselves, drank
of the cup of misery and despair ; it was 'a trans-
portation, as by the power of magic, from the dark
gulph of modring to the lightly buoyant clouds of
fluttering joy , in the imagination it may be drawn

presented to them the young knight, she entered
into consultation with them upon the most advis-
able plan of proceeding against the freebooters. The
first object, it was decided, must be the restoration
of lord William de Mowbray 'to liberty, the next
that of making Allanrod a prisoner, as he appeared
to be the chief animator of the ravaging hordes ;
and, these points being concluded upon, it was re-
ferred to the opinion of sir Edward, what force he
deemed necessary for the undertaking.
He replied, that he desired no more than onė
thousand men, well acquainted with the use of
arms; they were, he said, at least equal to twice
their number of a raw banditti, who were entirely
uninformed of the use of tactics.
Elizabeth directed that the number should be fif-
teen hundred ; and then applied to her secretary at
war to determine from what quarters the requisite
force should be drawn. After some debate upon
this point, it was agreed that three of the fifteen
hundred should be immediately drafted from the
troops now lying in the vicinity of the metropolis,
and be ready to commence their march on the morn
of the second day from the presenti one, and that
expresses should be sent forward upon the road
along which the expedition was to proceed towards
the north, for the like drafts to be made from other
regiments, and added to sir Edward's force as he
passed through the towns in which they were sta-
tioned; and the arrangement was so planned that
viij.

the number of the troops should be completed at
York.
Before the breaking up of the council, it was
suggested to the queen by her ministers, that it
would be regarded by her people as a necessary
proof of her gratitude to Heaven for the blessing of
ber continuing her auspicious reign over them, i
which had been granted to her in the preservation
of her existence, that she should appoint a day for
returning public thanksgiving to that effect in the
cathedral of Saint Paul, and they therefore entreat-
ed her to name one for that purpose. :1: 1.,11
» Elizabeth replied, that she was not deficient to
Heaven in gratitude for the singular protection,
which she had received at its hands, but that she
chose to defer her public, acknowledgment of it,
till the return of sir Edward to London should ena-
ble him to be present with her at the hour of her
devotion, that; by beholding him through whoin
her providential rescue had been effected, hier
mind might be the more firmly bent towards the
cause in which the benefit had originated,
Her ministers, in return; ventured to submit to
hep opinion whether so long a delay, of, an act of
devotion might not appear the effect of coolness in
its performance.
For the possibility of such a supposition the
queen's countenance immediately expressed that!
she would on no account give the shadow of a plea.
It shall, then,” she said, “be the day after
to morrow : sir Edward shall defer his setting out

till the subsequent morning, and attend us to Saint
Paul's."
Matters of public importance being thus de-
cided; the queen reconducted sir Edward to the
apartment where they had left Rosalind, 'to join
the members of the privy council ; and here, an,
midst many particulars of his own history, he im-
parted to the queen, at her command, the account
which had been given him at the convent of Saint
Agnes of the lady Margaret Murray, the cousin of
the bonny Mabel, who had afterwards espoused sir
James Lambrun, a man most devotedly attached
to the interest of the queen of Scotland, and there
appeared scarcely any reason to doubt that she was
the very person now in custody for her attempt
upon the life of Elizabeth., 14 "
The queen and her guests had so much matter
before them for conversation and reflection, that
the night was far advanced ere they retired to rest,
although the health and spirits of both Elizabeth
and her goddaughter were in a state to require the
nourishment of repose.
1 ... here
On the following day. Margaret Lambrun was
brought before the queen's ministers for her exami-
nation. From the investigation which she under-
went, it appeared that she was indeed the daughter,
of the deceased earl of Lednoch, who had preserved
berself from the contagion of the pestilence by flying
to the mountains of Atholi; thatshaving espoused
a man who owed his all to the house of Stuartſ and
on that account had been attached to it with a

strength of affection which bordered upon frenzy,
she had imbibed from him his principles, and
considered it an act of duty to his memory to
fulfil the plan for avenging the death of his mistress,
to which his mind had been devoted for some weeks
previously to his decease.
She had, she confessed, suffered many struggles
within her own breast, and made every effort she
had been capable of, to divert her mind from hier
design, but that all the arguments she had used to
convince herself that it was better to resign her
purpose had only tended to strengthen her in it.
“I have experienced,” she added, " that reason
has no power to restrain a woman from vengeance,
when she is impelled to it by love.”
It had been feared and suspected that Margaret 1
might of been a meinber of some dangerous con-
spiracy, formed perhaps by the Roman Catholics
against the government and the queen ; but on the
present examination of the culprit, it was fully
proved that all apprehensions of this nature, were
without foundation.
One of the nobles present inquired of lenom
“ Since you confess that you experienced many
struggles with your own mind upol lle propriety
of the action which you have commitied, and could
not subdue your idea of the necessity you were
under of attempting it, are you satisfied with having
made the attempt, and happy that it has not been
productive of a fatal consequence, or

Why should I reply to your demand," she
replied, “since the law considers only the at-
tempt ?”
Her answers to various other questions which
were put to her displayed the same collectedness
and strength of mind, but her examiners still
believed her repentant of her crime, although tov
proud of spirit to make confession of it.
The report of Margaret's examination was laid
before the queen, and her majesty at the same time
informed that the necessary preparations for the
trial would be made without delay.
" She must be found guilty, must she not ?"
inquired Elizabeth of the earl of Southampton, who
had brought her an account of the examination, at
which he had been present.
“ There can be no doubt of it, madam," he
replied.
“And death must be the punishment which the
law awards to her crime ?” rejoined the queen.
The earl returned an affirmative answer to her
question, and then retired, upon a signal to that
effect from her majesty.
The queen passed nearly the whole of the after-
noon and evening alone in her private apartment.
On the following morning, at an early hour, sir
Edward received a summons to attend her in her
closet. “ I have an embassy, which I shall request
of you to perform for me to the prison of Margaret
Lambrun," she said. “This is the day appointed
for me to visit the cathedral of Saint Paul, and

return my thanks to Heaven for the preservation of
my life, of which it chose you as the instrument.
The intention of inflicting punishment on those
who have injured us bespeaks resentment against
thern in our breast : how then can I, without wil-
fully drawing down upon myself the vengeance of
Providence, pray that my trespasses may be
forgiven to me, in like manner as I forgive them
who may have trespassed against me, whilst I
permit a fellow-being, who has been guilty of an
offence towards my person, to be detained my
prisoner, for public execution ?---Convey to Mar-
garet Lambrun that paper -- it contains her
pardon.”
By this unparallelled benignity of soul, ma-
dam,” exclaimed sir Edward, you increased the
glory I have been blessed by rendering you, since
by it you afford one more proof of the many virtues
that had died with you had the assassin's blow been
fatal.”
“ But,” added Elizabeth, “inform her, that ere
the expiration of a week, it is my condition that she
quit my kingdom for ever ; I will provide ber an
escort out of it, and, if she be destitute of them,
with the means of life.”
Sir Edward immediately proceeded to the Tower,
and was conducted to the apartment of the lady
Margaret. She expressed a haughty surprise at
his appearance, the motive of which he explained
by putting into her hand the pardon, to which the
royal signature was affixed, and which he presented

to her with an impressive eulogy on the humanity
of the queen, and the gratitude with which the
conduct of Elizabeth ought to fill her heart.
Having twice or thrice successively perused the
contents of this paper, as if doubtful of the evidence
of her senses, she raised her eyes to sir Edward,
and said, in her usual tone of firmness --" Since
the queen of England has vouchsafed to grant me
her pardon, be pleased, sir, to acquaint her majesty,
that I have but one poor request to make of her,
which she shall receive from me, in the course of
a few hours, in writing.”
Sir Edward having executed the commission
with which his royal mistress had charged him,
returned to inform her of the reception which it
had met with from the object of her humanity.
“ Whatever that request, it shall be granted,”
the queen said ; and, decked with the smiles of
conscious benevolence, she proceeded to her
chamber, to attire herself in a manner appropriate
to the business of the day.
At the appointed hour the religious procession,
in the centre of which moved Elizabeth, passed in
solemn order from the palace to the church ; it
was graced by the presence of every noble who had
received intimation of the design in time to become
ay part of her train; and the blessings of the popu.

delivered to her by the lieutenant of the Tower.
He had been commissioned, he said, by Margaret
Lambrun, to put it into her majesty's own hand.
The queen tore it hastily open, and found the
contents to be these :
MADAM,
Ere you have perused these lines,
I shall be at peace for ever. Whilst I feared
that an act of suicide might be imputed to the
dread of those tortures to which the voice of justice
might condemn me, I determined to endure life,
rather than submit my reputation to the obloquy of
such cowardice ; now your gracious pardon has
removed that apprehension, and no motive can be
attributed to my self-destruction, but my desire of
uniting my spirit with those of my esteemed
friends, who are no longer of this earth, I do not
hesitate to swallow the draught of death ; and the
only petition which I leave behind me is that of
being committed to the earth with the ceremonies
of the Catholic church, of which I have lived a
member: such is the prayer of the dying
MARGARET LAMBRUN:"
With a countenance on which the greatest con-
sternation and surprise were depicted, the queen

turned to the lieutenant, and inquired whether he
had not left Margaret alive."
His reply was, that he had received the letter
from her own hands.
Elizabeth communicated to him the contents,
and directed that he should immediately return to
the Tower, and make personal investigation into
her safety; and if he found her still living, to
withhold her from committing the act of violence
upon which she appeared determined.
Accompanied by the earl of Suffolk, and two
other gentlemen commissioned by the queen to
attend him, the lieutenant şped to the Tower, and
directly led the way to the apartments where
Margaret was a prisoner : she was not in the first,
and they proceeded to the second chamber, in which
stood her bed; upon it they found her extended :
her frame was torn with convulsions, and her fea-
tures fixed in the agonies of death. Medical aid
was instantly called in to her 'assistance, but it
arrived in vain ; the struggle in which they had
found her was her last, and, with a deep and
lengthened groan, her spirit fled into eternity.
Upon her table, near her bed, stood a drinking
cup, at the bottom of which appeared a sediment
of a dark nature, with a few drops of water floating
above it; this was the remnant of the poison which
she had swallowed: by its side lay a small silver
box, in which the drug had been contained.
Although the queen had nothing to reproach

herself with on the score of humanity in the case
of the deceased Margaret, still she received the in-
telligence of her death with many expressions of
regret, and some degree of painful reflection. Her
untimely end was a link of the chain of miseries
which the death of Mary had wound round the
hearts of the Scotch : and once more Elizabeth
wished in vain that she could recall thic first inimis
cal action of wiich she had been guilty towards the
fallen monarch.

MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
The succeeding day was that appointed for the set-
ting out of sir Edward against the borderers.
With the first of the morning the queen called
to her one of her ministers; she had pledged her
word to grant the last request of Margaret Lambrun.
and to him she issued her commands for the ob-
servance of her promise, by directing the body to
be removed into Scotland for interment, and order-
ing that inquiry should be made at Rockmount

Castle for that of her husband, sir James, in order
that he might be laid by the side of his wife.
This done, she dispatched a courier to Rock-
mount Castle upon a business of a different nature:
him she charged with a mandate to lord Rufus
himself, commanding him to appear before her
without delay in London: for although from Rosa-
lind she had learnt him to have been vanquished by
the moss-troopers, she doubted not that he had
already paid the ransom fixed upon for his liberty,
and returned to his despoiled castle.
Having made these arrangements, she entered
her breakfast apartment, and sent to invite Rosalind
and her husband to join her at her repast, that she
might enjoy the society of the latter, for a few
hours, previously to his departure, which was to
take place about noon. -
The various concerns which had occupied the
mind of the queen that morning had caused her to
begin her meal full an hour after her usual time ;
and herself and her happy guests had not yet risen
from table, when one of her attendant gentlemen
entered the apartment, and informed her that lord
William de Mowbray was arrived at the palace, and
entreated to be admitted to the presence of her
majesty.
Upon the receipt of this intelligence, the greatest
surprise was depicted on the countenances of the
queen and her guests, while the gentle Rosalind
could with difficulty prevent herself from falling off
her seat.

765
The queen perceived her emotion, and imme-
diately addressed her in these words—“ Rosalind,
you forget that you are under the protection of a
inother and a queen, united in one person.
Then turning to the gentleman from whom she
had received the information of lord William's arri.
val, she said—“Is it known to you whether the
baron de Mowbray is acquainted that sir Edward
and his daughter are the inmates of my palace ?”
“ So please your Majesty, I have no reason to
believe that he knows it,” was the reply.
“Let him then be kept in ignorance of it,” re-
joined the
queen;
and to this command she added
her directions for him to be conducted into an
apartment till she was ready to receive him, which,
she said, he might be informed, she should shortly
be.
When the messenger had quitted the room-
“ Heaven be praised,” exclaimed Rosalind, " that
my father is no longer the prisoner of the dreaded
Allanrod !"
“ I commend thy filial affection, my Rosalind,”
said the queen, “which shines forth with additional
lustre in proportion to the acquaintance which
those who behold it have with the very slender
claim that your parent's conduct towards you has
left him to excite it in your breast.
“ He is still the author of my being,” replied
the trembling Rosalind, “ and I feel it the first duty
of that existence to implore my sovereign to tem-
per the resentment against him, which my past

sufferings have excited in her heart, with a lenient
consideration for the errors to which human nature
is prone.'
“ Exalted, generous woman !” exclaimed the
queen, worthy the love and admiration of thy
sovereign ! the dove-like supplications of thy for-
giving nature shall not fall unheeded upon the ear
of Elizabeth, because Elizabeth will not neglect the
performance of any act whereby she may add to
the happiness of her meritorious god-daughter."
Rosalind kissed the extended hand of her sove-
reign, but her heart was now too full for utterance.
In the course of a few minutes the queen arose
from her breakfast-table, and telling sir Edward
and Rosalind that it would probably not be very
long before she would summon them into her pre-
sence, she proceeded to another apartment, into
which she commanded the baron de Mowbray to be
conducted to her.
On his entrance, the queen, who had seated her-
self at the upper end of tie apartment, gave him a
reception which bore neither the marks of pleasure
nor the reverse. With a countenance dressed in
smiles and humility, he advanced towards her, and
kneeling at her feet, whilst he touched with his
lips the glove that covered her hand, he poured
forth many adulative expressions upon the joy
which he experienced at once more entering her
presence.
" It surprises me, I confess, to behold you here,"
returned Elizabeth ; " for I had learnt that you

767
were the prisoner of the freebooters, and had pre-
pared a force to march to your rescue.”
Lord William returned the queen his most grate-
ful thanks for her kind intention, and then besought
her to suffer the troops which she had selected for
the purpose of his rescue to proceed without delay
to that of his daughter Rosalind, who, he said, had
been torn from De Mowbray Castle by the free.
booters that had despoiled it, and, he doubted not,
been conveyed to the same fortress in which he had
himself been a prisoner, as he had understood it to
be the residence of the chief of the banditti, the
dreaded Allanrod. And what, he said, increased
his apprehensions for her safety, was the demand
which had been made of him by Allanrod, to grant
bis daughter to lord Rufus de Madginecourt to wife,
as the price of his own ransom.
" And does this demand on the part of the free-
booter Allanrod increase your apprehensions for
her safety ?” asked Elizabeth. Surely I do not
comprehend you aright, for it has been reported to
me, that you had used every means in your power
to compel your daughter into the arms of lord
Rufus de Maginecourt.”
Lord William felt entirely at a loss what to de-
cide the queen's feelings with regard to the union
he had once endeavoured to contract for Rosalind
with lord Rufus ; and equally fearful of condemn-
ing himself, if her sentiments were unfavourable
towards it, by maintaining silence, he said-
“ There was a time, my sovereign, when I should

have approved the alliance of De Maginecourt with
my daughter, but” He hesitated.
**." I suppose that you had been misrepresented to
me,” replied the queen, with coolness, but with
point, “ for I judged that, had an alliance been in
agitation, the approbation of her royal godmother
would have been asked to grace it."
The baron felt the reproof, and eager to turn the .
thoughts of the queen from himself to one more
culpable, he replied The conduct of lord Rufus
has since that period been of so 'different a nature
to what it then was, that I would sooner have fol-
lowed my daughter to the grave than to the altar as
his bride. Since I have been the prisoner of the
freebooters, I have discovered him to be guilty in
the point of loyalty as well as friendship ; for the
demand which Allanrod caused to be made to me
of giving my daughter's hand to his friend, lord
Rufus de Maginecourt, plainly bespeaks some
secret connexion to subsist between them. Thus,
in his union with an enemy of the state, lord Rufus
proves himself a foe to its interests."
Lord' William paused. The queen passed a few
minutes in reflection upon the strangeness of the in-
formation which he had conveyed to her, and
doubtful whether to believe it the truth or a fallacy.
If it were true that Allanrod had demanded the
daughter of De Mowbray to wife for lord Rufus de
Madginecourt, some tie, some friendly union must
subsist between them, to have caused this demand
on the part of the freebooter; and if Allanrod had

been authorized by lord Rufus to make this demand
for him, why had not lord Rufus profited by the
time during which Rosalind had heen the inmate of
his castle, for forcing her into compliance with his
will? From Rosalind she had learnt that during
this period, lord Rufus had informed her that
Allanrod had demanded her to wife for himself, and
lord Rufus had suffered his castle to stand the
attack of a siege, rather than deliver her into his
power. These were contradictory circumstances,
points from which the queen new not what conclu-
sion to draw ; and if the assertion which lord
William had made to her, of Allanrod having re-
quired the hand of Rosalind to be given to De
Madginecourt as the price of his liberty, were a fal-
lacy, she could not imagine to what end he had de-
vised and propagated it.
The baron de Mowbray we have, throughout the
series of adventures in which we have witnessed
him, perceived to be a man inoffensive towards
those who placed no obstacles in the way of his
favourite passion of aggrandizement of power and
wealth, and heedless what unjust action he com-
mitted were self-interest was concerned; it was,
therefore, in the present instance, natural to such
a character as his was, however he might feel in-
terested in the fate of his daughter, exposed as he
believed her to the power of a band of freebooters,
to feel still more for his own safety, which was
trembling under the threatened accusation of the
resolute Hubert.

Accordingly, finding it difficult any longer to re-
strain that subject which was uppermost in his
heart from mounting to his lips, he broke the si-
lence which had for some minutes prevailed, by
saying—“Upon the house of De Mowbray the
countenance of my gracious sovereign has ever
shone with the most conspicuous and benign par.
tiality; it is therefore not only with satisfaction,
but with pride, that I inform her that there is at
this moment existing an attack, a base calumny,
levelled against the honour of that house, in which
her interference is most materially requisite for the
preservation of its fame in the eye of society.”
To what he was now referring the queen was
entirely ignorant, and therefore directed him to
explain.
With many pauses and hesitations he gave the
demanded explanation; but he said nothing of
Hubert's having threatened to accuse him of hav-
ing commanded the murder of the child; he merely
acquainted the queen that, having entrusted the
care of an infant, whom he wished to have brought
up in obscurity, to one of his vassals for that pur-
pose, that vassal had murdered it for the sake of
possessing undivided the means with which he had
furnished him for its maintenance and his own;
and that judging some severe punishment due to
him for the crime, yet undetermined in what way
to proceed against him, he had brought him in
chains to London, in order to act under the advice
of the queen.

781
The baron's story carried with it evidences of its
own imperfectness, which could not pass upon the
acute senses of Elizabeth, and she said " But,
my lord, I do not perceive in what manner a crime
committed by a vassal is to reflect that violent dis-
grace of which you speak upon the house of De
Mowbray. Let me clearly understand upon what
grounds your apprehensions of this nature are
founded.”
With still more hesitation, the baron was obliged
to confess, that the criminal, frenzied by the tor-
ture of his own mind, had declared an intention of
accusing him of having commanded the death of
the child,
“ If it be proved,” replied the queen, “ that the
senses of the accuser are really deranged by the
corroding reflections of his mind, bis accusation
will be of no avail. If this is not the case, the
credit given to his accusation will materially de-
pend on the degree of interest which you will be
found to have in the death or existence of the child.
- Who was the infant whom you desired to have
reared in seclusion from the world ?" she added.
“ One nearly connected with myself,” returned
lord William, forcing a smile, and desiring to con-
vey to the queen that it had been an illegitimate
child of bis own.
Elizabeth probably comprehended him thus, for
she answered" It had been a safer case for you,
my lord, if the infant had not been at all connected

with yourself; those are the worst of crimes which
are engendered in folly, and matured in vice.”
These words she spoke with asperity, and added,
after a moment's pause—“And who, my lord, is
this accuser whom you dread 7”
“He was once a soldier in my ranks, so please
your gracious majesty,” returned De Mowbray:
“his name is Hubert.”
“Hubert " echoed the queen, and sunk into
thought; for the idea of that Hubert whe had been
the faithful follower of sir Edward immediately en-
tered her mind; and although she could not for an
instant admit the probability of a soul noble and
disinterested as his had been described to her being
the agent of a crime of the horrid nature of an in-
fant's murder, still as she dwelt on the gold of
which sir Edward had found him possessed when
enlarged by him from the prison in Flanders, and
on the mysterious manner in which he had parted
from him soon after their arrival in England, de-
claring that the business he was going upon was for
the eventual happiness of his master, she believed
that his wealth might have been acquired by his
having been made the guardian of this child of
which De Mowbray had spoken, and that his
strength of attachment to his master might have
led him into the false opinion of conceiving that
the accusation he had resolved upon preferring
against lord Wiliam, relative to that child, might,
by working the fall of the baron, cause the

restoration of Rosalind and her husband to hap-
piness.
This idea once admitted, the queen could not
divest her mind of it, and she inquired of lord
William, how long it was since he had entrusted
the child of which he had spoken to the care of this
Hubert 2 -
He replied, that it was now full four years,
he believed nearly five, since the event had taken
place.
This Elizabeth recollected was about the period
at which Hubert had been represented to her to
have left England in quest of his captive bene-
factor Edward. This recollection strengthened the
suspicion which she had before entertained: should
the time of his return to England tally with that
of Edward's follower, she considered that she
should be confirmed in it. To this end, she in-
quired of the baron, when he had first seen Hubert
aſter the time of his committing the child to his
care 2
In reply to this question, the baron stated the
unexpected appearance of Hubert before him in
the cedar chamber of his own castle, when he was
lamenting the devastation made in it by the free-
booters.
The queen was now fully confirmed in her
suspicion of its being the same Hubert to whom the
preserver of her life owed his escape from his
captivity in Flanders; and unable to reconcile
these apparent contradictions, she desired to hear

the account which Hubert should himself give of
the transaction, and its consequences, 'as the
various occurrences of which she had lately gained
acquaintance from the lips of her god-daughter had
given her some insight into the crafty disposition
of De Mowbray, and she therefore doubted the
correctness of the information he had just laid
before her.
" Where is this Hubert to be found ?" asked
Elizabeth.
The baron described a particular spot in the
vicinity of the Tower, where he had left him in the
custody of Irwin, and those two of his soldiers who
had escaped from the stronghold of Allanrod,
The queen rose from her seat, and in forming
lord William that she would see him again pre-
sently, quitted the apartment; and having com-
manded Hubert to be brought to the palace, she
sent to summon sir Edward to meet her in ano-
ther apartment. She judged that the nature of the
conference which she wished to hold with him,
relative to the strange situation in which the baron
de Mowbray had expressed himself to be placed,
might be too overpowering to the feelings of a
daughter, who had not forgotten the parent in the
injuries which she had received at the hands of
the father, and therefore she forbore to extend
her invitation to Rosalind.
Sir Edward heard her account of what had
passed between herself and the baron de Mowbray
with the greatest astonishment, and declared that

775
the case was of so extraordinary a kind, that he
could not venture a surmise upon its real state,
till he had likewise heard the account which Hu-
bert should himself give of it, of the strict honour
of whose heart and principles he made an asseve-
ration of that strength which was to be expected
from the tongue of a man who stood indebted to
him for the blessings of which he was now in pos-
session.
To sir Edward, the point was one of the most
delicate nature: it appeared that either the saviour
of his peace and existence, or the father of his
beloved wife, must be proved a criminal of the
blackest dye; and with the most painful agitation
painted on his countenance, he continued to tra-
verse the apartment in silence, whilst the queen
sat lost in reflections equally perplexing and dis-
tressing
At length Hubert was announced. In his way
to the palace, he had gained intelligence of those
facts of which the baron de Mowbray was still igno-
rant; and the instant he was conducted into the
apartment, rushing towards sir Edward, he fell at
his feet, and clasping his knees, he exclaimed-
Joy! joy to my beloved master! amidst the
blessings called down upon thine head by a grateful
nation, although the last to greet thy excellence,
not the least fervent is the voice of thy faithful
Hubert."
Even the presence of the queen, and the awful
crisis of the moment, did not prevent sir Edward

776

from acknowledging the gratitude with which he
received these testimonies of joy and fidelity from
his tried friend; but having in few, although ex-
pressive words, declared to him the sentiments of
his heart, he admonished him of the presence they
were in.
Turning his eyes with the utmost humility and
reverence towards the queen—" Although my
speech,” he said, “ be not sufficiently refined for
address of majesty, the gracious sovereign in
whose presence I now kneel, has, in the instance
of my loved master, displayed too forcibly her re-
gard for the heart of worth and honesty, to make
me fear that her displeasure should fall on one who
has only the sincerity of his loyalty to recommend
him to her hearing. May heaven lay up in store
for thee to future ages, gracious queen, an hundred-
fold of that bliss with which my own feelings ac-
quaint me that your benignity has filled his heart!”
The honest fervour of Hubert in the cause of his
master drew a tear into the eye of Elizabeth ; and
as she wiped it from her cheek she rejoined-
“ Were all my subjects like thee, I were a happy
queen indeed !"
Then suddenly recollecting the accusation pre-
ferred against him by the baron de Mowbray, wbich
the interesting scene of his meeting with his revered
master had for the moment driven from her remem-
brance, she added, in an impressive tone" Hea-
ven grant that thou prove as worthy, upon the in-
vestigation of thy inmost soul, as it is my desire to
find the !"

“Oh, Hubert Ioh, my friend !-- whose services
have entwined thee round my heart,” exclaimed
sir Edward, “ should it be possible that thou hast
committed any action which casts a spot upon thy
fame-which must render thee less perfect, less
exalted in mine eyes than thou now appearest in
them, that heart would, upon such a conviction,
feel a pang far, far beyond the bliss of which thy
means have made it the possessor.”
Whilst sir Edward was speaking, a smile of the
utmost serenity and inward satisfaction of mind
stole over the countenance of Hubert, and in a tone
of voice correspondent with it in composure he re-
plied——" Has then the lord de Mowbray been pre-
ferring an accusation against me here? It is but
as I expected, and as I hoped.”
“ Hoped I say you hoped ?” demanded Eliza-
beth
Hubert repeated his declaration.
Still more surprised than ever, the queen com-
manded him to explain his meaning.
Falling upon his knees, from which he had just
before been permitted to rise, Hubert said—“Most
gracious sovereign ! if the services which I have
rendered to my beloved master have any weight in
the scale of your good opinion, as having been the
mean instruments of enabling him to perform the
blessed, the meritorious act which has drawn upon
him your royal favour, by the remembrance of
those services I implore your majesty, that, in the
presence of your gracious self, I may be permitted
to hear lord William state his accusation."

This request appeared to Elizabeth one of an un-
common nature ; but the expressive eye of sir
Edward ranked so forcibly on the side of the
pleader, that Elizabeth commanded the baron to
be conducted into the apartment.
Hubert's arms were bound together at the wrists,
with chains which had been put upon them by the
command of the baron, immediately on their quit-
ting De Mowbray Castle : this circumstance assured
the
queen
that he could intend no treachery against
the life of his accuser, as he had not the power of
performing it; and thus convinced, she began to
fear the discovery of some great evil on the part of
lord William.
Hubert again addressed the queen.—" I beseech
your majesty,” he said, “ that having granted thus
much concerning myself to my petition, you will
grant still a little more for the sake of my accuser ;
permit not any of your attendants, so please your
gracious majesty, to be present at the discussion
which is about to take place between the baron de
Mowbray and myself. I repeat, that I make this
entreaty for the sake of my accuser."
From her irresolution how to reply to this de-
mand, the queen was relieved by the entrance of
De Mowbray, whose eyes instantly fell upon
sir
Edward.
Had a damning fiend, charged with the mandate
of futurity to hurl him to the nether world, encoun-
tered the sight of the baron, the life-blood could not
have turned colder at his heart, nor the strength of
manhood have fled more rapidly from his trembling

knees: thrice his bleached lips moved without ut-
terance; he staggered towards a chair, and leant
upon it for support.
“Art thou astonished,” demanded Elizabeth,
“to behold one doomed by thee to languish out a life
of misery within a captive's cell, transplanted to a
soil where the rays of my favour shall warm him into
bliss Thy senses do not deceive thee: it is the
same Edward who, in return for the little bounty
which he for a while received at thy hands, has
groaned beneath thy tyrannous persecution—an in-
justice to which I should call upon thee to explain
thy cause of provocation, and to make remuneration
to the sufferer, were not thy offence in this parti-
cular lost in the greater guilt of that crime with
which thine own lips have informed me that thou
art accused by this man.”
The queen paused.
The baron appeared several different times to be
on the point of speaking, but as often closed his lips
again, with marks of the greatest agitation of mind
depicted on his countenance ere a sound had es-
caped them. -
“Prove thyself innocent of the accusation which
thine own tongue first taught me to know that this
Hubert had against thee, and I shall suppose thee
likewise falsified in other accusations,” said Eliza-
beth; and having said this, she waved her hand to
her lords in waiting, and they all left the apartment.
The eye of Hubert sparkled with pleasure at this
command on the part of the queen; and as soon as

they were departed, the baron De Mowbray ap-
peared more at ease in consequence of their absence,
and addressed Hubert in this words>" Where,
vile miscreant, is that child which I entrusted to
thy guardianship ?”
“Do you, my lord, speak of that babe,” replied
Hubert, calmly, “concerning which you said to me,
that no art in the hiding up of those that live can
equal the security of the
grave
?"
Sovereign of my hopes !” exclaimed De Mow-
bray, addressing the queen, “canst thou credit that
I would speak thus of a babe, which I have already
declared to have been nearly connected with myself?
-because I conceived it conducive to the honour
of my hour to have it reared in obscurity, am I
therefore to be judged guilty of having willed its un-
fair death."
“ Prove to me that you were interested in its ex-
stence," answered the queen," and you will re-
move my suspicions."
“ Is not every one,” cried the baron, with in-
creasing agitation, “ interested in the fate of those
whose blood flows from their own ?"
" But that interest is sometimes of a nature to
bear the most cruel consequences to the hearts of
those descendants,” returned Elizabeth : “ witness
the union into which you would have forced your
daughter with the lord de Madginecourt : you were
doubtless urged by interest to inflict on her the cru-
elties which she then experienced at your hands."
“ But, madam,” exclaimed De Mowbray, stung

to the soul by this evidence of the queen's acquaint-
ance with his former proceedinge, “ if I exerted my
authority over a daughter possessed of reason, to
point out to her the utility of my plans, but wilfully
blind to her own happiness and mine is it thence
to be inferred that I should become the monster to
command the death of her innocent babe ?”.
“ Her babe !” exclaimed the queen,
“ the babe
of Rosalind ! —was it then her babe which you en-
trusted to the care of this man and was it not
born without life, as its unhappy mother was taught
to believe it?"
The confession had escaped the lips of the baron
and every turn of his agonized countenance was a
confirmation of its truth.
Hubert again sunk upon his knees~" Blessed
Heaven!” he cried, “ do thou give ear to this
avowal! And thou, oh, gracious queen, Heaven's
choicest delegate on earth! do thou inscribe upon
the tablets of thine heart this joyful confession!
Yes, my beloved master, thou art the father of a
babe, lovely as blooming parents like yourselves
could wish the offspring of your loves.

adopted any other method than the one I have pur-
sued in the cause of this deserted helpless infant,
that the grandsire who had endeavoured to nip the
blossom in its bud might deny it ever to have pos-
sessed being, my invention has been turned to the
means of obtaining from his own lips a confession
of its existence at its birth: that confession is ob-
tained, and the happiness of my life is complete.”

With her hands clasped towards heaven, the
queen stood with her eyes half fixed upon De
Mowbray, half averted from him in horror: with
him all sense seemed lost in shame, in disappoint-
ment, and in the tortures of conscience.
Sir Edward had fallen upon the neck of Hubert;
and had the mingled emotions of joy, 'surprise, and
gratitude, left him the power of rendering his words
articulate, he would have been heard to pour forth
blessings on the man who, to the salvation of the
father, had added that of his helpless and oppressed
infant.
“I told you, my loved master," when we parted
in Northumberland,” said Hubert, “ that it was
for your eventual happiness that we were about to
separate: the cause is now explained to you, as is
likewise the declaration that I made to our gracious
sovereign, that, in requesting this interview might
be without witnesses, I made that demand for the
sake of my accuser.”
“ Monster of criminality !” exclaimed the queen,
addressing De Mowbray, “ does not thy soul sink
within thee at beholding the virtuous integrity
which thy temptations have not been able to shake?
Does not thy heart sicken at the lesson of humanity
afforded thee by a vassal? I have pledged my
promise to thy godlike daughter, who is now, where
she ought long since to have been, under my pro-
tection, to treat thee with mercy: to her, therefore,
and not to Elizabeth, thou owest the lenity that
will be extended towards thy crime ; but although

I do not follow thee with the rigour of the law,
mine eyes must never fall on thee again—quit for
ever the presence of Elizabeth.”
The baron endeavoured to move towards the
door of the apartment, but his tottering limbs re-
fused to bear him to it, and he sunk upon a couch
near which he was standing." Shield me! shield
me from the sight of my wronged child !” he groan-
ed forth in accents 'scarcely audible ; “ bury me
within some cloister's walls, where solitude and re-
pentance may be my only companions to the
grave !"
• The queen advanced towards Hubert, and taking
with her own hands the chains fronı his wrists, she
said" Ere this last action of thy excellent heart
was known to me, I had decreed thee a reward for
thy services to the preserver of my life: what re-
ward that shall be, we will hereafter determine;
become, meanwhile, the esquire of that valorous
knight, whom it has hitherto been thy pride to
follow in a meaner capacity.”
Having said this, the queen summoned her at-
tendants, and commanding them not to quit the
apartment, but to watch over the baron de Mow-
bray, whom she expressed as ill at ease in his mind,
she directed sir Edward and Hubert to follow her.
*. She led the way to her closet, and when they
had entered it, she said." You must perceive, sir
Edward, that it is most essential to the happiness
of your Rosalind that she should never again behold
her father, or be made acquainted with the crime

which he once intended to her innocent child. He
has himself spoken of a monastery as a fit retreat
for his future life: I will therefore furnish him with
a letter to the abbot of the Holy Ghost in Wiltshire,
whose members are never permitted again to return
into the world, from the moment of their first
entering its walls, commanding that he be instantly
received as a brother of the order.”
The heart of sir Edward, like that of his Rosa-
lind, ever leant towards the side of mercy; but he
foresaw too much danger to the happiness of
himself, and those who formed that happiness, in
the restoration of a man like the baron de Mow-
bray, whose passions were under the control of
neither reason nor religion, to his former rank in
life, to consider that it became him to urge any
petition to the queen for the permission of his con-
tinuance amidst society; accordingly, the moment
the queen had composed her epistle, some gen-
tlemen in whom she placed confidence were called
to her, and the contents having been entrusted to
them, they were directed to remove him from the
palace, and to loose no time in beginning their
journey with him into Wiltshire.
Sir Edward considered that as the husband of the
baron's daughter, it was a becoming condescension
in him to be himself the messenger of the queen's
proceedings in his favour to lord William ; accord-
ingly, having obtained the permission of Elizabeth
to this end, he returned to the apartment where he
had left the baron; and scarcely had he reached

the door, ere a scene of the most affecting nature
met his sight.
Rosalind, the tender Rosalind, racked with the
tortures of suspense and apprehension, and no
longer able to endure absence from the apartment
in which she supposed the queen to be closeted
with lord William and her husband, had just entered
it with trembling steps, and was flying to the em-
brace of her father, who, with his face buried in his
hands, turned from her imploring arms, and in a
voice of agony shrieked forth the crime which ren-
dered him unworthy to be clasped in them.
The mother's heart is never dead to the memory
of that offspring for which she has borne the pangs
of birth ; and at the sound of its name, a thousand
perplexing ideas of hope and affection burst upon
her brain.
:.“ What, what of my child ? tell me, I implore
you, tell me if my infant lives?” she exclaimed, in
a tone of voice almost as frenzied as that in which
her father had addressed his frantic exclamations to
her.
Yes, yes, it lives!! replied De Mowbray;
“but thy father would have snapped its tender
stem of life, and burled his soul to"
Rosalind heard no more with a feint shriek she
sunk into the arms of her husband, who bore her
instantly from the apartment.
In his way with her to a chamber, he was met
by the queen, who comprehending from the few
words which sir Edward let fall, what was the cause

of Rosalind's senseless state, conceived nothing so
essential to her future peace as to prevent à second
meeting between her and her father, which she
dreaded that the dutiful and forgiving temper of
her goddaughter might induce her to seek; she
therefore 'accelerated the departure of the fallen
baron, who, if he had a wish remaining in life, it
was the wish of hiding himself from the scrutiny of
every eye.
Till the necessary preparations could be made
for his setting out, he was taken to the house of
lord Burleigh, who, as the uncle,of his late wife,
could not refuse him a temporary shelter beneath
his roof, and where the fever of disappointment and
remorse rose in his brain to a height that seemed
to threaten to strike at the root of his life.
The queen watched the return of sense to the
overpowered frame of the unfortunate Rosalind :
when that period arrived, sad and desponding were
the feelings of her mind; but the gentle reasonings
of the queen, aided by the persuasions of her be-
loved Edward, instilled some degree of calmness
into her soul, and, after a time, won her into con-
fessing the necessity of her being withheld from far-
ther communication with her parent; and no pains
were omitted to convince her that his own wish

From the gloomy, contemplation of her father,
she turned to the blissful expectation of clasping
in her arms a pledge of her love for her revered

saviour of her child's existence: and Hubert enter-
ed the apartment, and knelt by the side of the
couch upon which she lay extended.
Tears alone fell from her eyes, and she was un-
able to advance the inquiries which she had in her
own mind prepared to make of him. The soul of
Hubert melted in sympathy with the feelings of the
mother, and an interval of the most affecting silence
ensued.
At length the desired explanation flowed from
his lips : he said, that having resolved to use the
money which the baron had given him as the price
of his removing the child from Cumberland for the
enlargement of his loved master from captivity, he
had immediately, upon receiving the infant at the
hands of lord William, conveyed it to the cottage
of a sister of his own, married to one of the shep-
herds on the mountains, and in whose kindness
and motherly attentions to it he knew that he could
confide.
“ This done,” continued Hubert, “ I proceeded
into Flanders : with all that befell me in that
country you are already acquainted; I have only
to explain the reason of my not having informed sir
Edward that he was a father, and that I had been so
fortunate as to have had it in my power to preserve
the life of his babe. It had then struck me that
my single voice would be insufficient to prove its
birth-that nothing could effectually substantiate
its ever having lived, but the confession of lord
William himself; accordingly, I resolved to tell

my loved master nothing of his child, till I could
present it to him as the acknowledged grandson of
the baron de Mowbray.
“When we parted in Northumberland, and sir
Edward proceeded in his disguise to De Mowbray
Castle, I went in quest of his child. My sister
had removed her abode, and several days elapsed
before I was able to discover her new dwelling. I
found her situated not a day's journey from De
Mowbray Castle, and the treasure which I had en-
trusted to her keeping well and happy. It had so
chanced, that scarcely an hour before the time of
my reaching the cottage of my sister, lord William
had left it ; he had called at it for refreshment, on
his way to his own castle from the stronghold of
the freebooters, after having escaped from the cap-
tivity in which he had been held by them. I re-
solved to follow him to his castle, and obtain the
interview with him which had been long planned
in my mind. On reaching the castle, I found it
despoiled by the freebooters, and the baron its only
inhabitant: this appeared a most favourable oppor-
tunity for working upon his mind in the manner I
had resolved to do, and I entered his presence. It
must be needless to describe the surprise with
which he beheld me—the fury with which he heard
me declare my intention of delivering him into the
hands of justice, that he might expiate, in a manner
agreeable to the mandates of the law, the crime
which he had induced me to commit. I doubted
not that this threat on my part would provoke him

789
to throw the supposed murder solely upon me,
and that, in order to procure the infliction of
public punishment upon me for the death of the
child, he must first prove it to have liad existence :
thus, with the greatest satisfaction, I beheld the
effect which my declaration had produced on his
mind. His passion drove him to such extremes,
that, I believe, had I been unattended, and he
armed, I had not left his presence alive ; but his
arms had been taken from him by the freebooters,
and I found a most serviceable companion in that
dog, my compassion for whose hungry state first
drew upon me the good opinion of my revered
master, and which I had left with my sister during
my absence from England, as one of the guardians
of the child which I had entrusted to her care.
" It was my intention,"continued Hubert, “to
have detained lord William a prisoner for some
days in his despoiled casile, and to have endea-
voured to work his mind to repentance; but the
arrival of Irwin and his companions defeated that
plan, and I was obliged to return to my original
device of drawing him on to confess that the
child had been born alive. Those powers which
never sleep to the wrongs of the oppressed inno-
cent stretched out their arms in my cause, and
the proudest wish of my soul is accomplished.”
It will doubtless be perceived that beautiful boy
on which the eyes of the baron fell when he awoke
from his repose in the cot of the hospitable shep-
herd was his own grandchild; with this particular

Hubert was acquainted, and made it known to the
parents of the babe.
The queen expressed not less impatience than
Rosalind and her husband to behold the child
whose interests were so nearly allied with their
own, and which had thus long been the sport of
fortune; and Hubert was requested to set out
without delay, and conduct him to the arms of
his anxious father and mother.
No commission could have been of a more
pleasing nature to Hubert, and he insisted on be-
ginning his journey towards Cumberland that very
afternoon. Elizabeth observed the impatient fond-
ness of a mother's heart beaming in the eyes of
Rosalind, and immediately promised to provide
him with horses and attendants for his journey.
Till the hour of his departure, Hubert was not
permitted to quit the apartment wbich contained
his master and Rosalind ; and as they dwelt on
the strange occurrences which had marked their
lives, Hubert, addressing the lady Rosalind, said
-" There is one circumstance which I doubt not
still appears a mystery to you, and which I have
often wished to have it in my power to explain to
you—I mean the voice which, on the evening of
your interview with the baron in the cedar cham-
ber, called to him to spare you : it was mine,
lady; I had discovered a private and disused pas-
sage at the back of this chamber, which led to-
wards that of Gertrude: and towards her apart-
ment I was proceeding, in order to deliver to her

a request from my master that you would meet him
at the chapel, when overhearing what was passing
between you and lord William, I could not for-
bear endeavouring to serve your cause, by calling
out in the manner I did.”
“ And were you the form which I beheld, on
the day subsequent to my marriage, enter my
chamber, and afterwards appear in the door-way
of the cedar chamber ?” asked Rosalind.
This supposition Hubert also confirmed, by say-
ing, that he had at that time been seeking an op-
portunity of informing her of the sudden departure
of sir Edward for Flanders, but had been frus-
trated in his attempt at gaining access to her.
The moment the horses and attendants which
the queen had commanded for the use of Hubert
were ready to depart, he set out on his journey,
carrying with him the blessings of the hapyy pa-
rents whom he left behind, and receiving the
farewell of Rosalind in an embrace of affectionate
gratitude.
Hubert had not long quitted the palace ere lord
Burleigh arrived at it, and brought with him
information that the first violent transports of
lord William's emotions having subsided, he had
himself demanded his journey to be accelerated by
every possible means towards the monastery in
which the future period of his life was to be passed.
-" It is now,” added lord Burleigh, “ nearly an
hour since he quitted London, rejoicing in nothing
so much as that a second interview with his daugh-
ter had been spared him."

May this slender proof of his consciousness of
that evil repute in which all characters of worth
must hold him," said Elizabeth, “ lead him to
devote the future hours of his existence to such
sincere repentance as may purify his soul, and
render him worthy to unite in another state with
those of whose society he is undeserving in this !”
The tears stole down the cheeks of the amiable
Rosalind; with her hands clasped to heaven she
seconded the wish of the queen, and retiring
shortly after to her chamber, spent the evening in
prayer for the restoration of peace to the mind of
her father, and forgiveness to his crime.

N. LEE.
Tue unexpected arrival of the lord baron de Mow-
bray at the palace of queen Elizabeth, and its con-
sequences, had delayed the setting out of sir Ed-
ward on his hostile expedition into the North to so
late an hour, that it was judged expedient for him
to postpone the commencement of his journey till
the succeeding morning.
It may be imagined that as lord William was no
longer the prisoner of the freebooters, the queen
might have become less anxious for the marching
of the troops than she had been whilst she consi-

dered herself called upon as a sovereign to effect
the rescue of one of the barons of her realm, who
had lost his liberty in defending the rights of his
country ; but it must at the same time be recol-
lected, that, although his enlargement had been
the ostensible business of this expedition, it had,
in the private feelings of the queen, been the se-
condary one, and her chief object that of subduing
the daring freebooter, who appeared to mock her
power, and who had possessed sufficient audacity
to demand her goddaughter to wife. Accordingly,
although the setting out of the troops had from
causes of necessity been postponed, still the ar-
dour of the queen for their marching had not ex-
perienced the slightest abatement.
Not less impatient than his royal mistress was
sir Edward to chastise the notorious Allanrod, who
appeared to stand forth, distinguished by crime
from the common race of man—that Allanrod who,
to the iniquity of heading a lawless community of
robbers, added the atrocious vice of having been
the adulterous disuniter of wedded and happy
hearts, in the persons of the laird of Glenross and
his wife, the bonny Mabel—that Allanrod who,
although the open foe of England, had dared to
lift his thoughts to an union with Rosalind de
Mowbray, the daughter of one of its barons.
Nor was a justifiable enmity to the foes of their
country the only passion which animated the hearts
of the queen and sir Edward, in the conquest over
Allanrod which they were mutually anticipating :
a great degree of curiosity, which they were impa-

tient to have satisfied, had been excited in their
breasts by the unaccountable and contradictory
circumstances of the freebooter having demanded
the hand of Rosalind for his friend lord Rufus de
Madginecourt, as the price of her father's enlarge-
ment from imprisonment in his fortress; and lord
Rufus having been unable, a few weeks after that
period, to prevent Allanrod from leading her to
the altar as his own destined bride. It was evident
that some secret tie subsisted between them, and
what that tie was it appeared probable that nothing
but the overthrow of Allanrod and his band of
robbers would ever develop.
Irwin, the leader of the fallen baron de Mow-
bray, was a man well acquainted with the duties
of a soldier, a quality for which sir Edward had
ever prized him ; and no sooner did he learn that
he was in London, than he sent to request to see
him, and at the interview which this message pro-
duced, he proposed to Irwin to join him on his ex-
pedition into the North. As he had been a cap-
tive in the stronghold of the freebooters, sir Ed-
ward judged that his presence might be of infinite
use to him in his undertaking, and Irwin readily
agreed to march with him.
Amidst other matter, Irwin informed sir Ed-
ward of the freebooter by whose means he had
procured his own release from captivity, and who,
he said, was now in London, where lord William
had promised to pay him the stipulated reward of
his services.
“The poor fellow,” replied sir Edward, “shall

not lose the recompence for which he hazarded his
life. Let him be brought before me ; I will make
him this assurance in person, and take the same
opportunity for proposing to him some questions
relative to his late captain.”
The freebooter was accordingly conducted into
the presence of sir Edward, and the generous pro-
mise with which our young knight addressed him,
stating that, as the husband of the daughter of the
baron de Mowbray, he considered himself called
upon by the voice of honour to execute his obliga-
tions, so far won him the heart of the grateful de-
serter, that whatever particulars he was acquainted
with concerning Allanrod, it instantly became as
great a gratification to himself to disclose, as it
could be to sir Edward to hear them.
But it appeared that the knowledge which he
had of the chief of the freebooters was very limited.
He described him to be a man of an athletic and
commanding form, clad in the Highland fashion
of dress, and his face constantly hidden beneath
the visor of his helmet. Resembling in every re-
spect to this account had he appeared to Irwin,
when he had beheld him on the brow of a distant
hill, after the combat which had a few weeks be-
fore taken place between the freebooters and the
soldiery of the baron de Mowbray; and corres-
ponding with this description had sir Edward seen
him, when advancing towards the altar in the cha-
pel of Rockmount Castle.
The moss-trooper could give no further account
of him, except that it was very rarely that he ever

headed any expedition of plunder, but that he ge-
nerally deputed the command to one of his leaders;
that he seldom visited the fortress, and then never
remained at it above a day or two at a time,
during which period he kept himself retired in a
couple of apartments adjoining to each other, in a
tower at the southern extremity of the building,
which was in better repair than any other part of
it ; that his attendants were a man named Frasier
and two or three others, who enjoyed his favour,
and exercised authority, in his name, throughout
the fortress.
Of this vague kind was all the information he
was able to give. To the name of lord Rufus de
Madginecourt, he was an utter stranger; he knew
not that there was such a noble in existence,
About the hour of noon, on the day succeeding
that upon which the disconsolate baron de Mow-
bray had set out for one of those mansions of se-
clusion from the active duties of life, of which a
few were still existing, which owed their being to
the pretended blindness, and not to the open to-
lerance of the queen, sir Edward, animated by the
good wishes and affectionate farewells bestowed on
him by his beloved wife and revered sovereign,
marched with the first division of his troops for
Northumberland.
As he proceeded onwards, the promised supplies
joined themselves to his standard ; and, when he
quitted York, he found himself at the head of
fifteen hundred men.
During his march, his thoughts rested solely on

797
the object for which it had been undertaken; he
doubted not obtaining a full victory over the free-
booters, and returning to London worthy of the
most benignant smiles of the queen. But the in-
formation which he had derived from the moss-
trooper was, in one point, unfavourable to his
designs. He had said, that Allanrod seldom re-
sided at the fortress, and when he did so, rever
above a day or two at a time; the chances there-
fore were much against his being an inhabitant of
the building at the moment of his attack upon it-
and, without taking Allanrod his prisoner, he
considered that his victory would be but half a
conquest. To this uncertainty however he was
compelled to submit, and to trust to the disco-
very which his vanquished band might be tempted
to make of their leader, if he did not fall into his
power a captive of war.
Sir Edward was principally guided in his route
by the knowledge which Irwin had of the country;
and, by his advice, he halted for a day of refresh-
ment to his troops, on a plain about ten miles
distant from the haunt of the freebooters, in order
that twelve hours, given to repose and ease, might
enable his men to exert themselves more effectually
in the business of the fight.
During these hours of cessation from the toil of
marching, they were allowed every indulgence
which could inspire them with vigour and strength,
for stretching out their arms with spirit and energy
in the cause of their country and their queen; and

with the first hour of the morning, sir Edward
gave the command for proceeding towards the spot
where their ser:ices were to be called into action.
The day was just beginning to break, when the
advanced guard, at the head of which Irwin was
marching, descried the stronghold of the enemy.
Irwin accordingly halted, till the main body of the
troops had joined him, and then sent forward a
herald, as had been agreed upon between sir Ed-
ward and himself, to demand, whether the free-
booters were willing to surrender themselves to the
banner of mercy, which the queen graciously held
out to them, or preferred, by opposing their
strength to the troops which she had sent against
them, to provoke her vengeance 2
On receiving this intelligence from the herald,
the freebooters displayed at once their disregard of
all military observations and the undaunted fero-
city of their nature, by surrounding him, and
dragging him a prisoner into the fortress.
The eminence on which the English troops were
halting was sufficiently near to the fortress to
enable them to distinguish that their herald had
been compelled to enter its walls; and as he
remained within them a longer time than could
have been necessary to the framing of a reply to
the demand with which he had been charged, sir
Edward suspected his mission to have been abused,
and gave the word for his troops to march to the
attack of the place.
Ere they could reach it, the freebooters were

already mounted upon its walls, and discharged at
them a treble fire from their matchlocks, which
they seconded with a shower of arrows; and as the
troops drew nearer to the building, they hurled
down upon them large stones, which they tore,
with the fury of savages, from the ruinous towers
and parapet walls.
But the vehement exertion with which the free-
booters commenced their defence rendered them
unable to prosecute the struggle with equal spirit
for any length of time; and as they grew ex-
hausted by the violence of their efforts, the sol-
diers, under the command of sir Edward, by a
steady and skilful management of their strength,
were becoming with every moment more able to
sustain the conflict.
For about three hours, the contest was carried
on with the most determined spirit on either side.
The numbers which fell, both amongst the free-
booters and the assailants, did not appear to
slacken a nerve in the cause—nay, the purple tide
which flowed around the combatants seemed to act
as a stimulus to their valour.
At length a projecting turret at one angle of the
building, which was supported upon a wall not
less mouldering than itself, becoming still more
weak by the freebooters having drawn massive
lumps of stone from its tottering sides to cast
down upon the enemy, and rocking under the
weight of those who were climbing upon it for the
purpose of providing themselves with ammunition

for their slings, fell with a crash, which threatened
inevitable destruction to those whom it bore with
it to the earth, and also to those to whom the ra-
pidity of its fall gave no time to fly froin the spot
upon which it sank.
This event, which was fatal to no inconsiderable
number of the regular soldiery, proved of still
worse consequence to the freebooters ; they sus-
tained from it a loss of so great importance as
disabled them from carrying on their operations of
defence with any farther degree of success; and
although their hardy souls scorned to cry for quar-
ter, their arms shortly after fell in despair from
their hands, and victory rested upon the crest of
Edward's troops.
The tide of fortune being once decidedly turned
against the freebooters, a very short time made
them the prisoners of the victorious party; and
sir Edward, with Irwin by his side, rushed into
the building, making impatient inquiries of all
whom they saw, whether Allanrod was himself
within the fortress? But even the threat of instant
death could not terrify the required information
from the lips of any one of the banditti; and sir
Edward judging that this stern taciturnity carried
with it marks of their unwillingness to confess that
he was secreted in some part of it, as, had he been
absent, it appeared unlikely that they should not
readily have declared him so, he demanded of
Irwin whether he was acquainted with the way
to the southern tower, and having learnt that he

was, he bade him lead to it, and followed his steps,
attended by some of his own soldiers, whom he
called upon for that purpose.
Headed by Irwin, they proceeded to the ex-
tremity of a long and narrow passage, whence an
archway led to a flight of stone steps: these they
ascended, and having arrived at the top, Irwin
was on the point of entering a door which pre-
sented itself to their view, when it was suddenly
opened from within, and Frasier, with about a
dozen other men, rushed out with their drawn
swords, and immediately fell upon sir Edward and
his companions, with the same savage fury that
had marked the actions of the other banditti during
the combat. Unprepared for this attack, as they
considered the victory already theirs, and there-
fore the use of arms to have ceased, sir Edward
and Irwin, with their attendants, were for some
time in the most imminent danger, owing the
preservation of their lives solely to their skill in
the exercise of the sword: but the clangor of their
arms being heard below, several of their fellow-
soldiers hastened to their assistance, and the
desperate remnant of the lawless band were se-
cured in like manner as their brothers in iniquity
had just been before them.
Scarcely allowing themselves a moment to
breathe, as they judged for whose sake this despe-
rate effort had been made to prevent their entering
the apartment, they rushed into it, and perceived
a figure, which they both instantly recognized to

be Allanrod, in the act of endeavouring to force his
way out of a narrow window, through which he
had just thrust one leg and arm, and attempting to
wrench away an iron bar which prevented the rest
of his body from passing through the aperture.
Sir Edward darted upon him, and seizing the
arm which was towards him, he dragged him back
by it into the apartment, exclaiming—"thou shalt
not escape me monster ! the hour of thy atonement
is at length come !"
The position in which Allanrod had been found
by sir Edward was such as had rendered him unable
to resist the force of his arm ; and as he fell beneath
it upon the floor of the chamber, turning his coun-
tenance, which was, as usual, concealed by the vi-
sor of his casque, upon the arbiter of his fate, a con-
vulsive start shook his frame, and bending himself
forward, with an effort of the wildest nature, he
seized with both his the hand in which sir Edward
still bore the naked sword, which he had drawn in
his own defence against the ruffians whom he had
encountered at the door of the apartment, and in
tremulous but solemn accents, expressiveof mingled
agony, horror, and remorse, he shrieked fortlı-
“Hold ! hold! point not thy sword against a father's
life !”
The quivering lips of sir Edward would have echo-
ed the exclamation, but the shock of astonishment
which had communicated itself to his heart was so
excessive as to deny him the power of utterance or
of motion.

“ Deceive me not, I charge thee!” proceeded
Allanrod, in the same appalling tone of voice in
which he had before spoken—" art thou not the
acknowledged grandson of an aged man, named Mat-
thews, whose residence was on the margin of a
small lake in the vicinity of De Mowbray Castle ?”
Still sir Edward could not unlock the faculty of
speech. To the demand of Allanrod, Irwin replied
for him in the affirmative.
“ No doubt then hangs upon our affinity,” re-
joined Allanrod.-" And, oh God! that we should
meet thus--that I should have been doomed, in
ignorance of thy birth, to have been thy persecutor
through life! God of justice! what a meeting is
this! between a son and a futher!”
“ Art thou indeed my father ?” stammered out
sir Edward ; and, in a soſtened 'tone, he added-
“ Oh, thou Distributor of earthly events ! can this
be the author of my being ?”
“ The God who hears thy invocation is the wit-
ness!” cricd Allanrod. " Scorn me not: ere this
awful moment, I had resolved to make thee retri-
bution for the pangs thou hast experienced at my
hands—retribution worthy thy acceptance: thou
art the legitimate heir of honours and of rank, and
shalt be proved their legal possessor.”
" But who is be that I am called upon to ac-
knowledge as a father ?” demanded sir Edward:
On, disclose thyself to me!”
I will,” replied Allanrod : “ first my heart,
then my countenance; and it is a heart of no com-

mon nature; too soaring to have lived trammelled
with the galling ties by which common worldlings
are bound—too proud to meet death from any hand
but this !” and as he spoke, he tore open his corse-
let, and plunged a dagger into his breast !
The heart of sir Edward died within him at the
sight; every object floated before his eyes : he en-
deavoured, but in vain, to call in assistance ; he
sank upon his knees, by the side of the bleeding
body, and had not the power to make an effort at
staunching the tide of life, which was flowing from
the breast of Allanrod.
Irwin snatched the dagger from his hand, but
the deed of death was past recall : at his summons,
some of the soldiers, who had followed sir Edward
to the door of the chamber, approached, and would
have applied bandages to the wound, but the self
destroyer, with the resoluteness of a tiger, mad-
dened by the torture and imprisonment of a toil into
which he has fallen, tore away such ligaments as
they were endeavouring to wind round him, exclai-
ming, at the same time—" Protract not my suffer-
ings, for I will die !”—Then turning to sir Edward,
he addressed him by saying—“Having shewn thee
my heart, it now alone remains that I suffer thee to
behold my countenance. I have sworn an oath
that Allanrod should never be seen without this
visor whilst alive : I now consider myself in a mid-
dle state, between life and death, and my oath thus
void. Behold, therefore, thy father | but remem-
ber that the period of his having known thee to be

his son is short-remember, and behold me!”-and
having spoken these words, he raised his visor, and
discovered beneath it the countenance of-LORD
RUFUS DE MADGINECOURT!
The excess of surprise which had before filled the
mind of sir Edward, on hearing himself declared
the son of the freebooter Allanrod, is a weak ex-
pression for the sensation which it now experienced:
the mist which had already been floating before his
eyes increased to total darkness; every faculty be-
came lethargized, and, with a groan composed of
horror and astonishment, he fell senseless into the
arms of Irwin.
Unmoved by feelings like the rest of men, lord
Rufus still retained a resolute composure on the
margin of the grave : he called to his son to attend
to his dying words; and when the eyes of sir Ed-
ward again opened to the light, De Madginecourt,
in accents which the weakness approaching death
rendered scarcely audible, thus addressed him-
Inquirc amongst the freebooters for a man nam-
ed Frasier ; he will furnish you with the key of a
cabinet in the chamber adjoining to this, in which
you will find an explanation of the circumstances
that now move your wonder. It was my wish never
to have beheld you again, since the discovery I have
made of our affinity ; and I wrote the papers which
are locked in that cabinet, in order to repair to you
the wrongs I had inflicted on you whilst ignorant
that I was the author of your existence. That

manded to seek you out, and place them in your
hands, after my death; for I came hither to die-
my intention has been hastened by your arrival.”—
He paused ; the powers of nature were almost drawn
to their close, and lord Rufus gasped with a painful
and convulsive struggle for breath.
Speak not of reparation to me,” replied sir
Edward, commanding with difficulty the power of
utterance—" Oh, live to make your peace with
Heaven !"
The eyes of lord Rufus appeared starting from
their sockets, and the first groan he had breathed
passed through his lips: his countenance was
writhed with agony, and every feature indicated
the near approach of that moment at which soul and
body part for ever.
" Or if our efforts cannot save thee,” continued
sir Edward, “ take with thee to a future state, the
free forgiveness of thy son: his prayers shall follow
thee into eternity.”
Again the eyes of lord Rufus were fixed upon sir
Edward ; their expression was of the most pitiable
nature; they bespoke the remorse with which he
was stung, at the conviction he had just received of
the surpassing excellence and nobleness of that heart
which he had wronged, when compared with his
own from whence those wrongs had sprung.
“ I have but one request to make,” said De Mad-
ginecourt; “ on the nobleness of thy nature I rely
to grant it. Extend that forgiveness, which thou
hast unasked bestowed on me, to thy brother, and
when thou hast forgiven, do not desert him."

« Brother l" echoed sir Edward.--"A brother!"
Speak quickly, or I die, and hear not thy pro-
mise,” said lord Rufus.
“ I know him not, but still I promise,” replied
sir Edward.
Lord Rufus caught the hand of his son in his, and
pressed it with a convulsive grasp of gratitude for
his compliance with his petition ; an agonizing
pang then rent the last fibre of his life.—“Mercy !
mercy, Jesu !” trembled on his lip, and his spirit
fled from earth.

It cannot be doubted but that a very short time
elapsed after life had fled from the body of lord Ru-
fus, ere sir Edward caused Frasier to be brought to
him, and having convinced him of his affinity to the
man whom he had lately served, received from him
the key of the cabinet. On opening it he found a
small packet, of which the direction was—“ For
Edward, the son and heir of lord Rufus de Mad-
ginecourt.” With an impatient hand he broke the
scal, and applied himself to the petusal of the con-
tents ; but, as they coutained only partia accounts

of occurrences with which our readers will desire to
become more intimately acquainted, for the pur-
pose of developing some mysteries which have been
presented to them in the former pages of these vo-
lumes, instead of transcribing them, we shall give
an unveiled detail of the life of him who has been
one of the principal actors upon our stage.
The same year which gave birth to Lord Rufus
de Madginecourt resigned the parent who had borne
him to the grave; and scarcely had he completed
his sixteenth year, ere, by the death of his father,
he became the representative of one of the families
of the first distinction in the kingdom of England.
Some years previous to this event, he had been
placed under the care of a tutor, introduced into the
family for that purpose, who found him by no
means secondary in genius and sense, but deficient
in application, and infinitely more incorrect in the
regulation of his morals than his manners. His
father, however, being a man of severe habits, the
natural disposition of the son was checked under
his observant eye; but no sooner had he paid the
debt of nature than the tempestuous passions of
his soul began to break forth.
His tutor, whose name was Ravil, was a clergy-
man of the episcopal church, who, during the pre-
ceding reign of persecution, had been compelled to
desist from the exercise of his religious function;
and the savings of whose former years of industry
had been so nearly exhausted, by his having pos-
sessed no other source from whence to supply the

813
exigencies of himself and family, as to reduce him
to seek the situation in which we have just found
him placed.
In the course of the four first years of his resi-
dence in the family of De Madginecourt, a fever,
which at that time raged in the kingdom, had carried
off his wife and two daughters, and he had now re-
maining to him only one son. This young man,
who was about six years older than Lord Rufus, his
father had intended to enter into that profession
which he had himself followed in his former days
of happiness and prosperity; but Lord Rufus hap-
pening to gain acquaintance with him, on an oc-
casional visit which he made to his father, at Rock-
mount Castle, was so much pleased with his
society, that he insisted on retaining him as his
friend and companion, promising to render the ex-
ercise of any profession unnecessary to him through
life; and this young Ravil was the very man to
whom our readers have already been introduced as
the associate of lord Rufus, in the narrative of the
unfortunate Eloise de la Valois.
In the course of that narrative, enough was dis-
played of his character to shew that he was pos-
sessed of a disposition which could not fail to gain
him the favour and good opinion of a youth like
lord Rufus, who, in a friend, sought only the bold
executor of his vicious plans, the fawning adulator
of his actions, and the invariable approver of his
sentiments.
No sooner was this tie of mutual corraption of

heart, misnamed friendship, formed between the
younger Ravil and his patron, than the father and
the tutor lost all influence; still that love which
the affinity of blood caused him to feel for the one,
and that partiality which, from the habit of con-
stant intercourse, had grown in his mind for the
other, rendered him unable to tear himself from
them ; and he continued an inhabitant of Rock-
mount Castle, and the kind and the lenient adviser
of his son and his pupil, although he sighed to
perceive how unprofitably his admonitions were
received by them.
The years passed on, unmarked by any occur.
rence connected with our history, till lord Rufus,
having completed his twenty-first year, visited the
court, clad in all the dazzling pomp and splendour
of which he gloried in making a display. Whilst
in the metropolis, he conceived a desire to visit
France, and having obtained from Elizabeth an in-
troduction to the monarch of the neighbouring
kingdom, he departed, taking with him a large and
splendid train of attendants, and his friend Ravil as
his companion.
On leaving the French court, the mansion of the
marquis de la Valois was one of the first to which
the letters with which he was honored by the king
gained him admittance ; and no sooner had he en-
tered it, than a passion, exceeding in strength any
which he had ever before felt, took possession of
his heart for the lovely and enchanting Eloise, the
daughter of his entertainer.

Utterly unacquainted with the control of his in-
clinations when any end struck him as desirable,
he had simply been accustomed to consider by what
means it could be made attainable ; arguing, there-
fore, according to his regular system, he found
marriage to be the only channel through which the
possession of Eloise could be obtained, and there-
fore resolved instantly to make her an offer of his
hand, without a thought given to the repentance
into which a tie of trishasty nature might lead him.
When Eloise escaped from the mansion of her
father, and it appeared improbable that he should
ever behold her again, violent disappointment took
possession of his soul : but it was short in propor-
tion to its strength; and after the first week of her
flight from the marquisate of La Valois, it was not
probable that he would ever have thought of her
again with the affectionate desire that he had as
many days before regarded her with, had he not,
by the most extraordinary of chances, when ship-
wrecked on his way from Genoa to Cette, been pre-
served from perishing on board the very vessel
which was transporting her back to France from
her captivity in Algiers.
At this unexpected meeting, the flame of love,
which absence had smothered, burst forth again
with redoubled heat: but the manuscript of Eloise
has already informed us of the dreadful occurrences
which took place on board the Algerine vessel, in
which were included the death of the villanous Ra-
vil and the unfortunate d'Altonville ; and we may

therefore pass on to Madginecourt’s arrival in Eng-
land, with the unhappy victim who had fallen into
his toils.
Some time before the departure of lord Rufus for
France, the elder Ravil, whose health and spirits
had been materially impaired by various causes of
distress, finding himself ill at ease amidst the noisy
and dissipated scenes of Rockmount Castle, had re-
quested its lord, on whom was his sole dependence
for the subsistence of his future days, to remove
him to some spot of quiet obscurity, where he might
pass the evening of his life.
Lord Rufus had in many instances found the
counsels of his tutor of service to his interests, and
therefore felt averse to removing him far from his
presence ; accordingly he proposed to build for him,
as a retreat, a small dwelling, for which he resolved,
that the ruins of an ancient tower, at a distance of
about half a league from the castle, should serve as
the foundation. There was still subsisting a sub-
terraneous passage from the castle to this tower,
and this he considered would afford an easy commu-
nication for supplying him with the necessaries of
life : for him therefore was constructed the cottage
or grotto, which at a later period formed the retreat
of Rosalind-But more of this hereafter.
On landing in England, his heart, burnt up by
the fever of desire, was in a most improper state to
be addressed with any admonitions contrary to the
immediate gratification of his wishes, and therefore
he procured a priest to unite his hand with that of

Eloise, from whom he had not any of these reason-
ings to fear which Ravil might have ventured to
breathe in his ear, had he been called upon by hiin
for the performance of the sacred act.
Scarcely had a month been passed in the enjoy-
ment of Eloise's charms, ere the joys of ecstacy
began to wane into coolness, and with a second
they were succeeded by satiety. He began to con-
sider her as the impediment to his forming a con-
nexion which might increase his wealth, and swell
his consequence; and no consideration prevented
him from working her immediate destruction but
the knowledge of her being about to become a
mother.
At length Eloise gave birth to two infants of
opposite sexes. At the time of their entrance into
the world, lord Rufus was absent from his castle;
and at the same moment that the intelligence of his
being a father was announced to him, he was like-
wise informed that the girl had ceased to breathe.
Having resolved that no vestiges of his marriage
should remain, De Madginecourt scized upon the
death of one child as a plea for removing the other
from the protection of its mother; and having torn
it from her arms, he conveyed it through the sub-
terraneous vaults to the cottage of Ravil. He had
already informed the old man of the death of his
son, although he had forborne to explain to him by
whose hand he had fallen ; and his inducements for
remaining in the vicinity of Rockmount being thus
materially weakened, he prevailed upon him to

consent to remove into Cumberland—to change his
name to that of Matthews—to take with him the
child—and to bring it up here as his own grandson.
The old man looked forward with no small degree
of satisfaction to the task of rearing an infant, which
might grow up to call forth those affectionate prin-
ciples of his heart which were almost dead within
it; and departed into Cumberland with the child,
promising to profess himself his grandsire, and
never to develop his real origin, lord Rufus, on his
part, returning to him a promise of visiting their
abode at least once in every six months.
In this particular lord Rufus was for some years
true to his word, but he always chose the season
of the night for his visits, and beheld his son when
locked in the arms of sleep—not suffering that son
to behold him, lest any difficulty should arise in
replying to such questions as he might ask concern-
ing him ; and it so chanced, that at the time of lord
William de Mowbray's being thrown from his
horse, in the vicinity of Matthews's cottage, lord
Rufus was just arrived at it upon one of his periodi-
cal visits: he therefore was the second figure whom
the baron beheld in the door-way of the cottage,
and on his account was Matthews at first reluctant
to admit him within his dwelling, and afterwards
so particular in exacting from him a promise of
secrecy relative to whatever might meet his obser-
vation, if received within it.
The child being thus removed from the eye of
the world, all the thoughts of De Madginecourt

were turned to the disposal of the mother. He had
for some time past suffered her to be attended upon
by only one confidential servant, and by him he sent
to her the dagger and letter, which we have already
recorded as having been received by the unhappy
Eloise, as predictors of the violence which was in-
tended her.
Lord Rufus hoped that she might become suffi-
ciently weary of a life of pain and misery, to have
seized thankfully and greedily upon the means of
suicide ; but he was deceived in the nature of her
heart. Eloise acted rigorously up to the declara-
tion with which she concluded the narrative of her
sufferings, that she would never lift her hand
against her own existence; and lord Rufus finding
her thus resolved, became the monster to strike to
her heart the blow of death, which he then accused
her of having perpetrated upon her own person.
Thus perished the unhappy mother of Edward,
by the hand of that iniquitous being to whom he
owed his existence.
Once more a free member of the world, lord
Rufus plunged wildly into those vices, which, if
they do not draw down open punishment upon the
exerciser of them in this life, still goad his soul at
certain moments with terrors of the future; and,
notwithstanding the greatness of his wealth, his
extravagance in the pursuit of pleasure was so un-
bounded, as frequently to throw him into the great-
est difficulties when called upon for the payment of
his debts.

That servant in the confidence of lord Rufus,
whom we have spoken of as having been the sole
attendant of the lady Eloise for a short period pre-
vious to her death, was a Scotchman, named
Frasier: he had once been a gentleman: he had
broken his fortune by gambling, and since its loss
had committed some actions which had driven him
from his own country into England: hither he had
come, attended by an only sister, whose principles,
if not so decidedly corrupt as her brother's, had still
been of too relax a kind to cause her to refuse the
advances which lord Rufus had made towards her
person. She was now dead, but Frasier had con-
trived to insinuate himself into the favour of De
Madginecourt so far as to have become a member
of his family, and to enjoy almost as much of his
confidence as his friend Ravil had done.
Venting one day a paroxysm of rage in the pre-
sence of Frasier, which was occasioned by his inabi-
lity to command a large sum of money, with which
he was impatient to purchase some sensual gratifi-
cation, Frasier said—“Ah, my lord, Scottish free-
booters do not complain thus of the want of money:
would that you had a few score under your com-
mand, or that I were the captain of as many in
your pay !” When Frasier first expressed himself
in these words, his meaning scarcely extended be-
yond a joke, and lord Rufus, hearing them at
the time with a smile, dismissed them from his
memory; but in the course of a few days they
again returned to it in a different shape to that in

which they had before met his senses, and he began
to reflect whether such a plan for the increase of
his wealth might not be practicable; and having
dwelt on it for some time in the solitude of his own
mind, he imparted his ideas to the subtle Frasier,
and they employed themselves with seriousness on
the formation of a scheme which might render
their undigested plan feasible and easy--which af-
fords an additional instance of the slender causes
from which the most important undertakings of a
man's life almost invariably flow.
Frasier was too well acquainted with the porerty
of the lower orders of the Scotch, and their enmity
to the English, not to be well assured that a plun-
dering horde might without any difficulty be raised
from amongst them, who would require to know
nothing more of their captain than his name, and
his ability to reward them for their services in his
cause,
Several bands of this nature, who had obtained
the names of borderers and moss-troopers, had
already been formed upon the confines of the two
kingdoms; they had chiefly been selected from the
rude and ill-living Highland peasants, to whom any
state of existence was preferable to the miserable
one from which they had been taken-and hun-
dreds were, no doubt, still remaining, who would
be glad of the same opportunity for changing their
condition.
It was accordingly resolved that Frasier should
pass into Scotland, and enlist as strong a force as

he could find willing to rally round his lawless
standard, and that they should know themselves
as the freebooters of sir Allanrod, under which title
it was agreed that lord Rufus should sometimes ap-
pear to them, with his countenance concealed be-
neath the visor of his casque; for there appeared
an equal necessity in his case, for not confiding the
knowledge of his person to his banditti, as there
did for his sometimes shewing himself amongst
them.
For a considerable time this ravaging band,
headed by the desperate Frasier, had no settled
lurking-place but the cavities of rocks, and rude
huts and tents, which they built on the mountains;
at length, however, they took possession of the
ruined monastery upon the borders of Northumber-
land, of which our readers have already had a full
description, and having converted this into a for-
tress, their depredations became more bold, as they
possessed a stronghold to retire to for their per-
sonal defence, and the concealment of their booty.
The wealth which they wrested from its lawful
possessors was great; it was such as even exceeded
the expectations which lord Rufus had formed of it,
even when a private tax had been paid out of it to
the joint avarice and knavery of Frasier, who was,
upon the whole, perhaps, as just an agent as De
De Madginecourt could have found for his nefarious
scheme. To suppose that a man who served him
in the quality of a robber would be strictly honest
to his employer, lord De Madginecourt knew too

much of human nature, and the motives from which
all men act, to expect.
In every enjoyment which gold could pur-
chase, lord Rufus revelled: female beauty was
the charm which possessed the greatest power
over his heart and every part of England hav-
ing supplied luxury to his wishes, the delight
of anticipated novelty had for some time ren-
dered him desirous of visiting Scotland, but
the differences which subsisted between the two
kingdoms had withheld him from putting his
inclinations into effect: at length, auguring that
no Englishman would be present at the
revelry in which all Scotland was invited to
participate at Kinnavain Castle, upon the mar-
riage of Mary with her cousin the earl of
Darnley, he resolved to profit equally by that
and his assumed title of sir Allanrod, to visit
the Scottish court. He accordingly passed
over into Scotland, and causing himself to be
announced at the tournament as sir Allanrod,
he perceived that there were none present who
were likely to recognize him for the person
he really was, and to expose his fictitious
character; and being thus assured of security
from detection, he resolved to enjoy the week of
festivity without restraint.
Here it was his chance to meet the bonny Mabel
Monteith, the wife of the laird of Glenross: her
beauty, so universally acknowledged, was of that
enchanting kind which instantly bound his heart a

captive in the fetters of adoration, and he resolved
to possess her, if earthly means could purchase the
ardent desire of his soul.
The bonny Mabel, of whose heart vanity was the
ruling passion, and who had for some time past
considered the 'pleasure which she perceived her
husband to take in the society of the enlightened
lady Margaret Murray as almost a crime committed
against herself, listened with triumph to the adu-
lating tongue of a man whom she regarded as sen-
sible of the adoration due to her pre-eminent
charms; and, from listening, she consented to re-
ward the high opinion which he professed himself
to entertain of their perfection.
Accordingly, on the very evening of the ball
which concluded the festivities given by the royal
Mary and her newly-married consort, they fied
together from Kinnavain Castle, and their flight
knew no interruption till they had reached the
confines of the English kingdom. Here they paused
in their progress and here the bonny Mabel, who
had not been able to resist the appeal made to her
vanity, confessed herself still not entirely lost to
shame. She besought sir Allanrod, as it was im-
possible that she could ever become his wife, to
suffer her to enjoy his affection in obscurity, and to
place her in some retired solitude where none should
visit her but himself.
As the lady Glenross was now entirely in his
power, dispossessed by the rash step she had taken
of any friend to whom she could turn for protec-

825
tion, he without reluctance confessed to her his real
rank and name; and at his desire she consented to
become the inhabitant of that cottage which was
united to Rockmount Castle by a subterraneous
passage, and of which Ravil had lately been the
occupier. Here it was agreed that she should live,
and be reputed as a peasant girl who had fallen into
the snare of his seduction.
At the expiration of a year, the bonny Mabel
gave birth to a male infant: a mother like herself
could not be supposed to feel much desire to be the
personal inspectress of her child's rearing, and it
was therefore, without any opposition on her part,
sent into a distant part of the country, under the
care of a nurse who was provided for that purpose.
Before a second year of adultery had flown over
the head of the lady Glenross, the marriage of her
cousin, Margaret Murray, with sir James Lam-
brun, and the voluntary seclusion from the world
to which her husband had condemned himself in
consequence of her infidelity to his bed, had opened
her eyes to the innocence of that friendship which
had subsisted between him and the lady Margaret;
and this conviction, added to the coolness with
which lord Rufus now beheld her, when compared
to the rapture with which he had at their first ac-
quaintance dwelt upon her charms, resolved her,
if possible, to execute a plan which she had formed
for escaping from him into Scotland, and placing
herself for life in the convent of saint Agnes, in the
island of Auskerry; for which convent we have al-

ready said she felt a preference, on account of one
of its members being a relation of her deceased
mother.
In the habitation where she then dwelt, mo-
ney had been useless : accordingly she possess-
ed none.
All the wealth she had at command
was her jewels, in which she had been decked
for the queen's ball on the night of her flight
from Kinnavain Castle with lord Rufus, and
which had ever since that period been deposited
in a chest in the cottage, which contained her
clothes.
With a part of these she bribed one of the
domestics who had attended upon her from the
time of her arrival in the county of Durham
to become her escort to the island of Auskerry
and to maintain an
inviolable secrecy upon
her fate.
The man
true to the confidence repo-
sed in him ; he found means of procuring her
escape in disguise from the vicinity of Rock-
mount Castle, and conducting her to the coast
from whence he provided a vessel to transport
her to Scotland. Of the particulars of her lan-
ding on the island of Auskerry, of her reception
into the convent of saint Agnes, and her
subsequent death, we are already informed.
The sudden disappearance of the bonny Mabel
was rather a cause of surprise than regret to
lord Rufus de Madginecourt ; constancy was
not one of the passions of his heart, and she
was

who was now lost to him had been his a
sufficient length of time to have quenched the
fire of his passion in possession. She had left
for him in the grotto a letter, in which she
informed him that repentance for her past conduct
had driven her to fly for ever from his arms,
and entreating him, as he had once valued her,
to protect the child which she had borne him
for her sake. Lord Rufus had loved the bonny
Mabel better than any woman whose affections
he had ever shared ; he therefore read her let-
ter with a degree of attention which that of a
pleader who had been less interesting to his feelings
would perhaps not have commanded; and he re-
solved to fulfil her petition respecting the child.
In compliance with this determination he fre-
quently visited it, in order that he might be certain
of its welfare; and being struck with the resem-
blance which it bore to its mother, for whom latent
sparks of love were still lurking in his breast, he
felt a desire to have him more constantly in his
sight; to this end he brought him at the age of six
years to his castle, as the son of a peasant whom
he intended to bring up for a page to attend upon
his person. -
The boy's name was Alwin, by which he has al-
ready been introduced upon the stage of our history;
and it will now be perceived who was the brother
for whom lord Rufus in his dying moments en-
treated a promise of forgiveness and protection from
sir Edward.



## p. 828 (#864) ############################################

828 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
Alwin was a child of sharp and ready talents,
and he insinuated himself into the favour of lord
Rufus, unconscious that those arts, which he had
at that early age sufficient cunning to perceive cal-
culated to gain him indulgence and praise from his
patron, were directed to the author of his existence.
Lord Rufus, on his part, became every day
more and more attached to the boy: he appeared to
him the only being who had ever been capable of
calling forth affections of the nature which he felt
for him; and he perhaps loved him the more for
the novel sensation with which he was inspired by
him: in short, ere Alwin had attained his eleventh
year, De Madginecourt was ever dissatisfied when
he was not by his side.
About this time were waged those continental
wars, at the commencement of which arose those
false hopes and ideas with which the vain lord
Rufus flattered himself that the favour extended to
him by Elizabeth, in the exalted command which
she honoured him by permitting him to bear in her
armies, was of a nature which extended beyond a
friendly regard.
At his return from these wars, on the morning of
his receiving the thanks of his sovereign for the
judgment and efficacy with which he had executed
the trust that had been reposed in him, he first
beheld the daughter of his friend, lord William de
Mowbray.
We have already given the history of his views
and passions subsequent to that time down to the

829
period of Rosalind's marriage ; we have therefore,
in this place, only to revert to certain actions on
his part, of which the motives have not been ex-
plained.
For the first few years after the birth of that son
which had been borne him by the unfortunate
Eloise de la Valois, lord Rufus performed his pro-
mise of visiting the child and his protector Mat-
thews once in every six months : but various causes
then arose to make him neglectful in this point of
duty; and at the time of his arriving at De Mow-
bray Castle, in the character of Rosalind's suitor,
so long a period had elapsed since he had made any
inquiry after Edward and his nominal grandfather,
that he was entirely ignorant of the fate of both :
affection he certainly had none for the child, whom
he had driven thus unnaturally from his protec-
tion; but there was still a certain feeling in his
heart, which rendered him desirous of learning
whether or not he were in existence. The proxi-
mity of De Mowbray Castle to the spot on which
stood the cottage of Matthews, urged him to snatch
an hour for visiting it; accordingly, dreading that
his absence from the castle by day might lead to a
disclosure of that secret which he intended never
to reveal, he stole at the dead of night from his
apartinents, and having, by means of a sentinel,
procured a passage over the drawbridge of De
Mowbray Castle, he proceeded to the cottage by
the side of the lake.
He found it deserted; and upon investigation,

830
MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTRR,
he discovered that it must have been some time
without inhabitants. He wished to know what was
become of those who had formerly resided in it;
but it was impossible to make an inquiry to that
purport, without divulging their fate to be of some
importance to him ; and therefore he resolved, if
not satisfied with ignorance, to endure it, and trust
to the hope of their being both removed from earth
by the hand of death ; and this was a hope in
which he was most ardent, for his affection for
Alwin was now become so great, that he had re-
solved, should his elder son, Edward, never ap-
pear, through the advicc of Ravil, to claim his
birthright, and should Rosalind de Mowbray bring
him no male descendants, to declare Alwin the
heir to his name and possessions ; for which end
it was his design to report him the legitimate son,
which Edward really was.
Accordingly he, without delay, returned to De
Mowbray Castle ; and chance had so fated it, that
Rosalind, whose slumbers had been disturbed by
dreams of an awful nature, and who had left her
bed in her endeavours to compose her agitated
mind, was a witness of his entrance within the
walls of her father's castle-a circumstance of
which it will be remembered that the mystery
heightened that disgust which she already felt for
him. This disgust was afterwards swelled into
horror, by the words which she heard him pro-
nounce as she passed the door of his chamber in her
way to the chapel —" Die she must,” he had said,

MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER,
831
" and if she will not kill herself, I must do it for
her ;” and this conviction of his either having been
a murderer, or his intention of becoming one, fixed
her in the resolution which she had already formed
of never becoming his wife.
There are moments when conscience will goad
the hearts of the most hardened in iniquity; and
the hours devoted to sleep were those in which De
Madginecourt felt the scourge of a murderer's re-
collection. At these moments would he, in imagi-
nation, react the murder of his sainted wife ; and if
not awakened from the trance of painful thought in
which sleeping fancy held him, his sufferings were
exquisite: as a relief from those attacks of horror,
he had for some time past obliged Alwin to sleep in
a closet adjoining his bedchamber, and instructed
him to wake him whenever he should hear him
struggling with the fiends of memory. Alwin was
faithful to his trust, for the lord Rufus was liberal
to excess in rewarding him for his services and his
secrecy, and Rosalind perhaps the only person
except the page, who had ever been an auditor of
his nightly pangs.
Having explained these mysteries, we proceed to
that period at which lord Rufus de Madginecourt,
from having first addressed Rosalind, solely on ac-
count of the favour in which she stood with
the queen, became so strongly enamoured of her
person as to demand an interview with her father,
at which he proposed to him to lead ber to the
altar, and compel her to become a second time a

wife, whilst yet the husband of her affections
lived.
We have already seen in how contemptible a
manner lord William received this unnatural pro-
posal, and the enmity by which it was succeeded
between him and De Madginecourt. But although
the baron de Mowbray had been sufficiently wary
to refuse his adjunction in a step which, if taken,
threatened to unite dishonour with his name, still,
either from incaution or indifference about con-
cealing the truth in this respect from lord Rufus
he let fall enough to inform him that Edward was
held in a confinement to which he had doomed him
in Flanders, and from which it was his intention
that he should never return to claim Rosalind as his
wife. No sooner had lord Rufus obtained this
knowledge, than feeling secure in his own imagi-
nation, that were Edward once removed from life,
the baron would feel no scruple in compelling his
daughter to accept him as her second husband, all
his thoughts were bent upon devising the readiest
means for depriving him of life.
The baron had said enough relative to Edward's
confinement, to convince lord Rufus, to whom
Flanders was a country well known, which must
be the prison where he had found the means of
confining a man who had committed no ostensible
crime ; accordingly, resolving that the deed of
Edward's death should be performed by one in
whose fidelity he could place the most unlimited
confidence, he engaged to that end the services of

833
his page, Alwin ; promising him, at his departure
from England, that, on his return with a confirma-
tion of his rival's death, his reward should be a dis-
closure to him, on the part of lord Rufus, which
would not only teach him to know himself as the
heir of an immense wealth, but empower him to
place his inheritance beyond a doubt.
The deluded youth, who had been won alike by
precept, example, and indulgence, on the part of
his united father and patron, to consider his will
as absolute, and all his desires as just, elated by the
promise which was to reward his present mission
into Flanders, thought lightly, or indeed scarcely
at all, of the crime by which it was to be pur-
chased; and, attended by two trusty companions,
he set out on his guilty journey.
In the preceding pages we have been informed of
such occurrences as took place in the prison of
Garcias Xavia, after the arrival of Alwin in Flan-
ders; we have seen that the misguided boy, at the
moment of perpetrating his supposed crime, was
not master of the same fortitude with which he had
undertaken the commission of it. His every sense
was unequal to its office ; his eves did not discover
the imposition which was practising upon them, in
the body of another man having been placed in the
situation where he expected to tind the rival of lord
Rufus ; and his unsteady hand, instead of directing
the first blow which it aimed at its victim to his
heart, darted the weapon of death into his cheek.

## p. 834 (#870) ############################################

834 MYSTERIOUS FREEBOOTER.
Delighted however at the ultimate completion of
his task, Alwin returned to England, and delivered
to lord Rufus a particular detail of the transaction;
in return for which, the elated De Madginecourt,
clasping his son to his breast, confessed to him their
affinity, and his intention of declaring him his heir
at his death. Alwin listened to him with equal
ecstacy and surprise; and the knowledge which he
had thus gained, whilst it rendered him still more
unlimited in those demands which he was constantly
making upon the purse of lord Rufus for the indul-
gence of his own inclinations, caused him also to
consider himself as more implicitly bound to fulfil
the mandates of his nominal patron. Accordingly,
when the lord baron de Mowbray, contrary to the
high-raised expectations of De Madginecourt, re-
fused to give him the widowed hand of his daughter
—when the lord Rufus, struggling between the
pangs of indignant pride and disappointed passion,
leant alternately to various plans for obtaining by
force the person of her, the willing gift of whose
charms was refused to him, and at length resolved
to use to that effect his second character of Allan-
rod—he confided to Alwin his union with the free-
booters, and questioned him whether he would un-
dertake to act the part of a deserter from the band
of the dreaded Allanrod's banditti, and proceed as
such to De Mowbray Castle, with a tale calculated
to draw lord William into his toils 2
Had not the discovery of his affinity to lord Ru-
fus been already made to him, there is little doubt

835
that Alwin would readily have complied with his
demand, so forcibly had the habits in which he had
been educated taught bim to desire all that lord
Rufus himself wished; but now he had obtained
the knowledge that it was a father to whom his
services had from his infancy been given, a sense
of duty, of which the strength was surprising, in
proportion to the deficiency in every other virtue of
that heart in which it grew, rendered him enthusi.
astically warm in the agency of any plan which
could add to the happiness of the man in whom all
his expectations were centered, and with exultation
he assumed the fictitious character which lord Ru-
fus had proposed to him; and thus accoutred, he
proceeded to De Mowbray Castle, where we have
already seen the success that attended his strata-
gem--for Alwin was the supposed deserter, who at
the opening of our history introduced himself to the
lord de Mowbray and his leaders under the feigned
name of Donald, as a youth whose family had been
the victims of the notorious Allanrod's brutality
and lust.
No sooner was the baron de Mowbray enticed
into that encounter with the freebooters, in which
his soldiery met with an entire overthrow, than
lord Rufus considered himself as at length secure of
obtaining the hand of the lady Rosalind; he be-
lieved that every man's love of liberty was too
great to suffer him to have any scruples about the
terms on which he was to obtain it, so as it were
but presented to him as obtainable upon any con-

ditions at all ; and therefore he doubted not that
the demand which he caused to be made to lord
William, from Allanrod, of his promise to bestow his
daughter Rosalind in marriage on lord Rufus de
Madginecourt, as the price of his immediate enlarge-
ment, would be replied to with a ready affirmative.
But in the firmness of the baron, in withholding
his daughter from the possession of the man whom
he now considered as undeserving of her hand, his
hopes encountered a fresh disappointment ; and his
first resolve, upon his receiving a negative to his
request from the lips of lord William, was that of
assailing De Mowbray Castle, and enjoying her
charms by force.
But a little reflection pointed out to him that the
bliss he should thus obtain must be transient, and
that its consequences might be fatal to him, while
the exercise of some degree of policy might still
cause Rosalind to believe that he was deserving of
her gratitude, out of which sentiment it was possi-
ble that a feeling approaching to love might ulti-
mately spring.
To the accomplishment of this end, therefore, he
directed his confidential friend, Frasier, to send a
sufficient force against De Mowbray Castle, for its
utter subjugation, whilst, to the trusty Alwin, he con-
fided to lead a small detachment of his own soldiery
from Rockmount towards it at the same hour, to
whom, at the command of Frasier, the freebooters
were to deliver up the lady Rosalind, who was
thence to be conducted under the escort of a faith-

ful English leader of De Madginecourt's, named sir
Maurice, to his castle on the coast of Durham.
Thus far lord Rufus succeeded in his plan upon
the unprotected Rosalind: he imposed himself upon
her as her rescuer from the dreaded Allanrod and
his ferocious band of freebooters, and she confessed
herself grateful for the deliverance : but a small
part only of the plan he had conceived was accom-
plished. The next step towards the attainment of
his desires was, to teach her to believe that the ne-
farious Allanrod demanded her as his bride; and
having worked upon her mind with this dreadful
apprehension, again to sooth her feelings by de- .
claring, that he would submit to the sacking of his
own castle by the lawless freebooter, ere the
threatened indignity should be offered to her
person.
He perceived that this declaration won some de-
gree of faith from Rosalind, to the repentance
which he professed himself to feel for having at a
prior period been the cause of unhappiness to her,
as likewise to his present desire of repairing to ber
his former conduct; and, glorying in the observa-
tion, he desired to make every possible shew of his
present merit, and therefore sent a private order to
Frasier to inform his horde, that they were com-
manded by their chief, Allanrod, to march to an
attack upon the castle of lord Rufus de Madgine-
court, in the county of Durham, and to lead them
on to it without delay, charging hiin at the same
time to bring a force capable of subduing his sol-

diery, as the fruitful issue of his stratagem depended
upon the conquest being assigned to Allanrod.
That a man like lord Rufus made no scruple of
sacrificing the number of individuals, whose fall in
this siege was unavoidable, is a matter which can-
not excite surprise.
Having still farther shewn his zeal for the safety
of Rosalind, by conducting her to the grotto, at the
end of the subterraneous passage leading from the
castle, lord Rufus passed the interval, till the hour
of the expected siege, in contemplating his future
prospects of happiness: he had resolved, the mo-
ment the freebooters were declared the conquerors
of Rockmount Castle, to enter the chapel in the
disguise of their chief, to cause Rosalind to be con-
ducted thither to him, and there, in mockery of the
rites of religion, to receive her hand from his vile
accomplice Frasier, whom he had instructed to ap-
pear at the altar, in the habit of a priest, for the
purpose of imposing the marriage as a legal one
upon the senses of Rosalind.
Having drank the nectar of her charms in his
character of Allanrod, it was his design to quit her
chamber ere the light of day should enable her to
distinguish his countenance, and having left her
for the space of about a week to her own reflections,
to present himself again before her as the zealot of
her cause, to inform her that, by the acquisition of
additional force, he had conquered the freebooters,
and that their detested chief had died by his
hand.

The greatest joy, he doubted not, would rush
into her heart with this intelligence, and, at the
moment that it was softened towards him as her de.
liverer, the master-stroke of his plan was to be
effected by once more throwing himself at her feet,
the suppliant of her smiles : he believed that the
gratitude with which she would be inspired for the
accumulated services that he had rendered her,
would leave her unable to refuse him the boon
which he should sue for as the recompence of his
exertions in her cause ; but, should it be possible
that she should still attempt to withhold from him
the possession of her charms, even after she be-
lieved them to have been rifled by the chief of a
band of robbers, he considered that the indignity
with which he should conceive himself to be treated,
by a conduct of this nature on the part of Rosa-
lind, would no longer leave him master of his own
feelings—that it would prompt him not only to.
convince her that his deeply-planned arts had al-
ready obtained for him the blessings of possession,
but perhaps spur him on to deprive her by death of
the power of bestowing on any other object that
happiness which she denied to him: but the hand
of Providence stretched itself out towards the too-
long-afflicted Rosalind, and preserved her from an
accumulation of misery under which the powers of
reason must have forsaken her-Edward, the be-
loved partner of her heart, was sent to preserve
her from the pollution of a villain's touch.
And, now we are acquainted who Allanrod really

was, it will no longer appear strange that his soul
sank within him, and his every nerve became pal-
sied with trembling apprehension, when he beheld
Rosalind snatched from his arms by the apparent
shade of the murdered Edward.
But when lord Rufus had in some measure reco-
vered from the excessive terror which had shaken
his senses at beholding what he had for the time
believed to be the apparition of the man whose
death had been perpetrated at his command, he
began to suspect that there might be some decep-
tion in the appearance which he had seen, and com-
manded an instant search to be made for Rosalind
throughout the castle.
Blessed in the smiles of fate, Rosalind and the
beloved partner of her soul had already gained the
beach, and her pursuers did not extend their search
after her beyond the walls of Rockmount Castle.
But whilst the fruitless pursuit was carrying on in
every part of the building, Alwin, who, actuated
by the zeal which he always felt for the accomplish-
ment of his father's wishes, was the most strenuous
in the cause, discovered the pilgrim's robe and hat
behind the tomb in the chapel, where Edward had
thrown them down. Since the time that Philip
Watkins had been admitted as a minstrel into the
castle, Alwin had more than once passed through
a hall adjoining the kitchen, where he had seen
him, and Edward in his disguise, seated amidst
the domestics, and, recollecting that these were
the garments which had been worn by the minstrel's

nominal brother, who had been declared to be
dumb, a suspicion of some deceit being allied with
his character immediately flashed upon his mind,
and he commanded the search which was making
for Rosalind to be extended to the minstrel and his
brother.
In a very short time poor Philip was found lurk-
ing near the vaults, where Edward had left him
when he had followed the steps of one of the free-
booters to the chapel. He was instantly dragged
before lord Rufus, who still wore the dress of the
freebooters' chief, and to whom Alwin quickly re-
lated the cause by which he had been induced to
bring him into his presence.
With an air and voice that might have struck
terror to a much more courageous soul than that of
Philip Watkins, whom we have already perceived
not to have been overburthened with valour, lord
Rufus, placing his hand upon the hilt of his sword
as he spoke, commanded him to confess the truth,
as he hoped to live beyond the present moment.
Philip was an honest and a well-intentioned fel-
low, although not a brave one, and the threat of
death was probably the only one which could have
caused him to betray a man to whom he had pro-
mised fidelity; but life is a charm from which few
are willing to part, and, falling upon his knees,
with a prayer that his might be preserved to him,
he made the required confession.
The astonishment which seized upon the minds
of lord Rufus and Alwin, on the conviction which

they received from the lips of Philip of their having
been juggled with in their attempts upon the life of
Edward, in the prison of Garcias Xavia, may be
easily imagined, and they demanded of Philip
whether he was able to explain how his preserva-
tion had been effected.
Apprehensive of the consequences of refusing to
reply to any question they advanced, Philip briefly
related the services which Hubert had rendered to
his benefactor.
The surprise of lord Rufus increased upon this
recital, and he demanded from what extraordinary
cause every vassal in De Mowbray Castle appeared
to have been thus strongly attached to this Ea-
ward ?-"I perceive two of you,” said de Mad-
ginecourt,“ risking your lives in his service: from
what motive arises your partiality to him ?”
Philip replied, that the urbanity of his manners
and the excellence of his heart had won him univer-
sal esteem in De Mowbray Castle ; and added, that
his deserted state had rendered him a peculiar ob-
ject of regard.
“ Deserted !" echoed De Madginecourt.
he not enjoy the protection of the baron de Mow-
“ Did
bray ?"
Philip replied, that what he referred to was his
not being possessed of any natural protector upon
whom he could call for acts of service or kindness.
“ Whence came he then ?” asked De Madgine-
court, sternly : “ who was he when lord William
admitted him into his castle ?"

“ The grandson,” answered Philip, " of an aged
man, named Matthews, who resided on the margin
of a small lake in the vicinity of De Mowbray Cas-
tle, and by whose sudden death he was left depen-
dent on the charity of strangers.”
“ Matthews !-Edward his grandson !-he that
Edward! Oh, God of retribution !—Mercy, mercy,
Ileaven !” groaned forth lord Rufus, and, leaning
for support on Alwin, he left the chapel, and, with
trembling steps, reached his own chamber.
Scarcely had they entered it ere lord Rufus
spoke, and the tone of his voice was such as for
the first time awed the senses of him he addressed.
“ Alwin,” he said, “we are accursed of Heaven!
I have commanded the murder of a son, and thou
hast raised thy hand against the existence of a
brother!”
This declaration was an enigma to Alwin: in a
brief, but impressive manner, lord Rufus explained
it to him; and if the goaded consciences of the
guilty ever were deserving of commiseration, their
hearts were rent with pangs most truly pitiable.
Oh, how awful is that moment at which the veil of
delusion is removed from before the eyes of the
sinful wretch, and he at length beholds the heinous.
ness of the course of iniquity through which he has
travelled to the summit of his criminality!
In agony of mind, lord Rufus threw himself upon
his bed, and for several days he refused to rise from
it. At length he one day called to him Alwin :-
Repent, repent,” he said, " and thou shalt yet

be happy : the soul of thy brother is of too noble à
nature not to forgive the heart that is filled with
contrition.”-Having spoken these words, he
pressed his son to his 'breast, and then directed
him to retire again to the adjoining apartment,
which command Alwin obeyed, totally unsuspicious
that he then beheld his father for the last time.
At the dead of night, lord Rufus, attended by
Frasier and a small number of the freebooters, left
Rockmount Castle, and proceeded to the fortress
on the confines of Northumberland.
Arrived there, he directed Frasier to lead him to
the tower in which he supposed the baron de
Mowbray still to be a prisoner ; and, on learning
that he had effected his escape about the time that
his castle had been despoiled, he expressed great
regret at being disappointed of the interview which
he had anticipated with him.-" It was my desire,”
he said, addressing Frasier, “to have seen him,
and informed him of the lineage of his daughter's
husband, that he might have accorded to him his
pardon and paternal protection, in addition to the
inheritance which I am shortly to bequeath to him.
Frasier remarked on the term shortly, and lord
Rufus replied, ---“ Yes, very sbortly ; I cannot en-
dure life under the reflections that I am doomed to
bear about with it."
He retired to the chambers which were set apart
for his private use in the building, and in one of
these he applied himself to writing. He first com-
posed an epistle to the baron de Mowbray, con-

taining such matters as it had been his intention to
give him information of, had he obtained a confe-
rence with him ; this done, he drew out a history
of the birth and inheritance of his son Edward,
which be addressed to him, and in which he de-
clared to him his ignorance of their affinity at the
time that he had been his persecutor, and entreated
forgiveness of him for himself and his brother Al-
win, whom he in the strongest terms recommended
to his protection. -
The epistle addressed to lord William he in-
closed in that intended for his son Edward ; and
he had just summoned Frasier into his apartment,
and given him in charge instantly to search out that
injured son, and place the packet safely in his
hands, when the herald from the English army,
commissioned by the queen, and headed by sir
Edward, reached the fortress.
Although resolved to die, De Madginecourt's
apprehensions of death were still so great, that he
required some immediate spur to the act of suicide
upon which he determined, and his superior dread
of falling a prisoner into the power of the English
troops as a rebel who had headed a band of robbers,
trained to the molestation of his mother-country,
furnished him with this spur, and he would have
fallen upon his sword the instant that information
was brought to him of the English forces being in
sight, had he not been withheld by Frasier from
the deed; but the instant of his resolution being
once past, he suffered himself to be entirely guided

by Frasier, who represented to him that the defeat
of Elizabeth's army was certain, and that, if he were
resolved on death, it were at least better to die
with the satisfactory knowledge of dying the chief
of a conquering band.
That lingering love of life which exists in every
breast, probably prevailed more with lord Rufus
than the arguments of Frasier, who, committing
the defence of the fortress to the other leaders,
placed himself, with a score of chosen men, within
De Madginecourt’s apartment, determined, as he
declared, to guard his life, or perish with him. To
these the defeat of their comrades was not known,
at the moment when they opposed the entrance of
sir Edward and Irwin into the chamber where they
had stationed themselves to protect their chief, and
the intelligence of the overthrow of the freebooters
was so unexpectedly and suddenly conveyed to lord
Rufus, that he was rendered incapable of reflection
by the shock; and forgetting at the instant that he
might rescue himself from captivity, by flying from
existence, he attempted to effect his escape from
his enemies through the spiral window of his
chamber.
Of the awful interview which succeeded this mo-
ment, we have already given a description. So
powerful was the effect produced upon the senses of
lord Rufus, at beholding in the person of his injured
son the agent of that royal mistress to whom his
conduct had been equally criminal, as to the child
whom he had withont a just cause discarded from

his affections, that it deprived him at once of every
desire to live; the grave appeared to him the only
veil from his crimes and his shame; and with a
degree of triumph at thus escaping from the taunts
of men, he plunged the dagger to his heart.
Beyond the tomb we cannot follow him ; but
impressive are the reflections which arise out of
the contemplation of a life like his. Born to the
enjoyment of rank and wealth, endued with every
quality which can render man a blessing to the so-
ciety in which he exists, vanity and avarice, the
meanest passions which infest the human mind,
stole into his heart, and overrunning it like a noxious
weed, poisoned in the bud every generous flower
which might have sprung up to its ornament.
Thus on the soil where virtue might have thriven
in its fairest form, the foulness of vice fixed its ab-
horrent stamp ; and every capability which it pos-
sessed of scattering comfort on the millions beneath
it was converted into the purchase of enjoyments
not less selfish than unsatisfactory to their pos-
SeSSOr.
The doctrines of religion instruct us what will be
the reward of those who possess the means, and
with it the will of distributing happiness to the
circle in which they are placed ; and awfully do
they set before our observation the dreadful reverse
to which the amply gifted of Heaven, who have
been the bane, and not the comfort of their fellow-
beings, will be doomed. May the example of De
Madginecourt’s death furnish a convincing proof

of the incapability of those enjoyments, which are
purchased by iniquitous means, to confer happiness
on the heart which vainly expects to derive it froin
them !—May it lead to the reflection that a life of
that nature which ensures a calm and peaceful hour
of dissolution, is the only life which, in this state
of trial, can be deemed a happy one !

On, how delightful is the task which leads us to
tell of the happiness which the virtuous enjoy!
How exquisite to recount the rewards which attend
on the trials endured by superior beings like sir
Edward and his Rosalind ! to behold them removed
from the oppression of the vicious, and the tyranny
of the unfeeling, to the joy-fraught exercise of that
benevolence which is the spontaneous growth of
their hearts, and to the enjoyment of that domestic
love which is the recompence of every pang under-
gone to secure its possession !
It must be almost unnecessary, after what we

have seen of the exalted sentiments of sir Edward's
heart, to say, that although he discovered the fa-
ther in the persecutor, he did not, on this disco-
very, forget the obligations which are due from
every created being to the author of his existence.
With affection it was impossible that he should
follow a parent like lord Rufus to the grave, but
with that outward show of respect which reflected
back upon himself, in its brightest lustre, the sen-
timent which he bestowed, he attended the earthly
remains of his father to their last abode ; and con-
sidering that the rights of burial in England could
not be permitted to him, as a rebel to the interests
of his country, he procured permission for him to
be interred in the burying-ground of a monastery
upon the confines of the Scottish kingdom.
Alwin was, meanwhile, not forgotten by him ;
he sent him an assurance, that, although he could
not receive him as a brother to his heart, he would
not suffer him to feel the loss of his father, in the
point of those comforts which he had been accus-
tomed to enjoy. This message he sent to him by
Frasier, who, rejoicing in the opportunity thus af.
forded him of flying from the punishment which
awaited his fellow-freebooters at the hand of the
English government, instead of bearing the com-
mission with which he was charged to Rockmount
Castle, fled into Scotland, and secreted himself
there, in the assumption of some new character,
from the punishment which he feared might over-
take him.

From the tongue of common fame, Alwin heard
the occurrences which had taken place at the for-
tress; and unable to credit that sir Edward would
grant to him that forgiveness which the narrowness
and vice of his own heart would probably have
withheld him from bestowing on his brother, had
he been placed in his fortunate situation, and sir
Edward in that in which he now stood—a victim
to apprehensions and regrets, which almost con-
sumed his senses, he precipitated himself into the
sea, from one of the towers of the castle which
overhung its bosom ; and his corpse was brought
to land a few days afterwards by some fishermen.
At the same time that sir Edward had dispatched
the treacherous Frasier to Rockmount Castle, he
had sent forward Irwin to London, charged to deli-
ver an exact account of all that had taken place
since his departure from it, to the queen and his
Rosalind. Accordingly, the reception which he
met with at the palace on his return, was that of
being saluted by a body of nobles, who ushered him
into the presence of the queen as lord Edward De
Madginecourt. But if his heart experienced an
honest pride at the smiles of pleasure with which
he was welcomed by every member of the British
court, smiles of which the queen herself set the
example, if his heart danced with ecstacy at the
kiss of welcome imprinted on his lips by his beloved
Rosalind, what was the exultation with which he
received from the arms of Hubert the lovely,
blooming boy, who was the pledge of her love, for

fell upon
whom all his miseries had been endured, and for
the blessing of whose affection he would again have
undergone a second pilgrimage of equal hardships !
The tears of overflowing joy started into his
eyes; he pressed the babe to his face, and they
his
rosy
velvet cheek. Almost jealous of
the delight which her husband was experiencing
from his caresses, Rosalind again drew him to her
own breast, and kissed off the tears with which his
father had bedewed him.-" Oh, bless the child of
my beloved Rosalind !” exclaimed lord Edward. -
Angels guard thee, son of my adored Edward !”
responded his mother.
“Son of Edward and Rosalind is thy happiest
name,” said the queen, hanging over him as she
spoke ; “ but thou must also be the son of Eliza-
beth: the godmother of thy parent, I pledge myself
in the same degree of responsibility to thee.”
In compliance with this promise, the
young Ed-
ward was a few days afterwards christened in the
chapel of the palace, with a display of the utmost
state and magnificence ; and the queen became the
sponsor of his faith, in like manner as she had
become to his mother.
After a month passed in the royal mansion of
Elizabeth, the lord Edward and his lady took pos-
session of Rockmount Castle, to which Rosalind
obtained her husband's permission to carry with her
her faithful Gertrude, and old Ambrose, formerly
the porter of De Mowbray Castle, who, with the

other vassals of lord William, had been restored to
liberty by the subversion of the freebooters.
To the unequalled Hubert, the queen presented
an estate in the vicinity of Rockmount Castle, not
sufficiently large to deprive its possessor of comfort
by forcing upon him grandeur, but large enough to
give him the wealth of a happy competency—a
situation suited to the just and moderate feelings
of him to whom it was assigned; and the greatest
happiness of his existence was the contemplation
of that felicity of which he had been the glorious
author.
Dame Edith was continued by Rosalind in her
situation of housekeeper; and dying at the age of
one hundred and sixteen years, her earnest wish
was completed, of living a century beneath the roof
of Rockmount Castle, of which she had become an
inmate when scarcely sixteen years old.
Philip Watkins threw himself at the feet of Lord
Edward, and implored forgiveness for the confession
which had been forced from his lips, rather by the
polished blade of lord Rufus's sword, than the elo-
quence of his tongue; and lord Edward, kindly
remembering only the happy consequence which
had arisen from his want of fortitude, bestowed on
him, with his pardon, the permission of continuing
in his service for life.
The baron de Mowbray lived only three years in
the asylum to which he had flown from the taunts
of the world, and sunk into the sleep of death with

a penitent and religious concern for the errors of
his life, which afforded a most consolatory balm to
the feelings of his daughter, in the expectation
which they gave her of his happiness in a future
State.
Lord Edward did not in his prosperity forget his
friend, Adolphus Biron, and the interesting partner
of his fate, the lovely Belise; and he had the satis-
faction to learn that, by the interference of her
uncle at Maestricht, the fortune left to her by her
father had been recovered from the hands of the
governor Garcias Xavia; and about five years
after her union with Adolphus, Garcias, terrified by
the approach of death into a desire of repairing
some of the injustice which he had been guilty of
in life, bequeathed to her such a portion of his
wealth as increased the independence which she
and her husband already possessed into a fund of
riches for the future portions of a numerous off-
spring.
Not less happy in repeated pledges of their af-
fection, were the lord and lady De Madginecourt;
and on their second son Elizabeth conferred the
title of baron de Mowbray, which had else been
extinct at the death of lord William ; and with it
she assigned to him that domain which must other-
wise, in default of a male heir, have returned into
the hands of the crown.
Thus blessed in the favour of a gracious sove-
reign, and in the conscious rectitude of their own
hearts, lord Edward and his Rosalind lived long

and lived happily. In distributing comfort to the
needy, they doubled their own store of happiness-
in educating their children to pursue the path of
virtue, they felt their own minds ameliorated by
the instruction which they conveyed; and the mo-
ments which they passed in a return of thanks-
giving to that Omnipotent Being, by whom their
preservation from a host of foes had been so mira-
culously wrought, were rewarded with the glorious
expectation of joys more exquisite and more exalted
still, beyond the grave.
