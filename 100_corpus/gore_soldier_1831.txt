“ No kind of literature is so generally attractive as Fiction. Pictures of
life and manners, and Stories of adventure, are more eagerly received by
the many than graver productions, however important these latter may be.
APULEIUS is better remembered by his fable of Cupid and Psyche than by
his abstruser Platonic writings; and the Decameron of BOCCACCIO has out-
lived the Latin Treatises, and other learned works of that author."

PRE FACE.
In adding the Romance of The TUILERIES to the
collection of STANDARD Novels, it has been deemed
advisable to restore to it the title of the SOLDIER OF
Lyons, as more germane to the matter than the one
originally selected by the publisher.
More than ten years have elapsed since the publi-
cation, more than fifteen since the writing of this
work, almost a first attempt in prose, to beguile the
tediousness of a residence in a secluded château in
France. No compendious history of the French Revo-
lution had then appeared. Louis XVIII. was on the
throne ; political opinion in a state of subservience.
The works of Thiers and other able historians had not
familiarised the public with a variety of startling
anecdotes and narratives, which it was necessary to
seek out with caution and labour in detached memoirs,
often of doubtful authenticity.
A second Revolution has since enfranchised the
march of public opinion, and imparted a new character
to the throne of the Bourbons.
Much which, at the first appearance of this work,
there was treason in uttering, is now established as the
law of the fickle land of France. There are, conse-
quently, peculiar inducements for its republication.

THE
SOLDIER OF LYONS;
OR,
THE TUILERIES.
CHAPTER I.
It is the cause
it is the cause, my soul!
Othello.
The time-piece on the elegant toilet of the Marchioness
de St. Florentin pointed to the hour of five, on the 22d
of June, 1791, the morning succeeding the eventful
night selected by the unfortunate Louis XVI. for his flight
from the Tuileries ; — and its owner had just resigned
herself to the hands of her attendant, Mademoiselle Flavie,
who was hastily removing the diamonds from her neck and
the flowers from her hair, when a low tap at the door of
the boudoir suspended her employment.
The marchioness trembled as she desired her attendant
to see who waited without. Well might she tremble,
well might her faltering voice refuse to express the calm-
ness she was desirous to assume ! On that momentous hour
depended the uncertain issue of her future fate.
It might
prove her last of happiness ; nay, even of her earthly ex-
istence! Her husband, — the husband of her free choice,
in those days of general disregard to all but interested
claims in the marriage vow, the husband of her faithful

affection, at a period, and in a rank of society, where do-
mestic virtues were rare, - was at that moment sharing the
critical fortunes of his sovereign, and braving those perils
of popular animosity, in the origination of which he was
wholly innocent.
The Marquis de St. Florentin, holding no appointment in
the royal household, and uninvolved in the odium of a record
in the Livre Rouge, could not have been affected, even by a
punctilious point of honour, by the dangers of the court, had
not a powerful sentiment of personal affection for the House
of Bourbon motived a voluntary sacrifice in the cause of his
sovereign. He had never, it is true, been distinguished by the
favour of Louis, while that favour retained its value in the
eyes of his subjects. He had received no public distinctions,
for he had courted none. The past commemorated no especial
claim upon his gratitude; and the future,— alas! for his
king and for his country ! - afforded not the most remote
allurement to the schemings of interest or ambition.
It was solely, therefore, under the influence of a chival-
rous loyalty that St. Florentin resolved to assist in the
escape of the royal family ; leaving a beloved wife and two
helpless children to the mercy of those, who might pos-
sibly render them victims to the success of his enterprise ;
and who would surely wreak upon himself, in case of the
failure of his undertaking, the hatred and malice they so
venomously cherished against every branch and adherent
of the royal family of France.
“Would it not be more merciful,” whispered Madame
de St. Florentin to her husband, when he tore himself from
her arms on the morning of the preceding day,--"would
it not be more generous to let me share your danger?
A dreadful presentiment overpowers my mind !” She fal-
tereil
, and shudderingly averted her head from the shoulder
of the marquis. “If we part this day, St. Florentin, it
will be to meet no more. Danger and wickedness have
come among us by imperceptible strides ; unsuspicious of
the ambuscade, unmindful of their advance, we have been
surprised and disarmed.- Many, many will be the victims !

feiture for their perilous distinction; and if it must be so,
if the shadow of fate has already fallen over our heads, let
us dare the darkness together. Dearest St. Florentin ! take
us with you
u !- your post, your danger shall be ours.
Do not let us part to-day !”
Silence, my dear Emiline, - forbearance, my poor
trembling girl! - If not for mine, for your own sake, dis-
miss these horrors from your thoughts. It is unworthy of
you to enfeeble my mind on the eve of an important enter-
prise, by importunate appeals to my tenderness. A per-
emptory duty summons me from your side ; a duty equally
peremptory requires your submission to the decree. Look
at these innocent creatures !” he continued, leading her
towards the bed where her little daughters lay clasped
within each other's arms, “ look at them, and tell me
whether
you
dare desert them.”
“ You, St. Florentin, feel no scruple in quitting them.”
“I am a man. My duties are of a sterner and more
uncompromising nature than your own. They lie in ac-
tion, in unfailing energy,--yours, in patient acquiescence.
We part but for a brief, brief trial. All our measures are
assured, our line of co-operation accurately determined. In
less than three days, my precious trust will be honourably
fulfilled ; and, in five, you will rejoin me on the Rhine,
with these treasures of our common love. Yes! in five
short days, Emiline, we shall meet again, in the midst of
security and peace.
Heaven knows we have acquired a
just estimation of their value !”
" Oh, that our lesson were but happily ended! The
severest of my trials is yet to come: we are about to part
for the first time, St. Florentin ; or it may be,-merciful
Providence that I should say so!. it may be for the
last!”
“Is this your fortitude, - is this your promised heroism?
Remember that the slightest suspicion thrown at this crisis
upon our movements might prove fatal to your sovereign,
and to one whom you value, — shame that you are to the
name of Navelles, -far, far beyond ;-your husband, Emi-
line, who fondly thanks you for the unheroic partiality.
Beware, dearest, beware!-- remember how many malevo-

“ My resolution !” exclaimed Madame de St. Florentin,
rising from her knees, on which she knelt beside the little
couch of her children ;
you shall no longer doubt
no longer deride its energy. See, see what it can
effect !” And she flung back her entangled hair from the
pale face it overshadowed, and turned wildly towards him,
with the assumed smile and affected submission of a ma-
niac. “Are you satisfied, St. Florentin? - Am I suffi-
ciently cheerful,--sufficiently self-possessed?"
He turned away, shocked and disconcerted; and im.
plored her to refrain from such terrible demonstrations.
“ Still discontented ? ” she exclaimed; “nay, then, take
this last kiss and begone, for my heart is breaking.” And
she pressed her cold lips to her husband's forehead, and
again implored him to leave her to her sorrow.
“ One word inore, dear Emiline !” said the marquis
earnestly, taking her hand, and laying it with his own upon
the heads of his sleeping children. “ Promise me that,
whatever may chance to yourself or me, these children
shall still remain your first, your dearest object; that you
will cherish those who love them, and cleave to those who
can protect their helpless innocence ?"

after weigh heavily against their welfare ;— the enthusi-
astic devotion of wedded love, the unyielding pride of a
loyal name, –and after these, -shrink not, my Emiline, at
the word, -after these, the memory of your husband!
But when these, or other powerful interests, shall arise to
mislead your heart, remember, that to the mother of two
helpless girls self-preservation is a duty of primal moment.
Remember this when the prejudices of your youth inflame
your resistance to the spirit of the times. A Christian wo-
man and a mother may blamelessly resign her worldly
pride, in such a cause; and when I shall be no more

which hung upon her arm, and gaily singing the refrain
of a popular vaudeville-
A la cour
Tout prend son tour,
Biribi,
A la façon de Barbari,
Mon ami!
The Marquis de St. Florentin, who had long entertained
suspicions of the fidelity of Mademoiselle Flavie, threw a
hasty but significant glance towards his wife, which warned
her to busy herself in adjusting the pillow of her daughters,
in order to conceal the traces of agitation and despair vi-
sible upon her countenance. Then, turning towards the
soubrette, he demanded, in a tone of jocularity very un-
familiar to his lips, the cause of her abrupt appearance.
" Mademoiselle Bertin had sent a basket of the most
enchanting chiffons for Madame's inspection ;- was she at
leisure to look over the contents ? ”
“Certainly, certainly,” replied the marquis, perceiving
that his wife was totally incapable of framing a reply.
“ The moment is propitious,— since my presence, my
excellent taste, and my munificence, may expedite the se-
lection of madame la marquise. Let the damisel appear.”
An elegant little grisette accordingly glided into the
chamber to deposit her important charge ; and gracefully
throwing aside her shawl, proceeded to exhibit to the dis-
regardful eyes of Madame de St. Florentin, various fanciful
articles of fashionable millinery displayed upon her own
far from unattractive person.
At length, affecting to approach the marchioness for the
exhibition of her goods, she whispered, “ Bid your maid
quit the room.”
Impossible! ”replied the marchioness, in the same
scarcely audible tone; for she was not only conscious of
Mademoiselle Flavie's jealousy of temper, but had reason
to believe that she had been successfully tampered with by
the revolutionary faction; who scrupled not to avail them-
selves of such instruments, in order to acquaint themselves
as accurately as possible with the projected plans of the
adherents of the court. Yet such was the temper of the

times, that she had not dared dismiss from her service a
person who had the will and the power to become a dan-
gerous enemy. The immediate connections and friends of
Mademoiselle Flavie were forward in the ranks of the or-
ganised agitators of the public mind; and it would have
been madness to attract their evil will at so desperate a
crisis.
St. Florentin readily conjecturing that Mademoiselle
Bertin,-zealously devoted to Marie Antoinette, and ad-
mitted, during the recent embarrassment of her affairs,
somewhat too freely into the royal confidence,- had in-
trusted some important intelligence to the transmission of
her fille de magazin,—a person not likely to fall under sus-
picion as the bearer of political communications,- affected
to approach with an air of gallantry; inspecting her fragile
stores and awkwardly adjusting them on his own person.
With much adroitness she detected his intention, and began
with arch coquetry to criticise and correct the errors of his
choice; while Emiline turned despairingly.away towards
the children, sick of the scene of excellent dissembling she
was required to play.
“ Mais fi! donc, monsieur le marquis,” exclaimed the
modiste, “ you are trying to disgust madame with this
beautiful mantle.” Then stooping to disentangle the
flounce, she whispered, “ At the barrier at ten o'clock.
Bayard.” It was the password, and the appointment of
the queen!—
The intelligent soubrette perceiving that her mission was
accomplished, playfully resumed the jargon of her calling;
while the marquis, affecting to grow indignant at his wife's
indecision of choice, allowed himself to be persuaded into
the purchase of a velvet hat, en souris gris,— couleur
des plus distinguées !” — which the Iris of the queen of
fashion deposited in the care of Mademoiselle Flavie.
Then, turning towards the pale and heart-stricken Emi-
line, he kissed her hand, and in a tone of assumed levity,
recommended his gift to her notice. Not daring to trust
himself to a more explicit farewell, he bent one parting
gaze upon the face of the wife he loved, and turning ab-
ruptly away, quitted her and his home, perhaps for ever! -

But in that single parting look, he attempted to convey
to his beloved Emiline his grateful sense of the fortitude
with which she had succeeded in masking the struggle of
her feelings. He observed with satisfaction a smile on her
cheek, and a fixed serenity on her brow. Had he been a
nearer or more dispassionate observer, he might have also
seen that the blood oozed from between her compressed
lips;-
had he touched her hand with a less tremulous
emotion, he would have perceived that it was cold and
death-like as the marble upon which she was leaning. “I
will not say farewell," -- were the last words of St. Flo-
rentin, as he gently closed the door.- How often, how
painfully did they recur to the memory of his wife!-

DURING that critical afternoon, the heroic fortitude of the
Marchioness de St. Florentin had enabled her to continue
her ordinary routine of arduous amusement, and busy idle-
She stept into her carriage at the appointed hour;
paid formal visits to persons unconnected with the objects
which exclusively occupied her mind ; and sedulously ex-
hibited herself and her equipage at the door of a noted
magazin de nouveautés. She neglected, in short, nothing
which could counteract the suspicion that she was con-
cerned in the movements of the court, or peculiarly inte-
rested in any event of the passing day.
At that epoch of terror and mistrust, when, as a mem-
ber of the revolutionary tribunal has since recorded, “ the
system of domestic espionage was as troublesome as a per-
petual .swarm of insects; when every householder mis-
trusted his own servants, - when friends, children, and
parents, renounced their mutual confidence," — when all

the holiest bonds of society were giving way under the in-
fluence of revolutionary licence, the agitated wife, in her
alarm for the object of her affection, ventured not to con-
fide her feelings even to those most intimately connected
with the royalist party.
One person alone was admitted to the painful distinc-
tion of partaking her anxieties. An old steward, attached
throughout his prolonged life to the house of St. Florentin,
and whose fortunes were bound up in its prosperity, was
destined from the first to share the emigration of a family
in whose happiness and welfare his own were thus deeply
involved. He it was who had secretly effected every neces-
sary preparation for their journey to the frontier; who
had procured the passport, and provided the funds for their
undertaking. The good old man, after ineffectually at-
tempting to tranquillise, by his sanguine predictions of
success, the agitation of his lovely mistress, – promised to
devote a vigilant ear to the rumours of the day; and en-
gaged that, should the slightest intimation transpire of the
desperate enterprise in which St. Florentin was engaged,
he would seek her at the Hôtel Nivernois ; where, by pre-
arrangement, she was to attend a ball likely to be prolonged
to an early hour of the following morning. And thus, in
the bitter struggle of her agony, she was obliged to assume
the frivolous array and hollow semblance of mirth ; and to
veil in affected levity the anxieties, public and domestic,
which assailed her mind !
The fête passed off with the usual affectation of gaiety,
and splendour of appointment, distinguishing such enter-
tainments. It was nearly the last of those gorgeous orgies
by which the nobility of France attracted the fatal envy of
a class which they still peremptorily excluded from their
society. In England, a thousand honourable avenues con-
duct to public distinction, and to the social favour by which
it is accompanied. Professional and literary success,
great talents, - great merit, —or great riches, - may elevate
a man to the highest pinnacle of courtly or popular favour;
and there is no one so humble, or so humiliated, but that
his ambition may suggest a hope of admittance, or re-ad-
mittance, into the highest society of the realm. But

during the predominance of the ancien régime of France,
rank alone, - ancient, hereditary rank, — was the pass-key
into the Parisian saloons; and if occasionally a fermier
général, or some other successful speculator or peculator,
was admitted into their brilliant coteries, he was compelled
to pay a severe penalty for the intrusion, in the endurance
of a thousand insults; or by the sacrifice of other thou-
sands, more tangible and less easily overlooked.
The Hôtel Nivernois was one of those which deigned to
welcome within its lofty gates only those honoured guests,
whose ancestors had been its accepted inmates from cen-
tury to century. A Nivernois of the time of Henri Quatre,
or François Premier, might have made his re-entrance
upon its familiar stage, “ clad in complete steel,” nor found
among the revellers of the night a single name requiring
the interpretation of heraldry. The laurels of the field or
of the cabinet, had interposed no vile plebeian physiognomy
betwixt the wind and his nobility ; for the doubtful es-
cutcheon of a noblesse de robe, or peerage won by eminence
in the law, - was scornfully rejected by the chivalry of
fashion ; while the noblesse d'épée, or peerage won by mar-
tial distinction, - could rarely be conceded as the reward
of heroic deeds, in an army where hereditary nobility was
a requisite qualification for military advancement.
On the evening in question, the magnificent saloons of
the Duchesse de Nivernois displayed at once their inherited
friendships, and their inherited glories ; their antique
tapestry, where the infancy of art betrayed itself, — like
sickly human infancy, -in distortions and convulsions ;
and a still more ancient gallery of pictures, — which Peru-
gino and Sasso Ferrato, Cranach and Durer, had laboured
to fill with unpleasing representations of martyrdoms and
other varieties of pious horror. There was the obsolete
marquéterie, — the cabinets of Buhl or Florentine mosaic,
- the stately Dresden vase, with its crisp garlands of life-like
flowers; - the cup or shield of rich embossment, such as
Cellini was wont to forge between the visions of his turbulent
enthusiasm ; and high over all, and irradiated by a lustrous
glare of girandoles, a glowing and trophied representation
of the heaven of mythology, glaring from the gorgeous

pencil of Le Brun. But what was the pride of Juno,
compared with that of many a wide-hooped and pomponed
duchess sailing beneath ; — what the primness of Minerva,
to that of many an illustrious précieuse of the circle ? Or
how might the united pride and luxury of heathen supre-
macy, vie with that of the marshals, and grand échansons
and chevaliers de l'ordre of the declining court of the un-
regenerated Bourbons ? -
Among its best and loveliest, -- and it could still boast
many who were good and beautiful,- none held a fairer
reputation, or more general regard, than the Marquise St.
Florentin; but on that cruel night, amid the sights and sounds
of levity which tortured her afflicted heart, her numerous ad-
mirers failed not to note the listless manner in which she
bowed into silence their eloquent adulation. None of the
playful brilliancy with which she was wont to retort upon
their flatteries ; none of the piquant originality which
commonly distinguished her address ! To escape their
importunate inquisition, she rose to join in the dance;
and her pale abstraction, and unnatural wildness of eye,
might have personified the heroine of Ford's terrific drama,
Calantha, dancing on in horrible estrangement,
till her heart breaks with the conflict of suppressed emo-
tions !
Yet however indifferent the brilliant scene, she could not
but observe a character of unusual softness and affectionate
interest in the demeanour of her partner and near relative,
the young Chevalier de Mirepoix. Vanity might have
given a flattering interpretation to his altered manner; but
the marchioness, secure through the influence of a strong
and hallowed attachment from every impulse of coquetry,
dreamed of conquests as little as she desired them; and
attributed his attentions to their fitting origin, — his par-
ticipation in the anxious secret that weighed upon her
feelings.
The chevalier was a chief agent in the projected flight
of the royal family; and it was only in consequence of the
suspicions which the incautious zeal of youth had fixed
upon his person, and which might have attracted inquiry
towards the disguised Louis and his companions, that he

had consented to remain in Paris till the royal fugitives
should attain the Rhenish frontier.
“ Be not alarmed,” he whispered to Madame de St.
Florentin, as he withdrew his fair cousin towards the em-
brasure of a window : “ all will soon be well. Heaven
watches over our cause ; and though many among us have
offended, and done our unwitting part to inflame and dis-
temper the spirit of the people, you and yours are guiltless.
Seldom and reluctantly sharing the festivities of the court,
living in the decent retirement of a well-ordered home,
your conscience is as free from blame as your person is se-
cure from the odium which clings to several leading mem-
bers of our party. You can have nothing to fear; and
trust to my predictions, that within a few short days we
shall be wandering with your husband, -grown unendur-
ably vain of his exploit, and your little girls, who are vainer
than all of us together, - among the vineyards of the
Rhine.”
“ Heaven realise the picture !” murmured Emiline,
labouring to repress her rising tears.
“ Hark!” interrupted the chevalier, leaning towards
the half-open window, which overlooked the Boulevards.

“ Some accidental passenger whistling the Romance du

“'Tis a concerted signal! A faithful servant under-
took to give me this intimation, at an appointed minute,
if all went smoothly with the travellers.”
“Alas! that such precautions should have become need-
ful,” replied the marchioness; and scarcely able to re-
tain her assumed composure, she prepared to quit the
ball-room.
The Chevalier de Mirepoix hastened to seek her ser-
vants and equipage ; but speedily returned with alarming
intelligence that a riotous mob was assembled at the en-
trance of the court-yard ; and that they had made a bon-
fire of the sedan-chairs in waiting, the tremendous flames
of which rendered it impossible for the file of carriages to
advance. The police, apprehensive of irritating the popu-
lace, – the power of which had already manifested itself

by many a horrible excess, or perhaps secretly inclined in
favour of the revolutionary party, — took no measures to
interrupt their course of outrage, or silence the offensive
invectives and brutal epithets, which they lavished upon
those trembling women who attempted to escape from a
scene so appalling.
“Repress your alarm, and confide yourself entirely to
my guidance, dearest cousin,” whispered Mirepoix ; and
attempting to conceal his own perturbation, he hastily drew
aside Madame de St. Florentin, and enveloping her whole
person in his mantle, proceeded to disguise her face in the
ample folds of a large handkerchief.
In another minute she found herself carefully lifted
through a window on the ground floor, and hurried, under
the protection of Mirepoix's arm, along a series of unfre-
quented streets leading towards her own dwelling. Many
were the intoxicated groups of the rabble through which
they were constrained to pass, who insisted, with the para-
mount right of might, upon their joining in the popular
cry of “ A bas l’Autrichienne !” " A bas Monsieur et
Madame Véto.”
They were soon at the gate of the Hôtel St. Florentin ;
where the astonished Swiss recognised, with distrustful
wonder, the disguised person of the lady of his lord,
returning home at such an hour, and so strangely at-
tended.

of tears and self-gratulation. She had scarcely begun to
disencumber herself from her ornaments, when, as has
been already described, a low knock at the door of her
chamber renewed her subsiding alarms.
“ Who disturbs us, Flavie, at this unreasonable hour?"
inquired she, with tremulous lips.
“ It is monsieur l'intendant, who insists on an au-
dience,” answered her attendant, indignantly tossing her
head as she returned from the door. “ Truly, I think he
might have intrusted his weighty mission to my hands.
Had he studied the decencies to be observed in an honour-
able family, he would have known that the personal
attendant of madame la marquise was a more creditable,
if not so accredited an emissary of secret intelligence, as
such a superannuated eaves-dropping spy."
“Silence, Flavie! The age of Laporte should alone
secure your respect, as it does that of your superiors.
Admit him instantly."
“And the young officer of the National Guard by whom
he is accompanied ?
“Of the National Guard ? — Why did you not name
him before ? Whence comes he, Flavie, and what is his
errand ?” exclaimed Emiline, her husband's perilous ab-
sence instantly occurring to her mind.
“ Madame la marquise assuredly takes me for a witch,
or forgets that I have looked upon this young man,
who is so fortunate in his choice of a master of the cere-
monies,- for the first time. But his errand,” continued
Mademoiselle Flavie, placing her hands in the embroidered
pockets of her cambric apron with an air of defiance, “ is
probably addressed to madame, rather than to me. Shall
I acquaint him that the Marquis de St. Florentin is ab-
sent, lest so unimportant a circumstance should chance to
have escaped the worthy intendant's recollection?"- and
she glanced maliciously towards Emiline’s disordered dress
and burning cheeks.
The voice of Laporte was now audible from without,
imploring instant admittance; and his agitated mistress,
hastily throwing a roquelaure over her shoulders, and taking
a taper in her hand, rushed into the outer chamber.

“ In the name of Heaven, Laporte ! what means this
disturbance ? -Have

The old man interrupted her vehement apostrophe by a
significant look at the waiting-woman.
• Leave the room, mademoiselle !” said Emiline, with
an air of decision; and the femme de chambre obeyed the
command with a glance of startled recognition at the mili-
tary intruder.
May I inquire for what purpose I am favoured with
the visit of this gentleman ?” resumed Emiline, gazing
suspiciously on the young officer.
“ Madame deigns not to honour me with her re-
membrance," observed the stranger, in a low tone. Hap-
pily for herself, I cannot become equally forgetful.”
" Camille, my good Camille !” shrieked Madame de
St. Florentin, to whom the voice of the speaker was more
familiar than his person disguised by military accoutre-
ments; “ tell me, why are you here at this late hour,
why at all, -- and wherefore in this dress?
56 My dress,” said the soldier, looking down upon his
sleeve, is the badge of a corps which I trust I do not
dishonour; and I am here, madam, unbidden, as you
remind me,
- in order to rescue you and yours from ap-
proaching danger. This is no time for idle explanations,
- for the deliberations of delicacy. I speak plainly, or I
speak too late. Ere this, the fugitive king has been ar-
rested ; ere morning, you will be yourself conducted to
prison, as an accessary in the conspiracy, unless you em-
brace an instant opportunity of flight.”
Madame de St. Florentin clasped her hands in agony.
My husband then is lost!” she exclaimed, looking eagerly
towards the soldier.
“ He has shared the fate of his sovereign, and is by this
time a prisoner. But I beseech you, madam, let not the
poignancy of your grief overcome all sense of duty towards
yourself, and towards your children. The indecision of a
single hour may throw you into the hands of your enemies.
Providence can alone foresee in what excess of persecution
the victors in such a cause may indulge!”
“ Monsieur Camille !” interrupted the indignant steward,

“ does it become you to intimidate madame by your me-
naces, or school her into compliance by your self-assumed
authority ?”
May Heaven, my good Laporte," observed the mar-
chioness, provide me with no harsher preceptor. Oh!

the soldier, whose commanding figure and stern countenance
relaxed at the sound of her voice, “how different are these
days of sorrow and confusion, from those when in our child.
hood we tended the hives together in your mother's garden.
Would-would that I were now sheltered with my
children beneath her roof!"
“ The very spot, madam, which I had selected as your
place of refuge," replied Camille, with respectful deference.
“Say but one word, - one gracious word, - and before this
hour to-morrow, you shall be safe in the humble abode you
deign to remember with regret.”
“ Indeed ?” replied Emiline ; some bitter consciousness
of humiliation mingling with her looks and words. “ And
may I inquire through what new distinctions, what mighty
influence, you are enabled to offer your protection to the
wife of St. Florentin? - It is somewhat new in our national
annals, and sufficiently speaks the altered character of the
land, that the poorest vassal of an ancient line of nobility
is empowered to vouchsafe his safeguard to the daughter of
his hereditary lord.” She blushed for the ungenerous words
which the bitterness of degradation wrung from her lips.
But Camille replied to the taunt with unmoved calmness.
It is, I trust, madam, neither new nor wonderful,
that a son of France should be moved by gratitude to
respect the companion of his childhood, though fallen into
adversity, fallen through what mischance or what error,
it were ungracious to inquire."
“Silence, young man !” exclaimed the aged steward,
astounded at the audacity of Valazy.
Lady,” resumed Camille, in a still firmer and more
energetic tone, “the passing moment, which we waste so
idly, is one of the mightiest importance ; - if we lose it,
the chance is irrecallable. My forefathers were retainers
of your own. - I was born a vassal of
your
house. - My

you there ; and when I became fatherless, it was the fond-
sness of her nursling which rescued us from ruin and
misery.”
" Camille ! is this a time
“ Hear me to an end, and then, madam, resume, if you
will, your disdainful reproaches. I was deprived by a
trifling fault of boyhood, of your noble father's protection.
But I bless the day in which I was expelled from the lands
of the Duc de Navelles, since, by laying the foundation of
my fortunes, it has enabled me to secure the safety of his
daughter and her infant children. Scorn it, madam, if
will ; but after-hours will prove that many royalists, your
equals in honour and station, would gladly have availed
themselves this night of similar assistance."
“I am to understand, then," said the marchioness, with
an air of hauteur, “ that I have the honour of conversing
with a faithless factionary of the revolutionists ?
“ It matters little by what epithet, madam, you choose
to qualify your scorn,” replied Valazy, gazing mournfully
on the unwonted expression of waywardness disfiguring
her lovely countenance. “Suffice it that you converse
with one bound to your service by ties before which party,
interest, even duty itself, are frail as the smoking flax.
Little would it avail me to recount the feelings, the hopes,
which have rendered me what I am. Let me, therefore,
only boast myself your humblest of servants, and as such
win confidence to my assurances.”
“ I beseech you, madame la marquise, pardon his pre-
sumption," said Laporte, earnestly. “In spite of his
jargon and unreasonable pretensions, Camille Valazy is still
your devoted adherent."
“I must be permitted to withhold my trust, Laporte,
till Monsieur Valazy condescends to explain himself.”
“ Monsieur Valazy,” resumed the young soldier, red-
dening, “knows, with very painful certainty, that a deputa-
tion of the National Assembly, which met on the first
rumour of his majesty's departure, will visit this house at
day break, to affix the national seal upon the papers and
effects of the Marquis de St. Florentin ; and that a warrant

of arrest is already issued against your person, as having
abetted his criminal practices against the state.”
“ The state !” exclaimed Emiline. — “The state, which
itself conspires against the safety of its anointed sovereign !
- My husband's practices ! — would that the mercy of
Heaven had crowned them with success ; for they are ho-
nourable as his own noble nature !'
“ You have children, madam,” observed Valazy, some-
what sternly ; and the rising glow of her enthusiasm in-
stantly faded from the beaming countenance of the mar-
chioness.
“ Your projects, Camille—your preparations !--speak,
- speak ! — explain them without hesitation !”
“I have obtained a passport," answered Valazy, draw-
ing a paper from his bosom,” which will enable you to
pass with your children, under the protection of the faith-
ful Laporte, as far as Montreuil sur Mer. I have a friend
there, high in authority, who will see you placed in
security under my mother's roof; towards whom, madam,
I rejoice to perceive your affection still unchanged. From
thence, and seizing the earliest opportunity, you will do
well to seek your eventual safety in England.”
“ In England ? ”faltered the astonished Laporte.
“ In emigration ? murmured the marchioness;
leave my husband in the hands of assassins ? — Never !’
“Hush !” said Camille, pointing towards the door,
“ For his sake, learn to moderate your expressions ; and for
your own, deign, madam, to remember that should his life
be endangered your utmost efforts in his cause would be
utterly ineffectual, while your presence might place a
fatal impediment upon his movements.”

it may indeed be so," replied Emi.
line, wringing her hands; " but would even a certainty of
the fact warrant my desertion, - my base and cruel de-
sertion? - No! I will at least soothe his affliction by
participating in his danger.”
“ To an attached husband,” observed Camille, with
bitterness,“ such a resolution must afford a singular
source of consolation !”
Then starting, as the sound of
some distant movement struck his ear, he approached with

precipitate earnestness, and renewed his entreaties. “I
beseech, I implore you, madam, dally not thus with in-
stant danger. Within an hour, you will be a prisoner,
if you persist in your rash obduracy. – A post-carriage at
this very moment waits your orders in the adjoining
street; Laporte will aid me in conveying you thither, with
your children;
and for their sakes, for their innocent
sakes, -- peril no further delay.- Confide in the playmate
of your infancy,” he continued, throwing himself at her
feet, “ confide in the devoted servant of your father's
house, confide
“ Rise, sir !” interrupted Emiline ; “ the wife of St.
Florentin has courage to meet the dangers of her destiny.
Let them come! I shall be found at iny post, - and
willing to share the fortunes of my husband.”
Again Valazy persisted, pleaded, -nay, almost threatened;
--- and again, Emiline, with warmer energy, repelled his
prayer. Wounded pride, or perhaps some feminine in-
stinct which taught her to mistrust his motives, confirmed
her resolution.
“ Is it indeed so ?” said Camille Valazy, mournfully,
when at length he rose from his knees.
“ Must a being so
good, so gifted, become the victim of a prejudice,—the
dupe of an empty sound ? — Old man !” he continued, sud-
denly seizing Laporte by the arm, and impelling him to-
wards his mistress, “join in my prayers, - second, my
entreaties, aid me to save her against her very will ! -
Oh, God ! -oh, merciful God ! grant us the powers of per-
suasion !- Her life hangs upon the chances of this hour.”
“ Take my thanks, young sir,” said the marchioness,
extending her hand towards him. “ My resolution is fixed.”
“ All — all is vain !” murmured Camille, proudly de-
clining a pledge so coldly offered.
“ I leave you, lady ;-
I obey your commands, and feel, — how bitterly feel,
your contempt. But no matter. To loiter here were to
risk my own safety, through which alone, yours may be
hereafter secured. I leave you ; but if your heart retain
one generous emotion, you will repent the needless pain you
have inflicted upon mine. I shall live to be avenged !”
So saying, and with a hasty step, he left the chamber.

But in quitting the Hôtel St. Florentin, a new solution
of Emiline's wilfulness suggested itself to his distrustful
mind, the carriage of the Chevalier de Mirepoix crossed
him as he passed the porte cochère.
CHAPTER IV.
Oh, sir! you are too bold and peremptory;
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us. Henry IV. 1st Pärt.
CAMILLE VALAZY, as the reader may have collected from
the foregoing conversation, was son to the foster-mother of
Madame de St. Florentin. Deprived in infancy of his
father, he was adopted by an uncle, Pierre Valazy, who
officiated as land-steward to the Duc de Navelles, and
rented a small farm in the vicinity of the château ; while
his mother was retained in the service of his noble foster-
sister, to share whose infant pastimes, Camille was fre-
quently and familiarly admitted. Thus honoured by the
favour of his lord, and cherished by his surviving con-
nections, the spirited boy would have grown up contented
with his destinies, but for the mortifications and malicious
provocations of his uncle's son, a lad several years his
senior. Maximilien, regarding him as an interloper in his
father's house, and jealous of the distinctions which his
mother's interest with her lady-nursling failed not to pro-
cure for him at the castle, profited by every occasion of
insult and oppression to harass his young cousin, and dis-
play his own perverse frame of mind. Nature appeared
indeed to have gifted him with every fair and noble attri-
bute, save the one which is fairest and noblest.
He was
beautiful in person, intelligent in mind, brave and hardy in,
temperament; but he had a perverse and malignant heart,
full of scorn and envy of the upright character of his poorer
kinsman.

THE SOLDIER OF LYONS.
Notwithstanding his ingratiating qualities, - notwith-
standing the open forehead, clustered with glossy curls, and
that mellowness of voice which is the eloquence of sound,
--notwithstanding his acute wit and resolute courage,
there was not a parent throughout the country who coveted
him as a son, nor a mother who desired him as the hus-
band of her daughter. Insolently overbearing wherever
his strength and daring could second his presumption,
Maximilien was abject and servile where his purposes re-
quired the aid of craft; and recoiled not from any sacrifice
or degradation, which could further his interests, or the
deep-laid schemes of his ambition. Accustomed to regard
the house of Navelles as his only source of family aggran-
disement, he exhibited all the zeal and devotion befitting a
faithful adherent; but as he advanced in years, and the
impulses of talent began to suggest a stronger conscious-
ness of self-reliance, the submissiveness of his obedience
gradually relaxed ; and he now calculated the possibilities
of lifting his head above those waves, through which he
had hitherto dreamed only of a safe and unnoticed passage.
Unfortunately for a mind thus constituted, Maximilien
Valazy had “fallen upon gloomy days” in the destiny of
his native country. His dawning reason fixed his con-
templations on the causes and relations of things, at a
period when the corruption of a feeble and vicious king *
began to introduce fatal disorders into the state, and to
disorganise the general frame of society. The Encyclo-
pedists were beginning to disseminate the doctrines of in-
fidelity and insubordination in every class of society; and
young Valazy, infatuated by their brilliant eloquence, had
enthusiastically enlisted under their banners, long before
the developement of his powers enabled him to estimate
the importance of the cause in which those banners were
unfurled.
Glorying in the philosophical dogma which seemed to
dignify his lawless insolence of mind, Maximilien realised
his first vision of equality among the sons of men, by qua-
lifying the Duc de Navelles, his father's ancient patron, as
a fou feoffé, in the hearing of all the elders of the village !
* Louis XV.

It happened that the duke, as tenacious of his privileges
of rural sport, as others of his degree in other countries,
exacted with absurd rigour the maintenance of the ancient
forest laws throughout his domains ; while young Valazy,
under the influence of his newly-acquired opinions, not
only presumed on their bold infringement, but pursued
his unlawful chase even into the presence of his hereditary
lord !
The Duc de Navelles remonstrated with the daring
trespasser upon his rights, in those strong terms with
which an old man generally allows himself to convey his
displeasure to a young one, even when holding an equal
station in life. Maximilien, however, who heard in the
well-merited reproof only the imperious mandate of an op-
pressor, retorted with such bold audacity, that the Duc de
Navelles, who was on horseback, was provoked to strike
him with the end of his whip. Valazy immediately sprang
upon him like an infuriated tiger; and tearing him from
his horse, was about to see “what blood the old man had
in him," when his attendants coming up, made the young
ruffian prisoner ; and two days afterwards a lettre de cachet
transferred him to the dungeons of the fortress of Bitche.
The elder Valazy, a devoted adherent to his seigneur,
saw in his son's disgrace only the fitting fruit of his mis-
doings. “He has dishonoured a loyal name," said the
old man emphatically; "and as to the punishment of his
offence, be it as our good master pleases.”
But there was one inmate of the farm of Grand Moulin,
who did not so patiently resign himself to the arbitrary
decree. Camille, who, though his nature differed entirely
from the violent and assuming character of his cousin, was
sufficiently imbued with the opinions of the liberal party
to resist with ardour and firmness the slightest show of
oppression,- was painfully affected by the stigma which
seemed to have affixed itself upon his family.
“ We, too, had our ancient pedigree !” said he ; “a
pedigree of four hundred years' unsullied yeomanship from
sire to son; during which, no shadow of disrepute dis-
honoured our name.
But now, a Valazy has received the
withering weight of a blow, and must not wash away the

stain with blood; a Valazy, - a free man, an independent
citizen,- is shut out by a tyrannous hand from the fair
light of nature; and must not plead, in the ears of men,
against the will of his oppressor." The impetuous youth,
though he still smarted under the malevolent sarcasms of
his kinsman, could not but regard with warm indignation
the infringement upon the rights of man in the person of
Maximilien.
In the excitement of the moment, he ventured even to
seek an audience of remonstrance with the Duc de Navelles,
who reproved his temerity with the loftiest scorn ; and the
youth thus casually roused to a spirit of peevish disputation
of the divine right and feudal privileges of the aristocracy,
gradually forsook his blameless routine of useful employ-
ment, to listen to the secret and deepening murmurs of the
discontented of his own degree.
His old uncle, terrified by the delusions which appeared
to extend their contagion through his household, vainly
endeavoured to recall him to the duty of passive obedience;
and Camille might perhaps have been tempted into some
overt act of defiance to the powers that were upon the
lands and estates of Navelles, had not his mother, in at-
tendance on her beloved and loving charge, arrived oppor-
tunely at the château. From that moment, a change
came o'er the spirit of his dream.”
Emiline de Navelles had at this time expanded from the
artless playmate of his infancy, into a beautiful, graceful,
and captivating woman. The charm of her character and
address was universally felt and acknowledged, even by
those who detected not the qualities from which it derived
its peculiar fascination. Tenderness of heart was the pre-
vailing grace which softened her demeanour, and actuated
every impulse of her character.
And now this perilous and overflowing softness of feeling
was beginning to assume the firmer texture of womanly
affection; Emiline being on the point of marriage with
the chosen of her heart, — the young Marquis de St. Flo-
rentin, her father's favourite nephew.
It was several years since she had visited Navelles,
or Camille been admitted to her presence ; but Madelon's

23
interest with the gouvernante of the young heiress easily
procured him an occasion to throw himself at her feet, in
order to solicit her interposition in favour of his unhappy
cousin.
“Rise, my good brother !” said the gentle girl, with
encouraging softness ; “if your wish be possible, it is
already granted ;' and running with privileged freedom
into the cabinet of the duke, her endearments readily pro-
cured an order for Maximilien's liberation.
" I have promised one concession on your own party
Camille,” observed Mademoiselle de Navelles, as she de-
livered the welcome document into his hands. “My father
is of opinion that a more active mode of life would afford
a profitable school both to yourself and to your cousin.
He exacts, in short, that you should leave this neighbour-
hood for a season.'
Camille Valazy, to whom, on many accounts, this sen-
tence of temporary banishment from Grand Moulin afforded
a welcome release, bowed his humble acquiescence; and
being aware that his cousin had long determined upon
leaving home, in order to enter himself as a student in one
of the Parisian colleges, resolved to accept an offer which
he had recently received — and half rejected
distant relative of his mother, to become an assistant in one
of the most flourishing factories at Lyons, of which his
kinsman was the resident director. Madelon, anxious that
he should obey the orders of his incensed patron, warmly
urged his departure ; nor did he long resist her recom-
mendations.
My destiny assigns me a less ambitious career than
my inclinations,” said he at parting. “But if it enable
me, mother, to acquire a decent competence, and render
your old age happy and independent, I am contented.”
“ And what has thy father's son to do with ambition ?”
replied Madelon, gravely. “Thy uncle has turned the
head of Maximilien, by sending him yonder to the city to
cumber his head with learning that unfits him for a life of
labour. Thyself, Camille, has caught the parrot-phrase
of his presumption, and with less excuse ; for thou hast
nothing to support thy pride,—not even the knowledge
from a

which is the serpent-tempter of thy cousin Max. Forget
it, my son, forget it ;--and in its stead, learn that thine
old mother derives her chief happiness from her depend-
ence on her kind protectors.”
Young Valazy blushed for his mother, - - then for him.
self ; and repeating that Navelles had long been insup-
portable to him, joyfully departed to embrace his new
vocation. He was scarcely aware that the feelings
which he carried with him, were so powerfully developed
as to have already decided the character of his future
destinies.
CHAPTER V.
And grave he grew, and inwardly intent,
And ran back in his mind with sudden spring,
Look, gesture, smile, speech, silence, every thing ;
Turning their shapely sweetness every way,

And she became companion of his thought. Leigh HUNT.
1
The interview between Camille and Mademoiselle de
Navelles had imprinted a new character upon the mind
and feelings of the young enthusiast. Alienated from the
gentler ties of domestic life, reared wholly among men and
far from his surviving parent, Valazy had acquired from
his solitary haunts and occupations a contemplative and
romantic frame of mind. To escape from companionship
with his ungenial cousin, he had selected in boyhood the
task of superintending his uncle's extensive flocks upon
the hills. Next, he became the woodsman of the farm ;
and in the course of either employment, had leisure to in.
dulge in that visionary exaltation of soul, so apt to generate
unquiet dispositions. The world of which Camille dreamed
in his solitude, was one of his own imagining; and its
visions were fatal to the subordinate course of his des-
tinies.
As he grew in years, the literary stores which his cousin

brought back from his brief course of city education, be-
came open to his inquiry; and the books which Maxi-
milien procured from Lyons, of a sceptical and democratic
character, became his constant companions. Without pilot,
without compass, he launched himself upon that mighty
ocean, whose waves have impelled so many an unwary
voyager to his destruction ; and which, though they laye
the shores of thousands of rich and prosperous countries,
have many a desert island threatening shipwreck. But
Camille thought not of the whirlpool, the iceberg, or the
volcano. He dreamed but of the flowery regions gem-
ming the bosom of that great deep of mind on which he
sailed deliciously along ; - enchanted with the varying
tints of shore and sky, and wooing the impulsive winds
and unseen currents forwarding his progress.
A person of so sensitive and delicate a cast, would
scarcely yield the rich prize of his affections to one of the
uneducated peasants of his native village ; above whom,
indeed, the Valazy family maintained an unsociable supre-
macy. In the depths of his solitude, his mind had figured
forth an idol, - lovely, pure, gentle, and intelligent,
which he delighted to lavish his homage ; and this fair
creature of his brain, “ this eldest virgin daughter of
the skies,” he had found realised in the sister of his
childhood, — the beautiful Emiline. Her image was min-
gled with his earliest reminiscences of tenderness and joy.
He had ever cherished the recollection of a fairy thing,
whose playful steps had danced with his own, whose
soft arms had twined round his little neck, — whose toys,
and treasures, and sweetest kisses had been lavished upon
“ her own dear Madelon's own dear Camille.” But the
tide of passionate feeling which now rushed upon his heart
rose from a different source. He still loved Emiline, but
he did not affect to misinterpret the nature of his love.
His very despair appeared to augment its fervour.
Even in the dull routine of occupation exacted by his
new employment at Lyons, Camille found leisure for the
day dreams of his affection. For the first time in his life,
imprisoned within the walls of a city, he soon thirsted for
the balmy morning air and greenwood depths of his native
on

forests. His mind was ever wandering in the valleys of
Navelles ; hanging like their native lilies over those
wandering streams, and picturing the fair form glancing
like that of a wood-nymph among the thickets of the vast
domain. Nor did he attempt to drive the image from his
mind:
'Twas but his taste for what was natural,
And still his fav'rite thought was loveliest of them all.
When at length there arrived a letter from his mother,
describing, in her usual terms of partial affection, the cele-
bration of the happy marriage of her foster-child, — the
festivities of the bridal day, the graceful loveliness of the
young wife, and the considerate kindness of the Marquis
de St. Florentin towards herself, Camille received the in-
telligence with only a transitory feeling of bitterness. The
bride was not removed by a single degree the further from
his humble adoration. Emiline de Navelles had been a
“ bright particular star” shining in the heaven of his
fancy; and Emiline de St. Florentin could be nor more
nor less.
“ Since this marriage insures her happiness,"
thought Camille, “ let me rejoice in its completion. — She
cannot form a wish of which I do not pray to Heaven for
the fulfilment.”
Meanwhile, Maximilien, released from his ignominious
durance, returned to Navelles to prepare for the course of
life assigned by his sentence of banishment; and which no
other circumstances would have induced his old father to
sanction. Pierre Valazy entertained an opinion, that agri-
cultural cares and labours offer the most honourable occu-
pation to those who boast no gentle blood as a plea for
idleness ; but he considered a life of study preferable to
one of mere pleasure ; and as his garners were filled with
plenteousness through his prolonged and laborious activity,
he readily supplied his son with the means of entering
himself in the Collège de Louis le Grand.

measure so consonant with his desires had been brought
about.

Grand Moulin, in the quietest and most inoffensive manner;
but the Duc de Navelles, with injudicious pertinacity, in-
sisted on bestowing a parting admonition on the refractory
offspring of his submissive steward. The impatient young
man would even have endured without remonstrance the
prosy dulness of his suzerain's common-place harangue ;
but the Duc de Navelles had unfortunately judged it ex-
pedient to summon his whole household as witnesses of an
audience so fraught with edification, as well as to mingle
with his reproof certain bitter taunts, which roused the
worst feelings of young Valazy's passionate nature. Too
deeply irritated to hear his insulting lesson to an end,
Maximilien rushed from the chamber. But as he reached
the door, he turned his flashing and dilated eyes upon the
astonished auditory; and extending one hand towards the
aged duke, in an attitude of denunciation, « Vouz m'avez
avili !” he cried. “ You have trampled me beneath your
feet. Fortune may yet place me where you sit--and leave
you where I stand :— nay! lower by ten thousand-fold !
I wait her sentence. - Aristocrat, we shall meet again !”
There was a deep silence as the sound of his departing
footsteps was heard echoing along the corridor; and the
domestics of the duke, instead of resenting the insolence of
Valazy, or intercepting his passage, fetched à general
breath, as if relieved from the presence of some superna-
tural being. Even young St. Florentin remained breath-
less with surprise ; and was glad to escape to the society
of his wife for further explanations.
“ Your father, Emiline,” said he, “ has made this day
an implacable and dangerous enemy.'
Dangerous? It is to be hoped the Duc de Navelles
may laugh to scorn the menaces of one so degraded as
Max Valazy.”
“No enemy can be considered despicable who is ani-
mated by an enterprising mind; more especially if, as in
the present instance, unrestrained by moral or religious
principle. It is by a combination of spirits such as that
of young Valazy, that factions arise fatal to the repose of
nations; and in the strife of the conflict, when individual
is opposed to individual, the finest attemperment of the

most polished weapon is no surety against the rude pike of
a deterinined assailant. Mark my prediction, Emiline, that
in the event of any popular tumult, Maximilien Valazy
will become a conspicuous leader. He unites an audacious
courage with the depth of sagacity requisite to attain such
an eminence.”
“ But why dream of popular tumults? - This is not the
first time I have heard you refer to such a bugbear.”
“ Nor will it be the last. The dissensions continually
arising between the king, his ministers, and his parliament,
- the growing unpopularity of her majesty,- the deep-
laid schemes of the Palais Royal -
“ Unpopular? - the queen unpopular? Dear St. Flo-
rentin, think for an instant of the last opera at which we
were present, and the applause that followed the chorus,--
Chantons, célébrons notre Reine !'"
“Remember rather the fickleness and exaggeration of our
national character. Children of impulse,- of enthusiasm,
- the sight of a lovely woman brilliantly attired, suffices
to obliterate for the moment all recollection of the undue
influence attributed to Marie Antoinette. While Dugazon
and Jélyot are pouring forth their thrilling harmonies, the
imaginary millions transferred by her intervention to the
Austrian treasury became of minor importance. But the
relaxed bow is easily strung anew; and there will come an
interval of calmer disaffection, when the busy spirits which
have long been secretly undermining our ancient consti-
tution will gather together like electric clouds.”
“ Silence, thou worse than Cassandra!” exclaimed Emi-
line, placing her hand reproachfully upon his lips.
momentary troubles excited between the court and the city
have altogether ceased, except in the minds of a few
alarmists like thyself. Après la pluie, le beau temps !'”
While the nobility of France were thus wilfully blinding
themselves to the gathering darkness which gradually ob-
scured the political atmosphere, numerous classes of the
discontented were beginning to organise their scattered
numbers into a common body: -- like the wandering veins
of a mine, extended through darkness, but united by an

unchanging centre. Among his fellow-students of the can
capital, Maximilien Valazy could not fail to encounter these
widely-spreading channels; and the kindred spirits with
which he surrounded himself gradually confirmed his
wavering principles into the extremity of democratic vi-
rulence.
Of these companions many have since attained unhappy
distinction. The romantic Camille Desmoulins,—the witty
and licentious Louvet, and others of their caste, have
been “ damned to everlasting fame,” as the earliest planters
of that tree of liberty, which, like the upas, dropped poison
upon the heads to which it proffered shelter. He became
member of the Breton club ; a popular orator at the sedi-
tious meetings of the day ; an anonymous contributor to
the periodicals established by his companions. He was
enlisted, in short, in the foremost ranks of the cabal which
grew and grew, till the earth was filled with the shadow
thereof.
It was not solely the influence of a perverted patriotism
or an ill-understood devotion to the cause of independence,
which united Maximilien Valazy to the popular cause.
He was anchored there by a barbed and venomed instru-
ment — by the power of Hatred, deep, dark, and con-
centred as the infernal gulf ! His father having died
during the first year of his banishment from Grand Mou-
lin, the Duc de Navelles, extending his allodial privileges
to their utmost limit, compelled the heir to dispose of his
leasehold rights, and expelled him from his territories. In
addition, therefore, to the clinging remembrance of a blow,
Maximilien cherished a recent consciousness of indignity
and oppression, which rendered the very name of Navelles
a rallying cry to the tumultuous passions of his soul. The
lust of vengeance fevered his every pulse ; and whenever
his pathway was crossed by the equipage of the Marquise
de St. Florentin, and all other eyes were riveted upon the
brilliancy of her innocent beauty, Valazy would again and
again mutter fiercely betwixt his grinding teeth,
tocrat, we shall meet again !”
How little, amid her career of success and prosperity,

smiles of her children, the applause of troops of friends,
and the “golden opinions of all sorts of men,” — how
little did Emiline imagine herself to be an object of intense
passion, of love and loathing, to two individuals lost
in that wide crowd, on which she gazed impassively as on a
painted sea! - Blinded by early prejudice, she would have
still regarded those obscure individuals as clods of her
native valley : congenial with the earth they were born to
dig for their daily bread. She knew not that the hour was
approaching when a Promethean torch would animate such
moulds of clay into a frightful intensity of being ; and that
her own destinies, and those still dearer to her, would hang
upon the uncontrolled will of men, whom she had seen
crouching on their bended knees in the presence of her
noble parent,
Begging their brother of the dust
To give them leave tu toil!

MEANWHILE the younger Valazy, destined to an humbler
sphere of action, and a mode of life the useful activity of
which forbad the continuance of his speculative studies,
became less and less interested in the disputes and discon-
tents of the new system of philosophy. It was his fortune,
and a happy one, to live among a race of men devoted to
the interests of their calling ; who, while they saw their
workmen thriving and peaceable, and their looms in full
occupation, were indifferent whether pope or emperor
ruled the hour. They were, in short, uninfected by the

prevailing and still prevalent mania for ruling and regulat-
ing a state, already perplexed with over-legislation ; and as
Camille, on his arrival at Lyons, found neither partisans
nor even listeners for his patriotic declamations, and as
he was now secure from the daily spectacle of aristocratic
encroachment, he became less morbidly tenacious of popular
rights; and devoted the exercise of his excellent under-
standing to the improvement and furtherance of the branch
of trade to which circumstances had attached his services.
In these views, his early proficiency in mathematical
studies, the sole profitable instruction he had gathered
from the aid of his talented cousin, — seconded his ardour;
and during his second year of attendance at the manufac-
tory, he effected a mechanical improvement which induced
the partners of the establishment to grant him a share in
the concern, as their easiest mode of repayment; - they
wished to make him their own at any price. The gentle
demeanour and fine person of young Valazy, had also their
part in securing his popularity, not only throughout the
populous establishment to the well-being of which his
cares were directed, but among the more respectable in-
habitants of the commune. He might even have realised
the destiny which romance commonly assigns to the in-
dustrious apprentice, by marrying his master's daughter;
the heiress of his elder partner having made some singular
demonstrations of preference in his favour. But Camille
appeared wedded to his commercial drudgery. He re-
mained unobservant of the coquetry of the young Lyon-
naise ; and retained his grave and reserved address through-
out the civic duties and social intercourse, to which he was
introduced by the wide connections and growing opulence
of the firm. He was sad without discontent; but his
melancholy, like that of Jacques, was one peculiarly his
own.
The only cheerful smiles in which he was seen to indulge,
arose on the occasional receipt of a letter from his mother;
which, in spite of its rude orthography, and the ruder
simplicity of its style, found a direct road to his heart.
Whatever errors of composition the epistles of Madelon
might exhibit, her sentiments were never ignoble; never

dishonouring either to herself or her son. Her tenderness
for Camille, her partiality for her nursling, formed the
themes of her correspondence; and even her gratitude
towards the Duc de Navelles, who, on the death of Pierre
Valazy, and the marriage of her lovely charge, had estab-
lished her in all comfort and honour upon the farm of
Grand Moulin, was free from any taint of servility. She
felt her claims on his generosity; and rejoiced that the
prosperity and filial duty of her son enabled her to receive
the partial munificence of the Navelles' family without
drawback from a degrading sense of necessity.
And then she dwelt with such fond fervour on the
graceful virtues of the child she had reared at her bosom,
of her own Emiline, of his! — who grew, she said,
in favour with God and man, and had now given the
world a copy, — and, according to Madelon, a very re-
sembling one, - of her excellence. Once or twice she ad-
verted to the strong anxieties entertained by the family of
Navelles, its friends and adherents, relative to the adjust-
ment of the popular differences, and the security of the
court of Versailles. But when with these words, – for
they had become mere words to Camille Valazy, — Madelon
proceeded to connect the name of St. Florentin and the
interests of little Emiline and her mother, he failed not to
regard with the seriousness due to its importance, a subject
which his secluded position and engrossing employments
had in a great measure withdrawn from his consideration.
A secret dread of crossing the brilliant path of Madame
de St. Florentin had hitherto determined Camille to decline
the pressing desire of his partners, that he should under-
take the annual settlement of their affairs with their Pari.
sian correspondents. He knew that Emiline, though un-
honoured by an appointment in the royal household, was
regarded as one of the most brilliant ornaments of the
court; where her simplicity of manners, the purity of her
conduct, and the perfect harmony subsisting throughout her
domestic relations, were enhanced by many an unfortunate
contrast. A more intimate knowledge of the frame of Pa-
risian society would have taught him that stars so differing
in glory as the beauty of the Faubourg St. Germain, — the

33
favourite of the Trianon, — and an unobtrusive merchant
of Lyons in his entresol of the Rue de la Jussienne, were
fixed in their allotted courses,— parallel, and incapable of
junction.
But various circumstances now concurred to change his
disinclination for a visit to the metropolis. Madelon's
recent communications were of a character sufficiently
alarming to direct his eager attention towards the position
of public affairs, and the destinies of those who were so
intimately involved in the distresses of the court; and
from the same quarter, he had received hints concerning
the conduct, character, and views of his cousin, which
struck him with dismay and regret. He was aware by
what wanton excesses Maximilien contrived to distinguish
himself, even in the most licentious capital of Europe ;
and by Maximilien's bold avowal of his vices, knew also
that the patrimony of the respectable Pierre had been gra-
dually melting away under the fiery clutch of sin ; while
his own generosity was frequently taxed to uphold the
falling fabric.
But he now resolved to see and judge the offender and
his offences, that he might remonstrate, or assist, as the
case might require ; and while mingling in the murmuring
crowd of the great Babylon, hoped to gather tidings from
its hubbub of the existing order of things, and hints of
their probable event. He prepared himself to feel much
disapprobation, to endure many disgusts, in that resplend-
ent world which had never yet shone upon his rustic eyes ;
and which books and his own fancies had exaggerated to
his conceptions, as books and fancies will exaggerate.
But even prepared as he was, the coup d'ail afforded
by Maximilien Valazy's suite of apartments, struck him as
some unreal and fantastic vision. He had been told that
his cousin entertained a guilty connection with a young
peasant of his native village; whose parents had been de-
ceived into a belief that she was engaged in honourable
service at Paris; while in reality she was degraded to the
condition of Maximilien's mistress, and initiated into his
arts of daring profligacy. Since the period of his cousin's
imprisonment, Camille had become a stranger to them both;

and his recollections of little Flavie portrayed her figure
clad in the short scarlet petticoat and sabots of her pro-
vincial costume ; with her good-humoured countenance
smiling archly beneath its coarse cornette of white linen.
In such a dress, he had last seen her when, in driving home
her father's cows from the pasture with a beechen bough,
she usually paused for a moment's gossip at the gate of
Grand Moulin ; where Maximilien, in his short jacket of
grey camlet, was leaning upon the very gun which had been
his passport to the ill opinion of the Duc de Navelles. The
whole scene rose before his eyes, - with its evening wood,
its blossomed hawthorns, its home-bound shepherds whis-
tling towards the farm ; and the freshness and simplicity of
such a picture served to heighten the glare by which he
was dazzled, as he entered the apartments of his cousin,
and surveyed the luxurious extravagance of their decora-
tions.
The rich texture of the rpets, -a luxury at that time
unknown in the provinces, - the commodes of carved
orange-wood, – the girandoles of massive crystal and can-
delabra of glittering steel ; curtains with draperies of filmy
muslin and cachemire,— tables of Sèvres porcelain, breath-
ing bird-like melodies from their invisible mechanism,
these and all the costly adornments of the gorgeous cham-
ber, appeared worthy of the boudoir of a fairy princess,
rather than of the retirement of a plebeian patriot, affecting
to sigh after the purity of republican austerity.
But if the extrinsic embellishments of his cousin's
dwelling excited his attention, his surprise was great in-
deed when the divinity of the shrine became visible ;
Mademoiselle Flavie herself, - affecting the extreme of
Parisian fashion,-gaudy and overdressed, - glaring with
rouge, and prominently exhibiting the foot which had dis-
carded its ebony sabot, enveloped in a stocking of brocaded
gauze, and a brodequin of the most delicate silk ! - She
interrupted the pause of displeasure which had
ceeded Camille's astonished start, by a forced and immode-
rate peal of laughter.
“ And is it to gild the waste of this heartless toy,-
this vain wanton, – that Maximilien has dissipated the

thought Camille. • Is it to breathe this enervating at-
mosphere, that he has deserted the wood and the valley ? ”
continued he, gasping under the oppression of an air loaded
with perfumes.
The hasty entrance of the object of his reflections in-
terrupted their indignant course. “ This is kind, indeed,
Camille !” exclaimed his cousin, advancing towards him
with a cordial welcome. - You have a mind superior to
paltry resentment of our boyish squabbles. Touche là,
mon ami !
Give me a forgiving hand. You have de-
layed our meeting something of the longest, coz ! — But,
absent or present, your friendship has afforded me more
than one timely lift.”
“ Your good father, Maximilien, was my earliest and
best friend.
“ While you are the latest and best my father's son can
boast, and thus the debt is acquitted ;
- which is more
than I can say of my own.”
“ In truth, the representation of your affairs contained
in your last letter
“ Hush, hush !—my hero of 'le Lyons d'or,' do not
open your financial budget before you have tasted my bread
and salt. —Go! Flavie, - you waste your labour to sit
simpering there. Your grimaces are quite thrown away
on this stoic of the woods. — Go! and order a repast
worthy of my cousin's welcome, and your own assiduity.
- Via! — vanish !-let us see no more of you till the
steam of an exquisite consommé overpowers your musk.
Camille will be otherwise as sick of you as I am.”
Neither abashed nor resentful, Flavie disappeared at his
command; but not so the amazement with which the un-
initiated provincial listened to his cousin's novel tone of
gallantry. To address a woman thus,
a woman whom
he had loved, who perhaps still loved him !
“ And when did you visit the good woman at the farm?
- I understand that drivelling dotard, old Navelles, added
cunning to his insolence,—(no fox so crafty as a grey fox,)
and pushed me from my stool, only to place his own

the walnut tree I planted by the gate ? —how.
“I cannot satisfy your curiosity, Max, on any point
regarding our old home. I have never visited Grand
Moulin since my mother's instalment,” replied Camille.
“ Ay, ay, a prudent politician! 'Twould be no jest to
re-encounter one of old Navelles's dictatorial admonitions !
You have too many crowns jingling in your pockets, Ca-
mille, to endure such solemn music now.'
“ Rather too much occupied in forwarding the interests
of a firm whose liberality has been the foundation of my
fortunes, to find leisure for a journey to Navelles.”
“ Like the rest of the world, your powers measure
themselves by your inclinations. Your time be
stretched to compass a visit to our gay city; while it
contracts spasmodically at the bare mention of a visit to
your old mother's drowsy chimney-corner.”
“ Business alone has brought me to Paris.”
“ Bring you what will, my sagest of cousins ! pleasure
shall keep you here, - I have some chosen friends to whom
I must present you,—master spirits, who will one day
write the world their debtor. - And Flavie - what think
you of the Ninette of Navelles, in her Parisian costume?

of the Rhone. N'importe! We must refine your taste.”
“ Pardon me! I judged your fair friend by a standard
that needs no refinement; by the noble simplicity of
of Mademoiselle de Navelles ; whom even yourself have
acknowledged as an exquisite model of loveliness and taste.”
“ Of Madame de St. Florentin ? - By heavens, Camille,

we parted at Grand Moulin !”
“No new fancies, perhaps.”
“You look as if you longed to add that mine are suffi-
ciently ruinous to suffice the family.”
“My dear cousin, you still over-rate my genius for
satire. Leave me to my own predilections, - I wage no
war with yours.”
“ Just as you please. It is your object to be sententious
rather then witty. So much the better, - I shall shiver no
lance with you on that ground. But I see the boy has proved
the father of the man ; you are still the grave, reserved
Camille who conned his lesson so demurely, hanging to the
old curé's rusty surplice. You made a little involuntary
bow when I named the Duc de Navelles, — just as my old
doting father used to touch his cap at the sound; and the
blood still mounts to your temple when you refer to your
foster-sister.”
“ You, at least, Max, can be charged with no such sin.'
You are indescribably altered.”
“ For the better? --Come,—be courteous, - and say
for
the very best.”
“ I will not prematurely pronounce your sentence,” re-
plied Camille, gaily ; “ but you are certainly more frank,
more cordial,
“Mere knowledge of the world! – Those who mingle
in the mixed society of a capital have no leisure to be re-
served, no time to make mysteries and marvels out of
nothing. Reserve is a provincial vice. We are so rich
here in conversational talents, such treasures of wit and
information lie scattered upon the surface of our earth,-
that no man cares to dig for hidden treasures.
“It was not frankness of manner, but of heart, to
which I referred.”
“ As we grow older our hearts expand,— stretch like a
familiar glove, and are worn as easily. 'Tis an art you
have yet to learn, my trusty and well beloved cousin. But

CAMILLE VALAZY was not long in accomplishing a more
intimate acquaintance with the connections, the habits, and
the projects of his cousin. The night following his arrival
in Paris was devoted to the celebration of one of the orgies
of the Jacobin faction: — orgies which served to minister
with equal success to the social vices of a licentious crew,
and mask those dark and powerful designs which were
gradually undermining the reckless footsteps of the royalists.
The unpractised eye of the younger Valazy rested with
undisguised amazement upon the group of patriots assem-
bled in Maximilien's gorgeous habitation ;
scene af-
fording a singular contrast with the “greasy rogues ” who
appeared familiarly habituated to its exits and its entrances.
He could not refrain from glancing from the buffets of
spotless marble, the carved and sculptured seats, the antique
lamps, and massive plate, — to the coarse and slovenly
human figures clustered round the board ; while to them,
those costly decorations, -except in the instance of a fine
statue bearing the name of Brutus on its pedestal, and
commanding the upper end of the room, appeared as ir-
relevant and disgusting, as their disordered uncleanliness
to Camille. He had already observed that every thing be-
longing to Maximilien wore an appearance of the most
studied elegance ; while his own dress and person assumed
as elaborate a display of negligence. But the short un-
powdered curls clustered round his forehead, and a cravat
loosely knotted to display his fine throat, so singularly

became the Grecian outline of his head, that they might
have been adopted to gratify his vanity, as much as to
task with reproof the trimly neatness of the courtly mus.
cadin, or satisfy the coarse prejudices of his party.
It was the beginning of the year 1789;. and the
spirit of revolutionary excitement which had not yet
broken forth into those overt acts of insubordination, of
which the taking of the Bastille in the course of the sum-
mer proved the initial signal, - was slowly gathering to its
full ripeness of mischief. Like vapours which condense
their mephitic influence in the lowest depths of darkness,
it brooded in expectation of its future prey. The names,
therefore, severally announced to Valazy upon his entrance,
though he recognised them as belonging to the accredited
agents of the Jacobin party, did not cause his heart to leap
within him, or oppress it with an overpowering mastery,
such as they have since assumed over the mind of man.
Danton, Marat, Barrère, Collot d'Herbois, Pétion, Louvet,
St. Just, the Abbé Fauchet, and Robespierre, were succes-
sively presented to the provincial kinsman of their host;
and the luxurious profusion of the repast to which they
immediately addressed themselves, aided by copious liba-
tions, soon warmed their hearts into cordial intimacy with
the new comer. They knew him to be a man of substan-
tial fortune, and respectable influence in a populous dis-
trict; and that in either character, he would form a valuable
accession to their party. But they soon perceived that he
was no weakling, to be hood-winked into a blind adoption
of their principles, or stunned by empty vociferation ; and
thus stimulated to an unusual desire for victory, the mental
gladiators rushed upon each other with powerful and earnest
animation,
But if the mind of Camille Valazy were fitted to receive
unharmed « food meet for strong men,” it was by no
means constituted to digest without irritation the poisoned
viands now set before him. Burning with youthful enthu-
siasm, and bewildered by dreams of social regeneration, he
was a pure and disinterested partisan of civil and religious
liberty; and sensible, as such, of the corruption of the ex-
isting order of things, was ardently desirous to behold both

the church and state of his native country cleansed from
the dust and cobwebs of time, and restored to a becoming.
degree of purity. He had prepared himself to join in ab-
horrence of a rapacious and degraded priesthood; but he
row heard his ancient faith reviled, - his Creator blas-
phemed. He had prepared himself to second their resist-
ance to the innovations of the aristocracy, and the encroach-
ments assumed as the prerogative of the crown by a
ministry equally bold and feeble ; – but he now heard his
anointed sovereign reviled as a driveller; the overthrow of
throne and altar calınly projected; and measures devised
and defended, whose covenants could be only sealed by the
profuse outpouring of human blood.
Till he listened to the intemperate menaces and ferocious
projects of Maximilien's guests, he had considered himself
enrolled in the liberal party. With rash self-committal, he
had trodden the first steps of a green ascent, when a fiery
crater poured over his head a shower of inflammatory mis-
siles ; and as he listened to the eruptive roar of the volcano,
he trembled, not only for himself, but for the country
lying within its scope of evil.
The horrors of civil anarchy rose shadowed before his eyes,
like the menacing spectres in the vision of Macbeth. He felt
how impure must be the worship, of which the arch-priests
reeled in licentious audacity on the threshold of their sanc-
tuary; and whose pernicious efforts would probably fan
the pure light kindled upon the altar of liberty, until its
gathering flames extended over the earth, even unto utter
devastation. The spirit of Camille sank rebuked, when he
remembered how often he had avowed himself a fellow-
labourer in the cause he now heard advocated with such
demoniacal fierceness, with such blasphemous invectives.
Among the interlocutors in the bold arguments by which
these feelings were awakened, Robespierre alone excited his
transitory sympathy. But be it remembered that the real
character of this ferocious man was still undeveloped. At
the period of Camille's visit to Paris, Maximilian Robes-
pierre was regarded in his party, as a generous enthusiast,
simple, candid, disinterested, and exclusively devoted to

the cause of the people.* They acknowledged that he was,
a man ungifted with superior talents; that his eloquence
was purely declamatory, without system, and without con-
clusion; la Patrie!” — that magic word, which possesses
in the ears of Frenchmen an inherent eloquence, - being
the still recurring embellishment of his vague but brilliant
orations. He looked to others for the care of every mea-
sure of redress. He had no plans to propose. He left to
Danton the task of suggesting expedients,-a task for which
he was eminently qualified by the boldness of his concep-
tions, the precision of his ideas, and the stern consistency
of his mind.
But while the opinions of Robespierre seemed prompted
by the frenzy of fanaticism, - so artfully did he manage to
disguise his fierce ambition,- Danton himself, lost in vo-
luptuous indolence, was gradually sinking into the licentious-
ness, which induced him to look forward with eagerness to
a disorganised state of society. The hope of escaping the
chastisement incurred by his vices enlisted his voice in the
advocacy of an irregular mode of government.
But of all this celebrated group, the person whose im-
portance appeared to Camille the least explicable, was Ma-
rat. Disgusting and deformed in his person, feeble in his
enunciation, and frankly avowing the rapacity of his views,
this “ fanfaron de crimes” would never have risen above
his calling as an outcast from all the better ties of human
nature, but for the singular governance he contrived to ac-
quire over the minds of the people, through the infamous
journal of which he was the editor. By addressing him-
seif with adroitness to the passions of the mob, and affect-
ing a tone of hearty cordiality in its cause, he created for
himself a spell of authoritative influence, which he after-
wards so memorably abused.
His pen was worthy the vile service to which it was de-
voted. But there were other hands more respectable, and
consequently more dangerous, which directed the periodical
press towards the same purposes ;

echo and tool of Robespierre ;-Laclos, — Raymond,-
Fabre d'Eglantine,—these, and others of equal talents, if
not of similar celebrity, were diligently employed in the
daily diffusion of the tenets of Jacobinism.
But although he occasionally cast his eyes on these
Journals, the organs of the democratic party, Camille Va-
lazy had been hitherto unaware of the designs and the des-
peration of their writers. He had believed their utmost
aim coincident with his own; to strip the throne of its
unnatural privileges, - to limit the influence of the aristo-
cracy, — and, in the formation of a new constitution, raise
the tiers état to its becoming importance. There were
times, indeed, when the tenacity with which Louis appeared
inclined to cling to the prerogative of his crown, -a tena-
city popularly attributed to the influence of despotic Aus-
trian blood, - coupled with the feebleness which appeared
incapable of retaining the rights thus vainly cherished,
induced him to admit the probability that an unqualified
revolution must follow the first innovation marking the
triumph of the popular party; which would probably be-
come irritated by the royal resistance, and encouraged by
its defeat.
But his amazement was great indeed, when he listened
to an assertion made by Danton, that the deposition, — nay,
the sacrifice of the king and queen,
would be required by
that powerful body, which the court of Versailles desig-
nated as the canaille ; while Barrère fiercely rejoined, that
“ the roots of the tree of liberty were never known to
flourish till watered with copious libations of the blood of
kings:---and that the vessel of the Revolution could only
reach its haven floating on the waves of a crimson sea.

ually regenerated amid heaps of corpses !” *

6 A spy;
some
conversation, could no longer resist expressing his indig-
nant rejection of these sanguinary opinions.
“ As an inhabitant of the second city in the kingdom,”
said he, “ I have an opportunity of judging the popular
temper on these subjects; and I boldly assert that, with
the exception of a few lawless and godless ruffians, the
people of France are still unseduced from their loyalty ;
and that however they may be disposed to resist oppression
and the wanton squandering of Cæsar's tribute money,
they would rally round the white banner of their kings, on
the first appeal to their hereditary affection.—A name is
every thing in France ; and the charm centred in that of
Bourbon, will never become obliterated !”
—a felon spy!-a skulking royalist,
abject minion from Versailles ! ” resounded on all sides,
on the conclusion of his bold address; while Camille,
calmly disclaiming their accusations, replied by a renewal
of his offence.
“ If there be a man of honour present here,” said he,
« let him singly repeat but one of the epithets so liberally
bestowed en masse, and he will find that I know how and
where to defend myself and my cause ; for it is that of the
liberal and honest portion of my countrymen."
Maximilien now interfered as a mediator between his
infuriated guests and the object of their suspicions; apolo-
gising for his cousin's petulance, and asserting that his
choler had been excited by the abuse lavished in the course
of their arguments upon the aristocratic patron of his
youth. The character of the Duc de Navelles had, in
truth, been handled among them with the most insolent
bitterness ; for as a member of the ministry instrumental
in placing Marie Antoinette on the throne, and a notorious
partisan of the emperor, he was regarded with abhorrence
by the revolutionary faction. Eagerly seizing an excuse
to qualify the expression of their intemperance, and shrink-
ing with the ordinary cowardice of assassins from the as-
pect of heroic enthusiasm, even beardless as that of the
younger Valazy,—they expressed their regret that his per-
sonal friendships and predilections should have been
wounded by their strictures. A hollow truce followed this

apology; and Maximilien, having warmly implored them
to re-seat themselves, and resume their convivialities, the
angry disputants could not but follow up their pacific over-
tures. They attempted every ordinary effort by which the
flagging gaiety of an ill-assorted meeting is stimulated into
the semblance of harmony. The song went round, -- but
its mirth was polluted with obscenity; the jest rebounded
from lip to lip,—but it raised only the hollow laughter
fitting its fiendish malignity ; the cup was drained, - but it
was with the coarse sensuality of inebriation ;- and still,
at intervals, many a furious glance and gloomy scowl was
furtively directed towards Camille. The thread of their
festivity was broken. Mistrust and disunion had crept
among them; and long before their usual hour of separa-
tion, the party seized some frivolous pretext to disperse.
“ And these Maximilien, — these are your vaunted
friends !” exclaimed Camille, as the latest lingerer left the
room ; men who unite the valour of the bravo, the
consistency of the hireling, the drivelling eloquence of the
novelist, and the morals of the gallies ! Is it from the
crooked policy of wretches such as these, we are to expect
that national regeneration which your friend, St. Just,
would seek in a baptism of blood ? — Is it from a lazar-
house we must court the pure impulses of health ? ' - Is
it from the caverns of vice we must listen for the oracles of
the gods ? ”
“My dear and very classical friend !” replied Maxi-
milien, attempting to smother by idle persiflage the
generous enthusiasm of his cousin ; “you are yourself
inclined to-night to play the Oracle ! Are these fits of
inspiration frequent with you?”
“ As you have heard my confession of political faith
this night, so will you ever hear it. I hold myself the
champion of a liberal monarchy.”
“Of a free tyranny,—a hot moonlight — a cold meri-
dian ! discerning preference !-- I wish you no worse ca-
lamity than the fulfilment of your own desires ! - But I
confess I was ignorant that the worthy weavers of Lyons
affect to cut their doublets à la Henri Quatre ; or only lay
them aside to bare their servile backs to the scourge of his

descendants. Nay, never look so sublimely indignant!
You seem expiring with the anguish of stifled magnani-
mity.”
“ Rather with shame for my cousin, - with sorrow for
my country.”
“A vile antithesis !- Banish, I pray you, all such ob-
solete forms of speech. Soyez de votre siecle ! Liberty
and patriotism are the order of the day, good coz; and
the order of the day, you know, is a peremptory order.”
“ Maximilien !" allow me one further word of expos-
tulation ; or rather allow me to suppose to trust - that
your necessities— which, believe me, are no longer a secret
-- have enrolled you in this accursed faction.”
Valazy, sobered by the earnest tone assumed by his
cousin, now haughtily replied that he wished to shelter
himself under no such inference.
“Without losing my time," said he, “in challenging
your right of interrogation, I hesitate not to assure you,
that every axiom advanced this night by my friends ob-
tains my hearty concurrence. The deliverers of an en-
slaved nation must not be startled, like a sickly wench, at
the sight of a few red drops. For what is the importance
of the whole existing human race, compared with the
welfare of future generations ? - What matters it, if a few
coroneted heads be given up to the axe, to secure succes-
sive ages of tranquil government? -I am no advocate for
bootless slaughter ; but I heartily believe that the greater
the transpiration of the social body, the more perfect its
health. — And, after all,” he continued, again affecting a
hideous tone of pleasantry, “ the guillotine is but a bed a
little less luxurious than those to which the aristocrats have
accustomed themselves.”
And
may I inquire,” said Camille, shuddering as he
spoke, “ whether the party to which you assert yourself as
belonging of your own free choice, is truly so numerously
and so potently organised, as my late courteous companions
persisted in declaring ?”
“ Undoubtedly! On the word of a kinsman and a true
man, I was present some nights ago at a secret assembly,
where four thousand persons affixed their signature to a

measure, which I must refrain from defining to so loyal a
subject and thin-skinned a politician, as my cousin Ca-
mille.”
“ Then God have mercy upon our country !” said Ca-
mille, with fervent solemnity.
“ Amen,-amen! for with a starving population, an
absolute monarch, and a profuse and licentious queen, she
has need of all the mercy which the universe can spare !
But her day and ours approaches, Camille !- When the
new light dawns, may it show you to me in the character
of a friend."

CAMILLE VALAZY retired from his cousin's Saturnalia to a
sleepless pillow ; where, again and again, the momentous
revelations of which he had been an involuntary auditor,
seemed to grate upon his ear, and startle his harassed mind.
But the more he reflected upon the characters of those
among whom the omens had been interpreted, the more he
was inclined to attribute their protestations to the swag-
gering of groundless self-confidence. « The bee wander-
ing among the poisoned plants of the Savannah,” said
he, " is said to gather only infected honey. Why then
give faith to the testimony of such men as Marat and
Danton ?”
But notwithstanding the self-reproval of young Valazy,
he could not altogether mistrust the declarations of Maxi-
milien's jacobinical associates ; and it was with an aching
head and heavy heart, that he rose the following morning
to receive the appointed visit of Monsieur Delplanque,-a
rich silk mercer of the Rue St. Honoré, with whose house

his own maintained commercial relations. After an hour de-
voted to the regulation of their concerns, during which the
obligations of debtor and creditor were satisfactorily adjusted,
the smirking man of the counter, polite as a court calendar,
and apparently desirous of condescending from his awful
eminence as mercier breveté de sa majesté," in favour
of the substantial credit of his provincial correspondent,
glanced upon his own elaborate array, his habit à galons,
and perruque à l'oiseau royal, observing that he was com-
pelled to assume a court dress, in order to conduct his
daughter to Versailles.
Indeed,” exclaimed the provincial, who had been
somewhat curious to know for what purpose the knight of
the ell-wand had girded on the slender steel sword, which
dangled importunately between his almost equally slender
legs.
“ Yes ! Monsieur Valazy ; we Parisians find it neces-
sary to hold our time and our persons at the disposal of the
court. Some days ago, I was honoured with the com-
mands of Madame Thibaut, to exhibit at Versailles a few
demiesaison novelties; and having ventured to take with me
my daughter, Mademoiselle Euphroisine, to assist in dis-
posing and displaying them to advantage, her dexterity and
modest demeanour attracted the favourable notice of ma-
dame; and
“She engaged your young lady as her femme de cham-
bre?" observed Camille, negligently, and with wandering
thoughts.
“ Sir!" ejaculated the amazed Delplanque, stretching
himself out like one of his own lustrings.
“ The talents of mademoiselle will, no doubt, do honour
to her choice.”
“A femme de chambre !— my daughter! -- the most
accomplished young lady — the richest heiress of the parish
of St. Honoré, a femme de chambre !- Sacré bleu !
Camille rose in explanation of an error which it was
difficult to qualify ; but the agitation with which old Del-
planque continued to smooth down his ruffles, and his fre-
quent interruptions of “ Une femme de chambre ! que dia-
ble!” filled up the pauses of his harangue. The mercer

of her most christian majesty, feeling conscious, however,
that graciousness became the lofty sphere in which he moved,
and recurring to certain views he had long entertained on
the merchant of Lyons, at length accepted with affability
the proffered olive branch.
“ Ah ! I perceive your mistake.
You intended to say,
'Demoiselle de compagnie de madame la surintendante de
la reine !' Quite another affair — quite another affair !
But to return to my little narrative. We visited Versailles,
sir, as I before informed you ; we were welcomed with
the most gratifying urbanity, as I now acquaint you ;
and we were honoured by an especial token of royal favour.”
Delplanque paused, either to fillip a particle of dust
from off his silken vest, or stimulate the curiosity of his
auditor. But Camille, on this occasion, prudently re-
frained from anticipating the nature of a distinction
adapted to the daughter of her majesty's mercer.
“ Yes! my young friend, a token of the most flattering
favour,” continued the old man, taking from his pocket a
perfumed play-bill elegantly printed on some of his own
white satin ; which, with spectacles on nose, he proceeded
in a pompous voice to recite.

On donnera ce soir, Mardi 20 Avril, 1789, une première

“ This play-bill, Monsieur Valazy,” said Delplanque, sud-
denly interrupting himself through a laudable preference
of his own prose to that of other people, —" this play-bill,
sir, enveloped tickets of admission for myself and Euphroi-
sine, to her majesty's most private and particular theatre
of the Petit Trianon ; a favour rarely conceded even to
those permanently attached to the household. But I have
not yet disclosed the most gratifying incident of the affair,"
he continued, bowing as if the mere recitation of the royal
name had filled his great soul with all the urbanity of the
Eil de Bauf, -" I say the most gratifying, inasmuch as

I trust it will procure my daughter and myself the ad-
vantage of Monsieur Valazy's society throughout the plea-
sures of the evening. Know, then, that the amiable Madame
Thibaut enhanced the value of her gift by presenting me
with an admission-ticket for a second gentleman ; conjec-
turing that, in all human probability, a young lady gifted
with the beauty, prospects, and accomplishments of my
Euphroisine, (she is Grétry's favourite pupil, Monsieur
Valazy!) could not be without an admirer.” And with
another flourish, Delplanque drew forth the precious ta-
lisman, and placed it at the disposal of Camille, who was
prompted by a first impulse to decline a gift appearing to
imply a degree of devotion towards Mademoiselle Euphroi-
sine, such as he was by no means inclined to assume. А
second consideration induced him to accept the offer of his
new and gracious protector.
"I will become a witness to the excesses of this vilified
court, I will look upon this haughty queen and her licen-
tious train !” said he, within himself, as he entered Del-
planque's plain but respectable-looking equipage ; and
under his benign instructions, was driven to the shops most
in vogue, to equip himself as became the royal presence.
“ You will do me the pleasure, sir,” said the old man,
authoritatively addressing a fashionable tailor, who had
undertaken to make the requisite alterations in a suit of
velours épinglé, fond vert du Nil, which some capricious
courtier had left on his hands, “you will do me the plea-
sure to forward this gentleman's dress, in the course of an
hour or two, to my house in the Rue St. Honoré :-- he
dines with me.”
“And whom have I the honour of addressing?” inquired
the respectful king of shreds and patches.
“ The mercer of her majesty!” said Delplanque, in a
tone that might have served to herald an ambassador from
the Sublime Porte.
The tailor bowed still lower at a designation so satis-
factory to his financial calculations. - The safest of cus-
tomers !” said he to himself. Ready money!” mut-
tered the foreman, as he brandished his needle ; and their
united labours faithfully fulfilled their share of the contract

a
to bestow upon the handsome young provincial the air of a
prince. Even Mademoiselle Euphroisine regarded her
esquire of the evening with unqualified approbation. Nor
was Valazy less pleased with the simplicity of her manners,
and the gentle deference of her address to her father,
grace which, throughout every rank of society, distin-
guishes the females of France. He scarcely observed, indeed,
the graceful outline of her head and waist, the dazzling
fairness of her complexion, or the surpassing sweetness of
her dimpled smile: a smile equally radiant still illuminated
the recesses of his bosom, neutralising the attraction of all
other charms; and even if the soft tones of Euphroisine's
voice had found their way to his ear, they would have
been quickly overpowered by the sonorous eloquence of her
pompous father; who, in compassion to the rustic ig.
norance of his companion, now proceeded, as they drove
leisurely along the route to Versailles, to illustrate the play-
bill and dramatis persone, with notes explanatory of his
own.
“ Hem! hem! voyons, voyons! Who shall we have
to-night? - Aha! Madame la Duchesse de Polignac,' the
friend of the queen ; an object of admiration to the whole
court-of jealousy to the whole city — of adoration to a
certain royal prince who shall be nameless. - Madame la
Princesse de Lamballe,' the loveliest flower of Versailles ;
a daughter of the royal house of Savoy, and daughter-in-
law to the Duc de Penthièvre. Ah! Monsieur Valazy,-
could you but see her in a polonoise of brocaded silk,
couleur des cheveux de la reine, -- the new colour, sir,
which I have lately invented !--- As the queen's mercer by
appointment, such little attentions are expected at my
hands. - Hem! hem !- Let me see- let me see - who
have we next on our list? —Madame la Marquise de St.
Florentin ;' an angel, Monsieur Valazy, a very angel! -
The most adorable woman in Paris ! I have only to fur-
nish her a piece of taffeta, and it becomes the fashion in a
week!”
While the enthusiastic Sieur Delplanque continued to
apotheosise the beauties of the court whose titles graced at
once his ledger and the bill before him, Euphroisine was

pondering over the extraordinary confusion which suddenly
manifested itself in the countenance of Monsieur Valazy,
and was succeeded by as marked a paleness. Believing
him to be indisposed, she silently let down the glass of the
chariot; but on perceiving that even with this accession of
air he still gasped for breath, she directed the attention of
her father towards his guest.
“ Merciful Heavens! what an alarming perturbation !
· Was Monsieur Valazy unwell ? was he subject to
these nervous attacks ? — Perhaps the purée à la Pompa-
dour had been too much for his digestion ; the Eau
doré too poweful? -
“By no means ; but
“ Was Monsieur Valazy inclined to return to Paris ? ”
6: On no account; but
“ Would Monsieur Valazy, on arriving at Versailles, de-
sire to consult the physician, - surgeon, - apothecary,
or pharmacien of her majesty? - The name of Delplanque
would gain access to the whole faculty ; - he had there-
fore only to speak.”
No! Monsieur Valazy expressed himself already reco-
vered from his seizure. And Euphroisine, detecting with
the tact of her sex, Camille's anxiety to divert the attention
of his companions, readily engaged her father in a critical
comparison of the various physicians attached to the house-
hold ; while Valazy, by a strong effort, regained his com-
posure.
Those who, habituated to the publicity of the world, are
accustomed to see their holiest sentiments exposed to the
scrutiny of society, can ill imagine the feelings of a vision-
ary who, having nursed in solitude some delirium of the
heart, shielded its sweet fancies from observation, guarded
its hallowed object within an unapproachable shrine, and
madly lavished there its silent fervour of devotion, is sud-
denly required to hear “ the one loved name pronounced
in the vulgar tone of every-day comment ! Valazy, who
had cherished with such an excess of susceptibility his pas-
sion for the lovely companion of his childhood, - who had
contemplated her noble graces till his eye rested with dis-
satisfaction upon every meaner forin, - who had preserved

through time and absence that beauteous image unweakened,

but to wonder that the spell still hovered unrelaxingly on
his lips, — who
Went on, gathering sweet pain
About his fancy, till it thrilled again,
was not prepared to see his idol dragged out for common
worship, — named with indifference, – perhaps with blame
or reproach. His contempt for Delplanque deepened into
disgust, as being the origin of his sufferings; and it was
not till they reached the outskirts of Versailles, that he
had sufficiently regained his composure to re-assure his
anxious companions, by entering into conversation.
Having argued himself into some degree of self-com-
mand, he began to rejoice that he had been thus unwittingly
betrayed into the presence of the woman he idolised. “I
shall find,” thought he, in wilful self-deception, “ that
time has subdued the vehemence of my vain, my romantic
attachment. I shall find that I can gaze on my mother's
precious nursling with the same pure spirit of adoration
that a Persian regards the sun. I shall see her shall
see that face upon whose every lineament my memory has
dwelt so fondly. Unseen- unsuspected- uncared for,–
I shall look upon her blessed face again ! ”
His train of reflections was interrupted by the compla-
cent self-gratulation with which the “ mercer by appoint-
ment” pointed out to his notice that, though their car-
riage bore no armorial decorations, his card was a sufficient
passport with the Swiss to admit it into the court-yard.
“ The name of Delplanque, you perceive — my estima-
ble young friend
the humble name of Delplanque is
equivalent to a peerage ! ”
But the busy loquacity of the elated cit of the Rue St.
Honoré was soon subdued into the deferential composure
fitting the time and place; and having passed in safety
“ the gates, the guards, the wall,” and followed the guid-
ance of an usher of the court to their appointed post, the
little party found itself seated in a portion of the pit railed
off for the accommodation of a few spectators, comprising
the most respectable inhabitants of the town of Versailles,

and one or two eminent purveyors of the court; among
whom, as indeed among the more exalted portion of the
audience, the appearance of the beautiful Euphroisine ex-
cited a general murmur of admiration. But Camille Va-
lazy marked not the cause - noted not the effect - gazed
not on the burning blushes of his conscious companion.--
One thought

- only Emiline !

Une erreur de fait jette un homme sage dans le ridicule. Il y a de petites

They were among the earliest spectators; a circumstance
attributed by the polite Delplanque to his desire that his
country correspondent might be the more completely ini-
tiated into the mysteries of the scene. As the boxes be-
came gradually filled with all that was illustrious and lovely
in the land, Euphroisine proceeded to enlighten the mind
of the pre-occupied and indifferent Camille, by announcing
the court-beauties familiar to her knowledge through her
participations in the details of her father's business.
But her gentle whispers were urged in vain. Neither
the brilliantly illuminated theatre, -the exquisitely modu-
lated orchestra, the personages who negligently lent their
charms to the front rows of the boxes, nor the still love-
lier one who blushed so humbly beside him, were capable
of fixing his attention. Camille remained bewildered and
unobservant; till, on the entrance of a group of lovely
children into the stage-box, a murmur arose from the part
of the theatre in which he sat, of “ Vive Monseigneur le
Dauphin - Vive Madame!”
At the suggestion of Madame Mackau, their sub-gover-

ness, these infantine representatives of royalty gracefully
acknowledged the applause which greeted their arrival;
while the eyes of Camille remained riveted upon their box.
Euphroisine, observant of the air of interest with which he
gazed on the “ Children of France,” and believing it to be
excited by the delicate appearance of the young dauphin,
immediately began a loyal refutation of the vulgar opinion
that he did not share the affections of his mother equally
with madame royale and the Duc de Normandie.
But it was not the dauphin's precarious condition, nor
the imputed alienation of the queen's attachment, which
absorbed the attention of Valazy. Several children of the
nobility had been admitted into the royal box; and among
them, a fairy girl, with long glossy brown curls overhang-
ing her little shoulders, whom Camille could have avouched
that he had carried a thousand times in his arms, and be-
stowed a thousand kisses on those waxen cheeks, affording
a faultless model of fantine beauty.
“ It is Emiline!”
he murmured My own Emiline !
“ It is, indeed, the little Emiline de St. Florentin," ob-
served the astonished Euphroisine ; but she had no time
for farther explanations. The curtain at that moment
drew up, and discovered Marie Antoinette in all the splen-
dour of her youthful beauty, her glistening hair not yet
blanched by the vigils of anxious sorrow, nor her clear blue
triumphant eyes sullied by tears of humiliation. Her dress
was adjusted with the perfection of elegance which was one
of her sins in the eyes of the multitude ; and even the
costume of her attendant was of the choicest fashion.
That attendant was the Marquise de St. Florentin.
Mamma, dearest mamma !” exclaimed the startled
cherub of the stage box, clapping her little hands in un-
controllable ecstasy; while, notwithstanding the prolonged
st, st, resounding through the house, every spectator sym-
pathised in the affectionate rapture of the delighted child.
« Ah ! there are few such mothers !!” - whispered a
venerable old man who was seated beside Valazy.
Respectable in all the relations of life ! ” was the re-
joinder of the person to whom his comment was addressed.
“ As daughter — wife - mother friend - mistress

not a disparaging word has ever been attached to the name
of Madame de St. Florentin.”,
It was fortunate for Camille that the place assigned him
by the usher in waiting enabled him to recline against an
adjoining pillar. Confused murmurs rang in his ears, and
more than his former death-like faintness overcame him,
when the first melting accents of Emiline's voice stole
upon his heart.
To support those smiles, unconsciously
directed towards himself; to hear the playful modulations
of that voice, — and yet endure the presence and the gaze
of thousands, was a task beyond his fortitude. Motion-
ing, therefore, to his friends, to let him depart unnoticed,
he profited by the first change of scenery to escape from
the theatre.
The chamberlain in waiting at the entrance, followed
him into the corridor, to ascertain the cause of this hasty
and perturbed exit; but Camille, heedless or unconscious
of his breach of etiquette, rushed down the great staircase
towards the air, precipitately crossed the court-yard, and
with a distracted step and gesture, hastened onwards with-
out a pause, till he reached the avenue De Madrid. Breath-
less froin speed and emotion, he staggered towards the
bank; and throwing himself on the grass, relieved the
horrible oppression which overcame him, by an uncon-
trollable burst of tears. Scarcely had he succeeded in stifling
his almost convulsive sobs, when he perceived that two
officers of the royal body-guard were standing by his side.
" What means this intrusion, gentlemen?” he exclaimed,
starting up in painful consciousness of the ridicule which
might attach itself to a predicament, rendered provokingly
apparent by the importunate radiance of a bright moon,
shining through the still leafless branches.
“I believe, sir, I may consider the object of my intru-
sion sufficiently answered,” replied the garde du corps, in
a tone of mild sympathy. “ The officer on guard, alarmed
by your abrupt and unceremonious departure, commanded
me to trace your route.”
“ As a madman ? ” observed Camille, with bitterness;
- "
or possibly, as an assassin ? ”
“ In this season of popular excitement,” replied the

stranger, “it becomes the duty of all who share in guard-
ing the safety and well-being of the royal family, to keep
a jealous eye upon the movements of such strangers as
appear to consider the presence of their sovereign no
restraint on their caprices. In the present instance, your
involuntary betrayal of affliction in my presence, pardon
me, sir, if I allude to that which gives you pain, be-
comes the warrant of your innocence.”
The young officer would have proceeded in the same
considerate tone, when a police officer with two attendants,
evidently charged to reinforce the military scouts,
came up to the party ; and with rough interrogation, de-
manded the name and residence of the stranger.
“Has this fellow authority for his impertinence ? ” in-
quired the indignant Camille, of the garde du corps by
whom he had been first addressed.
“ The gentleman is the servant of his majesty,” replied
the young officer ; “and you will not, I am persuaded,
resist an inquiry which purports no offence towards your-
self."
s Your
name, young man ? ” persisted the officer of
police.
“Valazy - merchant of Lyons."
“A name of no good omen, you will allow ?
claimed the man, addressing his observations to the two
gardes du corps. Some kinsman, I doubt not, of the
notorious Jacobin."
“ It is the name of a loyal subject,” replied Camille,
turning fiercely upon his interrogator, were he kin to a
thousand Jacobins !”
“ You will, in that case, offer no resistance to the search
I am commanded to make on your person. A loyal sub-
ject disputes not the mandates of his sovereign.”
“How say you, gentlemen ?” said Valazy, who now
began to understand the nature of the suspicions his pre-
cipitation had incurred. “ Have I subjected myself to
this humiliating scrutiny ? '
“ You will expose yourself to less annoyance by sub-
mitting quietly to an inquisition, which I am persuaded
will produce only a result honourable to yourself,” replied

the elder of the officers, a counsel with which Valazy
complied without further demur; and great was their
satisfaction, for the distress of mind betrayed by the
handsome young stranger had interested them in his
behalf, when the search thus unceremoniously instituted
brought to light neither weapon nor implement more
dangerous than a well-stored pocket-book.
Previous to an operation which the irritated feelings of
the prisoner rendered galling beyond description, the party
had been invited by the porter of a château adjoining the
road, to enter his lodge ; where, flambeau in hand, he
assisted to throw light upon the investigation. All was
now cleared up. The officer of police grew courteous as a
chamberlain at the sight of his intended prisoner's morocco
treasury ; the gardes du corps renewed the expressions of
their regret at the consequences which had visited his in-
advertence; and Camille, a few inches taller than usual,
was about to leave the lodge, when an officer, apparently of
the household, in a uniform brilliantly decorated, galloped
to the door ; and stooping from his horse, received the
respectful report of the subordinates, of which a few de-
tached sentences uttered by the gardes du corps reached
the tingling ears of its object.
Totally unarmed - sudden indisposition certainly

“ Camille Valazy of Lyons?” shouted the officer, leap-
ing from his horse, and abruptly entering the lodge.
“ Valazy! my worthy friend — when next you permit
your brains to go wool-gathering in the royal presence, for
Heaven's sake and for your own
warn your friends of
your infirmity; or one of these romantic vagaries of yours
may chance to leave you in one of the dungeons of the
Tour de la Bazinière. The Bastile has opened her rapa-
cious jaws to devour many a prisoner on grounds less sus-
picious. You may retire, gentlemen,” he exclaimed, ad-
dressing the other three ; " and since you will precede me
at the palace, be so obliging as to acquaint the Duc de
Liancourt, who is in waiting to-night, that the person whose
abrupt departure from the theatre has given rise to such idle

alarm is a gentleman, of whose good intentions and loyal
sentiments Madame de St. Florentin will hold herself re-
sponsible to her majesty, should the exaggerated reports in
circulation reach the ear of the queen.”
The Marquis de St. Florentin — whom fortune had thus
opportunely brought to Camille's assistance was now left
alone with his young protégé ; and struck by the pallor of
recent indisposition which overspread his countenance, in-
sisted that he should rest himself for a few minutes, while
the officious old porter procured him the refreshment of a
glass of water.
“ I perceive with regret that you are really ill," observed
the marquis, with the kindest interest. “I shall there-
fore defer my exhortation till a more convenient season.
Emiline will grieve to find that I have renewed my ac-
quaintance with her foster-brother under circumstances in
every point of view so unsatisfactory. I often remind her,
Camille, of the chasse au chevreuil I used to have with you,
during my vacation, in the forest of Navelles, — particu.
larly when I wish to disparage the royal battues of Fon-
tainebleau.”
“ Five years have elapsed, Monsieur le Marquis, since
my days of servitude at Navelles."
“ Ay, ay! we have heard, through your good mother,
Camille, of your advancing prosperity. But Madelon
neglected to inform us that you were grown too proud to
old friends."
My visit to Paris has been one of mere business.”
“ It has been that which you pleased ; — I trust it will
become pleasing to others, -to ourselves, your oldest friends.
To-morrow, sir, we return to town; and you must take
up your quarters in the Hôtel St. Florentin.”
Camille retained sufficient presence of mind to assure
the marquis, that an immediate necessity for his return to
Lyons forbad him to profit by so much intended kindness.
“How! not delay your departure for a single day, that
you may bestow it on your earliest friend and playmate ?”.
cried the marquis.
“ I am deeply sensible of the Marchioness de St. Flo-
rentin's condescension, though it simply repays the
visit your

59
respect of my devotion towards herself, towards her
family,” replied Camille. “ In bidding you adieu, mon-
sieur le marquis, believe me grateful for your gracious
intention."
“I will extend my faith to an almost impossible limit,
and believe in your good-will, though you look and speak
as if you could knock me down without remorse,” cried
St. Florentin. “ One word more,” continued he, in a
lower tone. “I trust, Camille, you have not passed your
time during this hasty visit in the society of your cousin?
- Maximilien has become a marked man; and most ob-
noxious to the well-thinking part of the community.”
“I fear it is impossible for me, to take on myself the
championship which our near connection might seem to
dictate,” replied Valazy. “I have spoken with my cousin
only twice during as many years.”
“Good — good! Emiline will rejoice to hear that a
connection so unpromising for your reputation is broken
off. But you must not think, Camille, of returning to
Paris on foot, in your present feeble condition,” continued
St. Florentin, with an air of friendly consideration. “Since
you do not feel equal to wait the departure of your friends,
remain here for five minutes, and I will send you an equi-
page. Nay! no remonstrance no re-assumption of your
air of magnanimous disdain !”.
Camille smiled.
“ Come! all is right again !. You look like yourself,
your boy-self, when you are cheerful. And now, good-
night, Valazy. Let your friends hear often of your wel-
fare !” — and having cordially shaken him by the hand,
the marquis hastily remounted his horse. In another
moment, the clatter of distant hoofs announced his hurried
departure; and the sound was altogether lost, before
Valazy could recover from his stupefaction.
In less than a quarter of an hour, a well-appointed car-
riage drove up to the lodge, whose lackeys, in the gor-
geous St. Florentin livery, wearing bouquets as large as
bushes, inquired of the stranger to what quarter of Paris
he wished to be conveyed.
As he rolled rapidly along, at the impetuous pace of the

blood-horses then in fashion, Camille, leaning from ex-
haustion against the silken cushions, recalled to mind that
a few short hours before, the cheek of Emiline might have
rested on the self-same spot. He detected the Cipre per-
fume which she habitually wore. A flower lay upon the
seat, which, from its freshness, he believed to have formed
part of the decoration of her dress. — He seized it, and for
an instant was about to press it to his lips, and make it
his own; then throwing it from him with equal im-
petuosity, he disclaimed the sickly and forbidden sentiment
which rendered it precious to his heart.
“She is the beloved and loving wife of another,” said
“ to me, the phantom of a dream !— And what if
her presence have power to stir my blood — her voice to
suspend my breath. Is it not the mere seclusion of my
life which has preserved their influence unimpaired ? -
Had I mingled were I now to mingle, in this giddy
joyous crowd — should I not teach myself to dismiss this
chimera from my brain,- should I not learn to consider
her but as one of the fairest of its gilded puppets ? And
shall I meanly remain the slave of circumstances ? - Out
on my folly!- Emiline is nothing, or shall become nothing,
he;
-
to my heart !"
Arrived at Paris, he flung a louis-d'or to the powdered
jackanapes who scornfully sought out his obscure lodging;
and who despised him only the more for his exaggerated
liberality.
Valazy's slumbers that night were scarcely less disturbed
than on the preceding one. So ardently did he labour to
forget Emiline, that he thought and dreamed only of
herself.
Pour chasser de sa souvenance
L'ami secret,
On ressent bien de la souffrance
Pour peu d'effet.
Une si douce fantaisie
Toujours revient ;
En songeant qu'il faut qu'on l'oublie
On s'en souvient !

CHAPTER X.
O l'enuyeux conteur!
Jamais on ne le voit sortir du grand seigneur.

Et ne cite jamais que duc, prince, ou princesse.
MOLIERE.

ALARMED by the probability of being molested by further
kindness on the part of the St. Florentin family, Camille
rose with a determination to quit Paris with the mail-
courier that very evening; and was projecting a visit of
explanation and adieu to the mercier breveté de sa ma-
jesté,” when the old gentleman himself entered the room.
Though Delplanque no longer wore his dress of cere-
mony, his step was far statelier and his manner more
dignified than before. After a very formal inquiry after
the health of Monsieur Valazy, he began to express his
regret, or more accurately, his displeasure, that the indis-
position or caprice betrayed by his young correspondent on
the preceding evening should have exposed himself and
his daughter to the most alarming suspicions.
Nay!” exclaimed the irate old gentleman, extending
with one hand his gold-headed cane, and with the other
his ponderous agate snuff-box, “even my loyal reputation,
and a respectability of thirty years of solid credit, has been
endangered by your petulance. You have committed me
with the court of Versailles, Monsieur Valazy- cruelly
committed me; and I consider it essential to seek an
audience of the minister of the interior for my disculpa-
tion. I have already waited in private upon the Marquis
de St. Florentin ; who, I understand, was deputed by her
majesty to inquire into the affair ; and have forced him to
acknowledge the improbability that a man of my standing
and experience should share in that hot-headed infraction
of propriety, which might be very natural in a young pro-
vincial like yourself.”
- You surely have not been so importunate.”

“ Importunate ! - - me— Delplanque, mercier breveté de
sa majesté — importunate ? My dear sir, you do not
justly appreciate the mischiefs of being classed among the
friends and associates of a Jacobin, - a stigma which your
inadvertent folly has fixed upon yourself. No, sir! I

diate return to Lyons, and my own most active
“ Without recognising the prévôt des marchands' right
of admonition, or seeking counsel from friend or foe,-
nay, without further consideration of a very trifling and
equally misconstrued incident, I have come to a similar
conclusion.- I leave Paris, Monsieur Delplanque, this
very evening.”
“ So much the better, — so much the better.
I rejoice
to see that my authority has its due weight with you.
Ignorant as you are of the world, friendless in Paris, and
led away by romantic exaltation of mind, I consider my-
self responsible for your safety to my worthy.correspond-
ents, the Sieurs Dacquin, of Lyons. My good young
friend ! you have no doubt an excellent heart, - I do not
dispute its excellence ; but, unfortunately, a good head
does not fall to every one's share.. As I was observing to
the lovely marchioness just now, • Our young protégé,

emphasis ' a little in alt, or so!' But we shall form
you, Monsieur Valazy, — we shall form you. Even ma-
dame la marquise expressed her perfect satisfaction when
she understood how implicitly you pin your reliance on my
guidance.”
Perceiving that any attempt to undeceive a man thus
guarded round with self-sufficiency would be labour lost,
Camille attempted some formally polite inquiries concern-
ing Euphroisine; but on this topic Delplanque appeared,
if possible, more vexatious and tormenting than before.
He persisted in giving the most gallant motive to every
trivial compliment uttered by the wealthy young merchant
of Lyons. He chose to assign a secret signification to
every word ; replied with a short laugh of most provoking
implication ; reminded Camille that he had been young

63
himself; and finally gave him to understand, he had intro-
duced the episode of his imputed admiration of the fair
Euphroisine into his round unvarnished tale to the St.
Florentin family.
Either the surpassing irritation of being "sprighted with
a fool,” tended to kindle into a deeper glow the fever
already burning in the veins of Valazy, or the current of
the old man's absurdity had exhausted itself; for Del-
planque became suddenly struck by the change which a few
short days had wrought in the appearance of Camille. He
insisted on feeling his hand-his pulse ; pronounced him
to be in a raging fever; and having resolved on summon-
ing to their council a coadjutor less offensive to the sufferer
than the prévôt des marchands, in the guise of a skilful
family physician, found himself compelled to yield to their
importunities, and enter his bed instead of a travelling car-
riage. A cold caught on his journey and neglected during
the press of business, the intense excitement of his cousin's
detested orgies, and more than all, immersion in the night
dew after the enervating atmosphere of the court-theatre,
had united to produce a violent fever. In the course of
the night, Camille became delirious; and on the second
day, his life was despaired of!
Delplanque, with officious zeal, judged it expedient to
call at the Hôtel St. Florentin, and acquaint the marquis
with his imminent danger; when Emiline immediately des-
patched an express to Grand Moulin, to apprise the good
Madelon of the situation of her son ; and on the fifth night
of Camille's overwhelming attack, his mother was watching
by his bedside. For days, for weeks, he lingered on the
verge of the grave; raving of past recollections and chi-
meras for the future; and lavishing on many a careless
ear those hallowed secrets which he had thought to yield
but with his life.
At length the force of ycuth unimpaired by excess, and
the vigilance of careful tending, restored him to conscious-
ness, to motion, to strength; and soon, the only symptom
remaining of his severe illness, was a sobered demeanour,
and still more subdued mood of mind. He learn wit
gratitude, and gratitude alone, that the St. Florentins had

64

been unceasing in their attentions to Madelon and to him-
self throughout the period of his sufferings.
" It is well, mother !” replied Camille ; « Time will
probably afford me an occasion to mark my sense of their
kindness."
“ But now that you have consented to return home with
me, my dear son, and perfect your recovery in
your
natal
air, you will at least not leave Paris, without acknowledging,
by a parting visit to the marchioness, that you are grateful
for her interest in your sufferings ?”
“ No, mother! no ;— they are noble, I am base !
No relations can exist between us, but such as are embar-
rassing to them, and humiliating to myself. Let them be
content with the consciousness that they have conferred an
obligation.”
On arriving, however, at Grand Moulin, this ferocious
spirit of independence subsided into a milder feeling, when
he perceived the affectionate care with which Madame de
St. Florentin had laboured to surround the guardian of her
childhood with those flattering luxuries, rendered neces-
saries to Madelon by long domestication among the rich
and noble. Without ostentation, the most considerate ten-
derness seemed to have suggested every arrangement for
her personal comfort; and Camille watched over his mo-
ther as she dozed in her easy chair, without wondering that
she should dream of madame la marquise, as of a superior
being.
But it was not as madame la marquise that Madelon
either thought or dreamed of her foster-child. However
her speech might define the lady of St. Florentin, to her
heart she was stil] “ Emiline,” as truly and tenderly as in
the days when wont to guide her little footsteps among the
parterres of the Château de Navelles. — She was Emiline
in the prayers nightly offered to the Almighty for her wel-
fare ; - she was Emiline in that morning burst of joyful
thankfulness, with which she went forth to enjoy her bene-
fits, and sun herself in the light of heaven. Madelon,
the daughter and widow of a vassal of the Duc de Navelles,
pretended neither to gentle birth nor gentle breeding. But
she was wholly uncontaminated by vulgarity of mind.

65
She spoke, it is true, the dialect of her native village ;-
but it served to express the sentiments of an honest and
generous heart. She saw no further into things that met
the eye or ear, but she saw them undistorted by malicious
interpretation. She had loved the infant Emiline more as
a daughter of her hereditary lord, than as a charge capable
of insuring her future fortunes; and she loved the mar-
chioness, as her nursling - her own her fille-de-lait-
her child in all but blood ! — Even Camille her only son,
claimed not so close an adoption in her heart; for strange
to tell, she felt his superiority over herself, with a more
marked consciousness than that of the Marchioness de St.
Florentin. His honours were all acquired. She had seen
his ascent towards his present height of prosperity ; while
Emiline's dignity of station appeared in Madelon's eyes a
part of her original self. But though embarrassed by the
sense of her son's superiority, she dearly loved him ; was
proud of his talents and his virtues ; and, moreover, pecu-
liarly tenacious not to humiliate him by the evidence of her
former servitude, or give him reason to wish he had a finer
lady or better scholar for his mother.
But Madelon's humility was not unmingled with pride,
She would have scorned to assume the appearance of a con-
dition to which, of inherited right, she did not belong,
Notwithstanding her opulent circumstances and the defer-
ence with which she was regarded among the tenantry of
the duke, she retained her provincial costume as exactly
as the poorest peasant of the village. The lace gathered
round her wide-winged cap might be of finer texture, and
the golden cross and ear-rings of more costly workmanship;
but instead of the flimsy, self-important Madame Valazy,
which many would have sought to appear under similar
pretensions, she chose to remain "la bonne Madelon ;
though perhaps a little tinged with a wealthy farmer's va-
nity in her linen-presses,— her walnut-wood furniture,
her twenty-five silver converts,— her yellow carnations,
and unrivalled dairy! She boasted a breed of bantams, too
which was the envy of the neighbourhood. But it was
the only possession of which she boasted. She was never

known to allude to her son's acquired gentility, or her
Emiline's faithful affection.
It was this very independence of spirit which rendered
her so dear to Camille. He felt himself ungifted with a
similar superiority to vulgar opinion ; and to him this long-
delayed visit to Grand Moulin was a source of equal tri-
umph and humiliation. He had left the village a peasant
he returned to it a gentleman ; and rejoiced in the fee-
bleness of health, which, retaining him within the limits
of the farm, secured him from provoking that envy, hatred,
and malice, which infallibly attend the elevation of a parvenu.
For five long years he had been imprisoned within the
walls of a city ; " the pomp of groves and garniture of
fields” had long become unfamiliar to his eyes. Accus-
tomed to the begrimed walls of Lyons, and the oppressive-
ness of a populated atmosphere, the fresh breeze of the
wide woodlands, and the soft verdure of a bursting spring,
ited within his heart a sense of enjoyment, painful from
its very intensity. It was so long since he had offered the
sacrifice of gratitude to the Creator upon his own mighty
altar, that his heart throbbed with consciousness of its
prolonged neglect; and as he fixed his aching eyes on the
sweep of wooded uplands, the silvery orchards and wind-
ing waters surrounding the farm, “ the peopled desert past”
subsided into its real insignificance in his estimation, and
“ the fickle breath of popular applause” became that empty
echo which the ear of wisdom disavows. The unchange-
able face of nature, shining with its eternal smile, and
reminding him that while empires pass into oblivion and
dynasties vanish from the world, the rolling river abideth,
the fountains of the great deep lose not a drop through
the lapse of ages — and the foundations of the hills stand
so fast that they cannot be moved," — caused him to
smile when he remembered the bootless vehemence of the
factions of Paris !
But if Camille indulged at times in philosophical reflec-
tions, a more frequently-recurring consideration arose from
the remembrance of Emiline, as connected with Navelles
and its scenery. Nor, had he been so minded, could he
have dismissed her from his thoughts ; for Madelon, in

-
every passing object and hour, found themes on which to
ground her praises. He saw his mother's fair, round, good-
humoured face break into smiles whenever she began to
talk of her dearest child; and how could he ungraciously
dismiss the subject ? In very truth, he could have lis-
tened for ever.
One day, after dragging his listless limbs round the
garden of Grand Moulin, humouring his mother's pride in
her early lettuces and listening to her predictions respect-
ing the first opening of her rosebuds,—for they flourished
in modest emulation side by side, - he paused for a mo-
ment to rest in the trimly arbour of hornbeam, which in
his boyhood he had so often assisted to train, now over-
grown by a matted mass of honeysuckles, through which
the officious bees were pushing their peculations with a
murmur of self-satisfaction. Madelon, following his feeble
steps, seated herself for a moment by his side, to admire
the busy activity of her hovering favourites, --for the re-
putation of her honeycomb vied with that of her dairy;
till allured by the propitious influence of the scene and
hour, into the indulgence dearest to a Frenchwoman,
undisturbed causerie, she commenced à skirmish of
gossipry, which her son readily anticipated would terminate
in an important attack. From her very commencement of
“ Ah! ça, mon ami! dis donc un peu," he foresaw that he
should be required to say every thing which he most wished
should remain unsaid.
After rallying him with village freedom upon his evident
pre-occupation of mind, and attributing to his love of re-
verie the seclusion he had maintained since his arrival at
Navelles, she suddenly exclaimed, 66 Well! she is in truth
a sweet creature ; and let them say what they will, I can-
not wonder at the devotion of your attachment.”
All the blood in Camille's wasted frame rushed into his
face at this strange avowal of his mother's participation in
his mystery.
“ Can it be possible,” he faltered, “ that
you are mistress of the secret I have guarded so vigilantly?”
“ Oui dà !” replied Madelon, half-laughing at his ear-
nestness ; my last journey to Paris taught me many a

secret. Did I not watch by your pillow, child ? - did I
not listen to all your sighings, and murmurings, and rav-
ings of her beauty, and of your tenderness, and a thousand
such sing-song fancies ? To hear your protestations,
Camille, no one on earth ever loved so fondly before.”
“ Would that such a persuasion were but the raving of
my delirium! I do love her, mother, as none ever loved
before. Who, like me, has defied the power of time and
absence ? — who, like me, loved without even the wish to
hope ?
« Plait-il?” said Madelon. “ Without hope?
Why, what can a fine young fellow like my Camille have
to fear?'
“ Mother, you deceive yourself and me.”
Nenni, nenni, mon fils ! I had scarcely found my
way to your secret, child, before I discovered that this
wonderful passion of yours was as warmly returned ; - ay,
and fifty-fold. She will not own it, Camille, but she loves
the very ground you walk upon, and
“ False - did an angel speak it!" exclaimed Valazy,
with indignant vehemence; and Madelon, who was gazing
on his haggard countenance, became apprehensive that the
consequences of his fever had affected his brain.
Nay,” she answered, in a deprecating tone, “I tell
you only what I heard myself from the marchioness's sweet
lips.”
“Mother !” exclaimed Camille, his own tremulous with
emotion, while unconsciously he grasped her arm; “mother,
have a care! one word more or less than the truth will
indeed drive me to madness.”
“ My own dear son!” whispered Madelon soothingly, as
she laid the fond pressure of a mother's embrace upon his
shoulder, wrong in revealing to you
what
my
other
child, my daughter Emiline, acknowledged to me? Ay,
Camille, - flout me as you will, — she told me the whole
secret as we were watching together by your sick bed. She
had been bending over you, and listening to your incoherent
lamentations

you, that Emiline de St. Florentin watched by my bed of
sickness?”
“ In truth, did she,-ay, Camille, hour after hour, and
day after day, — although she bad me keep her condescen-
sion a secret from your ungracious self.”
Valazy, whose mind was now excited beyond his control,
rushed from the harbour, traversing with hasty but totter-
steps the turfen paths of the garden; while Madelon relieved
the oppression of her terror and concern by tears.
She was still stifling her sobs with her hands, when she
felt them pressed by a cold touch ; and looking up, per-
ceived Camille again standing beside her. In those few
moments of absence, an age of passion had rolled over his
head. His lips were pale and quivering, his brow livid, his
eyes dilated.
her;

“ Mother !” said he, in a tone intensely low, “ I have
heard from your mouth this day, what else no bribe, no
threat had tempted me to believe. But you would not slander
you would not breathe one calumnious word against
her! I would I had never heard it, - I would 'twere all
unsaid, so I might calm the throbbing here,' he laid his
hand heavily on his bosom, " and think of her again as
I have ever done. But no matter. You have touched the
rock, and the stream that issues forth is a stream of lava.
Is that your fault, mother, -or is it mine? - No matter.
I am going back to Paris this night. Henceforth there is
no breath on earth for me, but where she breathes.”
Madelon, more and more convinced of the delirium of her
son, gently attempted to dissuade him from his project.
Nay, nay, I will not hear of your going yet, Camille ;
your strength is unequal to the exertion. Can you not
write to her father?”
- To whom?”
" To her father. As long-winded and tiresome and
self-sufficient as he is, the marchioness assured me that he
favoured your mutual passion.”
Mother, 'tis you who are raving now.”
“ To the good marquis, then. I am persuaded he would
condescend on this occasion to become your advocate. After
all, could the old gentleman do better for his daughter?

For though Mademoiselle Euphroisine is fair and gentle,
and well to do in the world, my Camille has a right to claim
a bride as pretty as the best.”
“ Euphroisine ?"
“.The word must out at last, though you have chosen to
keep the secret so long, and with such girlish coyness.
“ Who said that Euphroisine loved me?” exclaimed
Valazy, fiercely.
“My child, our own dear Emiline."
“ And where, mother, — when did she tell you so ?”
“ By the side of your sick bed, Camille. We had been
weeping together over your danger, and for many, many
hours
you had been raving of your tenderness for some be-
loved creature, for you never named her. Even while
protesting your attachment, my son, before all who were
attending you, you still kept swearing that no power should
ever rend the secret from your bosom. And when, in my
perplexity, I turned to the marchioness for an explanation,
she told me-
-you are not angry?"
Speak out, while I have patience to listen.”
“ She said that the busy old gentleman, whose officious in-
trusions just then were so tormenting, came but as a mes-
senger from his daughter, who loved you to distraction.
She herself had seen you together, she said, at some public
spectacle, where a jealous pique on Mademoiselle Euphroi-
sine's account, drove you almost to phrenzy. Monsieur
Delplanque judged it his duty to acquaint the marquis and
herself, as your friends, with all the circumstances.'
" Intolerable idiot!”
" But so little did the worthy man disapprove your at-
tachment, and, according to my Emiline's account, so well
was the degree and character of his daughter assorted to
your own, that she was at a loss to conjecture what had
suddenly driven you to such an extremity of despair.”
Despair ?”
“ Yes, repeatedly, during the paroxysms of your dis-
order, you spoke of having vainly striven to drive the sweet
image from your heart.
s And Emiline listened to the cries of my agony, yet
knew so little to interpret my devotion to herself !”

attachment as in my own,” replied Madelon, as incapable of
imagining the possibility of a profane passion for the pure
Emiline, as for the holy Madonna.
“ Mother, you do not guess the depth of my love for
my foster-sister
I can, my son !” exclaimed Madelon, kissing
his forehead. 66 And oh ! cherish that sacred affection, for
it is the pride and comfort of your old mother's life.
Indulge what whims you will in your fondness for Del-
planque's daughter ; but be your true and supreme attach-
ment, to the sister who shared my cares for your child-
hood !'
Camille, unwilling to give her pain, made a signal of ac-
quiescence, and withdrew from her presence.
• Excellent
woman !” murmured he, as he paced slowly homewards.
“ Her mind cannot imagine such monstrous disproportion
as my love for the wedded child of a noble father!”
“ Now Heaven have mercy on my son !” thought Ma-
delon, as she also took her meditative way towards the
farm. “ Book-learning and the new whim-whams which
the marchioness assures me are rife at Paris, — with Max
Valazy, the ill-conditioned ruffian, as the prophet of the
tribe, - have turned his head! Ah! Camille - Camille!
it was an evil day and evil chance that made thee a gen-
tleman, if thy poor brains cannot bear thee up through
thy elevation. God send thee sense! thou hast no pride
of body;
- but if there be such a thing as pride of thought,
that pride thou hast, my son, and sorely. I would I knew
how his bewilderment would end,” thought the good old
woman, as she seated herself at her ebony wheel ; and, to
ease her perplexity or beguile her affliction, began to spin
with as diligent an alacrity as one of the Destinies.

CHAPTER XI.
J'ai par dessus vous
Ce plaisir si flatteur à ma tendresse extréme,
De tenir tout du bienfaiteur que j'aime;
De voir que ses bontés font seules mes destins,-
D'étre l'ouvrage heureux de ses augustes mains.
Zaire.
DREADING that he might have wakened suspicions in his
mother's honest heart, Camille Valazy seized the first letter
he received from Lyons, as a pretext for his immediate
return.
“I leave you happy here," said he, at parting, -and he
gazed wistfully as he spoke, around the well-ordered
arrangements of the thriving farm. “ Your simple occu-
pations, mother, and prosperous industry, satisfy your
heart. The varying seasons bring you a change of cares
and pleasures, which preserve you from ennui and-
“ Ennui !” said Madelon, turning her fresh healthy
smile upon her son. “ Those who rise with the sun,
Camille, and labour till its setting, have no leisure for
whimsies. I know not how 'tis — but I have ever a happy
prospect before me. To-morrow, the first scythe is to be
laid to my wheat and saw you ever a likelier harvest ?
Then scarcely will the songs of my husbandmen's fête
be silenced, when— quick - the vintage ! every hand to the
vintage ; and saw you ever a fairer crop than in the home
vineyard, and on the côte ? Then, long, long before the
wine-press has done its work, comes my real fête - the
dear happy crowning moment of my year. -
Guess what
it is, Camille !”
Forgive me, mother, if my country knowledge have
somewhat escaped my memory. I can recollect no further
autumnal pleasure of the fields ; —- unless, like our neigh-
bour Madame du Brac, you have a fancy to commemorate
the festival of St. Hubert, by riding home from the forest
with a couple of wolves at your saddle-bow.”
" And so rob poor Caval, the ranger, of his forest fee ?”
said Madelon, her short laugh ringing joyously at the
idea. “No, no! guess again ! - You cannot ? Ah! you

are such a stranger at Grand Moulin, that
you
know not
half its pleasures ! - Learn, then, that one calm soft
evening, at the close of the vintage, just when all is still
still in the twilight,' except the whistle of the shep-
herds folding their flocks, I shall hear a distant roll of
wheels, and then a long shout, and a burst of warm
acclamations in the village; and then a hundred neigh-
bours will come bustling in with the one same word on
their lips, “Our good master is corne! the gracious mar.
chioness is come !' — And then, I shall not close my eyes
for blessing myself that night; and in the morning, long
before the dew is off, a gentle tap, and “Bon jour, chere
bonne! — comment ça va ?' - and then a sweet kiss, and
the little ones creeping in with their · Bon jour, mère Ma-
delon,' and 'Is not Emiline grown? - look at Aglaé's curls!'
Or perhaps, .And what news from Lyons, dear good
nurse ? - Oh! 'tis such a happy moment !” said Ma-
delon, with the tears rolling down her cheeks at the
thought.
“ And then the round of the farm ! - Madame la mar-
quise must needs visit the barn-yard, to see the game-
bantams; and the young ladies must have a look at the
hives, and taste the new honey-comb; and then — and
then,- I find when the little fairies are gone,
all
my
flax
entangled on the reel, - and, 'tis such pleasure to set it
right again ! - But forgive me, my son! I speak of plea-
sure, and you are about to leave me.”
“Our parting should always be cheerful, mother ! Since
destiny decrees us to live apart, let me rejoice that you
have friends who supply my place, and to whom your
happiness is precious as to myself. But should any future
change decrease that flattering interest, or the activity of a
farmer's life become too much for your declining years, you
must come home to your Camille, and accept from him
only, the tenderness and respect which you have so much
right to command in his heart. God bless you, mother!”
said Valazy, with that filial salute from which no age ex-
empts the affectionate children of French parents.
“And you, my brave son!” said Madelon, laying her
hand upon his head. Then, with tearful eyes, she followed

his departing footsteps from the village, the jealous com-
ments of which he cared not to provoke by the sight of his
travelling carriage.
“ There he goes
good, and true, and handsome as a
prince! As madame herself observed, it would be a sin
indeed if he should ever become infected by the thoughts
and ways of his cousin Max. — Well — well! let him
marry Mademoiselle Euphroisine. Her pretty modest
smile and rich dowry are not to be despised ; and he will
then have other thoughts to occupy his brains, than trouble
himself concerning what advisers our good lord the king
shall take to his councils, or what ladies her gracious
majesty shall gather round her court. What are court or
council to him or me, or our like? Ah ! la mère Ma-
delon-la mère Madelon !' tout à l'heure mes amis !
tout à l'heure, ma fi. See if I can steal half an hour for
my own indulgence without being called here, and wanted
there! Allons, allons, - la boutique avant tout.”
Once more engaged in the important concerns of his
manufactory, the mind of Camille Valazy regained its
former tone of moderation and tranquillity. An enormous
capital, and the well-being of his patrons, was confided to
his prudence and industry ; and what afforded a still more
engrossing interest to his heart, the existence of five hun-
dred workmen, with their families, was dependent on his
success. The domestic legislation of this little state offered
continual calls on his time and feelings ; for there is
scarcely a condition of life which comprehends such ve-
rieties of excitement, as that which brings an individual
into contact with a large portion of humble fellow-crea-
tures whose prosperity hangs upon his single will.
The
interest entertained by a sovereign for the provinces of his
kingdom is far less intimate and intense than that of the
manufacturer to whom thousands look with reliance for
their daily bread.
In the Lyonese society which Camille frequented, the
state of public affairs now excited the warmest interest;
but it was discussed with a qualified view to the emanci-
pation of the tiers état, in which he wholly sympathised.
The wealthy merchants of Lyons were naturally at-

a
tached to the maintenance of that class of the aristocracy
whose luxury was the foundation of their fortunes. They
were attached also to the abstract idea of their hereditary
sovereign. They loved the name of Bourbon. But they
were royalists, with a determination to enforce a more
liberal constitution. “We adopt in our machinery,” said
they, “every improvement suggested by the discoveries of
modern science. — Be the loom of the state as wisely and
peaceably reformed. Its wheels will spin the easier, and
their increased velocity produce a more even texture, -
more polished surface.”
Under these expectations, the assembling of the states-
general of the kingdom shortly after Valazy's return from
Paris, was regarded as a first constitutional blow struck
against the abuses of a corrupt government; and was
hailed as such with universal gratulation. The taking of
the Bastille, however, the second incident of the awful
drama, and the first popular movement,
was attended
by acts of outrage, which induced Camille to revert with
alarm to the predictions of Maximilien and his associates ;
while the insurrection which followed, connected with the
events of the 5th and 6th of September, sufficiently justified
his anxiety.
It is needless to follow, with close accuracy, the march
of public events which, from that period till the summer of
1791, - the epoch of our story's commencement,
an appearance fatal to the hopes of the royalists of France,
and terrific to the court. Neither is it requisite to re-
vert to the equally familiar, and far more interesting pic-
ture of the sufferings of the royal family; who, from the
period of their compulsory removal to the palace of the
Tuileries, to their attempted escape from the polluted
home of their ancestors, endured a bondage which must
be considered one of the gloomiest and severest pages
offered to the schooling of princes. But there were indi-
vidual destinies connected with these calamities, which,
if less generally known, are scarcely less deserving in-
terest.
The Marquis and Marchioness de St. Florentin, al-
though forming no part of the royal household nor pro-
wore

voking through undue favouritism the evil will of the
populace, had not so wholly escaped its censures as their
kinsman the Chevalier de Mirepoix thought proper to
assert for the re-assurance of his lovely cousin. Maxi-
'milien Valazy, who had his own views in augmenting
their unpopularity, had taken care that their names
should be defiled by frequent introduction into the
pages of his friend, the infamous Hébert.
He had no
direct accusal with which to brand their innocence; but
to associate the unoffending with the guilty, even by a
disjunctive conjunction, - to bring them perpetually upon
the stage of shame, even without involving them in the
action of the piece, is one of those arts of faction, by
which the brightest character, though “pure as the snow
that hangs on Dian's temple,” may become “ begrimed
and black.”
The king and queen, forewarned by many disastrous
signs and omens of the perils which were about to extend
from their persons to those of their adherents, had per-
suaded many of their nearest and dearest to seek safety in
emigration ; and had even addressed their gracious com-
mands to the veteran Duc de Navelles and the St. Florentin
family, to quit their native country during the preva-
lence of civil anarchy.
We will spare our readers the verbose reply of the
stanch old man. His sentiments, though involved in a
flimsy web of diffuse eloquence, were worthy the nobleness
of his loyal name. The honourable resolution set forth at
the same time by his son-in-law, the Marquis de St. Flo-
rentin, has already placed its melancholy consequences before
Meanwhile their secret but unrelaxing enemy,
the Jacobin Maximilien, failed not to improve the advan-
tages afforded him by their steady adherence to the unpo-
pular cause. Secure through the increasing ascendency of his
faction from the enmity of the lord of Navelles, he boldly
revisited his birthplace and openly harangued the people;
and though he ventured not to proceed to any extremity
of violence, the firebrand carried by the human fox into
the wide fields of the duke's demesne bequeathed sparks
in its progress, which smouldered for a time to burst into
our eyes.

a desolating conflagration. Those who marked the sullen
progress of the flames dared pot lay an assuaging hand
on their violence ; nay, even those who beheld their pos-
sessions thus ravaged before their eyes, were compelled to
join in the triumphant pæans of the incendiary. Alas !
already they anticipated a darker hour, and more extended
ruin !
CHAPTER XII.
We have seen the best of our time; machinations, hollowness, treachery,
and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves! Find out this
villain ;-- it shall lose thee nothing ; - do it carefully. - King Lear.
While the adherents of the house of Bourbon were thus
involved in danger and dismay, Camille Valazy did not
fail to follow with a vigilant and sympathising eye the
deepening complexion of their destinies. He knew the
woman he adored to be surrounded by perils of the most
serious character; he saw her name inserted in the
calumnious pages of the Père Duchesne, and Publiciste
Parisien ; and was aware that many who had been
brought forward in a similar manner, had been already
sacrificed to the blind vengeance of the people. Emiline
was in danger. — The companion of his infancy - the
adored foster-child of his mother-was menaced by unpre-
cedented trials; and having satisfied himself that in so
sacred a character she had a claim to every sacrifice in his
power, Valazy was not long in forming a determination to
resign his views, his interests, his feelings, his principles,
his very life, to her service. Such was the vow he had
offered to his mother in her behalf ; — such the oath which
again, and fervently, he pledged to his own heart.
Fortunately for his intentions, it chanced that the course
of commercial business suffered a material check from the
disorganisation which now began to pervade every branch
of public affairs; and Valazy found no great difficulty in
exciting the alarms of his partner respecting the critical
position of their interests. He persuaded him, and not

THE SOLDIER OF LYONS,
without justification, that the time was come for every pru-
dent man to hold his capital at his immediate disposal ; and
that their wisest measure would be to realise their property,
at a considerable loss, rather than leave it to be involved in
the general wreck which the future, and at no great dis-
tance of time, must inevitably decree to the commercial
interests of France; and old Dacquin more inclined to be-
wail himself and his manufactory, than his native country,
or her failing credit, stormed, expostulated, swore, wept,
threatened, and ended by assenting to the views and
proposals of his partner. The liberality exercised by Ca-
mille readily procured them purchasers desirous of com-
peting for a business at present thriving with undiminished
success. In less than a month, a bright succession of newly
burnished golden letters superseded those of the firm of
Dacquin and Valazy ;' while the ci-devant manufac-
turers became capitalists and gentlemen at large.
Amid the confusion arising from these important ar-
rangements, Camille’s anxiety of mind was aggravated by the
receipt of a letter from Laporte, the steward of the Duc de
Navelles, acquainting him with the factious violence which
had manifested itself among the peasanty of the estate sub-
mitted to his control ; — the unhappy spirit of resistance to
all constituted authority excited by the visit of his kinsman
Maximilien ; — and the belief entertained by the family of
his noble patron, that Grand Moulin was no longer a safe
or satisfactory residence for one so notoriously attached to
their rights and interests, as his mother. He stated that,
though Madelon had been treated by her nephew with scru-
pulous regard and deference, it had been evidently a main
object of the Jacobin's inflammatory harangues to render
his ejection from the farm tenanted by his fathers, an evi-
dence of the most oppressive tyranny; and that in conse-
quence of the influence commanded by his cunning elo-
quence, the good fermière of Grand Moulin began to find
herself, for the first time, an object of jealousy and mistrust.
All remembrance of her kindliness, her neighbourly friend-
ship, her frank cordiality, had been obliterated in a moment
by the plausibility of an orator, who contrived to connect
his imaginary wrongs with the grievances of that popular

79
cause which he insidiously affected to advocate ; and Ma-
delon, deeply wounded by the desertion of her familiar
friends, and the jealous sarcasms of envious neighbours, and
above all, irritated past patience by the disaffection now
openly acknowledge towards the hereditary lord of the land,
at length acceded to the earnest entreaties of her noble
foster-child, and resigned the lease of Grand Moulin, home-
vineyard, bantams, yellow carnations, and all! She had
not, however, at present complied with the supplementary
request of the considerate Emiline, that she would re-estab-
lish herself in her household. “Come!” she had written,
come and resume your rights upon my grateful affection.
I call you, my best and kindest Madelon, to an anxious
home, and a troubled city ; but we will weep together over
the calamities of France; and teach my children what holy
charities can bind together the lord and the vassal, whom
the policy of our evil times is seeking to disunite."
It was in furtherance of Madame de St. Florentin's pro-
ject for the removal of Madelon to Paris, that Laporte
requested the intervention of her son. In the mean time,
her own views and inclinations were set forth in the follow-
ing epistle, — being the third which his worthy parent had
laboured to indite in his behalf, during the twenty-six years
of his existence.
“My Son!
“ I am going to quit Grand Moulin !. So much the
worse, Camille ! for you passed a happy childhood there,
and I hoped that a tranquil old age would still find me
settled at the farm. 'Tis a good air, that blows from the
côte. The vines seldom failed. The crops are the earliest
in the lordship; and the basse cour, now it is paved and
rebuilt, has not its equal in the province. The happiest
days of my life were passed there, Camille; and your
father
died there, and your good uncle. But, n'importe ! as I
said at first, I am going to leave Grand Moulin.
“And now, child, what shall become of your old mother?
My good Emiline would have me live with her at Paris.
But many causes forbid me to accept her generous offer.
I am told by eye-witnesses to the dangers by which she is

surrounded, that for her life's sake she may not long abide
in France, that she must emigrate; emigrate ? ay, that
is the word which designates the flight of the queen's
friends. And supposing I should agree to encumber her
journey with my helplessness, is it for me to leave France,
leaving all who are dearest to us in the hands of their ene-
mies,- for me, who have a son I love, and who is an ho-
nour to his father's name?
“ You are a gentleman now, my Camille ; not of man's
making, but of the Almighty's and your own. The station
in which you were born was beneath your abilities and
goodness, though it was a match for mine; and Madelon
knows better than to resume a post which, ranking her with
hired servants, would seem to bring you back to the con-
dition above which your exertions have raised you. Were
I alone in the world, I would toil till my last hour for my
master's house; work for my foster-child - beg for her ;
but I have no right to degrade my excellent son in the
person of his mother. Say then, Camille, what shall be-
come of me?
“ Means I want not. Frugality, and Heaven's favour
have blessed my store with increase. But these are fearful
times. The bread we eat cannot be called our own; and
the strong arm of defence can scarely keep its head. With
you, my rest would be without fear, my food without bit-
terness. But how may this be? Will Mademoiselle Eu-
phroisine, whose speech is so dainty and her fashioning so
gay, bear with Madelon's kersey bodice and village phrase ?
-Will Camille himself endure to see me disgrace his
board ? - My son ! it is for you to decide !"
These communications served but to determine and
hasten the execution of a project, with which Camille had
from the first connected his retirement from mercantile life.
An estate of some extent had been offered to him as an in-
vestiture for part of his floating capital; which, as its
vicinity to the coast of the Pas de Calais afforded facilities
becoming daily more important to the obnoxious party, he
resolved to make his own. It was situated in a part of the
country divided among small proprietors; and consequently

free from the intemperate spirit of resistance animating the
peasantry of the extensive territories of the ancienne no-
blesse. It would form his pride and pleasure to install his
mother as mistress of an estate so secure from the general
disturbance; and he doubted not that while he made it the
business of his life to watch in Paris over the destinies of
Emiline and her little family, his mother could content her-
self by cultivating at Manoir the favourites of her new
garden and poultry-yard, in the hope of one day offering
their produce to favourites dearer still.
Madelon accepted with rapture her share in the scheme,
a scheme which threatened no disturbance to her ordi-
nary mode of life.
She was content that herself and the
carnations should be transplanted together: and when,
every preliminary adjusted, the son of whom she was so
justly proud came to conduct her in person to his estate,
the ex-bonne, ex-fermière bad a triumphant adieu to the
apostate village of Navelles, with an air of magnanimous
disdain equivalent to Coriolanus's “ I banish you !”.
Camille did not linger longer at Manoir than the time
requisite to establish his mother. He persuaded her that
it was a concession due to his position in the world, to be-
come Madame Valazy previous to her inauguration, and
leave at Grand Moulin her village costume. On this latter
point, indeed, he found her less refractory than he had an.
ticipated; for the disloyalty betrayed by her native province
had pre-disposed her to throw off the badge which marked
her as its own. Having forwarded with lavish liberality
all her projects of improvement, Camille directed his way
towards Paris.
Satisfied that reculer pour mieux sauter was the line of
policy through which he could best insure his object, - the
guardianship of Emiline's safety, - he assumed a tone of
character calculated to rank him in the moderate party of
the revolutionists, and obtain those local distinctions which
might avail in her behalf, when the influence commanded
by rank, and station, and opulence, should have ceased to
exist. He knew that through the agency of Maximilien,
such authority would readily be placed at his disposal. But
he had to overcome a powerful sensation of disgust before
G

he could determine on seeking his cousin's presence; who
had distinguished himself, during the two years which had
elapsed since their parting, by his virulent persecution of the
royal family, as well as by licentious personal excesses.
Maximilien was now one of the most noted and popular
members of the Assemblée Constituante; a leading orator of
the Jacobin club; and a confirmed roué in the habits of
his private life. Since his last inauspicious visit to Paris,
Camille had entertained no communication with him ex-
cept through their common notary,— on the occasion of
superadding some units to the amount of a loan which the
wasteful luxury of the rude advocate of republican sim-
plicity rendered highly acceptable ; and it was the con-
sciousness of this heavy obligation which somewhat damped
the cordiality of Maximilien's welcome, and embarrassed
his address to his country cousin.
But Camille, suspicious of the meanness of his appre-
hensions, no sooner assured him that he was inclined rather
to increase than diminish the measure of his favours, than
the disinterested representative of the dignity of the people
altered his tone, expanded into the most friendly warmth,
and proceeded to enlarge without reserve on the views of
his party.

to show forth from the outset, in its proper light, your bold
attempt in the theatre at Versailles."
Attempt? - my attempt?
- although unsuccessful, it was not lost upon
it served me, indeed, for the text of an oration on
heroism and intrepidity, delivered at a two-hours' breath to
the club of our section.”
“ Is is possible that so simple a circumstance should be
thus magnified into mischief, that a vertigo should be
construed into a project of assassination ?”
“ I gave you due credit for the colouring you threw on
the affair ; but between friends, coz, -such squeamishness
is absurd. Why I was myself followed by a mouchard,
for three weeks ensuing, on the strength of bearing the
same name with so desperate a democrat as yourself !
Ha! ha! ha! think, Camille, of the blackness of a re-
putation which could be supposed to endanger mine ! ”
“ I rather imagine, on the contrary, that suspicion fell
upon me, on that luckless occasion, only from being mis-
taken for yourself.”
Nay !-- do not rob yourself of your solitary laurel. A
time may come for it to shoot out into a sheltering tree.
When some months had passed away without my hearing
of your welfare or whereabout, I fully expected to unearth
you in one of the secret dungeons we ploughed up in the
Bastille. I dug forth, myself, a skeleton from under a
concealed staircase, on which the quick lime had but half
done its work, and which, by Heavens! I thought had
been your own.
The livid brow had all your imperial air
of magnanimity!
“ You jest on an awful subject, Maximilien."
Nay, it was no jest to me, but a real right earnest
disappointment, when I found in the chap-fallen hero a
more illustrious traitor than my cousin Camille ; for I
considered your unceremonious exit as a receipt in full for
I dare not say how many thousands of francs.'
“ I am indebted to the warmth of your family affec-
tion.”
Why, looking on the business with a philosophical
eye, I rather prefer your living carcass. I expect you will

become an honour to the name of Valazy. When you
have
fleshed your maiden sword to the hilt in the body of one of
the tyrant's minions, — when you have quaffed inspiration
from one of Danton's bold harangues, - when you have
acquired firmness as well as energy, you may perhaps
aspire to the distinction of becoming a popular leader. We
want a new man to occupy the public eye, whose unsullied
reputation may carry our theories home to the minds of the
scrupulous;—the fainéans, whose prudish consciences adjudge
the value of a creed from the demeanour of its priesthood.”
“I am not ambitious of so illustrious an office as that of
bleaching the stains of the Jacobin club. I would serve
the cause of the million in a very humble capacity. My
exertions have been for years past confined to the desk ;
have you interest and confidence in my capabilities to pro-
cure me a place as Adjoint ?”.
Bailly is my intimate friend, I have no hesitation
in assuring you of his protection.”
“ In the mean time I am anxious to enrol myself in
the National Guard, and devote my undivided services to
the common weal.”
“ Aha! a pure republican!,- Why you have outstripped
me on my own course! Little did I expect to see so sub-
lime an eminence attained by the millionnaire of Lyons,-
the stripling who was proud to stand for hours loading the
fowling-pieces of young Amédée de Navelles and the in-
solent St. Florentin! By the way, I conclude you are
aware that the Comte de Navelles is included in the decree
against emigration. — His long sojourn in Italy can be con-
sidered in no other light than the feint of an emigrant. I
must, therefore, content myself, when the day of retribution
arrives, -- and its glorious dawn already glows in the sky,
with the head of his old doting father; or with the
hand, — the withered right hand, whose accursed weight
once struck me to the earth. By the God of vengeance!”
exclaimed Maximilien, his lips quivering with rage,

my children's children !”

are gathered from the private passions of its leaders."

extinguish the idle intemperance of boyhood, — I was torn
like a malefactor from my family, — denied the light and
the breath of heaven, the exercise of my free limbs,
the emotion of my free heart. Condemned for recreation
to count the slimy tracks left by the wandering reptiles on
my. prison wall, I sanctified my nightly sleep, not by a dri-
velling prayer, but by a reiterated oath such as the demons
might register in their archives.”
" And to what end?”
“ The time for perfect confidence is not yet come.
I
must know the temper of a weapon, ere I gird it on my
thigh, and intrust it with the keeping of my life. But I see
the recital of my wrongs has moved you. Nor have I for-
gotten that 'twas to your bold exertions I owed my libera-
tion ; though you, coz, have since been tempted to overlook
the tyranny which hunted us from the lands of Navelles.”
“ I forgive an infliction I am conscious of having
earned. While I admit your wrongs to the full limit, I
feel that my mother's obligations should have taught me a
more respectful mode of resistance to the duke.”
Respectful ! to a dotard whose vulgar clay was only
animated into action by the heat of his obstinate arrogance !
Well, well ! an hour will come, when I shall grind that
clay into dust !- and when his precious nephew, St. Flo-
rentin, shall have humbly and unsuccessfully sued for my
patronage as a shoeblack, I will save from starvation his
mincing dame, — who affects to shudder whenever she
espies me at any public meeting, - by promoting her to

the rank of my first sultana, - if, indeed, the post be
vacant.”
A thousand lightnings flashed from the eyes of Camille,
and his clenched hand was involuntarily raised as the ruffian
uttered this insulting menace. But he retained sufficient
self-possession to detect through the satanic smile which
lightened Maximilien's keen fixedness of observation, that
he was baited as a trial of temper, — put upon the anvil
in proof of his real views and feelings. Satisfied of the
necessity of disguising from Maximilien the secret inten-
tions of his mind, he restrained his boiling indignation,
hurried through a scarcely audible excuse for his abrupt
departure, — spoke of a remembered engagement, - and
was in the street gasping for breath, before he had noted
the effect of his agitation on his wary kinsman.
As he paced onwards with impetuous steps, the laughter
of fiends seemed to ring in his ears ; mingled with the
names of the victims they had doomed to ruin.
“ I will save them !” said he between his compressed
lips, “ I will save them, let my life, fame, honour, be
the forfeiture of their escape. Heaven be thanked, I had
the precaution to evade the snare so cunningly spread by
yonder villain. Another minute in his presence would
have betrayed me.”
Poor Camille ! Unskilled in the arts of society's tacti.
cians, he knew not it was to his premier mouvement that
Maximilien's observation had been directed ; and that his
fervent attachment to the St. Florentins, to Emiline,
had been as distinctly revealed, as by the most deliberate
avowal.
His precipitate flight was hailed by Maximilien Valazy
with a burst of triumphant laughter.

CHAPTER XIV.
Dorante. C'est un bon bourgeois assez ridicule, comme vous voyez, dans
toutes ses manières ; mais galant homme tout à fait.
Dorimène. Il n'est pas malaisé de s'en aper cevoir.-MOLIERE.
To calm the perturbation of his mind by casting oil upon
the troubled waves, Camille directed his wandering steps
towards the house of old Delplanque ; who well deserved
the acknowledgment of a visit, though his officious absur-
dity had in a great measure neutralised the kindness of his
attentions.
His name, however, no longer blazed in Gothic capitals
over the door of the most sumptuous magazin of the Rue
St. Honoré; another mercer was breveté in his stead.
Curiosity mingled with some degree of interest, prompted
Camille to enter the shop, and inquire touching the
removal and welfare of its former proprietor, and of his
daughter; for as he ascended the steps, his mind involun-
tarily and anxiously recurred to the declarations of Del-
planque to Madame de St. Florentin, of the state of
Euphroisine's affections.
Neither the father nor the daughter, however, justified
his apprehensions. Both were alive and flourishing ;
having changed their abiding place, not for the church-
yard of the Innocents, but for a comfortable mansion,
entre cour et jardin, as the advertisements have it,-situ-
ated in the Quartier du Marais. Awe-struck by the fate
of Réveillon, the paper-maker of the Faubourg St. An-
toine, butchered during a wanton attack made by the
insurgents on his premises, the mercer by appointment had
emulated the wisdom of Camille, realised his capital, and
retired to such otium cum such dignitate, as the subor-
dinate honours of the unfashionable neighbourhood he had
selected for his residence could bestow.
Valazy did not hesitate to push his voyage of discovery
towards those unknown regions which the old man was
fond of designating as his modest retirement; and detected

on his arrival as complete an alteration in his appearance
as in his locale. The grey hairs once scrupulously pow-
dered and rolled in buckle round his important face, now
drooped like useless streamers from a shattered wreck. His
suit of brun de financier was exchanged for a douillette of
grey camlet; and his ivory measure for a watering-pot.
Valazy found him diligently occupied in placing labelled
sticks to the tulips in his garden.— It reminded him, he
said, of affixing the tickets to his merceries. But he grate-
fully renounced his employment, and welcomed any inter-
ruption promising him a listener.
My excellent young friend — my dear Valazy,” said
the old gentleman, conducting him to his coziest arm-
chair, and anticipating a gossip of at least three hours'
duration, “ this visit is indeed a flattering proof of your
remembrance. Euphroisine, Euphroisine! here is our
much-esteemed friend from Lyons. -My daughter not at
home? So much the better · we shall have time for an
uninterrupted discussion. Ah ! Monsieur Valazy, times
are sadly altered with us !”
“ I can scarcely consider them so, my dear sir," replied
Camille, well aware that the despondency of his host
applied itself solely to his individual plight,
66 since I
find you so comfortably settled.”
Why this house is, as you observe, tolerably distri.
buted, and not ill decorated. You had always a taste,
Monsieur Valazy, though the advantage of an entrée at
court, like mine, had not refined it to the highest pitch of
purity.”
“ Like yours ! — True, sir! but it enables me to do
justice to the elegance of your domestic arrangements,"
replied Camille, glancing towards the chairs and sofas,
from which the cotton covers were never withdrawn except
for the high solemnity of the weekly Boston, which
rescued the chandelier from its canvass bag, and the
mirrors from their tantalising veil of gauze. The ad-
miring guest attributed the orderly array of the little
apartment to the industry of Mademoiselle Euphroisine ;
but honesty or jealousy instigated the precise old gentle-
man to appropriate the compliment. The household

order visible in his establishment, he said, was l'expression
de son oisiveté, for, as he had already observed, times were
sadly altered with him.
Altered, and abundantly, they certainly were. Instead
of beguiling his mornings in the pompous display of the
glories of his counter to the fairest and noblest of the
Parisian beauties, - instead of lounging for hours in an
antechamber at Versailles, gathering the whispers of
fashionable scandal, which he afterwards mysteriously
unfolded over his café à la créme to his friends and gos-
sips of the Rue St. Honoré, he was reduced to the com-
parative obscurity of an independent home; and the
silver-mounted ivory measure with which he had been
wont to count brocaded ells to a lady in waiting, now
served to determine the sickly progress of a straggling
Cobæa plant, which he was striving to coax into verdure
upon a glaring white boundary wall.
Yes, my dear friend !” pathetically observed Del-
planque, as he led Camille through his miniature garden
to a tawdry Chinese alcove, which he qualified, in Rous-
seau phrase, as the cherished refuge of his humble leisure.
I have, as you perceive, renounced the great world.
These are no times for the exhibition and enjoyment of
commercial luxury;. as when the spirit of republican
insolence began to brave me across my mahogany counter,
I resolved to escape with honour from an unequal warfare,
to retire, Monsieur Valazy, with dignity. Yes !” he
continued, lowering his voice into a tone mysteriously
confidential, “it is a degrading fact that the mistress of
your kinsman — she who is now femme de chambre to
Madame de St. Florentin was deeper in my books in
the space of one month, than the whole united Faubourg
St. Germain !”
“How !” exclaimed Camille, remorselessly interrupting
Delplanque's course of argument ; -
“How say you ?”
Flavie a confidential servant to Madame de St. Florentin ?
- Impossible !”
Nothing is more sure. My successor, who occasion-
ally visits me in my rural retreat to remit a dividend of
his purchase-money, and between ourselves --- to try and

convert the residue to his own account, in the shape of
my Euphroisine's dowry,” added the ex-mercer, distorting
his meagre visage into an attempt at a knowing look,-
“my successor, sir, informs me that the little grisette,
having exhausted Maximilien Valazy's resources by her
boundless extravagance, and been replaced in his affections
by some opera dancer, was reduced to the necessity of
entering into service. Her father being a tenant of the
Duc de Navelles, she contrived to interest the kind and
credulous marchioness in her favour; and impose herself
by the aid of false certificates, as an accomplished waiting
woman.”
“ But her appearance her effrontery."
“ Let so accomplished an actress alone ! Attired in a
robe à l'enfant, or a bavolette à la villageoise, the part of a
country girl becomes as easy as any other.”
“ Can you have permitted a being so pure as the Mar-
chioness de St. Florentin to be polluted by the touch of
that abandoned woman ?”
“ Calm yourself, my good sir ! Monsieur Delplanque
has his own safety, and that of his daughter to care for,
without running a tilt in the cause of every gentle dame
wearing satin from his measure. 'Tis a serious matter to
interfere in the designs of the patriotic party; and my
Euphroisine, who has tact and discernment which mark
her as the daughter of no ordinary parents, is persuaded
that some uncommon inducement must have wrought upon
a being so selfish and arrogant as Mademoiselle Flavie, to
undertake a menial post. It is more than probable that
Maximilien Valazy has gathered valuable intelligence of
the projects entertained at the Tuileries, at the hands of his
ci-devant mistress.”
“And you, who affect a grateful devotion to the house of
Bourbon, have connived at this infamous imposture.”
“Mademoiselle Delplanque, contrary to my express com-
mands, thought fit to apprise the marchioness of the fact,
and of her own suspicions; but as to your inference, -my
loyalty, sir,” continued the old gentleman, theatrically
striking his breast,“ my loyalty is, thank God! pure be-
yond impeachment. Know that the suspicion of jacobin-

ism, which I incurred on the occasion of your unlucky
vagary in the Royal Theatre, brought on my unsuspecting
innocence the whole horde of patriots, in the hope that
through the cession of my books of credit, they should ca-
jole me into furnishing a popular accusation against her
majesty's extravagance. And what was my alternative,
sir, in this trying exigency? - How did I escape the snare ?
By burning my books into ashes, Monsieur Valazy, like
the sibyl of old. Yes! sir, I destroyed them, although
forming my sole bond of security for a debt of twenty
thousand franks. I destroyed them with the magnanimity
of an ancient Roman!”
Exhausted by his eloquence, Delplanque had no leisure
to comment on the fit of abstraction into which his guest
had fallen during his tirade ; and the entrance of Euphroi-
sine opportunely afforded a new turn to the conversation.
Though Camille had regarded her, during their former ac-
quaintance, with the most unobservant indifference, the
sentiments which her father had persisted in ascribing to
her had exerted that influence over his feelings which
might be expected from the vanity of human nature. His
heart beat quicker as she approached ; - and imperfectly
as he was versed in the catalogue of her external perfec-
tions, he was struck with equal surprise and regret on per-
ceiving the alteration effected by two short years in her
person. The joyous smile of youth and flush of health
had disappeared from her countenance; and though they
left its noble outline more prominently apparent, the beauty
by which she was now distinguished was of a grave and
lofty character, wholly unadapted to the expression of that
melting tenderness, which, in spite of his better reason,
Camille Valazy had prepared himself to trace in her de-
meanour.
Delplanque interrupted the complimentary ceremonial of
their meeting by vociferous lamentations over the tenacity
with which his daughter allowed herself to cling to her
early associations.
“ She cannot resolve, Monsieur Valazy, to abandon the
Faubourg St. Honoré. She cannot exert her father's phi-
losophy of mind, his superiority to the chains of habit,

and acquire the unambitious humility of a bourgeoise du
Marais.”
“ Mademoiselle is probably aware how earnestly her pre-
sence is still coveted in her former home,” replied Camille,
with an affectation of compliment, which was greeted by a
most contemptuous glance on the part of Euphroisine.
“No!” said Delplanque, unconscious that the assertion
had been silently but eloquently refuted—“No! my daughter
foolishly disdains all intercourse with my worthy successor ;
who by the way, after all, is a mere parvenu in commercial
life.”
“ Good !” thought Valazy. "There exists then an an-
cienne noblesse du comptoir !”
“ It is to a more noble quarter that the visits of Eu-
phroisine are addressed. Tell me, child ma poule — ma
cocotte !- tell me — have you not passed the morning with
Mademoiselle Bertin ? "
I have, sir.”
" Mademoiselle Bertin modiste brevetée de la reine ? in-
quired Camille, repressing a smile.
“A most faithful and devoted servant of her majesty,”
replied Mademoiselle Delplanque, in a voice whose firmness
repelled all renewal of ridicule on the part of Valazy.
- Ah! I knew it - I knew it," exclaimed her father.
“ You are to understand, Valazy, that this poor girl's affec-
tionate heart is as fervently devoted to the royal cause, as if
the blood of a Polignac flowed in her veins. Her mother,
sir, had the honour of being attached to the service of the
late dauphine, mother to our unhappy sovereign ; through
which connection I was favoured by the unintermitting
patronage of the court of France. Euphroisine, while still
a child, attracted the notice of our gracious Marie Antoi-
nette, then hopeless of becoming a mother; and the magic
smiles and endearing affability of the queen, - which could
as surely raise an army as did her imperial parent's intre-
pidity among her Hungarian states, have converted my
poor girl into a partisan of the royal cause. Now from
Mademoiselle Bertin she has the melancholy satisfaction of
learning every particular connected with the altered desti-
nies of her mistress ; and Euphroisine passes her days in

acquainting herself with the afflictions of the queen, and
her nights in weeping over them.”
Euphroisine rose from her seat, and began to busy herself
with the porcelain on the chimney-piece, in order to escape
the look of interest with which she was now regarded by
Valazy.
“ But,” continued the wily mercer, re-awakened by these
symptoms to his former designs upon Camille, “ I fear all
this is not likely to cement a friendship between you and
my daughter. You have a family inclination, as I am but
too well aware, towards the popular cause.”
Nay!” replied Camille, smiling, my politics will no
longer prove a motive of disunion between Mademoiselle
Delplanque and myself. The time is past when Maximi-
lien claimed even the influence of an elder kinsman over
I have long renounced my trust in his pa-
triotism."
“ Bravo! this is the best of good news.”
“ A spirit of cruelty and evil has lately manifested itself
which obviously arises from a deeper source than the degra-
dation or oppression of the populace; and which satisfies
me that the people of France are not at present to be trusted
with the unsheathed sword of liberty,
- a weapon which
fools and children wield to their destruction. Of two evils,
I prefer the tyranny of a monarch, guided or misguided by
a profuse and irresolute ministry, to that of the many-
headed monster the plebeian million — the self-consti-
tuted rulers, - who boast neither the qualifications of
education, disinterestedness, nor responsibility, requisite to
render their yoke a safe or easy burden.”

is the apostrophe of their own favourite author," observed
Euphroisine, half apart.
“ This is a profession of political faith I little expected
from one of the name of Valazy. May I trust that my
opinions have in some small degree influenced the amelior-
ation of your own ?” added the mercer, smiling.
“ You have surely engaged Monsieur Camille to partake

of our family dinner?” inquired Euphroisine of her father,
with an earnestness upon the strength of which an invi-
tation was immediately given, and as promptly accepted ;
and Delplanque, who, in the absence of more active em-
ployments, presided over the domestic arrangements of his
household, departed to issue his mandates.
CHAPTER XV.
D'où tenez vous, dans ce séjour obscur
Un ton si noble - un langage si pur ?
Partout on a de l'esprit ; c'est l'ouvrage
De la nature, et, c'est votre partage :
Mais l'esprit seul, sans éducation
N'a jamais eu ni ce tour, ni ce ton.
VOLTAIRE.
As soon as he had left the room, Euphroisine seated her-
self at the table, immediately opposite Camille, and at-
tempted to enter into conversation on some subject of
general interest. But scarcely had she uttered a few
words, when, covering her face with her hands, she sud-
denly burst into tears.
“Do not mistake this emotion, Monsieur Valazy, for an
effusion of idle sentiment,” said she, at length, by an
anxious effort recovering her composure. “I came home
agitated and harassed by public intelligence of an afflicting
nature which I had just received ; and the surprise oc-
casioned by your sudden and unexpected declaration of
loyalty overcame my firmness. Did you but know
could you but imagine - the straits to which my illus-
trious friends have been reduced for want of confidential
agents, you might better judge the value they affix to the
acquisition of an honest heart and ready hand. In these
times of irresolution and tergiversation, it is difficult to
know our friends from our enemies; but the candour, the
manliness of your declaration to my father, assures me
that the Marquise de St. Florentin was not mistaken in her
high reliance upon your loyalty.”
“ Madame de St. Florentin ?"

“My father has acquainted you with the fervour of my
sympathy in the royal cause. But he has not told
you
all.
He is old and timid, — incapable of active agency,
nay, even of active self-defence. I have therefore judged
it neither necessary nor prudent to implicate himn in a cause
which has proved fatal to many of its adherents. My own
safety I feel justified in perilling ; and your recent pro-
fessions induce me to confess that it is eternally bound up
in the fortunes of the royal family.”
“ To a degree, no doubt, beyond that assigned by Mon-
sieur Delplanque?"
“Even unto life and death! But before I intrust
myself more explicitly to your honour, grant me one word
of assurance that Madame de St. Florentin's pledge was not
rashly given ; and that you will guard in holiest secrecy all
I am about to commit to your keeping."
“ You require a blind vow, mademoiselle ; — yet, de-
manded in a name so precious to my heart, I freely concede
my promise. There is my hand,” said Camille bluntly,
" and I swear upon it inviolable secrecy and exclusive
devotion to the cause."
Euphroisine modestly, but without affectation, placed her
own in that of Valazy.
“I accept the compact, -and be it prospered by the
guardianship of Heaven!” said she, re-assuming the seat
from which she had half risen.
Camille still looked towards her for explanation. “ You
will not be surprised,” she resumed, “ that my deep de-
votion to the suffering court should have secured me the
confidence of many or most of its female adherents.
Among the most distinguished of these, the Marquise de
St. Florentin honours me with especial favour. It is scarcely
a week since (but pardon me to render myself intel-
ligible, I should acquaint you that the visits so lamented by
my father, are not addressed to the abode of Mademoiselle
Bertin, but to the château of the Tuileries itself,) - it is
scarcely a week since I heard you recommended, in the
most urgent terms, to her majesty, by Madame de St.
Florentin.”

“A trusty messenger was required to become the bearer
of a despatch to the emperor ; and, among all who had
been raised, and enriched, and rendered graceless by her
benefits, there was not one to whom Marie Antoinette
could confide an affair of so much delicacy. She appealed
to madame la marquise. She demanded whether there
existed no one over whom she was conscious of possessing
unlimited influence;
“ She named me,
say that she deigned to name her
foster-brother, that she remembered Camille only as the
most humble, the most devoted, of her slaves ! exclaimed
Valazy, rising and approaching the astonished Euphroisine
with an air of wild animation.
A vivid crimson overspread her fair face; and as it died
away, left an intense streak on her previously pale cheeks.
“ Be satisfied !-- she did name her foster-brother, and with
the fondest reliance on his loyalty. But scarcely had she
uttered the name of Valazy, when every voice was raised
against her rashness. Of the ladies of the court present at
the discussion, two persisted in confounding you with your
traitor cousin ; and the third vehemently recalled you to
the remembrance of her majesty as the spectator whose in-
decorous deportment in the theatre at Trianon excited so
much anxiety. I was then on my knees before the queen,
occupied in the adjustment of her robe — for it is in the
capacity of Bertin's favourite apprentice that I am ad-
mitted to the happiness of waiting on my illustrious patron-
ness ; and Madame de St. Florentin, who was aware that
my father conducted you to Versailles on the evening in
question, deigned to appeal to my testimony in your be-
half.”
“ And you gave it, mademoiselle ?
“ Unhesitatingly, as regarded your innocence in that
particular; but, conscious of so slight an acquaintance
with your principles and character, you will acknowledge
that it would have been vain presumption to confirm the
marchioness's declarations of your unqualified loyalty to the
House of Bourbon.”
• I was therefore suffered to share the ign niny of my
Jacobin kinsman ?"

“ Another courier was selected for the service of the day.
But I overheard the queen whispering to Madame de St.
Florentin when they parted, 'You must find me this Ca-
mille of yours : I am more than inclined to trust to your
recommendation. I am persuaded that the services of my
Emiline's foster-brother would not be withheld from his
queen in the time of trouble. Sound his views and prin-
ciples, and if you discover them to be such as we could
wish, let me hear more of him.”
- And wherefore has not madame la marquise deigned
to comply with her majesty's directions ? "
By her commands, I addressed a letter to you on that
same day, imploring your presence at Paris. My letter,
Monsieur Valazy, was returned unopened.”
“I must have quitted Lyons previous to the honour of
your communication.”
“She has subsequently prosecuted her inquiries through
another channel. Since the evil spirit of the times mani-
fested itself on the estates of the Duc de Navelles, — his
confidential steward, Laporte, has been received into
the establishment of the marchioness. From him, the
St. Florentine family learned that you had removed your
mother from Grand Moulin, without yielding the smallest
clue to your future residence or plans; which abrupt
measure they naturally regard as an act of unkindness."
“ It was urged by the most anxious regard for their
safety.”
• I leave you to exculpate yourself to the mar-
chioness. This very morning, as I was leaving the châ-
teau, she detained me to observe, “I fear, mademoiselle, I
was rash in the pledge I ventured to offer her majesty for
the dutiful services of Camille Valazy. I can obtain no
trace of my poor Madelon. Can you, Euphroisine, afford
me no clue to her retreat ?' I assured her, that since
your last visit to Paris, I had scarcely even heard you
named ; but madame I know not why - smiled in-
credulously as she patted me on the cheek. I will not
despair,' she said.
I still trust to recover my good bro-
ther through your agency.' Ah! how little, how very

little, when I entered this house on my return, did I ex-
pect so immediate a fulfilment of her expectations !"
“ Yet your manner of address evinced little pleasure in
the recognition."
“Nay!” replied Euphroisine, smiling for the first time
since their interview, “recollect that I had no reason to
share Madame de St. Florentin's partial interpretation of
your views and proceedings.”
“ I am grateful that you have amended your judgment.
You have vouchsafed to give me your hand, mademoiselle,
as the pledge of a loyal heart: assure yourself that with
mine, you have received my vows of homage and alle-
giance to the royal cause.
The treaty thus cavalierly proposed, was scarcely ratified
by the prompt acceptance of Euphroisine, when the re.
entrance of old Delplanque, pinked and powdered, and
re-installed in the habit brun de financier, put an end to all
confidential discussion between the parties. With good-
humoured chiding, he despatched his daughter to her toilet,
preparatory to the announcement of dinner; while a know-
ing smile affected to betray his participation in the state of
affairs between her and his agitated guest.
The disordered attire and dishevelled tresses of Eu-
phroisine manifested, on her return, how moderately she
shared either the coquetry of her sex, or the designs of her
father. Throughout the meal she remained silent, pre-
occupied, and mournful ; and when, on her father's pro-
posing the health and restoration to happiness of Louis
and his family, Camille accepted the pledge, and hallowed
its meaning by a profound obeisance towards herself, the
agitated girl was fairly driven from the table by the struggle
of her emotions.
She re-appeared only to bid Camille farewell at the mo-
ment of departure. “I will meet you to-morrow, at
eleven,” she whispered, “on the Boulevard de la Reine.”
And her tone was so distinct from that of levity or sen-
timent, that even the vainest of men could not have misin-
terpreted the character of her communication.
- This is indeed a season to mature the growth of
heroism !” thought Camille, as he slowly returned towards

his lodgings; nor can I wonder that women and girls
assume the energy of manhood, when men acquire the
qualities of beasts of prey. I will take, at least, no step
till I have received further counsel from this devoted ad-
herent to the falling cause of royalism ; or further in-
sight into the views of those who are still dearer to my
heart."
The young provincial, in traversing the most frequented
quarter of the metropolis, was astonished to perceive how
little its external surface demonstrated the commotions se.
cretly stirring within its dark recesses. Elegant equipages,
smiling faces, rich repositories of art and fashion, an-
nouncements of public diversions, of mountebank feats, and
theatrical representations, - still greeted him, as of old, in
every crowded street. There was not a careful countenance
or gloomy object to be detected in the city wherein projects
of death and desolation were hourly devised and perpe-
trated; and wherein the descendants of two ancient
houses of royalty were condemned to the most grievous
humiliations.

The following morning, Valazy failed not to keep time
and place in his appointment with Euphroisine ; and
scarcely had he begun to thread the jostling groups of the
crowded Boulevard, when he perceived her coming slowly
towards him.
“If the eyes of an enemy should be upon us,” observed
Euphroisine, unhesitatingly accepting his arm, “ this meet-
ing will be attributed to motives of gallantry

preservative against more important suspicions. And while
I know your affections to be devoted, however sinfully, to

What are name and fame, when balanced against a sense of
duty ? Banishing, therefore, every feeling of embarrass-
ment arising from our sex and age, I hail you
henceforward
as the brother of my hopes.”
There were many things in this speech which jarred
against the prejudices and self-love of Camille. He was
inclined to resent the peremptory decision of tone with
which his young companion alluded to that secret of his
heart; and felt piqued at the air of superiority with which
she assigned the boundaries of their relative position.
There was something, however, so mournfully grave, so
free from all petulance in her manner, that an avowal of
displeasure would have rendered him ridiculous.
“ I accept,” said he, after a short pause,
are willing to repose in me. You do me honour in be.
lieving, on such slight grounds, that my views and feelings
are honest as your own.
You do me honour by your
confidence ; – and may God desert me when I fail to de-
serve it!”
Camille fancied that the steps of his companion trod
with a lighter buoyancy as he uttered these words; and as
she had now insensibly directed their course towards the
outskirts of the throng, he was about to profit by this
moment of seclusion and enter into a detail of the projects
that had brought him to Paris, when Euphroisine, appa-
rently unconscious of his intention, resumed her former
tone of dictation.
“ The dove, Monsieur Valazy, need not disdain to ga-
ther wisdom from tbe serpent.
To escape the snare and
the pitfall, craft must match with craft, and the move-
ments of our warfare keep pace and quality with those of
the enemy."
“ You speak in the terms of an able tactitian."

importance of their stake, acquainted themselves with every

to acquaint you with your appointed duty."
“Leaving, I conclude, to myself," interrupted Camille
with some degree of irritation, “ the liberty of action.”
“ That you have already remitted, in your vow of alle-
glance to your queen.
“ I was hardly conscious
“ Listen to the detail of duty which I have been in-
structed to impose upon you. My father, I find, acquainted
you yesterday with the advantages derived by your cousin
and his party from the confidential post allotted to one of
their creatures, an unfortunate girl named Flavie, — in
the family of the Marquis de St. Florentin. - Better a
friend in the enemy's camp,' says the proverb, than two
at home.'
“I surely miscomprehend you,” exclaimed Camille,
raising his voice to a pitch of indiscreet indignation. “I
surely mistake your intention, in believing that you would
assign to me the part of a spy - of an eaves-dropping
traitor
“ I am simply instructed to request, that you will cause
yourself to be enrolled in the National Guard. Your
cousin's recognisance will obtain you the notice of La
Fayette ; and by attaining the right of occasional access to
the palace, you will supply a medium of unsuspected com-
munication between their majesties and those friends whose
safety might be compromised by overt intercourse.”
- Unconscious as I am,
at present, of the duties under-
taken and the oaths required in the act of enrolment, it is
impossible to comply with your somewhat imperious re-
quest. My own views entirely coincide with the measure
you propose ; but I have yet to learn whether a soldier of
the National Guard can honourably become an emissary

cannot fail to disarm."

“ Heaven mend the times !” thought Camille, as he
walked on for some minutes in silent perplexity ;

demonium, has infected every spirit in Paris with this
mania for ascendency and intrigue ! - Yesterday, Maximi-
lien talked to me as though his foot were already upon the
neck of his king. To-day, a girl, - a mercer's daughter,
a child in experience of the world, assumes the tone
of a chancellor, -a minister of state,-a regal ambassador,
affecting to regulate my conscience and her majesty's
councils ! - Plague on the presumption of both !”
“ I might perhaps startle you into inconsiderate acqui.
escence,” resumed Euphroisine in a tranquil tone, “ by
claiming it through the influence and in the name of the
Marchioness de St. Florentin ; but I should scorn to win
through the ascendency of a lawless and unsanctioned pas-
sion, those concessions which you withhold from a wife and
mother of the royal House of Bourbon, most injured
and most unhappy!”
“ I withhold nothing,” exclaimed Camille, "except the
blind sacrifice of my right of option. I have sworn my
allegiance to the royal cause to myself to God! -I
now repeat it to you, praying you to become the interpreter
of my good intentions in the quarter whence they have been
commanded.”
- The Marchioness de St. Florentin is at present occu-
pied in conducting the infirm duke her father, from his es-
tate at Navelles to a château possessed by the marquis in
the vicinity of Meaux ; and it is her intention to prolong
her visit to the utmost. A circumstance, however, of the
greatest moment one which at present I have no com-
mands to intrust to your knowledge will shortly require
the presence of madame la marquise at Paris ; when you
will have an opportunity of framing your own vindication,
and receiving your credential, from herself.”
Camille fancied that his companion was trying to obtain a
view of his countenance while she vouchsafed this explana-
tion; and, determined to mark his indifference, turned
calmly towards her, thereby acquiring the further certitude
that a tinge of scorn tempered the expression of her cu-
riosity.

“ I shall have the honour, then, of being admitted to
an interview with my mother's honoured charge !” — he
observed, attempting to characterise the nature of his de-
votion to Emiline.
A smile of deeper disdain evinced Euphroisine's de-
tection of the subterfuge. “In the mean time," she replied,
with marked emphasis, since
you
have so lofty a su-
periority to dissembling even in a good cause, suffer me to
forewarn you that you will find at the Hôtel St. Florentin
a subtle and observant enemy.”
" Your allusion to Mademoiselle Flavie authorises me
to inquire wherefore you have permitted a woman, of whom
you speak with veneration and regard, to retain in her
service a being so degraded as the paramour of Maximilien
Valazy?"
“ Madame de St. Florentin is well aware of the cha-
racter of her attendant. But it would be madness to draw
down the malicious vengeance of an infuriated Jacobin, by
the dismissal of his envoy. Besides, material advantages
have been obtained at the château, by putting the spy
on a wrong scent. We trust to your address to escape a
si.nilar snare, when you do us the service of obtaining
secret information from your kinsman.”
“ Again you misinterpret my intentions, or would affix
a false limit to the duties I have undertaken,” cried Ca-
mille. “ No consideration would induce me to provoke a
confidence of which I premeditated the betrayal ; nor
should I endure the thought of a pretended adoption of
the views of the patriotic faction, were it not the only avail-
able means of benefiting — ” he hesitated.
Speak out, sir ! You have nothing to fear from my
comments or misconstruction of benefiting, you would
say, the Marquise de St. Florentin.
Make what compro-
mise you can between your devotion to her interests,
those of the throne and the altar of your native country,
and your own peevish code of honour. For me," she
added emphatically, “ I have but'one law,-one principle,
one duty ; an unlimited devotion to my God, my
country, and my old father.”
Camille looked earnestly into Euphroisine's countenance

as she uttered these words; and was almost startled to find
there the same feminine delicacy of feature and dove-like
gentleness it had worn at the period when he regarded it as
the index of a trifling and feeble mind. Mademoiselle
Delplanque had something peculiarly girlish in her air and
figure; a fragility amounting to insignificance. Yet under
the admonition of those youthful and uncharactered lips
the spirit of Valazy sank rebuked.
“ I read your thoughts,” she resumed. 6. You marvel
at my boldness; at the recklessness of public opinion which
has engaged me in a furtive interview with a comparative
stranger, and above all, which has taught me to dispense
with the authority of my father.”
Camille discerned the tremulous motion of the arm which
rested upon his own.
“ Yet am I neither overbold, nor indifferent to the suf-
frage of the world. An era of general disorder has begun.
But that the fickle parasites of Versailles look rather to the
seeming than to the truth of things, Marie Antoinette of
France had not needed the reluctant services which I, the
lowliest of her partisans, am come to crave of you in her
name.
-
She paused in evident emotion; and just as Camille was
about to make an elaborate declaration of his confidence in
the purity of her motives, detached herself abruptly from
his side, and turning into an adjoining street, was out of
sight in a moment.
“ Am I awake?” thought Valazy, as he pursued his
solitary way.
“ Am I in my right senses, or is she? -
Delplanque's daughter become the delegate of a crowned
head ? - The queen
- Emiline - consorting with a simple
tradesman's daughter !"
The remembrance of his frequent advocacy of the equality
of human rights and virtues suddenly jarred upon his
mind; and consciousness of the superiority of the being
with whom he had been conversing reproved his apos-
tasy. He confessed to himself, meanwhile, that to become
the faithful emissary of Madame de St. Florentin, the
chosen brother of Euphroisine, were distinctions not un-
promising for his future happiness.

ALFIERI.
It was at this juncture that the difficulties, humiliations,
and cruelties, inflicted on the royal family, hastened the
end anticipated by their persecutors ; - by rendering their
projects desperate, and inciting them to a movement suffi-
ciently unpopular to warrant unqualified imprisonment.
The unfortunate Louis granted his tardy sanction to the
scheme concocted between his anxious family and the Mar-
quis de Bouillé, and attempted to secure their general safety
by seeking refuge in a strong outpost on the frontier of his
agitated kingdom.
The Marquis de St. Florentin, who, at the request of the
queen, had charged himself with the cipher transmitting
the pre-arrangement of the plan to Bouillé, who, as go-
vernor of Metz and Alsace, might be considered viceroy
over the north-eastern frontier, vainly represented to the
king that his sole chance of reaching Montmédy, the ap-
pointed fortress, was by the route of Flanders.
“I know," replied his majesty," to what misinterpreta-
tion my conduct is subjected ; and it shall never be said
that I abandoned my kingdom through tenderness for my
personal safety. — I will set my foot on no other soil than
that of France."* And thus the same timid apprehension
of wounding the prejudices of a nation whose every hand
and every voice was active against his peace, became anew,
and for the last time, a sunken rock, to wreck the frail
vessel, which might perhaps have still weathered the storm
of revolutionary excitement.
The passport procured by St. Florentin with the greatest
difficulty and address, was consequently given up to Mon-
sieur, who was sufficiently fortunate to reach the frontier
without molestation, while the marquis, dispirited by a
change of plan so fatal to his hopes, applied himself to the
difficult task of seeking a new passport, to conduct the royal

party by the Châlons road. Once more successful in the
attempt, it was agreed that he should accompany the fugi.
tives as far as the post from which Bouillé, without ex-
citing suspicion, might secure their further progress by the
convoy of a detachment of the troops under his command.
A cipher of assent to this new scheme of co-operation
had been received from the Marquis de Bouillé — the
strictest secrecy had been observed. The very household
of the queen remained unsuspicious of her intentions. For
repeated betrayal had insinuated general mistrust into a
mind originally candid to imprudence ; and the most san-
guine hopes began to renovate those drooping hearts long
steeped in the bitter tears of humiliation.
The queen, with prudent foresight, having appropriated
to the use of her daughter a chamber belonging to a vacant
suite of apartments whence an unsuspected door opened to
the court-yard of the Tuileries, it was resolved that the
royal party, including their majesties, Madame Elizabeth,
the dauphin, and his sister, should singly escape through
this obscure issue, at eleven o'clock at night — (an hour
when they were especially free from household attendance)
- and reach an appointed spot, where the travelling carriage
assigned to their use, with St. Florentin and two gentlemen
of the body-guard disguised as attendants, would be in
waiting to receive them. So judiciously were these and
other minor arrangements concerted, that had it not been
for a lamentable postponement in the outset of the expedi-
tion, through which the troops stationed for their protection
were compelled to desert their post previous to the arrival
of the disguised fugitives, the ultimate safety of Louis XVI.
and his unfortunate family would have been secured on this
critical occasion.
With a view of aiding the progress of an undertaking
requiring the stanchest fidelity in its agents, Madame de St.
Florentin had intrusted to her enthusiastic protegée the
delicate task of engaging the services of her foster-brother.
But among the calamities endangering the success of every
secret undertaking, at that epoch, was the general mistrust
and surveillance which rendered communication among the
parties concerned difficult on all occasions, and on some,

107
impossible. From the period when Euphroisine succeeded
in attaching Camille to the party, the vigilance of the
treacherous Flavie intercepted all means of intelligence
between them; and on the morning of the fatal 21st of
June, the arrival of a strange emissary on the part of
Mademoiselle Bertin in place of Euphroisine, satisfied
her that either treachery or some grievous misfortune had
deprived her of her energetic and favourite assistant. But
apprehension for the safety of those she loved — her
husband and her sovereign quickly obliterated all other
considerations; and she soon forgot her suspicions.
Meanwhile, Camille obeyed, with diligence and exactness,
his instructions. He had passed through the ordeal of
Maximilien Valazy's suspicious scrutiny; who, nothing
doubting that his kinsman entertained an ultimate and
unacknowledged object for his sudden exertions, subjected
him to a severe cross-examination in the course of his
very first interview with La Fayette. The result, however,
was favourable to himself; for the general, anxious to
secure the voices of the more respectable citizens, and sur-
round his person with active and able coadjutors, instantly
distinguished the manly and intelligent spirit characterising
the young aspirant for the honours of the civic guard. He
promised, and speedily redeemed his word, to have an eye
to his advancement.
Scarcely had Camille invested himself in the accoutre-
ments of his new vocation, when he hastened to fulfil the
expectations of those to whose aid its services were secretly
dedicated, by presenting himself at the house of Delplanque.
He did not, however, succeed in gaining access to the
presence of Euphroisine ; and his suspicions being awakened
by the pertinacity with which, day after day, he was re-
fused admittance, he had recourse to an universal method
of insinuation, and by a douceur to the surly domestic
Cerberus of the ex-mercier, obtained some insight into this
ill-timed and perplexing mystery.
On the very day of his last interview with Mademoiselle
Delplanque, she had been denounced to the National As-
sembly as a secret agent of Marie Antoinette ; and as the
period had not yet arrived when persons could be arrested

and imprisoned on such invalid suspicious, her effects were
subjected, in the first instance, to the domiciliary inquisition
of the municipal officers. Thanks to her own foresight
and presence of mind, nothing was detected that could sub-
stantiate the charge ; and after a slight, but vexatious public
examination, she was set at liberty.
To Euphroisine herself, this transitory trial appeared
but a trifling sacrifice. She had been harassed and insulted ;
but the remembrance of Marie Antoinette, and the humi-
liations to which she had been subjected, hushed every
murmur upon her lips. Not so old Delplanque. His
selfishness had enlisted itself in no party — acknowledged
no influence, — he was unsusceptible of the least enthusiasm
to smooth the path of martyrdom. The ensanguined
ghosts of Réveillon, Berthier, and Foulon, arose in his
memory, the moment a shouting populace cheered the
entrance of the minions of the law into his dwelling. He
had wit enough to perceive that the extreme loveliness of
Euphroisine had attracted general attention towards his
daughter and his ducats ; - and had no mind to be de-
spoiled of either in favour of some beggarly democrat, who
affected to be “ wise," and had “never seen the Louvre.”
Elated beyond his hopes by the speedy enlargement of
Euphroisine, he resolved to secure the further safety of
both by emigration, though not in its most extended sense.
A badaud of most contracted perceptions, the capital was
his patrie,
the Marais his city of refuge from the com-
motions of the court ; and in deserting them for his native
province, he became as very an emigrant as any Polignac
or D'Artois of them all ! Within twenty-four hours of
Euphroisine's liberation, he was on the road to Arras, to
place himself and his daughter under the protection of his
brother, a flourishing merchant, whose influence was great
in that city, “ whatsoever king might reign.” Vain the
tears and entreaties of his agonised child, — Euphroisine
was forced to repress her glowing loyalty, and stifle the
sense of her importance to her royal mistress, in the dread
that her father's timid egotism might betray
utter per-
dition the royal cause. With a heart broken by grief and
anxiety, she was fain to accompany the abdicated mercer
to Arras; where, he hoped, unknown and unsuspected,

to dream away the gloomy night which obscured the
face of public affairs, and the brilliant prospects of the
capital.
“ And did Mademoiselle Delplanque leave no letter for
- no communication ?" inquired Camille. " Did her
father mention no commission for me to execute ?"
“None !” replied the dull and uncommunicative do-
mestic, “But now I think on't, mademoiselle requested
you would take charge of a pot of carnations which stood
in her chamber.”
“ And why did you not immediately forward it to me?"
66 For what purpose ?
I have watered it daily; a poor
sickly plant, without a single flower.'
“ Nevertheless I am bound to comply with the com-
mands of mademoiselle, and charge myself with her com-
mission.”
“ As you please, sir,” said the sulky porter's wife.
“But you may assure yourself that I have both leisure and
zeal to look to Mam’selle Euphroisine's flowers."
Persuaded that some peculiarity was attached to the gift,
Camille instantly conveyed it in a fiacre to his lodgings.
Arrived in his own apartment, he hastily drew bolt and
bar, and proceeded to the investigation of the mystery.
The earth had evidently been recently disturbed. He
hesitated not, therefore, to turn out the contents of the
flower-pot; and his suspicions were justified by the dis-
covery of a square iron casket under the mould, containing
30,000 francs in sealed and labelled bags of double louis-
d'ors, accompanied by the following billet:
“ Probably your sagacity will put you in possession of
the accompanying gold, which I hold in deposit for the
service of others. Denied the valued privilege of pro-
secuting my exertions in their cause, leave me the conso-
lation of believing that you will replace me in zeal' and
attachment. I have every reason to suppose
accuser to the Assembly was the unworthy servant of one
who is very dear to you; and that you also are honoured
by her remembrance. Guard, therefore, as your life, the
secret motives of a measure which I trust is by this time
assured on your part.

your safety and my own. Farewell !”

secure
The sudden disappearance of Euphroisine from the scene
of action deprived the disconcerted Camille of the polar-
star by which he had hoped to steer his future movements.
He knew that Madame de St. Florentin must still be
ignorant of his submission to her commands; but though
his professional initiation had so fully occupied his time
and attention as to estrange his notice from the important
events passing in the Delplanque family, it had not pre-
vented him from making general inquiries relative to the
marchioness, her views, and movements. He was aware
that she still prolonged her visit to her father,
from insult and molestation in the midst of a tenantry to
whom she was endeared beyond a Jacobin's misleading ;
and thus, free from all uneasiness on her account, Camille
was content to fulfil the duties of the new calling he had
adopted, and acquaint himself with the occasions that might
render it conducive to her future safety.
From the hour of his enrolment in the ranks of the
National Guard, he had the satisfaction of perceiving that
he was considered by its commandant, La Fayette, with
distinguishing favour; a circumstance which Maximilien
Valazy failed not to attribute to his cousin's close kindred
with an influential deputy and orator of the patriotic fac-
tion; and which Camille himself was rather inclined to
trace to those insinuations of royalism, suggested by his
cousin with a far different intention. Le Blondinet,
as La Fayette was familiarly nicknamed by the court of
Versailles, — though professedly of the constitutional party,
omitted no occasion of affording personal protection to the
unfortunate monarch whom he was anxious to reduce to
the mockery of a state-puppet, - or nominal head to the

111
most limited monarchy which triumphant rebellion ever
yet shore of its beams. The king and queen were at that
period a sacred pledge intrusted by the nation to the
guardianship of its civic force ; and La Fayette was at
once responsible to the Assembly for the persons of his
prisoners, and to his sovereign for security from the evil
will of the infuriated multitude.
In the execution of this twofold trust, he had uniformly
bid defiance to the innovations of the people, and resisted
the arrogant pretensions of the Jacobin and Brissotin fac-
tions; to which, under the ultra-banner of the Monta-
gnards, Maximilien Valazy affected to hold himself attached.
Careful, however, to shun the perils investing a house
divided against itself, La Fayette remained on terms of
personal cordiality with the members of the party opposed
to the throne and its ancient prerogative — the court of
Versailles and its influence; while he welcomed, or rather
courted to his ranks, all such substantial citizens as had
personal motives for repressing the growth and innovations
of civil anarchy, - and all such moderate constitutionalists
as were willing to respect the fallen majesty wbich them-
selves had levelled with the dust. Notwithstanding the
influence attributed to his word, it proved insufficient to re-
establish the discipline of the troops under his command,
when, on the occasion of the king's intended journey to St.
Cloud, the National Guard united with the people, to forbid
his departure; and though La Fayette was persuaded to
resume the high military authority which at that crisis he
had indignantly resigned, he neglected no opportunity to
fortify the fidelity of his troops, and surround himself with
men of tried integrity and loyal feeling.
The family connection between La Fayette and the
Marquis de Bouillé induced many to believe that a secret
understanding existed between them, relative to the pro-
jected flight of the royal family; that the former, awakened
to the increasing ferocity of the mob, and the sanguinary
views entertained by the leading members of the Assembly,
had insisted upon the retention of his kinsman in his high
command; certain that it would secure an eventual resource
to the persecuted monarch and his family,

A few days previous to the night fixed for the
escape
of
the royal family, Camille received an unsolicited appoint-
ment to the post of aide-de-camp to his general ; who, in
overlooking the intermediary progression of rank in favour
of one of the name of Valazy, was secure from provoking
the displeasure of the Jacobins ; while the moderate party
placed a blind reliance on the wisdom of his measures.
There exists probably no human distinction, of which
the attainment is not an immediate source of pride and
pleasure ; and even Camille, restricted as he was in the
projects of his ambition and political views, did not regard
with insensibility the notice of a man so remarkable as La
Fayette.
Pray Heaven, I become not a partisan in right ear-
nest,” said he, as he looked on his new epaulet. “My
heart is with the king, — my mind with his people. My
right arm shall devote itself to maintain peace between
them, while it guards from scathe the child of the noble
benefactor of my youth. Welcome, however, will be the
day that restores the country to tranquillity, even at the
sacrifice of some portion of the rights it claims; for the
idol of liberty, which delights to find itself bathed in kin-
dred blood, is unworthy the sacrifices that load its reeking
altars."
Such were the reflections which followed his instalment
in his uncoveted honours. Further consideration taught
him to regret his accession to a dignity, which might prove
a fatal impediment to his exertions in the cause still dearer
to his heart than that of king or country. In the course
of the following day, as he was galloping with a despatch
towards the Porte St. Denis, having encountered a carriage
bearing the arms of St. Florentin and Navelles, he relaxed
his speed to detect its entrance into the court-yard of the
Hôtel St. Florentin, where the marquis was impatiently
waiting the arrival of his beloved Emiline and her children.
Though deeply agitated by this momentary view of the
object of his enthusiastic attachment, he was enabled to
detect the grievous changes effected by anxiety in her ap-
pearance. He noticed the tremulous lip and wasted cheek,
coloured with a momentary hectic as she approached the
13

113
beloved home no longer affording her a refuge from afflic-
tion, the beloved husband, whose fond esteem no longer
secured her from insult. But he knew not, nor could
guess the exciting cause of her unusual emotion! She was
come to take her leave of the marquis, previous to the final
effort of his devotion in the royal cause.
She was come
to be a hostage in the enemy's camp ;
to take her first
step in that public path of danger, which was hereafter to
guide her through precincts of infamy, horror, and death!
During the remainder of the day, the mind of Camille
was divided between his duties, and a consideration of the
manner in which he could avoid the appearance of offi.
ciousness in presenting himself to Emiline's recognition.
But he was spared all unnecessary debate on the sub-
ject. As he proceeded early on the morrow towards the
Hôtel de Ville to render an account of his mission, he was
met by an orderly, requiring his immediate attendance on
General La Fayette. Camille hastened forwards; and in
the course of a few minutes, was summoned to the cabinet
of the general, whom he found occupied in the attentive
perusal of some official documents.
La Fayette looked up from his employment as Valazy
entered, acknowledged his respectful salutation with a hasty
nod, and resumed his work; and Camille, while he waited
the leisure of his patron, interested himself in contemplating
the figure and attitude of the man, who at that moment
more than king or orator - balanced the destinies of
France. A stream of morning light fell from the lofty
window upon his stern soldier-like countenance ; his hair
hung in unpowdered masses round his face ; even his
military array had somewhat relaxed its punctilio of eti-
quette. But the person of the general had been too long
stiffened by the harness of war, to forfeit an iota of its
formal dignity; and Camille could not divest himself of
that feeling of awe with which we gaze on those who bear
the impress of having grappled with danger face to face,
and of wearing laurels not altogether bloodless. So deeply
was he engaged in this interesting contemplation, that he
started at the abrupt tone of General la Fayette's first in-
quiry.

to an
“ You have some domestic relation with the family of St.
Florentin. Explain to me, sir, its origin and interests.”
Valazy, who had not yet acquired the art of listening to
that name unmoved, attempted to describe the nature of
his connection with the house of Navelles ; interpolating
his hurried narrative with assurances that all intercourse
between them had long ceased.
La Fayette, attributing this renegation of his former pro-
tectors to a motive far less honourable than that in which
it really originated, sternly assured the young soldier that
he did himself little credit by this vehement exculpation.
Ingratitude," said he, “is a bad pioneer to advancement;
and to deny his master was condemnation even
apostle."
Camille was not sufficiently trained to habits of subordi-
nation, to let this charge pass unvindicated.
" Could I
accuse myself,” he began
“Silence !” exclaimed the general.
“ I sent for you to
receive my instructions, not to favour me with your own.
Understand, therefore, that I am so little inclined to behold

flicting punishment where expostulation may still avail, -
that I could wish you ” (instinctively he lowered his pe-
remptory voice, and glanced towards the door of the cabi-
net,) —" I could wish you to wait upon St. Florentin in my
name, and warn him, nay, entreat him, not to draw
my attention too closely towards him this day. He will
understand my meaning. Tell him, he may tempt my for-
bearance beyond my power of forgiveness; and beg him to
believe, that the hazards he is about to incur are directed
towards an unprofitable aim, — towards a hopeless -
utterly hopeless, conclusion.”
He paused, and Camille marked his comprehension of
the command by a profound obeisance.
“You will remember that my commission does not in-
clude itself among your military duties, that it is, in
short, confidential; and according to your diligence on the
present occasion, will a good understanding be permanently
established between us.
Go, sir.

-
own disposal for the remainder of the day. Remember
that I have said confidential.”
Camille again bowed, and following the command im-
plied by the general's extended hand, quitted the cabinet
without delay. Though understanding but imperfectly the
implication contained in La Fayette's mysterious message,
he perceived that it was one of considerable importance.
Pausing only to throw off that uniform which so ill became
the nuncio of a private and pacific mission, —he proceeded
to the. Hôtel St. Florentin.
CHAPTER XIX.

Before Camille presented himself to fulfil the charge of
the Marquis de la Fayette, St. Florentin had already
quitted his home — for ever !
Having received, through the agency of the faithful
Bertin, the final appointment of Marie Antoinette, and
taken the melancholy adieu already described, he deter-
mined to avoid all danger of interruption to his momentous
project, by absenting himself from his family during the
remainder of the day ; devoting the morning to a recon-
noissance of the obstacles he was likely to encounter on
the route destined to be traversed at night by the royal fugi-
tives ;—and dining at an obscure restaurateur's, in the re-
mote quarter where he had hired the travelling carriage and
horses for their use.
Camille, who received in answer to his inquiries for the
Marquis de St. Florentin a simple assurance that he was
absent from bome, determined to loiter in the neighbour-
hood till his return to the hotel. But hour after hour
passed away. The intense heat of the morning subsided
into the cooler freshness of evening - the dimness of twi.

distracted his mind with anxiety.–Was he too late ? -
Had that single hour of delay rendered his mission invalid ?
“ This day!” had been the period emphatically named by
La Fayette, as offering some danger expressly to be avoided !
Bewildered by his conjectures, Camille no longer hesi-
tated to apply for an audience of the marchioness herself.
But the porter, having transmitted the request through the
intervention of Mademoiselle Flavie, returned with a harsh
negative to the petition. There was something in the
phrasing of the message, which induced Camille to suspect,
and with reason, that it was not framed by the gentle
Emiline ; and persuaded that through some mischievous
influence, his prayer had been prevented from reaching her
ear, he resolved to despatch a message to her in writing,
and adjourned to a neighbouring coffee-house to effect his
purpose. But the sight of the suspicious and disorderly
beings congregated there recalled to mind the danger that
might arise, were a billet intercepted sufficiently forcible in
its expressions to awaken the alarms of the marchioness.
He returned, therefore, in anxious haste towards the hotel ;
trusting that among its exits and its entrances he should
encounter some faithful envoy.
Scarcely had he regained the court-yard,
for it was
already night, when a carriage drew up to the door ; and
Emiline, brilliant in jewels, and robed in all the glowing
elegance of fashion, - attired, in short, for the fête of the
Duc de Nivernois,- glanced for an instant before his eyes !
Camille shuddered as the carriage rolled away.
plorable levity !” he exclaimed, “fatal vanity! - Will
neither the sufferings nor the perils of her country, - her
sovereign, — her kindred, — her very self, suffice to
neutralise its fantastic folly ! - Emiline, Emiline !— There
is mockery in the glimmering of thy jewelled attire, —
there is accusation in the lightness of thy step at such an
hour! Were I often permitted to see thee thus — the
thraldom of my heart would quickly end.”
The Swiss was still standing, flambeau in hand, upon
the steps ; and Camille eagerly profited by so fortunate an
opportunity for further interrogation. “Was the Marquis
de St. Florentin," he inquired,“ likely to meet his lady at
- De-

-
the Hôtel Nivernois ? the address he had heard given to
the servants.
“ The marquis was gone into the country.”
6. When ? · where?
Instead of replying, the man hastily extinguished his
flambeau, and retreated from the importunate questions of
an obscure foot-passenger, whose visit had been cavalierly
declined by the femme de chambre de madame la marquise.
Valazy was half inclined to attempt an interview with
Emiline on her departure from the fête ; and, taking his
way towards the Hôtel Nivernois, stationed himself amid
the murmuring crowd surrounding the illuminated mansion
whence the sound of music and festivity issued in fright-
ful contrast. To escape the horrible execrations which met
his ear on every side, — the menaces poured forth upon
the heads of those who derided the starving populace by
their intemperance in the hour of scarcity, Camille turned
towards the Boulevards; a spot almost deserted at that
hour of the night.
It was the noon-tide of the year, - the glowing luxuri-
ance of June, that month which not even the pollution
of a city can wholly subdue. A clear grey summer night
twinkling with a solitary star that seemed to shrink from
finding itself alone on the heavens, had hushed the at-
mosphere into stillness. The hum of the city was over ;
the artisan had gone to his feverish rest; and Camille, as
he paced the deserted Boulevard, marvelled that the fra.
grance bursting from its lime-trees and adjoining gardens
had not power to attract the sickly mechanic from his
squalid den, or the still more sickly votary of dissipation
from the crowded chambers infested by noxious exhala-
tions, When he thought of the scene of riot and folly
whence he had just escaped, he felt inclined, for a mo-
ment, to revert to his early prejudices against the arrogant
luxury of the aristocracy; and to utter a general anathema
against that wantonness of excess, which even the humi.
liation and grief of the sovereigns they affected to cherish
were insufficient to moderate. He turned from the image
of the radiant Emiline, to the recollection of the pale and
saddened girl who hung on his arm when last he trod that
1 3

Boulevard ; whose beauty was subdued and soft as the
balmy night hovering over his head ;- and whose thoughts
were as elevated, and whose mind as bright, as the one
clear star that glanced amid its shadows.
Engrossed by these meditations and reminiscences, Ca-
mille pursued his solitary way along the Boulevards ; till,
in one of the most unfrequented quarters, he was struck by
the appearance of a heavy travelling carriage with four
horses, waiting as if in expectation of additional passen-
gers. While inwardly commenting upon the loveliness of
the season for a midnight journey, his steps were overtaken
by two females, who passed onwards with hurried avoid-
ance; and by the light of a lamp which partially illu-
minated their faces, he noticed that they were meanly
apparelled, but that the countenance of the one nearest to
himself, though tinged with a deathlike paleness, was ex-
quisitely lovely. As they reached the carriage, the door
opened ; and it was evident that they were welcomed by
those within with the fondest warmth of gratulation. In
a minute, a voice required in the German language the
coachman to proceed, and the equipage rolled rapidly along
the Boulevard.
A sudden consciousness as quickly enlightened the mind
of Camille, increasing as the rumble of its cumbrous
wheels lessened in the distance. The hour, the occasion,
– the mysterious haste of the travellers, excited his first
suspicion ; and on reflection, the beautiful face on which
he had gazed, bore the peculiar lineaments of the Bourbon
countenance. - It was undoubtedly that of Madame Eliza-
beth, the only member of the royal family personally
unknown to him; and the coachman, of whose figure he
had caught a momentary glimpse, was as surely St. Floren-
tin himself ! - His respectful air as he turned towards the
carriage, demonstrated that some person of supreme rank
was lodged within. Yes ! every circumstance tallied with
La Fayette's oracular warning ; every circumstance be-
trayed in the persons of these midnight fugitives — the
royal family of France !
The truth was scarcely less manifest than the importance
of the crisis ! Not a moment was to be lost. -- Life and

cess.
death, - perhaps, the lives and deaths of thousands,
hung suspended on every dropping grain of sand; -- and
Camille, fondly trusting that his speed might yet intercept
the carriage at the Barrière, flew with eager and untiring
zeal in the direction it had taken. In the impetuosity of
his course, the earth seemed to recede beneath his steps.-
He saw not, felt not, - his breath was restrained as by an
iron girdle round his bosom. — A sense of agony urged on
his bounding feet, and superseded even his doubts of suc-
There it was before him !-- that dark, and seem-
ingly indifferent object, moving forward in the distance,
whose attainment would form a triumph for his future life,
and perhaps a preservative for many an innocent victim ;
- whose attainment might have been compassed by the
delay of a moment, — by the intervention of a stone on the
road ! - But its destiny was otherwise appointed ! .
At about forty paces from the Barrière St. Martin, Ca-
mille, dreading to attract the observation of the municipal
officers stationed there, checked the violence of his speed.
Aided by the flashing lamps of the office, he had the mor-
tification of seeing the passport returned into the carriage
by the soldier on duty; and, before he could rush forwards,
a hoarse exclamation of " En route !” and a furious in-
citement of the whip put the stately vehicle again in
motion, at a very different rate from its previous move-
ments. Nor did Valazy attempt to follow its accelerated
speed. The impossibility of overtaking the carriage was
glaringly evident; and he felt assured that the betrayal of
undue solicitude, could not fail to attract the attention of
the gendarmerie towards its contents.
With an air of indifference, therefore, he sauntered
towards the guard-house ; where, under pretence of ar-
ranging his watch by the light of the lamp, he entered
into conversation with the soldier who was smoking at the
-affecting to ridicule the cumbersome equipage,
and heavy load of the recent travellers. “ But they were
a squadron of German thickskulls ? " he observed, in a
half-interrogatory tone.
“ The Baroness de Korff and her family, returning to

portations from the wrong side of the Rhine, or that they
were smothered in their own sauer kraut ! If my advice
were to be taken, morguienne, the Austrian, and her gang
should be crushed like so many toads ! ”
Valazy shuddered with horror, when he remembered
that the safety of “the Austrian had been placed but a
few seconds before at this ruffian's disposal ! Nor did it
dispel his anxiety to remember by how many voices in the
kingdom these sentiments, and others of similar atrocity,
were unceasingly re-echoed. The king and queen had
escaped the vigilance of their janitors; but, without pos-
sessing the slightest suspicion of their ultimate destination,
he felt persuaded that the warning insinuated by La Fayette
had not been inadvertently given; and that a path con-
ducting through observant thousands of exasperated ene-
mies must be fatal. Reflection came too late. The only
measure of redress that occurred to his mind, was to hasten
his purposed interview with Emiline, and withdraw one
martyr from the general sacrifice.
As he retraced his steps along the Boulevard, - the
deepening uproar of popular tumult became distinctly
audible. A lurid reflection reddened the atmosphere, just
where the palace of the Duc de Nivernois was sending forth
the clash of its cymbals into the midnight air. Camille
started ; and anticipating some danger for its thoughtless
inmates, began to revile himself as he hurried along, for
having presumed to utter one thought of condemnation
touching the fairest and dearest of them all.
Finding it impossible to penetrate the avenues invested
by an outrageous mob, Camille began to reconnoitre the
issues leading from the Boulevards to the hotel; whose
guests remained ignorant of a tumult, deafened by the
joyousness of their mirth. As he watched the open win-
dows of the heated ball-room, he became an involuntary
witness to the interview between Mirepoix and Emeline
de St. Florentin ! — He distinguished not, indeed, the
express words passing between them; but the tender
inflection of their voices reaching his ear, misled him into
a belief that gallantry, rather than patriotic sympathy,
had withdrawn them from the gay assemblage. He saw

121
the marchioness leaning, with heavy sighs, against the
marble window-seat; and believing them to be directed to
the ear of a paramour, could scarcely restrain his indig-
nation.
“ Deluded woman!” murmured Camille, as the flash-
ing of the lights within revealed her more than earthly
beauty. “ Can no ties, no perils, no warnings restrain
thee? · Danger is around thy path; - death perhaps
advancing, with gloating eye, to feed his ravening hunger
on thy cheek ! — And he will find thee in dalliance with
a libertine!”
A wilder shout from the inner court of the hotel pro-
claimed some fresh outrage.
But the time for warning
was expired : Mirepoix and his partner had already left
the window. Again Camille accused himself of having
been harsh and premature in his judgment. But ere he
had time to amend his fault by attempting to gain access
to the mansion, he beheld the object of his anxiety, care-
fully guarded by the stranger whom he believed to be her
lover, effect her escape from the now alarmed assembly.
He heard the chevalier, in terms of the fondest endear-
ment, urge her to be calm and silent during their flight.
As she clung to his protecting side, Camille, with
indignant wonder, heard him name her “Emiline-his
Emiline!”
“And I!” he exclaimed, “I who scarcely dared
entitle her thus, even in my purest prayer -
even in the
secret solitude of my midnight tears !”
Her mantle touched him as she passed, and he shook
off the contact as if it could convey a pestilential con-
tagion. — Still the thought of other times, and the feelings
with which they were interwoven, prompted him to follow
the footsteps of the fugitives. He saw the marchioness
deposited in safety at her hotel ; and alternately thanked
Heaven for her escape, and cursed her preserver !
The night was now far advanced ; and as Camille,
weary and disgusted, regained his own habitation, he felt
in some degree consoled for the ill success of his enter-
prise by his discovery of the unworthiness of the person
who had formed the chief incitement to his zeal. But on

entering his chamber, the first object which met his obser-
vation was a communication in cipher from La Fayette,
re-animating in a moment his exhausted faculties.
“ You have been too late, and fatally so ! I will not
prejudge your remissness, but require you to repair the
fault by proceeding a second time — and instantly — to
the same quarter.
See her at all risks. Tell her the
attempt has failed ; — that suspicion is stir, and sus-
pended only by the lateness of the hour, The Committee
of Research will visit her by daybreak. Her escape must
be immediate or unavailing.”
Camille had no hesitation in referring the mysterious
her to the Marchioness de St. Florentin. He threw on
his uniform, believing its authority might be some advan-
tage in case of an altercation with any civil officer. As
he once again, and with a beating heart, approached her
hotel, he trembled on discovering that faint red streaks
were already discernible in the east!”
On Emiline's return from the ball, the venerable
Laporte came forward to receive her; and when Camille
once more, and with uncompromising peremptoriness
summoned the porter from his slumbers, he demanded,
in the name of La Fayette, and by virtue of his habit, an
immediate interview with the old steward to whom from
his boyhood he had been favourably known. In this
startling emergency, the old man evinced more presence of
mind than could have been expected. Readily entering
into the scheme of light suggested by Camille on the hint
of a passport enclosed in the communication of General
La Fayette, he agreed in the necessity of exaggerating
the danger of the marchioness's position, in order to
expedite her departure. The foresight of Valazy had
posted his own carriage in the adjoining street; and
Laporte himself undertook to accompany the instant flight
of his mistress and her children. Both were sanguine of
success; when the obstinacy of Emiline overthrew their
scheme, and restored her entire influence over the mind of
her worshipper.- He looked upon her beauty,— listened
to her noble declarations, — and again adored her ! -
But it was no time to indulge in such emotions. To

save her
to guard her ---- to ward off the coming blow,
was his immediate consideration. Already he seemed to
behold her abandoned to the ruffianly insolence of the
minions of the law,— already an agony of apprehension
overwhelmed his heart. The danger, the imminent
danger of his fugitive king became as nothing. For in
the cause of Louis, many a sword would be drawn, many
a pleading voice become eloquent. — But Emiline — the
helpless mother of still more helpless children— Emiline
was forsaken by her lawful protector, and abandoned to
perils provoked by his own rashness !
All that remained for him was to repair without delay
to the Hôtel de Ville ; and gather from La Fayette some
tidings of the royal fugitives, and instructions for the
further defence of those endangered by their escape from
Paris.

As Camille approached the Hôtel de Ville, with the hope
of instant admittance to a confidential audience, he was
struck, on approaching the Place de Grève, by an appear-
ance of premature animation in the adjoining streets.
The shops, usually closed at so early an hour of the
morning, were filled with idlers, evidently assembled by
motives of curiosity rather than of commercial interest;
while even in the streets and the square, detached groups
of busy politicians were engaged among themselves in
some vehement discussion, connected with some new crisis
of public interest. The names of the king and queen,
repeated in various tones of disgust, hatred, and resent-
ment, soon struck his ear; and long before he gained the
steps of the Hôtel de Ville, the rumours of the angry
multitude acquainted him that authentic intelligence of
the flight of their majesties had that moment reached the
authorities.

some
Hastening up the crowded stairs, he perceived La
Fayette engaged in earnest conversation with Bailly, Gou-
vion, and a woman of the queen's wardrobe attended by
two soldiers of the National Guard, who seemed to have
been the bearers of this startling piece of information.
While the former was apparently deliberating on
further precautionary measure, Camille bent a look of eager
inquiry on his countenance, to ascertain, if possible, to what
extent the politic general had been previously involved in
the affair. The character of this remarkable man was still
imperfectly developed. He was known to have brought
with him from the emancipated provinces of America an
enthusiastic zeal for the cause of civil liberty ; yet the
courtly urbanity of his address repelled all familiarity on
the part of the rude and ferocious faction of the Parisian
revolutionists, inducing them to suspect his secret inclina-
tion towards that aristocratic ascendency, with which his
own mind and manners appeared so well assimilated. The
frankness and bonhommie of his demeanour towards the
populace, however, his seeming deference to their preju-
dices, and above all, the intrepid coolness of his demeanour
on occasions of popular disturbance, secured him the con-
fidence of the citizens, and an unlimited command over the
passions of the mob. In more than one crisis of public
excitation, his simple authority had arrested the course of
national violence, and suspended the effusion of blood : so
true it is that a man never obtains a complete sway over
the passions of others, but when he exhibits a mastery over
his own.
But Camille, although amply satisfied of the rectitude of
La Fayette's principles, and of his honest desire to strip the
monarchy of his native country of the dangerous preroga-
tive assumed by the House of Bourbon, could not divest
himself of a belief that the general was inclined to favour
any measure, whereby the anointed sovereign of France
might be saved from ultimate sacrifice ;-a sacrifice which
his recent humiliation rendered a superfluous atonement,-
and a needless lesson to the despotic monarchs of other
countries or future ages. Thus far, however, was clear,
that he was fully aware of the part taken in the plot by the

125
family of St. Florentin. Profiting by a moment's confusion
in the chamber, he turned towards his aide-de-camp, as if
for the purpose of professional instruction.
“ Your agency, sir, 1 perceive has been unavailing!”
said he, in a stern but subdued tone. “I require no par-
ticulars,” he continued, waving his hand, as Camille was
about to enter on an explanation. Enough that this rash
en ise has been attempted !”
Then turning to the two soldiers of the National Guard,
he inquired whether any indications had transpired of the
route taken by the fugitives; and learning that general
opinion pointed to that of Flanders, he appeared to coincide
in the belief; and continued to receive, with composed
indifference, a thousand contradictory statements poured in
upon hiin relative to the mode of escape, and direction of
flight adopted by the royal family.
It has since been ascertained, that the first person en-
countered by Marie Antoinette and Madame Elizabeth, on
leaving the Tuileries, was La Fayette himself, mounted on
the white charger which rendered him so conspicuous to
the Parisian populace ; but whether his blindness on the oc-
casion were real, or a merciful assumption, is still doubtful.
The populace crowded together in the Place de la
Grève, and under the windows of the Hôtel de Ville, where
the body of the municipal officers were now assembled, soon
exhibited their usual ferocity; and the menaces and impre-
cations of the mob were distinctly heard in the council
chamber, upbraiding Bailly the mayor of Paris, and even
La Fayette himself, as accomplices in the escape of the
royal family. Bailly was anxious to exculpate himself from
this unjust charge, by haranguing the people ; but La
Fayette, who had already beheld Foulon and his son-in-
law Berthier de Sauvigny, dragged from the balcony to an
immediate and cruel death, strove by the coolest expostu-
lations to dissuade his colleague from the rash attempt;
pointing out at the same time to his notice the fatal lantern
prepared for them.
“ The National Assembly is aware of the peril of our
predicament,” said he, without deigning to explain in what
manner he had procured the welcome intelligence.

safety cannot be a matter of indifference to them : - leave
it in their hands."
To the satisfaction of all parties, his conjectures were
speedily realised.
In another minute, the tumult of the
riotous populace was suddenly checked ; and a considerable
detachment of the National Guard was seen by the prisoners
in the council-chamber to traverse the square fronting the
Hôtel de Ville. No obstacle was opposed to their passage,
when it became known that these troops were commissioned
to conduct the mayor, as well as La Fayette and Gouvion,
before the Assemblé Constituante, to render an account of
their culpable negligence ; and be present at the opening of
the proclamation of Louis XVI. to the Parisians, — expla-
natory of the motives of his flight, and descriptive of the
injurious treatment to which he had been subjected. The
irritated mob readily gave way to the passage of their gene-
ral and his companions, under military escort; persuaded
that they were only surrendering their victims to the judg-
ment of a tribunal, as severely disposed towards the prison-
ers as their worst feelings could desire.
The measures of the Assemblé Constituante in this exi-
gency exhibited a character of promptitude, energy, and
moderation, such as it rarely displayed on less important
occasions. The ministers were severally apprised of the
escape of the king, and summoned to assist at a general
deliberation on the measures to be adopted. No person
was allowed to pass the barriers during the day. Couriers
were despatched into the departments, preventing the pro-
gress of all travellers towards the frontiers. Strong de-
tachments were placed in the disaffected sections of the
city, and others stationed for the protection of the Hall of
Assembly. When La Fayette and his companions reached
the bar, Alexandre de Beauharnois*, who acted as presi-
dent, was in the act of making known to the assembly the
report of the commissioners who had been dispersed
throughout Paris to investigate the dispositions of the
people ; and of the deputies who had been commissioned
to ascertain whether the crown jewels had been carried off
by the royal fugitives : — and the assurance conveyed

of the perfect tranquillity of the citizens and their un-
abated confidence in the integrity of their representatives,
seemed to impart a corresponding degree of firmness and
self-security to the proceedings of the Assembly.
The examination of La Fayette and his coadjutors was
followed up with a sufficient appearance of rigour to satisfy
the misgivings of the mistrustful populace. A direct charge
was made of culpable negligence on the part of the Na-
tional Guard, - and co-operation on that of the muni-
cipality,-- but only to be plausibly refuted ; and the
ministers of the crown having at length arrived, the cele-
brated proclamation of Louis XVI. was officially read to
the Assembly.
The reproaches and accusations against the National
Assembly, contained in this interesting address, served of
course rather to irritate than to effect any intimidation
upon its auditors. They were upbraided by the king with
having attempted the destruction of the French monarchy,
and with seeking to extend the civil anarchy of Paris
throughout every part of the kingdom ; but nothing could
be more easy than to refute a charge, in which the party
accused was both judge and juror. The excesses and ra.
pacity of the court of Versailles, the unconstitutional inno-
vations of the former ministry, as well as the unyielding
tenacity of the king, were again and again brought forward
by various popular orators as pretexts for the severities
and privations inflicted upon the royal family. - The
conspiracy formed by the Bourbon family against the so-
vereignty of the nation,” became for the thousandth, but
not, alas ! for the last time, a specious watchword to the
passions of the assembly; and though the declamations of
Mirabeau no longer dignified the phrase by their hollow
eloquence, the theme was hotly and successfully pursued by
others, who covered their deficiencies with the mantle of
the prophet.
Before the Assembly proceeded to the order of the day,
La Fayette begged to point out to their notice the aide-de-
camp by whom he was attended at the bar.
“In presenting to you, gentlemen," said he," this young
soldier as the kinsman and namesake of your esteemed

colleague, Maximilien Valazy, the friend of the people and
undeviating opponent of their tyrants, I feel secure of in-
teresting your confidence in his execution of your com-
mands. I am about to despatch him officially on the route
to Mons, which appears the probable direction of the journey
of their majesties; claiming such assistance of the local
authorities as may best enable him to secure the persons of
the fugitives, without violating the respect due to a sove-
reign of the French nation."
- Two couriers were sent off in that direction nearly an
hour ago,” observed Pethion. " I should recommend the
road to Metz; as it is evident that the aristocrat Bouillé is
as a magnet by whose attraction we are likely to unearth the
royal fox which has escaped our vigilance.”
“ I have already despatched my senior aide-de-camp,
Monsieur Antoine de Romeuf, on the route to Metz,” ob-
served General La Fayette composedly.
“ The more reason,” retorted Pethion, “ for following
up his mission by that of the Capitaine Valazy. Romeuf is
known to be one of those idle Mirliflors, whose minds have
been polluted by the sorceries of the Circe of Versailles.
His secret inclinations towards the royal cause will not fail
to betray our own, unless we drive the nail into the block
by a second blow of the mallet. Let Valazy proceed with-
out further parley to Châlons.”
This opinion being confirmed by the general voice of the
Assembly, La Fayette delivered to Camille the instructions
which were to regulate his proceedings.
“ You will use your best expedition in a mission so cri-
tical; but I feel persuaded that your utmost haste will not
gain sufficient ground on the fugitives,” said he, glancing
from the clock suspended over the seat of the president to
the countenance of his aide-de-camp; and, as it appeared
to Valazy, with a look of peculiar significance. “Go, sir !"
he continued, resuming his usual air of stern authority,
“ I ain satisfied that you appreciate the importance of your
charge ; and that none of my instructions touching this
important affair will be forgotten or disregarded.”
On leaving the Assembly to proceed to its deliberations,
while he visited the château of the Tuilleries for further

investigation, La Fayette was greeted by the populace with
cries of disapprobation and vengeance, and Camille, and
one or two officers of his staff by whom he was accompa-
nied, attempted to surround his person with a view to his
defence, as he traversed the infuriated multitude. But the
general, with a smile of perfect self-possession, motioned
them from his side, and boldly advanced through the
hootings of the mob.
“ My friends !” said he, to those of the discontented
nearest to him, you are pleased to term the escape of
the king a national misfortune.
What would you say to
a counter-revolution calculated to destroy the liberty you
have acquired ?"*
The fickle crowd, lending to these expressions a more
extended implication than had been anticipated by the
speaker, now flew into an opposite extreme; and began to
hail the departure of Louis XVI. as an event auspicious to
their interests.
“We are at length freed from the Bourbon gang !” they
exclaimed, with renewed shouts in honour of their favourite
commander; while a portion of the populace even raised a
cry of “ Long live La Fayette; let him be our new king !
- Yes ! La Fayette shall be our king !”
The general, turning towards the vacillating crew with
an air of mingled compassion and indignation, exclaimed,
" And what have I done, my friends, to deserve your bad
opinion? How have I merited that you should hold me
worthy of no better office ?”
On this specious phrase, the citizens redoubled their
huzzas in his honour, and suffered him to proceed upon
his
way ;
while Valazy seized the opportunity to escape
for the execution of the important mission committed to
his charge.
Within an hour, Camille found himself galloping along
the road, which, alas ! full well he knew to have been taken
by the illustrious fugitives. But though resolved to inter-
pret the glance of La Fayette into a secret implication that
his haste upon the route to Metz need not be over-zealously
accelerated, he had the mortification to discover at each

succeeding relay, that the couriers despatched by the As-
sembly, as well as his coadjutor, Monsieur de Romeuf,
had outstripped him by nearly two hours, and that there
was little chance that the ponderous equipages of the Ba-
roness Von Korff could attain the frontier, before they were
overtaken and arrested.
Satisfied, therefore, that his mission would be infructuous
to the party it was intended to benefit, he found no motive
to overlook his personal fatigue and anxiety,
nor his
secret regret at being forced to abandon Paris under cir-
cumstances so fraught with danger to Madame de St. Flo-
rentin. Stung to the heart's core by the hauteur of her
demeanour towards him the preceding night, yet with a
lover's inconsistency adoring the hand upraised in scorn
against him, — Camille, as he urged his horse along the
stately avenues of the road to Meaux, thought more of the
perils and insults awaiting the unprotected Emiline from
the deputation of the Committee of Research, than of those
which the fugitive Bourbons had so rashly braved in their
escape from the Tuileries.
Depressed in body and mind, — and sinking under fa-
tigues to which he had been ill-accustomed by his recent
modes of life, -Valazy, towards night, could scarcely keep
on his saddle. His head grew dizzy, and his eyes appeared
to rest once more upon that waving sea of heads, whose
fierce undulations he had witnessed on the Place de la
Grève, and whose horrible imprecations seemed to ring in
Such such were the ruffians to whose ani.
mosity St. Florentin had dared bequeath his helpless wife
and children! Such the human fiends to whose vengeance
he had been himself compelled to abandon the idol of his
soul! The mere thought of the indignities to which she
had been perhaps already subjected, served like a spur to
his flagging haste. Having obtained the refreshment of a
cup of wine from a peasant proceeding home from his pro-
tracted labours in the vineyards, he pushed onwards with
renewed activity. But on reaching the post-house at Châ-
lons, he had the mortification to find, not only that the
preceding couriers had considerably gained upon him in the
hour of their arrival and departure, but that the equipages

of the royal travellers had excited no trifling degree of sus-
picion in their passage through the town. The post-masters
on the roads of Lorrain were so accustomed to the spec-
tacle of emigrants and fugitives, that they looked with
jealous inquiry upon every equipage bespeaking a family of
consideration taking the route to the frontier.
Valazy now perceived that all hope of escape was lost for
the royal family, unless, indeed, they had been so fortunate
as to secure a very active co-operation on the part of the
Marquis de Bouillé; a circumstance to which popular sus-
picion already pointed previous to his departure from Paris.
Yet it appeared to him, — judging from the trivial causes
which had combined to negative his own eager attempts to
obtain an interview with the Marquis de St. Florentin,
that some miserable fatality was attached to the undertak-
ing; and that notwithstanding the generous or politic mo-
deration of La Fayette, it would be as impossible to secure
the
progress of the measure, as it had proved to intercept
the attempt.
His misgivings were speedily realised.
On reaching
Pont de Somme Vesle, a post-station three leagues beyond
the town of Châlons, Valazy encountered upon the little
bridge which unites the cross road to Varennes with the
high road to Verdun, a messenger, taking his way at full
speed to Paris; who, at sight of an officer of the National
Guard, drew up to announce that the king and queen, or
as he called them, “Les royaux," had been arrested at
Varennes ! The person of his majesty had been recognised
by the light of a stable lantern intruded into the carriage
at St. Ménéhould by a man named Drouet, son to the post-
master, who had seen him at Paris the preceding year, on
the day of the Federation ; and who identified the coun-
tenance of his sovereign by the engraving on an assignat
which he drew from his pocket. After giving such instruc-
tions to the postilions as insured the impossibility of reach-
ing the post-horses despatched to Varennes from the oppo-
site station to carry them forward to Dun, Drouet followed
them on horseback. No escort was stationed for their
rescue; and he denounced them to the authorities of the
paltry town destined to be the scene of their betrayal !

the man,
The suspicions of the inhabitants of St. Ménéhould had
unfortunately been kept on the alert during two preceding
days, by the arrival of several detachments of dragoons,
such as were stationed by Bouillé in all the different post-
towns of the route between Châlons and Montmedy, on
pretext of escorting a waggon-load of specie from Paris ;
but which did not fail to direct the apprehensions of the
multitude to their real purpose. The troops commanded by
the Duc de Choiseul and the Marquis de Goguelas, who
were appointed to await the arrival of the king's equipage
at Pont de Somine Vesle, had, in fact, been compelled by
the insults of the mob to abandon their post; and, misled
by misrepresentations that a heavy travelling carriage of the
description they were taught to expect, had passed through
the village at an early hour of the morning, Goguelas con-
ducted his men back to Varennes through the woods of
Clermontois, leaving the field clear to the enemies of his
sovereign.
But are you sure," said Camille, eagerly interrogating
“ that it is really the king and queen you have
secured?"
“ Am I sure !” said the courier, indignantly.
it not my own good cousin, Drouet, who was beforehand
with them at Varennes, who summoned the National
Guard, - imprisoned Bouillé's rampaging dragoons in the
convent of the Cordeliers, where they were comfortably
roosted for the night; — and, with the help of Procureur
Sausse, the candle-maker, and Billaud, and half-a-dozen
other townsmen as well disposed as themselves, blocked up
the bridge with their market-carts against the passage of
Dame Korff's berline ? — Parbleu! not'ancien, ces gaillards
là were not of the sort to let the Capet family slip through
their fingers like a base half-crown.'
“And where did you leave their majesties?” inquired
Valazy, but too well convinced of the authenticity of his
account.
• The bourgeoise de Versailles was sipping coffee in
Madame Sausse's back shop; and in spite of the hootings
and howlings of the multitude gathered round the house,
trying to flatter old Sausse into conniving at their escape,

by praising the freshness of the eggs set before her for
breakfast, and protesting she adored the smell of tallow!
But la commère Sausse is no gudgeon to be fished up out
of the Meuse with such a bait, and
“ And the troops stationed in the town ?"
“ Are deafening the king and queen with shouts for
"la Nation.'
“I spoke of monsieur's dragoons, and the regiment of
royal hussars.”
“ Tudieu ! of whom else? I tell you Bouillé's dragoons
are shouting in honour of the nation as loudly as if they
wore an uniform of the same facings with your own. —
But I am loitering here, Sieur Capitaine, without thinking
of the packet I am to deliver from Procureur Sausse to
the commandant at Châlons; - for which I mean to carry
back in exchange a packet of assignats, in reward of my
diligence, – to say nothing of the little sip of cassis, with
which I must wash the dust from my throat in order to re-
count all these particulars to monsieur le maire at the Hôtel
de Ville."
This information was too detailed, and too conclusive, to
admit of distrust on Valazy's part. Fearful of implicating
the Marquis de St. Florentin, who had not been specified
by the courier as forming part of the royal cortège, he ab-
stained from making any inquiries which could involve his
name in the affair. But Camille did not doubt that the
husband of Emiline had shared the arrest of the Duc de
Choiseul and the Comte Charles de Damas, who had been
mentioned among the group of prisoners detained in the
mansion of the procureur syndic; and he thought with
horror and consternation of the penalty incurred by his
share in the plot. Previous to the departure of the
courier, Monsieur de Romeuf had arrived at Varennes, and
been compelled to deliver to the municipal officer the
official mandate of La Fayette, commanding the arrest of
the royal family, and their compulsory return to Paris.
But Valazy was aware that his young colleague entertained
the most enthusiastic confidence in the intentions and
powers of their common chief; and that in attempting
to assure the queen of the protection and security she

would derive from the guardianship of the commander-in-
chief of the National Guard, he was only expressing his
sincere conviction. He rejoiced, however, that the painful
duty of bearing this mandate had not been imposed on
himself. The reproaches of Madame de St. Florentin's
illustrious friend would have been deeply afflicting to his
heart ; nor could he have conscientiously uttered an assu-
rance of safety, where he was persuaded of the existence of
dangers of the darkest kind. The more fully he became
aware of La Fayette's desire to favour the escape of their
majesties, the more was he assured of impending dangers
yet unsuspected by the public.
But his own course ! How could he best reconcile his
official duties with his persuasion of the secret views of his
commanding officer, and the suggestions of his own grate-
ful predilections? - Suddenly recollecting the family con-
nection between Bouillé and La Fayette, he resolved to
make it a pretext for a private communication with the
former; and, instead of proceeding on the road to St.
Ménehould, struck off through the woods. Following the
track left by the squadrons on the preceding day, — he took
his way at full speed towards Dun, where he doubted not
to meet with further intelligence. He was persuaded that,
on the first alarm of the royal arrest, the Marquis de
Bouillé, with the regiment of Royal Allemand, and others
of approved fidelity from the camp recently formed at
Montmédy, would attempt the rescue of the king; and
resolving, on his own part, to suggest that the attack
should be made on the open road, rather than at St. Méné-
hould or Clermont, where the National Guards were
strongly interested in the popular cause, and disposed
against the military, he determined to lend his best efforts
to the undertaking.
“If I am mistaken in my interpretation of General La
Fayette's wishes,” thought he, “and even should the
attempt prove as abortive as every other measure connected
with the fortunes of the king and queen, I must push my
way to Metz, and over the frontier to Coblentz. At the
worst I can die ! — Perhaps she will scorn me less,
when she knows I have perished in the cause she loves !”

The sun rose upon his path, as Valazy pursued his way
through the forest road. Dashing the dew from the hazel-
bushes as he galloped along, he could perceive where the
detachment of dragoons had forced its progress, by the en-
tangled and fading wreaths of woodbine which had been
rent away, and the wild roses trampled under foot. Still,
notwithstanding these traces of recent passage, there was a
profound depth of verdure,-a tranquil and fragrant lone.
liness about the place, which, at any other moment,
would have induced him to loiter on his errand, and con-
trast the almost sacred stillness and purity of the scene,
with the fierce, tumultuous, and wearisome strife of the
gorgeous dwellings and agitated city he had left behind.
But he was urged on by an imperious duty, - even by
the hope of suspending an effusion of human blood !
Fortunately for Camille, the horse with which he had
been furnished at Pont de Somme Vesle was one of those
reserved for the service of the couriers; and he had every
expectation of reaching Dun by ten or eleven o'clock. But
on emerging from a stately grove terminating the wood-
lands of Clermont, with his eyes dazzled by the transition
from their shadowy verdure to the scorching sunshine of
the open fields, he perceived at some distance before him a
group of four or five dragoons riding from the high road
towards a creditable-looking farm-house ; – pausing occa-
sionally to reconnoitre, as if dodging some fugitive through
the meadows.
On approaching more closely, Camille, who had the
advantage of a rising ground to assist his observations,
perceived, at the distance of nearly a quarter of a mile,
the person of whom they were in pursuit; a horseman
mounted on a tired and wretched beast, who was skulk-
ing behind some hedge-rows, in a heathy covert of furze
and broom adjoining the garden of a farm.
Camille, conceiving that the person thus pursued must
be one of the couriers despatched from Varennes to Stenay,
dashed forward to elucidate the mystery; but in his course,
he suddenly found himself on the brink of a gravelly hollow,
channel of a deep and rapid current; and being
delayed by the difficulty of getting his horse across this

awkward pass, lost sight of all parties on regaining the
level of the meadows. The sound of shouts in the dis-
tance served, however, to pilot him onwards ; and on pass-
ing a screen of maple bushes, he suddenly checked his
horse, and as quickly spurred him to full speed again, on
perceiving that, in the very next meadow, the fugitive was
engaged in defending himself against a fierce attack on the
part of four soldiers, marauding stragglers belonging to
Lauzun's hussars. — The person encountering these fearful
odds was no other than the Marquis de St. Florentin !
Already, he had managed to disable two of his antagon-
ists, one of whom had fallen senseless, or perhaps dead,
to the ground. But it appeared to Valazy that the Marquis
himself sat feebly in his saddle, as if exhausted by his ex-
ertions. To dash forward, sword in hand, to his relief,
was the thought and work of a moment ! But ere he could
reach the spot and interpose his assistance with any effect,
the disabled dragoon, who had been wounded by St. Flo-
rentin with a desperate cut in the bridle-arm, drew out a
pistol; the flash of which traversed the eyes of Camille
just as he dealt a tremendous blow on the soldier with
whom St. Florentin was engaged.
Turning fiercely on the man by whom it was discharged,
he was about to prevent him from drawing a second from
his holster, when the dragoon struck down his sabre with
the butt of the pistol he still held, and instantly repeated
the stroke on the schakos of Camille, who, reeling dizzily
upon his horse, fell stunned and senseless to the earth !
Rapid as was the progress of these movements, St. Flo-
rentin with a hasty glance had recognised the brave defender
thus strangely and opportunely sent to his aid. But though
he had as quickly the mortification of seeing him fall,
and as he believed, mortally wounded, — the marquis
found in the pause occasioned by his startling intervention,
all the advantage he so much required, and had a moment
before believed unattainable. While preparing to close
with the only dragoon still capable of very active defence,
for the last of the four fled the field on Valazy's approach,-
he had the satisfaction to see a young peasant of the country
gallop on a cart-horse to the spot, and lay about him such

lusty blows with a huge blackthorn cudgel which he poised
in his hand as lightly as a riding-whip, that the two re-
maining soldiers took hastily to flight ; leaving their dying
comrade in evidence of the pusillanimous part they had
taken in the affray.
But alas ! this powerful reinforcement arrived to late!
- A pistol-ball had penetrated the shoulder of the Marquis
de St. Florentin ; and Antoine Marmin, the farming lad
who had so materially seconded his efforts, found some dif-
ficulty in sustaining him upon his saddle, while he persuaded
him to accept the shelter of the farm-house whose peaked
gables were visible through the screen of maple trees.
“ You will be safe at Boisgelin, noble sir !” said the
young man, on perceiving the decoration worn by St. Flo-
rentin, in case yonder thieves return with a reinforcement.
It is said that half the garrison of Stenay have declared in
favour of the nation, to the very teeth of the Marquis de
Bouillé; and I take it that the fellows with whom I found
you beset belong to these mutineers.”
“ Do you know the marquis, my good lad?” said St.
Florentin, as they entered the little court of the farm.
“ None better, sir. He has often stopped at Boisgelin
on his cross-road from Châlons, to take a cup of whey
from my mother, who has a famous name for it in the
country. - Holà ! Jean-Marie ! - Jacob !
Baptiste !
Bénoit! - help here
fly!” and while a tribe of rough-
looking fellows with blue smock-frocks and cotton-night-
caps rushed from the outhouses to perform the office of
grooms to the stranger and their young master, Antoine
carefully lifted him from his horse, and with some assist-
ance conveyed him into the house.
“ Mother, I have brought you a wounded gentleman,
half murdered by a cowardly band of the Stenay hussars,”
cried he.
“ Eh! Jésus Maria ! noť bon Sauveur, - what has hap-
pened ? — My Toinon, you are covered with blood !”
“ It is not mine, mother it is none of mine. But do
not stand parleying: tell me where shall I convey this
gentleman ? He grows faint, and I can scarcely support
him.”

" Here
this way !” cried Lison Marmin, recovering
her prompt address and presence of mind; and she eagerly
assisted to lay St. Florentin on her own state-bed, and to
bathe his temples and hands with vinegar, while he lay in
in his deathlike swoon.
As soon, however, as he recovered to some consciousness
of the direful events which had occurred, he persisted in
his inquiries of Antoine Marmin. - You know the com-
mander-in-chief, -you know Stenay; you seem a loyal
and well-intentioned lad ? ”
“I am, sir, — I do, sir ! But the Marquis de
Bouillé is not now at Stenay. He slept at Dun last
night.”
“ To Dun, then to Dun, my worthy fellow, with this
paper,
if
you
would win the weight of your head in gold,"
exclaimed the marquis, searching in the bosom of his vest
for a billet. “ It is gone - I must have lost it in the
struggle !” he faltered in a failing voice. But no matter !
Time presses.
See the Marquis de Bouillé, — tell him
the king is arrested at Varennes. Bid him fly to the
rescue! Say that his friend St. Florentin was murdered
by a cowardly gang belonging to his brigade, as he tra-
versed the by-ways of the country to bear him a few words
hastily traced by his majesty at the moment of his arrest,
imploring instant assistance. Tell him," continued the mar-
quis, with perplexed and languid utterance, “that our
cause is lost, unless through his exertions !
“ I would do your bidding, sir," interrupted the young
fellow, with a look of much concern,
“ both for the good
king's sake God help him ! and your own.
But we
have not horse or colt left in the stable of Boisgelin. My
father is gone on brown Jocrisse to the market at Stenay ;
and I have sent off Baptiste on the brood mare to fetch
the surgeon of Briqueshen!”
“ Great God ! how unlucky ! faltered St. Floren-
tin. - All then is over! Alas! for Louis and my
country!”
Lison implored her unfortunate guest to compose him-
self, while she attempted to stanch the blood that welled

in frightful quantities from his wound, increasing the pain-
ful dizziness of his frame.
" It matters not,” said he, with a mournful smile. “ The
surgeon whom you have so unluckily sought on my ac-
count will tell you, if worth his errand, that I shall not see
the rising of another sun !
And Lison, with tears streaming down her face, recol-
lected this melancholy foreboding when she composed the
limbs of the unfortunate Marquis de St. Florentin for the
grave, before the dawn of the following day!

CHAPTER I.

As may beseem some well reputed page;
Yet tell me, first, how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me, it will make me scandalised.
Two Gentlemen of Verona.
Meanwhile, Madelon,' even in the tranquil valley of
Manoir, was not without her alarms. Content to be a
keeper at home from January to December, she was too
happily occupied in reclaiming her garden from the ruinous
neglect into which it had fallen, and in establishing the
details of her farm, under the care of a worthy automaton,
named Tonton, acting as her prime minister, to seek for ex-
ternal amusement. A stroll along the meadows by the side
of the Lianne, or an evening gossip with monsieur le curé
in the apartments of Manoir, handsomely furnished by her
son in order to pacify her regrets for the burnished walnut-
wood presses of Grand Moulin, - - varied the uneventful
monotony of her existence.
But in the middle of the month of June, a letter from
Camille enabled Madelon to greet her reverend visiter, one
evening, with an air of mingled ecstasy and mystery. In-
stead of conducting him, as usual, into the saloon, she
invited him, with a significant air, to retain his three-
cornered beaver, and take a stroll with her through the
river meadows or in the great avenue ; and as soon as she
attained a safe distance from the house, Madelon, with a
thousand injunctions of secrecy and discretion, placed in
the hands of the mystified old gentleman a letter from
Camille ; acquainting her that her foster-child he used
no other designation with her two children, would arrive
at Manoir in the course of a day or two, under the care of

Laporte ; and that for better security they were to pass by
his name, and in the character of his family. He further
desired her to apply to the good curé for advice and as-
sistance in
any crisis concerning the interests of her beloved
guests.
“ I need not bid you be tender of them, mother," said
he, in conclusion ; “for well I know that your own Ca-
mille has no dearer place in your affections than those
whom the chances of these evil times thus strangely enable
you to welcome under your roof. For myself, I can
scarcely guess at what distant period I may hope to visit
Manoir ; but be assured, that
every moment of
my
absence
is devoted to the service of those you love, and to the in-
terests of my unhappy country.”
The curé who, during the residence of Madame Valazy
at the farm of Manoir, had become acquainted with
the busy activity of her hospitality, especially in the fussy
zeal of kindness with which she was wont to welcome his
own accidental visits, was astonished to find how little she
was disposed, on the present occasion, to devote herself to
household preparations for the arrival of her noble visiters.
She had not failed, in the course of many a preceding hour
of gossip, to impress upon his mind every incident and
circumstance within her knowledge, relating to the united
families of Navelles and St. Florentin. He was as fully
sensible as she could desire of the aristocratic importance
of the old duke, - of the devoted loyalty of his son-in-
law, - and the thousand excellences and charms of the
marchioness; and being equally conscious of the en-
thusiastic devotion of Madelon to them and theirs, expected
to see the little household at Manoir thoroughly disor-,
ganised by officious labours of preparation for their re-
ception.
But he was mistaken; Madelon could do nothing but
laugh, and cry. Her beloved child was in peril ! - Ma-
dame la marquise was about to seek shelter - safety
peace, in her humble dwelling; madame la marquise and
the dear babes would once more embrace her - once more
cling round her neck ; - madame la marquise had pro-
mised to make Manoir her home - to live with her till

-
happier times to accept her services, her substance, her
whole heart's devotion !” — and, in the painful joy of
such a triumph, Madelon forgot for the first time to in.
terest herself in the quality of her soup, or the texture of
her homespun linen !
At length, in the exhaustion of her spirits, even these
details claimed their share in her consideration; and the
curé, on quitting her, after an eager charge to be pru-
dent in his mode of announcing in the village the expected
arrival of his parishioner’s Parisian kinswoman, Madame
Laporte, with her father and children, a charge which
had been more advisedly enforced on Madame Valazy's
personal observance, - beheld her eagerly engage in those
hospitable efforts towards insuring the comfort of her be-
loved guests, which her emotion served to retard ; and
which the clumsy attempts of the elated Tonton did not
much assist in forwarding.
On the morrow, however, all at Manoir was in its most
orderly array ; - all was swept and garnished. - The
sanded walks of the little garden were raked over;
- the
sanded floors of the chambers newly sprinkled ;
of the yellow carnations were culled, and placed on the
toilet-table prepared for the marchioness; while the
silken coverlid quilted by her own fair hands for Madelon's
couch was spread over that appropriated to the children.
At an early hour, Madame Valazy, attired in her costume
of etiquette, a black silk négligé and close cap of plaited
Valenciennes lace, stationed herself at the head of the
Manoir avenue; and not a cart, waggon, or chaise, ap-
peared in the distance of the Paris road, but she eagerly
waved her handkerchief to Tonton and his wife to throw
open the gates of the court-yard, to the utter confusion of
the bantams and turkeys, and the final mortification and
disappointment of their anxious mistress.
Evening brought back monsieur le curé and his in-
quiries, - but no Emiline ! The night was passed in
fruitless watching; and when morning arrived, it again
brought back monsieur le cure with something more im-
portant than inquiries;- intelligence of the escape of the
royal family, — which had been communicated to the

commandant at Calais by telegraphic despatch, and spread
rapidly through the environs. Aware, from the rumours
of the daily journals, as well as from Madame Valazy's
explanations, of the close connection subsisting between the
St. Florentin family and the royal house of Bourbon, the
curé could not but trace to this public event Camille's
previous announcement of the marchioness's design to visit
Manoir ; and persuading himself that their majesties had
in all probability followed a similar route after their escape
from Paris, his anxiety in behalf of those persecuted so-
vereigns for whom his days were spent in prayer, and his
nights in sorrow, became almost uncontrollable.
He now lent an eager ear to Madame Valazy's diffuse
details respecting every carriage (and she had amply
qualified herself for the task of description) which had
traversed the Calais road on the preceding day; and having
turned his old pony's head towards Condette, ascended
the tedious paths of the adjoining sand-hills, in order to
ascertain what vessels had profited by the early tide to quit
the harbour of the Lianne; and what facilities were
afforded by wind and weather to the passage of the illus-
trious fugitives towards a happier shore. - But the Curé
Blaisel's investigations availed him little. On the Calais
road he beheld, like sister Anne, nothing but a cloud of
and on the glossy surface of the sea, only its usual
little fleet of fishing-boats, gradually dispersing over the
waves ; whose calm mirror served to reflect their naked
masts, and close-furled sails, seeking no aid from the
breathlessness of the summer atmosphere. — But not a

tunate Louis XVI. and his family!
Another night- another day- brought no intermission
to Madame Valazy's anxieties; and she would have wil-
lingly found her way to Paris on foot, could she but have
ascertained that no personal disaster had occurred to inter-
cept the journey of Emiline, or cause the silence of Ca-
mille. The curé, acquainted with the arrest of the royal
family, shared, with earnest sympathy, her apprehensions ;
but by his se counsels he deterred her from attempting
a thousand incoherent projects, by which she promised
dust;

herself to obtain the intelligence she coveted; repre-
senting to her the dangers likely to accrue to her son and
to the St. Florentins, from the possible betrayal of their
projected flight through her inquiries.
At length, one night, towards the close of the month of
June, about a week after the receipt of Camille's letter of
announcement, Tonton, who had been despatched as usual
to the weekly market at Samer to procure provisions for the
family at Manoir, brought back a proclamation of the Na-
tional Assembly, setting forth that Péthion, Barnave, and
Latour Maubourg, had been sent in deputation by the As-
sembly to bring back the royal family to the Tuileries, as
state prisoners. But while Madame Valazy was perusing
a document so calculated to aggravate her alarms, a low tap
at the window of the apartment suddenly diverted her at-
tention from the paper she held in her hands.
On a repetition of the signal, Madelon opened a door
leading into the garden, and peered out through the twi.
light to ascertain who might be the intruder; when she
perceived a young peasant standing on the flower-bed be-
neath the window of the room she had just left. Madelon
instantly began to scream an angry defence of her yellow
carnations, to warn the thoughtless trespasser from the spot;
when coming hastily towards her, with an air and gesture
very different from those of the clumsy boor she had ex-
pected to find in such a dress, and such a position, the
stranger implored her to moderate her voice and her re-
sentment, making eager signs of secrecy and confidence.
Instantly connecting this mysterious arrival with the ab-
sence of her beloved marquise, she motioned in her turn
that the youth should follow her into the house ; where she
hastened to withdraw the exterior keys from the locks of
her sitting-room, and to close the jalousies, so that the
candle-light within might reveal nothing passing in the
chamber towards the garden entrance.
Having thus secured the apartment on all sides, Madame
Valazy turned towards her youthful visiter ; who, to her
surprise, had thrown himself unbidden into a chair, and sat
covering his face with his hands.
“ You are weary, mon enfant !” said Madelon in a

kindly voice; for she now perceived tbat the intruder was
little more than a child. “You are weary, — let me fetch
you some refreshments,
“ No !” said the boy, detaining her with a familiar
hand. “ No! do not stir — do not leave me, Madame
Valazy! - Do you not recognise me?”
Madelon, fairly puzzled, looked on the slender figure of
the young Picard, attired in the fustian blouse or smock-
frock of the country, belted round the waist with a leathern
girdle ; while the black curls, now released, by the removal
of a serge cap, fell profusely over his forehead, and half
concealed his pale and care-worn face. There was some-
thing in the countenace half familiar to Madelon's recol-
lection ; but when she strove to amend her observations and
retrace the remembrance, the quivering lips and tearful
eyes of the boy besought a suspension of her scrutiny, and
betrayed the mystery.
“ Ciel !” she exclaimed, advancing towards her guest,
“impossible ; – quite impossible ! - and yet, surely I am
not mistaken, — surely I am speaking to Mademoiselle
Delplanque ? Dame! — I was going to make a strange
mistake!” and Madelon, provoked to find her hopes dis-
appointed of obtaining intelligence of the Marquise de St.
Florentin, was far from courteous in her welcome to the
young mercière ; while Euphroisine, readily perceiving a
coolness on the part of her hostess, and attributing it to the
unseemly disguise in which she had made her appearance
at Manoir, began to weep bitterly.
Now Madelon had never accustomed herself to witness
unmoved this weakness of her sex; and no sooner did Eu-
phroisine's tears begin to fall, than she recalled her especially
to remembrance in two capacities, equally interesting to her
prejudices, as a protegée of Madame de St. Florentin,
and as the reputed fiancee of her son ; and though she
could not perceive that either the one or the other afforded
a pretext for Mademoiselle Delplanque to run about the
country in masquerade, she insisted on attempting to re-
store her visiter's composure with a glass of wine, or a glass
of water ; hoping gradually to arrive at the solution of the
enigina.

Unfortunately, however, she tempered her hospitality
with reiterated inquiries concerning Monsieur, her good
father;"— a name which served to renew poor Euphroi-
soine's distress, without procuring further explanation of
the mystery.
“ The poor silly old man is certainly dead,” thought
Made-on ;
“ and the young lady bis daughter has lost her
senses in consequence. Perhaps she has come to tell me
she has now no protector, and to ask a home at Manoir ;
or perhaps, to demand my consent to her marriage with my

somely towards her in her misfortunes; for she is a pretty

“ Ma fi! — I am just now lost in a world of wonder. I

“ Have you heard nothing from Paris ? '
“ Last week, Mademoiselle Jacquot that is
- Last week you received a letter from your son, an-
nouncing the probable arrival of our friend -
“ I did, I did !” cried Madelon, with renewed hopes of
obtaining information relative to her darling child. "I
did! but the time passes ; and I hear nothing further
from either of them. Are you come to give me tidings of
them ? — The king and queen are taken; but the mar-
chioness! tell me, I beseech you, that my dear lady is
safe? ” — And Madelon, hitherto so frigid in her de-
meanour towards her disguised visiter, now approached her
with tears in her eyes; and seizing her hands, appeared to
hang upon Euphroisine's reply to her inquiries.
“ Madame la marquise is for the present safe,” replied
Mademoiselle Delplanque, in a subdued tone: then, throw-
ing herself into Madame Valazy's arms, and resting upon
her shoulder in an agony of tears, she exclaimed in broken

6. Your son is wounded. The Marquis de St. Florentin
has fallen a victim to his exertions in the royal cause.
Their majesties are once more prisoners in the hands of
their persecutors !”
This last piece of intelligence, which the enthusiastic
Euphroisine had reserved as the acmé of her overwhelming
tidings, fell far more lightly upon the heart of the good
Madelon than her previous information. Emiline, a
broken-hearted widow ; Camille, wounded and unfor-
tunate! She had no fortitude to endure this twofold
stroke of affliction. It was Euphroisine who now found
it necessary to devote her attentions to the consolation of
her hostess.
“But I do not understand,” said Madame Valazy at
length, drying her tears, and looking round as if to collect
her bewildered faculties, —“I do not understand how you
became commissioned to acquaint me with these disasters.
Do you arrive from Paris ? ”
« From Arras.”
“ And my Camille is at Arras ? So near me! yet to
leave me in ignorance of his danger.”
“ Pardon me, madame

Euphroisine pressed her hand, as if to thank her for the
first gracious word uttered during their conference ; then
reseating herself, resumed her explanation.

nearly two months since my father, alarmed by the inter-
ference of the agents of the provisional government, com-
pelled me to quit Paris, and establish myself for a time at
Arras - his native place - among

sine were appointed in the province of Artois or the
Quartier du Marais. “ Pardon me, it was of the mar-
chioness and of my son you promised me tidings.”
- You desired me, at the same time, to acquaint you
with the manner in which they had reached me,” replied
Euphroisine, with something of petulance in her air;
“probably from some misgiving as to their authenticity.”
“ Again, and again – forgive me !” said poor Madelon.
“ I am harassed alarmed impatient. Forgive me!
I will not again interrupt you. — Misgivings? - Dame!
- would I could entertain any doubt of your veracity.
But

Compelled by my father to quit Paris without ac-
quainting Madame de St. Florentin or your son with my
departure, — and dreading that my absence might prove a
serious inconvenience to their plans and perhaps an aggra-
vation of danger to the most beloved and unfortunate of
queens — I addressed a letter some days ago to the intend-
ant
Monsieur Laporte
“Ah! the good Laporte ! — the faithful servitor of my
precious lady
“ Imploring him to grant me such particulars of the
state of their affairs as, without compromising others,
might serve to relieve my overpowering anxieties.”
Madelon nodded an impatient acquiescence.
“ His reply, — which I caused him to despatch to the
hands of a third person, so as to escape the indiscreet
examination of my poor father, — reached me last night ;-
containing, in a few hurried lines, a statement that the
Marquis de St. Florentin, having accompanied the flight of
their majesties, and been attacked by a party of Bouillé's
revolted dragoons, had fallen under their hands; while
the son of our excellent Madelon,' continued Laporte, ‘in
attempting to defend him, was sorely wounded by a sabre
cut, and still lies on a bed of sickness at a farm-house
between Dun and Stenay.'
“ Alas, alas !” interrupted Madelon. “ It was in behalf
of his noble foster-sister, then, that my brave Cainille en-
countered his danger! And my poor bereaved lady ! how

does she bear up against the loss of her husband ? — My
poor dear Emiline.”
A slight expression of surprise was extorted from Made-
moiselle Delplanque, on observing that a mother could for
a moment forget the danger of an only son, in favour of
the afflictions of a person to whom she was bound by the
vulgar tie of menial service. But Euphroisine, amiable
and feminine as she was, had not reached the period of ma-
turity which could enable her to estimate the force of af.
fection existing between a woman and the infant she has
nourished at her bosom; and was born half a century too
late to appreciate the intensity of feudal attachment uniting
the loyal vassal with the heir of his master's house.
“ Madame de St. Florentin,” continued she, “has not
been left to the indulgence of her personal afflictions. This
is no time for a faithful subject of France to sit by his own
hearth, selfishly lamenting his private sorrows.
The mar-
quis, by his noble devotion to the cause of his sovereign,
was at least enabled to bequeath to his widow the glorious
privilege of having suffered, and of suffering, in their
cause.
There was an excess of magnanimity in this view of the
case, which poor Madelon regarded as highly superfluous.
She had no patience that Emiline should be made a
martyr, even in a cause so legitimate as that of the Bour-
bons.
“ Ah!
poor child !” she exclaimed, wringing her hands,
“ lonely in her wretchedness, in that melancholy barrack
of an hotel ! Monsieur le Duc, decrepit and infirm, inca-
pable of assisting her, — her noble brother in Italy! Why
was not her poor old nurse by her side, to comfort and
assist her? Do you remember, mademoiselle, how gra-
ciously she condescended to watch by my son Camille, when
ah! why am not I by her side to comfort and assist
her?
And who watches by your son, think you, during his
present season of suffering ?”
My son is strong in mind, and strong in body!
Camille is capable of bearing his own defence, and of wres-
tling with his destiny. But Emiline - my poor dear lady!

- did I understand you rightly that since the loss of the
marquis, she had been subjected to some fresh trial
new affliction ?
“On the discovery of Monsieur de St. Florentin's share
in the escape of their majesties, his hotel was subjected to
an official visit; his papers were placed under the seal of
the Assembly, and the constables of the municipal body were
stationed in guardianship of his property from the excesses
of the infuriated populace.”
" But the marchioness - the dear children?

“He might have written to me, or to the good curé,

deared to you both. I am now, Madame Valazy, on my
way to Paris
You, mademoiselle ?” said Madelon, glancing signifi-
cantly at her dress.
"Ay! in this disguise, which insures me impunity from
the worst perils besetting the path of an unprotected woman.
My desire to fulfil the commands of Laporte, and invite
your own in return, induced me to turn from my way to
execute his commission.”
“ And your father?” mechanically inquired the dis-
tracted Madelon ; too much engrossed by her afflictions to
perceive that the hitherto pallid countenance of Euphroi-
sine Delplanque reddened even to scarlet at this interro-
gation.
“My father,” she replied in a more subdued voice, " by
tendering too dearly, in a former instance, the safety of his
daughter, is perhaps the remote cause of the present peril
of the royal family of France, of the miserable bereave-
ment of the widow of St. Florentin, — of the danger and

ments of reprehension at this bold assertion on the part of
a young, obscure, and feeble woman. “ No matter! it
was his part to care for his own safety, and that of his
child !”
“ And has he consented to your re-encounter with the
mischiefs proceeding yonder in that vile city ?
“I have not ventured to incur the crime of disobedience,
by requiring his acquiescence. I have escaped from home,
Madame Valazy, bequeathing my father to the consolation
of his family, and the blessing of Heaven. - I am bound
to Paris ! — If it please God to render me instrumental in
his holy works of mercy, I trust he will also deign to in-
cline my father's heart to forgiveness of my first offence
against his will.”
“ Oui dà !” said Madelon, devoutly crossing herself at
this invocation to the Almighty. “ When things come
round,—and monsieur le curé assures me that Providence
and our Lady in their own good time will bring all things
square again, - no doubt Monsieur Delplanque will esteem
himself a lucky man, if his daughter should have been in-
strumental in assisting the noble descendants of the house
of Navelles.”
At any other moment, Euphroisine would have been
provoked to smile at the narrow limits of action assigned
by poor Madelon to her exertions ; at the prejudices
which elevated Emiline de St. Florentin of Navelles so
much above Marie Antoinette of France in her estimation,
“ And now, farewell !" said she, rising from her seat,
and drawing back the scattered locks on her pale forehead.
• I have a guide waiting for me in the avenue, to conduct
me back to Samer, whence I shall reach Paris in some
public conveyance."
“ Not so !” said Madelon, the tears gathering anew in

“ It is not for me to combat your intentions,” replied
Mademoiselle Delplanque coldly. “ The tie which binds
me to Paris is peremptory and immediate: it brooks no
delay – nay! scarcely even that I have lavished on my
visit to Manoir. But suffer me, madame,

are unloosed upon their steps ?”.
My children !” - murmured Madelon with a sigh.
“ Yes, your children !" replied Euphroisine, with much
dignity of expression. “ The changes of national opinion
- the noble exertions of Camille — and, above all, the
equalising hand of misfortune - may thus unite their
names without offence to either. But I waste my time,-
I waste my words,” – she continued, struggling as if with
some secret emotion. “ Remain here, Madelon ! -
For
their sake — for your own - remain here ; and trust to
me for immediate intelligence respecting all who are dear
to you."

Madelon stood wringing her hands in all the bewilderment
of contending distresses ; when suddenly returning, Made-

CHAPTER II.
I know I love in vain -- strive against hope ;
Yet in this captious and untenable sieve,

EUPAROISINE, on arriving alone and unprotected in the
capital, under the costume and designation of Jacquot La-
voine, had the affliction of learning in the obscure inn she
selected for her abode, that their majesties, since their com-
pulsory return to the Tuileries, were regarded as prisoners
to the nation, and in that capacity consigned to the safe
keeping of La Fayette. — But while this intelligence re-
doubled her anxieties for the queen and royal family, she
entertained sanguine hopes of softening, by the devotion
of her services, those harsh trials which more efficient
hands had been unable to divert; and was saddened, not
overwhelmed, by the perils of her own position.
Aware of the impossibility of approaching the Tuileries

at such a crisis, - the public being now scrupulously ex-
cluded from the gardens at the hours selected by the royal
family for taking the air, and no strangers admitted within
the château without an order signed by three commission-
ers of the Assembly and countersigned by La Fayette,
she presented herself on the day following her arrival, at
the Hôtel St. Florentin ; and had the satisfaction of ascer-
taining the efficacy of her disguise in the careless harshness
with which she was received by the Swiss. The poor old
man's temper had been strangely tried during the period
the hotel was invested by the officers of the legislative
body; and though the seals were now removed and the
insolent agents of the Assembly withdrawn, he had not
forgotten that his master's house had been dishonoured,
his master's wife and children rescued by flight from the
minions of the law; — while his noble master himself,
the young, brilliant, and gallant Marquis de St. Florentin,
was consigned by an obscure sword to an unhonoured
grave !-- Poor old Boris could not endure to be questioned
on topics necessitating a recurrence to these afflicting events;
and it was with some difficulty Euphroisine succeeded in
ascertaining that the marchioness was still residing with
the Duc de Navelles at Florincthun, near Meaux ; — and
that the best medium of seeking a communication with
the family was through her cousin, the Chevalier de Mire-
poix.
It was only in the capacity of Jacquot the Picard pea-
sant, seeking service in the capital with the claim of cousin-
ship upon the old steward, that Euphrosine obtained even
this scanty intelligence; nor was she inclined to amend her
information through an audience of Mirepoix ; who, having
frequently noticed her, in attendance on his lovely kins-
woman and in the antechamber of Madame Thibaut, might
perhaps detect her through her disguise, and misjudge the
motives originating her rash enterprise. She proceeded
therefore to Florincthun, deeply grieved to quit Paris with-
out obtaining any definite knowledge of the condition of
those illustrious beings to whose service she had devoted so
much that is dear to the heart of woman.
On this ground, however, she had still a trial to en-

counter. Old Laporte, though at the beginning of their
melancholy interview, he wept upon her neck and blessed
her for the zealous loyalty of her heart, was the first to
rebuke poor Euphroisine for the unseemly attire she had
assumed, and to remind her that where there is disguise,
there is generally both guilt and shame. But Mademoiselle
Delplanque satisfied herself by meeting her old friend's
reproof in silence; without repenting her own precipitancy,
or projecting any change in her measures.
“I knew your mother, child !” said he. “ Your mother,
who was in the suite of her royal highness the dauphine,
was regarded as one of the loveliest and most virtuous
women belonging to the palace. You are sca
carcely her
inferior in beauty, you have hitherto rivalled the excellence
of her reputation. Let it not be forfeited, my poor Eu-
phroisine, by running about the country in strange dis-
guises.”
“Alas, alas !” cried Mademoiselle Delplanque, “ I know
that I am hazarding my good name in this arduous enter-
prise ; but I did not dream, that a good, kind, generous
old friend like yourself, would be the first to upbraid me.”
“ Nay,” said the old steward, touched by the tears of
vexation streaming on the cheeks of Euphroisine, " I meant
not to distress you. Be a good girl, and all will be well.
You are a favourite with madame la marquise, and perhaps
who knows? - with some who are still higher and
nobler. Besides, you are the sole inheritor of your father's
gains. You have a face and figure which would have
made themselves heard of in the saloons of Versailles ; – and
in good time, after all these troubles and tumults are ended,
madame la marquise will no doubt deign to interest her-
self in procuring you a suitable husband ; — the son of
Monsieur Armand perhaps,
or my own nephew, the
young notary at Rouen.'
Euphroisine bore these affronting reprimands and con-
descensions with patience. - She was far more moved by
the astonishing and fatal blindness with which the royalists,
their households, and dependents, allowed themselves to
anticipate a speedy termination of the revolutionary dis-
turbances of the country. Though the monarchy was vir-

tually at an end, and the kingdom unreservedly subjected to
the control of its National Guard, and fluctuating form of
government, they persisted in believing that things would
return to their original condition; and that, with the ex-
ception of a few obsolete abuses, the ancien régime would
be eventually restored.
But this persuasion did not, and could not, exist with
the Marchioness de St. Florentin. The past could not be
restored her, nor the pleasures of the world knit anew
around her heart their early captivations. — He was gone,
the friend — the beloved ; - the husband of her youth
the father of her children ! He had laid down his life
in the cause; and it appeared to Emiline an immaterial
triumph that it should be crowned with ultimate success.
- Even the intensity of her maternal tenderness failed to
console her in a crisis of so much anguish. She fancied
that but for her children, she should have shared the enter-
prize the perils — the sufferings the death of St. Flo-
rentin ; that she should have been spared the long dreary
waste of desolate existence she now beheld extended before
her. Then gazing on the innocent countenances of her
little girls,
of her Emiline and Aglaë, a sudden recoil
on herself acknowledged their resemblance to their father
their claims on her affection; till, folding them again and
again in convulsive embraces, she no longer refused to be
comforted ! They were his and they were hers. - Was
not the potency of such a tie sufficient to bind her to the
cheerful and patient endurance of her widowed wretched-
ness ?
In such a mood as this, Euphroisine obtained access to
her presence.
Now that the fatal deprivation she had un-
dergone rendered the future malice of Mademoiselle Flavie
a matter of contempt to Madame de St. Florentin, that
treacherous ingrate had been hastily dismissed the establish.
ment; and Emiline, restored to the indulgence of holding
unmolested conference with her friends, anticipated in an
interview with Euphroisine the gratification of talking of
St. Florentin ; and hearing a tribute of reverential respect
to his memory, such as his devotion to the unfortunate
princes of his native land so well deserved.

Of them, however, Emiline felt little inclination to dis-
Profoundly engrossed by the duties and affec-
tions of her sex, she was endowed with no heroic exaltation
of character ; and her cruel bereavement had estranged all
her enthusiasm from a cause, in whose behalf her best and
dearest had been torn from her heart. But though Laporte
had obtained her unreluctant consent that Euphroisine
should be introduced into her presence, when the sympa-
thising girl really approached her, the new-made widow
hid her averted face in her black garments, and felt the
anguish of her sorrow painfully renewed by the observation
of a new witness. Her little girls were playing at her feet,
and she snatched them up, and kissed them tenderly, as if
to re-invigorate her fortitude.
Euphroisine !” said she, extending her hand to Ma-
demoiselle Delplanque, who respectfully raised it to her
lips, “ these are heavy-heavy times for us !- How fares
it with your father — with yourself ? — It is very long
since we met, Euphroisine ; you quitted us abruptly; and
your absence and silence were a source of strange mis-
givings. Yet, believe me, I never distrusted your inten-
tions, nor did he ; for he was generous and candid as truth
itself, Euphroisine, and could appreciate the generosity and
loyalty of others.”
Mademoiselle Delplanque, satisfied that nothing would
afford greater relief to the sorrows of the unfortunate mar-
chioness than to give them undisturbed utterance, did not
attempt to pacify the excess of her lamentations.
“ He always said your departure was compulsory ;-
just as Laporte has now confirmed his opinion by an ex-
planation of your father's exercise of authority. Yet he
would never allow me to write and question you, nor en-

so dear to him. He persisted that we had no right to
influence the conduct, and compromise the safety of so
young
and
prosperous a person as yourself. He reminded
me, Euphroisine, that you were motherless; and that I
should not act the part of a woman and a Christian ino-
ther, by inducing you into the perilous paths in which our
own destinies were appointed.”

reputation of a nice and sensitive honour. That he deigned
to exert it in my favour, is only an instance of his benefi.
cence to one of the humblest of his coadjutors.”
• Nay, dear Euphroisine !—St. Florentin considered you
not in so lowly a point of view. He has often reminded
me that, by the untiring zeal of your services to our un-
happy sovereign, you had rendered yourself equal to the
noblest of his loyal subjects. He bad me love you, and
cherish you; and had not my affection outstripped his com-
mands, Heaven knows with what eagerness I should now
labour to fulfil the smallest injunction of my husband.”
Again Mademoiselle Euphroisine imprinted a kiss on the
extended hand of Madame de St. Florentin.

persuasiveness. “ Heaven has not abandoned you !-
Heaven has not decreed your total bereavement. — My lord

“Ah! Euphroisine,” interrupted Madame de St. Flo-
rentin, who could have anticipated that my old grey-
headed father would survive to witness the sacrifice of his
young and ardent nephew — of his beloved son-in-law ?
Who would have predicted that the venerable Duc de Na-
velles, in inspiring the heart of my St. Florentin with such
enthusiastic sentiments of devotion to his anointed sovereign,
was digging a grave beneath his feet?”
“ And bequeathing to his children and their posterity a
deathless remembrance of his worthiness !- Nay, madam
- repine not that you have surrendered a hero to his
country.”
“ Not so, my poor child !” interrupted the marchioness.
“ I have sacrificed my brave husband to the obstinate
blindness of a faction, and a chimera of the divine right of
kings, which my heart misgives me to be delusive. What
can I call my country, if not the voice of the French
people? --- and is it not loudly uplifted against this luckless,
this fatal cause ?
How, madam!”-exclaimed Euphroisine, reddening
with astonishment and indignation ; are their majesties so
unfortunate as to have forfeited even the support of the

descendants of the most loyal subjects of their realm ?
Oh! do not repeat those words !” continued the young en-
thusiast, throwing herself at the feet of Madame de St.
Florentin, and eagerly clasping her hands ; “ do not, do
not repeat them! Till the bewilderment of grief shall have
relaxed its influence over your mind, do not suffer yourself
to reflect upon a subject, on which you cannot now decide
cor feel impartially.”
“ Blind enthusiasm !”– replied Madame de St. Floren-
tin, mournfully waving her head. Euphroisine, it is
yourself who are misled by prejudices; it is from my own
eyes that the veil has been withdrawn !- Heaven, in desert-
ing the cause of the Bourbons, in leaving them helpless in
the hands of their enemies, has given a sign for our instruc-
tion that the Divinity has withdrawn himself from the Ark
of the Covenant ; that a new order of things will be
sanctioned by the interposition of Providence.”
Mademoiselle Delplanque, conceiving that the intellect of
Emiline was touched by her misfortunes, forbore to oppose
any argument to opinions which she believed to be the in-
coherent ravings of a disordered understanding. Rising
from her knees, and leaning on the cabinet by which the
Marchioness de St. Florentin had been seated on her en-
trance, she stood in mournful contemplation of the human
wreck before her eyes.
Though the marchioness was not attired in the formal
array of widowhood, her suit was of the deepest mourning,
and the importunate hair was gathered out of sight, beneath
the long black veil in which she was enveloped, — excepting,
indeed, one or two disordered tresses, which escaped from
their confinement, and hung loosely, and without grace,
round her beautiful countenance. Her brow, her hands,
her long slender throat, were of the transparent whiteness
which fasting and incessant vigils naturally produce. But
her cheeks were not pale ; they appeared, on the contrary, to
be scorched into fever by the bitter grief which had corroded
their delicate texture; and this unnatural radiance of com-
plexion imparted a wild and wandering expression to those
clear blue eyes whose silken lashes were moistened by recent
tears. Euphroisine thought she had never before seen Ma-

dame de St. Florentin look so lovely. She would have given
worlds to restore her to a better frame of mind, by the
alleviation of her afflictions.
“ No, Euphroisine !” said she ; “ I am not distracted 3
- nor, if I rightly interpret the inspirations of Heaven,
am I even deceived. Easy, indeed, is it to deceive our.
selves among the banquets of the luxurious, among the
festivities of the vain and the frivolous, - the tumult of
crowded theatres, — the flatteries of a brilliant court:
among those gorgeous scenes in which I was reared, and in
which my martyred husband conceived his trust in the de-
legated rights of kings, and the nullity of the popular voice !
But when we are snatched from these wanton indulgen-
cies, when we wrestle face to face with danger and death,
when we find the inortal portion of our existence ebbing to
its close and the cold reality of the grave gaping at our feet,
then, Euphroisine, then do we search diligently into the
depths of our hearts, and assure ourselves that the divinities
enshrined therein are not vain idols, to crumble from our
grasp in the hour of danger! - Under the consciousness of
our immortal responsibilities, we seek after the truth, Eu-
phroisine ! _We divest our opinions of all human preju-
dice ; we behold them clear from conventional disguise ;
we see them as we believe they will appear before the
scrutiny of an omnipotent tribunal!”.
Mademoiselle Delplanque drew near to listen ; for though
her feelings and belief were circumscribed within the nar.
row limit of unqualified devotion to the House of Bourbon,
she could not but be impressed by the energetic eloquence
of Madame de St. Florentin. When her visit had been
announced to the marchioness, Emiline was occupied in
that dearest and most sacred task of affliction, a review of
the tokens of affection, — the recorded vows - the letters
- the pledges
the braided tress the ring of betroth-
ment, - bestowed on her by her lost husband. The cabinet
on which Euphroisine was leaning, was the depository of
these treasures of her affection ; treasures amassed from
her very childhood,— treasures evincing the gradual progress
of attachment between the two noble cousins, whose birth, for-

tunes, and virtues appeared to have formed them for each
other's happiness.
Those letters — those terrible letters ! - What a monu-
ment of confiding love to be placed before a widow, knowing
that the grave had closed over the heart from which ema-
nated so many fond and generous sentiments ;--- and which,
but so short a time before, had beat in unrestrained affec-
tion against her own !- He had so loved her -- so cherished
her so cherished her children - their children, that
she could no longer comprehend the self-devotion with
which St. Florentin tore himself from their arms to rush
into the jaws of destruction. There were the fond cheerful
letters he had addressed to her, with her father's permission,
during his American campaign. - There the few illegible
lines traced upon a bed of agony, in order to relieve his
lovely cousin's apprehensions, when he had been officially
returned as wounded ; and which, hurried and difficult of
decipherment as they were, contained a playful message
to Madelon, and a recommendation to her protection of a
favourite hound he had left behind him at Florincthun,
There was the passionate effusion in which he informed her
that the consent of their families had fixed an early day
for their marriage ; — there were the two affecting lines in
which being forbidden to agitate the invalid by his
presence - he thanked her for the gift of their first-born
child !
Was it wonderful that the re-perusal of these documents
should open anew the sources of her grief, and again ex-
cite her displeasure against those whom she regarded as
the origin of her misfortune ? “ Had he died,” she ex-
claimed, “on the field of battle, fighting againt the enemies
of his native land, with the approval of Heaven and the
respect of his fellow-countrymen to hallow his memory and
soften the anguish of his kindred and friends, I could
have better resigned myself to the calamity. But to behold
so noble a heart--a life so valuable to his family - lavished
in support of an idle scheme by which the lives of the
Bourbon family have become forfeited to the indignation
of the citizens of Paris, is indeed an aggravation of my
sorrow !”.

“ The affliction of a wife,” observed Euphroisine,
sternly, “ should borrow no added poignancy from the
circumstances which render her a widow.
He whom we
lament, was lost, it true, in an obscure struggle which
has tended to no good purpose ; yet his life was as nobly
laid down in the cause of France and of the Bourbons, as
any which were sacrificed at Rocroy or Fontenoy.”
“ The cause of France is no longer the cause of the
Bourbons !” cried Madame de St. Florentin.
“ The people
from whom they received their rights on the kingdom,
reclaim a gift which they conceive to have been memorably
abused. The king himself acquiesces in the necessity for
a regenerated constitution ; the queen publicly proclaims
that she is educating her son in the principles of the Revo-
lution. It was their mistrust of the people, their want of
confidence in themselves, which induced them to irritate
the prejudices of the populace, by furtively withdrawing
from the château ; and this breach of faith will only
estrange from their cause the better classes of the revolu-
tionists, and infuriate those human wolves who render the
political disorders of the time a plea for the indulgence of
personal vices and instinctive crimes.”
“ Can this be a daughter of the house of Navelles ?”
involuntarily exclaimed Euphroisine. “Nay then,- the
destinies of the king and queen are indeed levelled with
the dust!”
“ No longer a daughter of the house of Navelles !” ex-
claimed Emiline, wildly flinging back the dishevelled tresses
from her face; “but the widow of St. Florentin
- the
mother of his fatherless babes ! - My husband, a subject
of France, has fallen by the hands of Frenchmen. - Ac-
cursed be the cause which could unsheath a sword of
enmity among men whom Heaven has commanded to act
as brethren!
“ The holiest of covenants, madam, was cemented with
blood,” said Mademoiselle Delplanque. “ But why attempt
to reason with your despair ? — Your affliction enfeebles
your mind, and seals my lips from their purposed reply.-
But alas, madam ! the sentiments I have heard from your
lips assure me that I must at least dismiss the hopes — the

expectations with which I sought access to your presence.
It is not because misfortunes thicken round the family of
Bourbon, that I can withdraw from their persons that loyal
affection which, next to the holy duties of my religion, has
exercised from my youth upwards its claim upon my soul.
I have no gentle or chivalrous blood within my veins;
but would expend its last drop in the service of my king.
I have left my father, — I have left my home, — hazarded
my fair fame, – plunged myself into an element of terror
and destruction, only in the trust that my feeble hand may
devote its unheeded efforts to the one great cause.”
“ You have done wrong, Euphroisine!” replied Madame
de St. Florentin, with more composure.
“ In attempting
to wield a weapon beyond your strength and unfitted for a
woman's hand, you have acted idly and presumptuously.
You have outraged the tie of filial duty, — you have broken
the bond of feminine delicacy.”
Euphroisine felt as if stung to the heart by these ac-
cusations ; for however conscious of the uprightness of her
intentions, she felt that the truth, unvarnished by her enthu-
siasm of heart and mind, justified the severe charge brought
against her conduct by Madame de St. Florentin.
“ Go back to your father. Do not leave his old age
childless to gratify the vague chimera of your bootless
loyalty. Go back to your father, Euphroisine ! or bitterly
will you rue, when the day of your tribulation cometh, your
desertion of the parent you are bound to honour. Of the
little knot of faithful friends wont to gather at the feet of
Marie Antoinette, one is already gone ; and what, alas !
did he gain to recompense the sacrifice, but the tears of his
Emiline ? And when yourself, my poor child, shall have
followed him to the grave, who will thank your enthusiasm
who even grieve over the blighting of your innocent and
promising youth, unless the poor old man whose fireside
you
have abandoned ?”
“ Had the heroes of former ages confessed the influence
of such frigid calculations,” cried Euphroisine indignantly,
“ many a great and virtuous action would have remained
unattempted.”
“ I speak not to a hero - I speak to one of my own
sex, whose hand should limit its labours to the distaff, -

domestic duties.”-
“Yet if the political principles formerly professed by
Madame -
“Never, Euphroisine ! no profession ever passed my
lips relative to the state of public affairs. I loved the
queen. She was my gracious friend. I honoured the
cause of the Bourbons ; – for in my youth I beheld it
honoured by my father, — in my maturity, by my husband.
My opinions, my hopes, my belief, were circumscribed
within the limits of my personal affection ; my principles
were all with him," said she distractedly, clasping her hands
towards a fine portrait of St. Florentin which adorned the
chamber, “ with him — for him! - I had no other trust
no other thought on earth !”
Euphroisine forbore to interrupt the current of her tears
by a reproachful comment. At length she involuntarily
exclaimed — “And yet you would desert the cause so dear
to him?"
" Desert it?
never !
But I will not make my chil-
dren orphans by Quixotic interference in measures which
Providence has wrested out of my hands. My father's in-
firmities render emigration as impossible an effort to him,
as it would be an unwelcome one to me. My husband's
grave binds me to the soil of France, even though it should
be made a field of bloodshed. I will not madly rush into
the mêlée. The weapons of the factious and mischievous
shall find me at my post, the bosom of my helpless family ;
but I will never officiously court molestation and insult."
“Nay, then," said Mademoiselle Delplanque, preparing
to quit the chamber, “ if your resolution, madam, be so
firmly taken, my mission here is accomplished. I have but
one hope remaining ; unless indeed the assistance of Ca-
mille should be withheld by your interference.”
A piercing shriek from Madame de St. Florentin
arrested the words and the departure of the astonished
Euphroisine.
" Who was it dared to breathe the name of an assassin
in my presence ? "- exclaimed Emiline with the vehemence
of a maniac.

Mademoiselle Delplanque grew as pale as death. She
was now satisfied that the incoherence of the marchioness
arose from insanity. “ Pardon me, madam,” said she,
soothingly,—“I spoke of no assassin, — but of the com-
panion of your youth, - of your foster brother, - of Ca-
mille Valazy.”
Again Madame de St. Florentin uttered a groan of
agony. Of Camille, the murderer of my St. Florentin !"
- False !

phroisine, with indignation equally uncontrollable.

she continued, in involuntary soliloquy,
as she who re-
wards with so foul a charge the devotion of his prosperity-
his

“Euphroisine !" ejaculated Madame de St. Florentin,
sinking back in her chair.
" You know it. With all the prejudices you have re-
cently adopted, you cannot blind yourself to that one truth ;
that Camille would have perilled his life, and more than
his life, for the benefactors of his mother
tectors of his infancy. The murderer of the Marquis de
St. Florentin ? — I would as readily believe, madam, that
you had yourself raised a hand against his life !”
Euphroisine attempted to suppress her indignation, when
she perceived that the consciousness of the marchioness was
gradually deserting her. But on approaching to tender
her services, Emiline eagerly repulsed her. Agitated and
alarmed, she had no alternative but to open the door of the
adjoining chamber to seek for further aid. How profoundly
was her heart touched by the spectacle which presented
itself within ! The poor old paralytic Duc de Navelles was
seated in his easy chair, gazing with a half imbecile smile
on the sports of his infant grandchildren, whose joyous
countenances were ill-assorted with the mournfulness of
their black array. Hastily summoning the attendants of
the children to the assistance of the marchioness, Made-
moiselle Delplanque quitted the room. She could perceive
that an expression of displeasure and disgust had already
overspread the beautiful countenance of Madame de St.
Florentin.

CHAPTER III.
'Tis hers the brave man's latest steps to trace,
Rejudge his acts, and dignify disgrace,
When interest calls off all her sneaking train,
And all the obliged desert, and all the vain;
She waits or to the scaffold or the cell,
When the last lingering friend has bade farewell.
Pope.
It was now many weeeks since Valazy was carried insen-
sible into the farm of Boisgelin. The good woman of the
house was fortunately a person more occupied with the
cares of her family, than with the state of public affairs;
and being what is termed in France une maitresse femme,
was thoroughly master of her house, her establishment, and
her husband. Marmin himself, a simple, uneducated pea-
sant of the Clermontese, was as warmly inclined towards
the revolutionary government as so craven a being could
presume to be, in defiance of the stanch royalism of his
active partner ; for though at little trouble to vindicate
the rights of man, as existent in his own proper person, yet
in common with most French peasants, he had been sorely
irritated by the aggrievement of the excessive taxes and
oppressive game laws in force under the ancien régime.
He was therefore well disposed to bestow his care and tend-
ing on an officer wearing the national uniform ; particularly
after he had been recognised by the procureur of St. Méné-
hould, — who visited Boisgelin for the purpose of a procès
verbal, as belonging to the staff of General la Fayette.
Lison, meanwhile, was scarcely less interested in his
favour by the affecting gratitude with which he had been
named in his last moments by the unfortunate Marquis de
St. Florentin ; who, having survived for more than twenty
minutes his removal into the house, had caused a messenger
to be despatched into the field, to bring in the body of
Camille, that it might receive the same decent cares about to
be bestowed on his own. But when the surgeon, summoned
to his assistance, on casting his eyes upon Valazy, declared
that he still lived, - that the blow by which he had been

stunned would probably produce only a temporary injury,
St. Florentin, knowing his own case to be hopeless, directed
the attention of his attendants to be immediately transferred
to Camille, whom he termed his friend, and brave preserver.
Taking a ring from his finger, a ring which bore the
united ciphers of his wife and children, — he bad them
give it to the national officer upon his recovery; then, call-
ing for a pencil, wrote with a tremulous hand upon a leaf
of the tablets he usually wore, the following hurried sen-
tences :
Farewell, beloved Emiline ! - Had the efforts made in
my favour by our good Camille been prospered by the will
of Heaven, I should not be thus prematurely torn from
you and from our children ! Valazy will convey to my
poor girl this last pledge of her lost
“ St. FLORENTIN.”
This letter, and its accompanying token of conjugal af-
fection, were carefully delivered to Valazy by the sympa-
thising Lison, some days after the unfortunate St. Florentin
had been consigned to the grave! But though the village
surgeon was justified in his conjectures that Camille's in-
sensibility was the result of a heavy but not mortal blow,
he
had not been able to calculate on the terrible havoc made
by excessive fatigue and anxiety in a frame far from strongly
organised. — Constitutionally subject to violent attacks of
fever, Valazy had only been restored to consciousness to
sink into the still more profound inanition of a feverish
disorder.
Meanwhile, Lison, attributing the continued illness of
the young and handsome stranger to the wound he had
received in his scuffle with Bouillé's dragoons, judged it
expedient to seek better advice for the sufferer ; when she
had the mortification of learning from the surgeon sum-
moned from Châlons, that her inmate was under the influ-
ence of an attack of typhus, attended with dangerous
symptoms, which, without the greatest vigilance, would
infallibly terminate his existence.
Madame Marmin, deeply distressed by this intelligence.

promised with the greatest sincerity to devote her whole
time and attention to her guest. During the brief interval
of his consciousness, Camille had deposited in her hands
the large sum of money he carried upon
his
person; a proof
of confidence which did not a little tend to magnify her
respect towards the young soldier. She reverenced him as
the possessor of she knew not how many untold louis-d'ors;
but far more for his generosity in intrusting them to her
hands.
“ How could he tell, poor young man !” said she, in a
private colloquy with her son Antoine — “ how could he
know that he should be in a burning, raging, fever before
morning — without power to lift his hand to guard either
life or property ? Bless your heart, Toinon! he gave
them to my hand, as if he had picked up a handful of
pebbles out of the Marne. Ma bonne !' said he, so gra-
ciously and so mournfully, 'keep this money till I recover ;
and if I am destined to rest my head under the sod of Lor-
rain, I make you my inheritor!” There spoke the ge-
nerous heart of a true gentleman ! - One of your sneaking
brigands of patriots, - if such a cur indeed ever had half-
a-dozen pistoles at command, would have hid them under
his mattress, lest the sight of his ill-gotten wealth should
tempt some brother rogue to anticipate the work of the
hangman on his miserable life. — Mark my words, Toinon,
it is only evil-thinkers and evil-doers who are apt to suspect
that the wicked one is buttoned within their neighbour's
jerkin.”
Ay, mother !” cried young Antoine, who was just at
the age to be captivated by the martial glitter of an epaulet
and sword-knot, “I knew him to be a gentleman before I so
much as heard the sound of his voice. I was coming
home, you see, from the barley-field, and going through
my usual labour to get the team over the slough near the
coppice, when what should I see but the poor marquis who
is dead and gone, hand to hand with three fierce tigers of
dragoons, in the outer field. And so I takes me Fanchon,
our fore-horse, leaving cart and team as fast in the mire as the
minster of Metz,
and gallops me to the spot ! and who
should I find joining the party, but a brave officer of the

Nationals, who cut in between them like a flash of light-
ning; and if he had not instantly got a crack on the skull
with the butt-end of a pistol such as would have felled
Fanchon herself, or one of our draught oxen, the poor run-
away marquis would never have been lying yonder in the
mould of St. Mark's churchyard ; nor would the brave
national captain have lingered here at Boisgelin, while there
is work and enough, calling for him at Paris.”
“ But, Toinon, mon garçon,” interrupted Madame Mar-
min, who, though not much of a politician or tactician,
could perceive that some especial inducement must have
caused an officer of the National Guard to side with an
abettor, of the king's escape, "you will find, as you grow
older, that there are things which your eyes had better not
see, and words which your ears would do better not to hear.
-And so, child, if the procureur should come here, med-
dling and questioning with his ink-horn in his hand, recollect
that you were sticking fast all the time in the slough with
the team ; and that when you arrived in the meadow, you
saw neither more nor less than three strange horsemen rid-
- a national officer insensible upon the ground,
- and the Marquis de St. Florentin (for such it seems was
his name) bleeding to death at the distance of a few paces.
You would not wish to get our poor sick guest into a slough
of his own,-into mischief with his commandant, — eh!
Toinon?”
“No, mother, surely; if I knew the rights of his case ;

“ And as to the ring and the letter which were left to his
charge by the dying nobleman, and which, even now, in
his sickness, he guards so carefully under his pillow,- we
need say nothing on a point upon which we are not ques-
tioned; and which, some how or other, my mind mis-
gives me, might bring him into trouble.”
No, mother, surely — but
“And now go and cut me an arm-full of lucerne. For
I was busy making whey for the sick gentleman at milking
time; and the cows are still in the homestead, and will not
thank me for visiting them empty-handed. — Go, child,

into vexation and difficulties by seeing and hearing more
than his neighbours.”
So strictly did young Antoine fulfil his mother's in-
junctions, that his recital, which was accompanied by the
audible mastication of a greasy galette, not only baffled the
inquisition of monsieur le procureur the process-monger,
but when the Chevalier de Mirepoix arrived at Boisgelin,
commissioned by the surviving family of the unfortunate
Marquis de St. Florentin to inquire into the precise manner
of his death and superintend the removal of his remains to
the family vault, not one word was uttered by the Mar-
mins which could induce him to suppose that the popular
version of his kinsman's disaster, as circulated by the roy-
alists, was untrue.
The chevalier's demeanour in the execution of his
mission did not serve to conciliate the regard of the inha-
bitants of Boisgelin. The members of the royalist party
were not, in fact, placed in a position to be lavish in pe-
cuniary matters ; and during his first conversation with
Lison, he indiscreetly took occasion to designate the Na-
tional Guard as the “ canaille of La Fayette ;”.
and favourite word which the aristocracy of France were
destined to atone with their heart's blood; and which, issu-
ing from patrician lips, was sure to create an inveterate
prejudice against the speaker. On the present occasion, it
effectually silenced the Marmin family.
But the Chevalier de Mirepoix, having afterwards acci-
dentally learned from the curé of the district, that a national
officer who had been engaged in the mortal affray with his
noble kinsman, was still lying on a bed of sickness at Bois-
gelin, returned to the farm, and insisted on an interview
with the sufferer. Lison, however, was too much inte-
rested in the condition of her patient to allow him more
than a transient glance at the unconscious Camille, whom
he immediately recognised, and qualified as a traitor and
an ingrate. Thus confirmed in her opinions, Lison ex-
horted Antoine strictly to adhere to their original plan of
reserve; and Mirepoix having been advised that should a
rumour gain ground in the country of his intention to re-
move the remains of the royalist marquis, the people might

be tempted to obstruct his march or molest him with in-
sults and invectives,—he was glad to proceed to his melan-
choly task without a moment's delay, and to set out again
with the hearse, at midnight, a few hours after his arrival
at Boisgelin.
It was some days after his departure before Camille
could be brought to a consciousness of what had happened,
or of his present condition; and Lison, having been re-
peatedly advised by his medical attendant that agitation or
uneasiness might prove fatal to the young captain, con-
siderately forbore to revert to the subject. With all these
precautions, his recovery was slow; and for several weeks,
the virulence of his disorder reduced him to the feebleness
of an infant. At length, he began with tremulous steps to
creep about his little chamber, and question his physician
as to the possibility of his removal and return to Paris ;
when one evening towards twilight, Antoine having entered
the room with his usual superfluity of congees and apolo-
gies, announced that a young stranger wished to be ad-
mitted to a few minutes' conversation with him.
“ With me?” exclaimed the invalid, staggering to his
seat, oppressed by the mere idea of conversing with a
stranger in his present state of weakness. Satisfied that
his mother would leave home and happiness to establish
herself as his nurse, he had been careful to despatch a few
lines to her at Manoir, containing a general assurance of his
safety, without the slightest clue to his retreat; and what
other human being entertained sufficient interest in his
destiny to seek him out in his obscure seclusion ?
“With yourself, captain !” replied Antoine Marmin.
“ A youth of about my own age, and, as I take it, a stirring
herdsman lad of my own sort.

entreated me to inform Monsieur Camille (he did not so
much as do you the honour of calling you 'Captain'-

Enough, enough! Toinon--the sparkler seems at least
to have done some business on your own brains. Why
did you not tell me from the first, that the stranger in-

“How should I know it myself, Monsieur le Capitaine ?
-Even if I were as wise a man as my uncle, the canon at
Metz-Heaven keep him for its own !- how could I pos-
sibly know that your name was Monsieur Camille, since
you never condescended to tell me that you had a name

is a young farming lad of about my own years; and though
my grandmother at Verdun always tells me to hold up my
head (like a good patriot), for that I am as promising a lad
as any in the province, I assure you, Monsieur le Capitaine,
she never presumed to call me a gentleman. But perhaps,
sir, you will deign to tell me the young lad's name, since
you desire me to address him. Pray is he called Monsieur
Camille, sir, like all
“Ask him yourself, Toinon!” cried Valazy, perplexed
to know whether his apparent simplicity arose from thick-
headedness, intoxication, or cunning ; “ for truly, I think,
you have no great scruple in pushing your inquiries."
Antoine was already out of sight. But he returned in
a few minutes, ushering in a young peasant wearing the
costume of Picardy. “ He calls himself Jacquot Lavoine,
Monsieur Camille le Capitaine," said young Marmin, with a

consequential air ; " and that is all I can get out of him.
-'Tis but a web-footed gull from the Picard coast, after
all."
Euphroisine, for it was herself, on entering the little
chamber, no sooner cast her eyes upon Valazy than she
perceived herself to be recognised, and that he was about to
utter an exclamation of amazement which must be fatal to
her secret. Placing her hand upon her lips in token of
silence, and assuming the air and dialect of a peasant of
Picardy, she approached Camille with so earnest a tender
of service, that Antoine, who still lingered, swinging the
door in his hand, thought it high time to interfere.
“ If Monsieur le Capitaine Camille is discontented
with me," he exclaimed, in a tone of supplication almost
amounting to a whimper, “it is enough — he has only to
say so; and I will never trouble himself to wait upon me
that is, never trouble myself to wait upon him, again.
- But if you should dismiss me, sir, from brushing your
coat and bringing you your breakfast, only to make way
for this finical stranger, I will send him back to Montreuil
with no more whole bones in his skin, than in the wood-
cocks of an Amiens pâté.”
“ My good friend !” said Jacquot, attempting by the
gentleness of his tone to deprecate the rising wrath of the
Champenois -
“ Do not good friend me, silken-tongued hyena !” cried
Antoine in so indignant a tone, that Lison herself, dis-
turbed by the exclamation of her son in the process of
sorting sorrel for her evening soup, intruded her comely
visage into the chamber with a rebuke to Toinon, and a
wondering inquiry into the cause of the debate.
“ This spindle-legged numskull, mother, is come to
take my place from me, and to attend upon Monsieur le
Capitaine, - and
My good Madame Marmin !” said Camille, with as
much patience as he could assume,
" this lad is come to
bring me letters from my family, and carry back those
tidings of amended health which your kind care has en-
abled me to render so satisfactory.”
“ Do you hear, blockhead ?” cried Lison, delighted

with this double tribute to her merits ; do
you
hear how
strangely you have misconceived the young man's errand ?
- A pretty specimen of hospitality truly for the honour of
the province, that a stranger is to arrive at Boisgelin, and
be welcomed after this graceless fashion ! Go, sirrah, -
off - out! To the bean-stack with you ; — and leave
Monsieur le Capitaine to read his letters.'
Shamed into a suppression of his grumbling, Antoine's
sabots were soon heard clattering along the bricked passage.
Lison gently closed the door; and Camille, on turning to-
wards his unexpected guest, found that she had sunk into
a chair, covering her face with her hands.
“Surely, surely," he exclaimed, approaching her with
the kindest interest, “ the insolence of yonder oaf has not
alarmed you ? Deign to inform me to what fortunate ac-
cident I am indebted for your presence here; and by what
strange coincidence
my
retreat became known to you?”
“ By no accident — by no strange coincidence,” replied
Mademoiselle Euphroisine, who had now recovered her
presence of mind, and with it a noble superiority to the
awkwardness of her position. -" Apprised by the public
voice of the arrest of the king and queen, I quitted Arras
in disguise, to assure myself by personal observation whe-
ther my feeble hand could be rendered instrumental to
their service; when, on my arrival at Paris, I discovered
you to be absent from your post. My inquiries at the
Hôtel de Ville instructed me that you were in Champagne
— wounded, perhaps dying ; while my subsequent audience
of the Marchioness de St. Florentin acquainted me, fur-
thermore, that you were dying a traitor to your country,
and a murderer of the nearest kinsman of your early
benefactors !”
- How !” exclaimed Valazy, with quivering lips and
blanched cheeks. “ I do not clearly understand ? — You
spoke of Madame de St. Florentin. - In

Emiline still alive, — is she well, - resigned, — patient
under her unequalled afflictions ?”
“ They are not the less poignant,” replied Euphroisine
coldly, “ that she believes them to originate with her

“ What can have possessed her
who can have pos-
sessed yourself with so groundless an idea ?” – indignantly
exclaimed Camille Valazy. “ I know from her own lips
how disposed she is to misinterpret and malign my words
and actions; but I could not have conceived it possible
that I — whose efforts in the cause of the royalists —I-
whose interposition in behalf of the Marquis de St. Flo-
rentin have so recently brought me to the brink of the
grave,
should be accused of a crime contrary to my
principles, — and, oh ! how revolting to my feelings !
Thank Heaven for having placed in my hands the means
of my vindication ! — Unless the marchioness can with-
hold her conviction from the handwriting of her husband,
from the dying pledge of his affection, - I am enabled to
lay before her such proofs of my innocence as shall force
her to retract the calumnious accusation.”

to have acted weakly in this affair, Monsieur Valazy ; but I
never imagined you to be culpable.
" And she could believe this of me !” ejaculated Ca-
mille, without listening for a moment to the ungracious
commentary of Mademoiselle Delplanque. 6. She could
fancy I would lift my hand against her husband !”
“ Madame de St. Florentin has been misled by mis-
representations,” said Euphroisine. “She was taught to
believe
you
the murderer of her husband.”
“ And I, who believed that her prayers for the victim
who had sought to sacrifice his life in her behalf, were the
talisman preserving me through my hours of danger !
And Emiline has cursed me!

I parted from the marchioness. - I left her bewildered
with grief, — with the perplexities of her critical situation.
But learning from Laporte with more detail than I could
presume to exact from Madame de St. Florentin, that the
Chevalier de Mirepoix had left you at Boisgelin, deserted
and dying, I resolved to pursue the route to Lorrain
instead of returning to Paris, and

“ Generous girl !” interrupted Camille, taking her hand;
“it is from you only that I have met with candour and
kindness.”
“Nay," replied Euphroisine, calmly disengaging her
hand, and walking to an open window on the opposite side
of the
room, you owe me little. My journey hither has
added but a mite to the mass of opprobrium and evil report
which my wilful and wayward spirit has gathered against
me. It is scarcely a week, Monsieur Valazy, since I was
witness to the tears shed by your good mother for her
absent son ;-it is scarcely a day since I was forced to
listen to the groundless imputations cast upon you by your
noble foster-sister, - and to the sinister-presages formed by
her steward relative to your present condition. On their
account, as well as on my own, I resolved to satisfy myself
of the life or death of one upon whom so much affection,
so much reproach, so much interest was lavished, and on
whom I myself rely for such kind offices as my mission of
danger and devotedness to the royal cause may require."
“ Still so true ? Still sanguine of success ?”
“No!" said Mademoiselle Delplanque, mildly. "I am
now altogether hopeless. But many a cause has been
ruined by the premature despondency of its adherents; and
I have resolved to persevere till the last. When the day of
ruin comes, what matters it that one so insignificant as
myself be included in its work of devastation ? Many
honest and loyal subjects, on the breaking out of this revo-
lution, predicted happy results from the new constitution.
They believed - vain delusion ! that when the main
columns supporting the ancient edifice of the French
monarchy were forcibly withdrawn, the vast pile might
still bear itself aloft. They saw the weeds and humid moss
which time had gathered round those venerable pillars,
and instead of disentangling the fibres, and cleansing them
from incidental stains, suffered them to be torn from the
toppling temple! Alas! that we should be doomed to
mourn over its ruins !”
“Not so, mademoiselle: the king, in subscribing to the
new, constitution, has arrested its downfall.

things, purified only from those abuses which no lover of
his country can wish to see renewed. Even the mistrustful
flight of the royal family will be forgiven, when the
honesty of their intentions is proved by time. Nothing
but a fault of policy on the part of the king will render the
power of the Assembly dangerous to his person or allotted
authority.”
“ Allotted authority !" cried Euphroisine, indignantly.
“ Fault of policy !—Tell me what error you find in the
conduct of Louis XVI., unless that he has treated his sub-
jects with the tenderness of a father rather than with the
firmness of a king ?

the friends who engross my anxieties will consent to leave
this distracted kingdon, and my poor mother follow the
objects of her affection, I have resolved to resign my com-
mission, and abandon a realm in whose existing govern-
ment I entertain no confidence, in whose feeble and
vacillating monarch I dare not place my trust."

yourself under the assumption of moderation, from the
terrors of an hour of peril involving the best interests of
your country.”

“ Miserable — miserable infatuation !” exclaimed Ma-
demoiselle Delplanque. “ And yet,” she continued, wring-
ing her hands, “ how can I presume to blame him for the
madness of his devotion ! Farewell, Valazy !” cried she,
turning abruptly towards him. “I have learned all I wish
to know - I have heard all I wished to hear. I go to
pursue my own duties - my own path of patient and
humble sacrifice; and since we may not tread that path
together, there is nothing more to unite us to each other.
Yet, stay!” said she, pausing as she reached the door.
“ One word of warning to yourself, before we part. In
taking the public step you meditate, forget not that all
emigrants absenting themselves from the kingdom after the
commencement of the new year, fall under the decree of
proscription; and that any officer abandoning his public
functions, without having sent in a resignation of his com-
mission, will be prosecuted under the revolutionary law, as
a common deserter. Thus much for public intelligence.

“I seek no argument on the subject,” said Mademoi-
selle Delplanque, imperatively. “ He loves your Emiline
has loved her, like yourself, from infancy. In process
of time, he will demand her widowed hand, and the inte-
rests of her family will exact its acceptance.”
“ It is but too true!” ejaculated Valazy, reverting to
the scene of the hotel of Nivernois; and he shuddered as
this new anticipation took possession of his mind.
“What chance have you of conciliating the prejudices
he will naturally strive to excite and foster in the mind of
his cousin,– perchance of his bride,—against the cousin of
Maximilien Valazy,—against the supposed murderer of her
husband ?”
Camille involuntarily smote his bosom.
“I will tell you !-Arise !-- shake off this lethargy!-
When your bodily strength shall be restored, strive to
achieve the restoration of your energies. Then, Camille
Valazy, declare yourself for the cause she loves. Advocate
it in the Assembly, bleed for it in the field ! You have

to compass the liberation of a land it is necessary only that
she should desire to be free, in a national crisis such as the
present hour, those who desire and deserve to distinguish
themselves, will not lack the opportunity.”
“ But tell me, I beseech you,” exclaimed Camille. He
spoke in vain. Euphroisine had left the chamber; and
his weakness forbad him to follow her departing footsteps.
He felt, as he had often felt before after an interview with
this strange and exalted being, depreciated in his own
esteem,-mortified and vexed, both with himself and her.
And when Toinon sulked into the room at bed-time,
with his evening potion of orange-flower water, he was
almost as well inclined to expatiate upon the boorishness
and sauciness of the young Picard who had come upon
them and disappeared again with the vivacity of a flash of
lightning, as either Lison or her zealous son.

CHAPTER IV.
When, ever yet, was your appeal denied ?
Wherein have you been galled by the king ?
What peer hath been suborned to grate on you ?
That you should seal this lawless bloody book
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine,
And consecrate commotion's civil edge ? Henry IV. Part II.

“ And pray who is the Muscadin from whom you received
so indignant a glance just now?" inquired the Deputy
Couthon of Maximilien Valazy, with whom he was tra-
versing arm in arm the garden of the Tuileries.
“ Yonder flimsy thing, skirting the paths beside the
basin, with so deliberate a step, - as if to catch a glance of
his empty countenance by reflection on its waters? – 'Tis
Mirepoix, next heir to the family of Navelles ; one of the
aristocratic silk-worms, whose existence is too closely en.
woven in its own dainty tissues, to perceive aught that is
passing in the external world. What is it to them that
the poor are worn to the bone by privation and labour ;
that the lowly are beaten with the heavy rods of oppression.
Our silk-worm feels not -sees not
hears not. Our
silk-worm is safely nested in the centre of his selfish co-
coon !”
- Ta, ta!” cried Couthon with a malignant sneer.
Keep your eloquence, Max, for the club to-night, or the
Assembly to-morrow. It is wasteful to lavish those good
round periods on a friend - on a friend who knows you,
too. It were as well, however, if this Mirepoix of yours
were to provide himself with a new suit ; for his button-
hole of decoration gapes with a most melancholy yawn for
the order we have wrested thence.”.
“ Nay! such is his insolent vanity! I doubt not he has
amused himself by inserting his snuff-box into the gash, in
order to widen its vacuum, and proclaim himself to all the
world an ex-chevalier.”

ebullitions of chuckling jocularity, that you, Valazy, in-
variably chose me as your companion, in order that my
crooked back might enhance the
your
Herculean
outline?”
- Psha! are the impertinences of such a thing worthy
recollection ? - Had he injured me by no worse blow than
a lick of the tongue, I might have satisfied myself, by re-
turning the favour. But the officious puppy has placed
himself between me and vengeance. When I was appointed,
at my own request, one of the commissioners for the domici-
liary visit to the Hôtel St. Florentin on the night of Louis's
escape, and had flattered myself of finding an occasion to
repay to Emiline de St. Florentin some of the courtesies for
which I was formerly indebted to Emiline de Navelles,
yonder Marplot was beforehand with me; - had conducted
her with her children to her doting father's seat at Florinc-
- and I found myself — ay! Couthon, prepare one
of those grim sneers you reserve for the mischances of your
friends, – I found myself compelled to a state-service, for
which I had little appetite ! - Instead of seeing that pretty
doll weep and tremble at my feet, as I anticipated, I had
the curse of soiling my fingers by routing through files of
mouldy papers; and of burning them afterwards, while
affixing the seals of the nation on every old chest calling
itself the property of St. Florentin. An edifying occu-
pation truly, for any thing beyond the condition of a no-
tary's half-starved clerk!”.
• And then to have the certainty that the very silk-worm
which so moves your choler was honoured with the satis-
faction of destroying your handy-work so shortly after-
wards! After all, it was but a pusillanimous piece of work
on the part of the Assembly, to pardon all the busy knaves
and fools who had lent a helping hand to the insolent at-
tempt of the 21st of June.”.
“Nay, the amnesty was granted in gratitude for the
blundering manner in which their officious counsellors set-
tled the affair. Had they carried off their wooden idols
to some secure shrine, - had they found safety for the
royal gang in a huckster's cart, instead of provoking recog-

nition by their own pompous paraphernalia, then might the
rogues have slept a head shorter by this time, — and the
limbs of the treacherous gardes du corps hung in dismem-
bered warning from every guard-house of the city. As it
was, even the poissardes were ashamed to hoot at the sneak-
ing blockheads as they sat, on their entrance into Paris,
chained in front of the royal carriage which they had not
found wit or valour to rescue from the friends of the na-
tional cause.
Pardon them? - Methinks the curs should
have shared their part of the decreed recompense, by which
the Assembly has paid the trouble and zeal of the thief-takers
of Varennes and St. Ménéhould.”
“ Pethion swears that Barnave passed the time of his
journey from Varennes to Paris in maundering speeches of
gallantry to Madame Elizabeth."
“ And Barnave protests that when they refreshed them-
selves en route, his two colleagues picked their chicken
bones to the very beard of the king, and made the Austrian
herself fill up their bumpers ! — For my part, I have only
to regret in the business that the sword of an honest revo-
lutionist should have performed an office on the insolent
St. Florentin, which I had designed for

“ The keener edge of the guillotine ! - And that the
same sluggish weapon did not more wisely direct its efforts,
by suppressing a little of the superfluous vitality of the
Valazy family, in the person of my pluckless cousin, the
merchant of Lyons.”-
“ Was he not wounded in a death struggle with St.
Florentin?”
“ There were no witnesses to the affray; and dead men
blab not. Camille, dull as he is, has had the art to jus-
tify himself to his general. But even if the fact were
proved, to my good thinking the blow was struck in ad-
vancement of his personal predilections, - in pursuance of
his personal enmities, not in any zeal for the cause of
the nation, or the liberation of his enslaved countrymen.
No, no, Camille Valazy was not born of the stuff that
makes a patriot.”
“ Yet you recommended him to the general ?”–

“ For my own ends. - Know we not that who is not
with us must be against us ? However, I have kept my
conscience clear, by warning La Fayette to place no further
trust in his services.”
• Right! Family attachments must not operate against
the interests of the commonweal.”

be answerable for the good dispositions of his aide-de-camp.
- He answerable to me for the principles of a beggar who
was nourished upon my father's bread, and sheltered under
my father's roof-tree !”-
“ Just one of his qualifying phrases, of his attempts
at moderation. But here is Danton posting away from the
palace with a grin as expressive of loathing as if he had
been swallowing some of Ræderer's taunts, or some of
his own dirty words. - Touche la mon brave ! - What
are they doing to-day in the Assembly — and what saying
in yonder mob, from which you have just escaped ? It
seems to have stationed itself under the windows of the
château, as country boobies stand gazing, in some pro-
vincial fair, at the encaged hyenas and panthers growling
through the bars of their dungeon.”
“ Parbleu! that is just what they say ! I heard an
old tinker muttering to his greasy friend the cobbler, that
the Assembly had resolved to keep the Bourbons in a den
for life, as a band of wolves in reserve to be loosed upon
the people in case of disaffection.”.
They must talk and think, truly, the dirty ruf-
fians !
Mort de ma vie !” exclaimed Couthon, with a grimace
which purported to be jocose ; “ methinks our good friend
Valazy relapses from time to time into something of the
phrase of the aristocrats. - : After all, Danton's tinker was
but one of the hereditary princes of the sovereignty of the
people ; and what becomes of the freedom of the republic,
if you seal the grumbling mouths of the cobblers with their
own wax?”

permanent obstacle to a French republic,” said Danton,
ferociously. “ The loss of a little blood would relieve its
plethora. As Barrère * observed to me last night, — when
we chanced to cross a congregation of the banditti of the
Faubourg St. Antoine gathered together by some cheering
news just arrived of the triumphs of their black fellow-
miscreants at St. Domingo, · The overgrown populace
of Paris, gathering round the seat of government, is like a
determination of blood to the human heart; the vital organs
are oppressed by suffocation, while the rest of the body be-
comes withered and enfeebled.''
“Ay, ay," observed Couthon, malignantly - Were
Danton and Barrère charged with the regeneration of the
constitution, instead of the mitred head and cloven foot
from Autun, and the renegade Alexandre Lameth with his
mouldy refuse of courtly compliments and congees, they
would teach the social organ to beat freely, and lop off the
gangrened integuments without remorse.
They would
* kill - kill — kill’ from mere ferocity; even as you and
I, — for the gratification of our personal animosities.”
“ Wait till you see St. Just and his plausible, canting
friend Robespierre, wielding the weapon of destiny, — I
am much mistaken if the scales of justice will not then be
filled with somewhat more than a pound of human flesh.”
“ So my fainéant of a cousin once predicted to me!
Camille Valazy asserts that the Revolution, like Saturn,
will devour its own children.”
“ It has not yet satiated its hunger upon those of other
people! Even if the king should refuse to accept the new
constitution (and they say La Fayette has had some
difficulty in forcing the peevish child to swallow his medi-
cine), I see little chance of cementing the glorious pile of
the Revolution with the only permanent medium, - the
blood of its enemies, — till the amended organisation of
the National Guard shall have rendered to each legion its
independent command, and snatched the scourge from the
hands of so doubtful a patriot as La Fayette. Till that
scrupulous old woman, Bailly, shall have atoned his treach-
ery towards the people, nothing effectual will be done.

We may expunge the feudal laws of the aristocracy,
may shrivel in the flames the horrible scroll of the lettre
de cachet, we may level the walls of prisons and
cloisters, we may equalise the revenues of posts of state,
we may enfranchise the land from oppressive taxes, both
ecclesiastical and secular; — but so long as those hands

Danton paused, exhausted by his own vehemence. But
Couthon did not venture to deride his eloquence, or ques-
tion the veracity of his intentions. He was known to be
in earnest ;- he had proved himself bold, enterprising,
and persevering in the pursuance of measures which the
majority of his party were readier in concocting and mak-
ing the theme of their tumid declamations, than in fur-
thering with heart and hand. Bred to the profession of
the law, he knew the vulnerable points of the civil edifice;
and his mode of attack was skilful and determined. Scorn-
ing the speculative theories of political regeneration, he was
willing to go all lengths with the fiercest demagogues of
the rabble ; and enforce the new order of things by that
demoniacal defiance of every law, divine and human, which
filled the ice-house of Avignon with dead, and defiled the
waves of the Loire with livid corpses ! -
Meanwhile, the condition of the illustrious inmates of
the palace of the Tuileries, which had now assumed the
character of a gloomy and dishonoured prison, rather than
of a royal abode of the descendants of Henri IV., were
overwhelmed with indignities and provocations. La Fayette,
so severely visited by the populace on occasion of the flight
to Varennes, that a lamp-post was prepared on the Place
de Grève for his instant execution, redoubled his vigilant

precautions for the safe detention of the royal family ;
either to mislead the opinions of his adversaries as to his
real intentions and feelings towards the king, or in truth
to prevent all possibility of future escape ; while Gouvion,
the second in command of the National Guard, was per-
manently stationed in the palace, -a measure far from un-
welcome to their majesties, who believed him to be devoted
to their persons.
But he refused to retain so responsible
a duty as that of his service at the Tuileries, unless per-
mitted to wall up several doors of communication affording
facilities to escape ; and unless two officers of the National
Guard were established in the antechamber of the queen.
The courts of the château were filled with national troops,
-a species of camp was pitched in the gardens immedi-
ately facing the Tuileries ; —sentinels were placed on the
very roof ;-— and, by the command of La Fayette, not
even the deputies were permitted access to the palace !
The precautions within doors were even more minute,
and far more offensive. The officers intrusted with the
personal guardianship of Marie Antoinette, had the privi-
lege of remaining in her chamber by night as by day; and
notwithstanding the remonstrance addressed by the king
on this head to General La Fayette, the only modification
obtained was a permission that while her majesty slept,
they should withdraw from her apartment. Even this
concession was a nominal relief; for they were compelled
to remain in the thickness of the wall between the double
doors of her bed-chamber, with the inner entrance ajar.-
One night, the queen, wearied by the vexations of the
day, (for it was that which witnessed the election of Pe-
thion as mayor of Paris, a man for whom the queen en-
tertained a personal disgust, which had been materially
aggravated by the coarseness of his insinuations, and in-
solence of his demeanour during the miserable days she
passed in his company on her return from Varennes,) had
retired to rest at an earlier hour than usual ; in that cham-
ber which, though stripped of all its gorgeous decorations
and splendid attendance, was still to be regarded as a sacred
retreat, as the asylum of an innocent and broken-hearted
woman, a mother, and a queen! - No regal plumage now

waved above its canopy,-
- no gewgaws glittered around.-
But the spot was consecrated by tears of penitence, and
prayers of Christian humility ! Feverish and dejected,
she found it impossible to close her eyes. Having lighted
a lamp left by her attendants for her use, she prepared
herself to pass the night in reading ; — but scarcely had
she cast her eyes upon the book which lay on the coverlid,
when she perceived the figure of a man traverse the room
and approach her bed.
Marie Antoinette was startled rather than surprised or
alarmed by this apparition.— She had become so well inured
to insult and danger, that her mind was prepared for the
aspect of death at any moment, in any shape, and her pa-
tience armed to cope with every fresh outrage offered to
her feelings, either as a queen or as a woman.
But when
the young soldier, — for by the light of her night-lamp
flashing on his accoutrements, she perceived that this un-
courteous intruder was, in fact, one of her guards,—threw
himself upon his knees beside her couch, seized her hand,
and covered it with passionate kisses, — she trembled with
terror and indignation! The vehemence of her emotion
was, however, quickly subdued. -On withdrawing her
hand from the eager grasp of the national soldier, she per-
ceived that it was wet with tears; and felt, with an in-
stantaneous conviction from such a circumstance, that as
a woman she had nothing to apprehend, and as the wife
of Louis XVI., much to hope, from the tenderness of her
janitor.
“ Alas! madam,” said the young man, flinging back
the sable curls from a brow of the purest whiteness, and
speaking in the most subdued tone, you do not deign to
recognise me!”
Marie Antoinette, disengaging herself, threw the glare
of her lamp on his face. Euphroisine ! my poor, dear,
faithful girl !” she faltered, -imprinting a maternal kiss
upon that fair forehead, while Mademoiselle Delplanque
could only reply to these acts of graciousness, by tears of
joy.
“Since the day you deserted us so suddenly, my child,
we have borne with much sorrow !” said the queen,-"yet

think not that your former devoted services were forgotten.
Deeply did I grieve to find from Bertin that you and yours
had endured molestation for our sake, and that she could
procure no tidings of your present welfare. Trust me,
my good girl, I have never experienced the want of a
trustworthy and affectionate agent, without murmuring a
selfish desire that Euphroisine Delplanque were still near
me, and still inclined to peril her personal ease and safety
in my behalf.”
» said the queen,
Surely, surely, madam, that last reservation was su-
perfluous !”- said Euphroisine, reproachfully.
“Nay !
“ forgive the mistrust of a
princess who has been betrayed by those in whose veins
circulates the same royal blood which warms her own ;-
a woman, whose summer friends have migrated from the
nest they professed to love so fondly.”-
Judge not the subjects of your ancient and loyal king-
dom from a few graceless individuals !” — exclaimed Eu-
phroisine, with spirit. “ The best and most honourable
hearts in France still beat, madam, to do you service; and
thousands of swords would gladly leap from their scabbards
at your majesty's bidding.'
“Hush, hush !” said the queen, faintly smiling. “ This
is a language I had alınost forgotten, which it were well
for me I had never heard, which I must henceforward
labour to forget.— Such were the delusive phrases which
inflated my youthful vanity at Schönbrunn ; such the ac-
cents which cherished the pride of my maturity at Versailles.
When I arrived in France, I was greeted with such
fond partiality, that I believed the flatterers who told me
the kingdom was my own by the predilection of the peo-
ple,- my children's, by the divine right of inheritance !'
- And so it was,
and so will it be again!”
“Never, Euphroisine,
never, never !
Where were
the swords which should have leaped from their scabbards,
when I'was driven from my bed at Versailles by the intrusion
of ruffians, exposed as a common mockery to the rabble,
- conveyed in open captivity to Paris,- surrounded by the
lowest of miscreants,- and heart-stricken by the spectacle of
the bleeding bodies of my faithful guards ?

my friends, my partisans, my knights, when I was for-
bidden by the mob to bestow on my children the blameless
enjoyment of breathing the summer air in the groves of
St. Cloud ? Where were they when, arrested like a fugitive
thief on my way to throw myself into the protection of
subjects more faithful than the misgoverned tools of the
capital, I was brought back a prisoner to this palace of mis-
fortunes ? Which of the courtiers of the Trianon rushed
hither to receive the afflicted daughter of the Empress of
Germany ? Noailles, my avowed enemy,

presented themselves to usher me into my regal dungeon ;

nave that I owed the preservation of my poor faithful
gardes du corps from the fury of the intoxicated mob!
Such, Euphroisine, such is the chivalry of France !
“Yet, Heaven forgive me!” she suddenly exclaimed,
as if by a recoil on herself _“Why should I desire to find
them otherwise ? — The misfortunes they must encounter
in a cause so foredoomed as that of the sovereignty of the
Bourbons, would only aggravate my afflictions. What
did I not suffer, when my good, my gallant St. Florentin
paid the penalty of his persevering devotion to his sove-
reign ? -- When Choiseul, Damas, Goguelas, were dragged
to prison, for their efforts in our behalf ! - You have
been yourself too deeply in our secrets, Euphroisine,
not to know with what ardour I implored my beloved
friend, Madame de Polignac, and her family, to quit the
kingdom.”
“ And it was to my own hands, madam, you deigned
to intrust the commission of requiring Madame de Lam-
balle to seek safety in England.'
“ Trust me, Euphroisine, it was to those who call
themselves my partisans, I addressed my reproach ; — not
to that knot of beloved friends who are even now hazard.
ing their safety for my sake. You will find me surrounded
by many who were wont to charm your affectionate heart
by their kindness and protection. Madame de Tourzel,
Thibaut, La Brice, our good Campan, still fulfil their official
duties at the Tuileries ; but who among them, Euphroisine,

-
who among them has served me with a disinterested
and enthusiastic constancy like your own ?
Again Mademoiselle Delplanque imprinted a kiss on the
gracious hand extended towards her.
“ Your majesty
vouchsafes to over-rate the value of a feeble reed devoted
to your support.”
56 A few more such reeds, my poor child, would afford
a prop effective as the most gigantic oak !

such loyal votaries would replace me and my children,- I
will not say upon the throne of France, – that day is past,
nor do I further covet a distinction so cruelly degraded,

from the sanguinary rebels of France.”.
“ But will his majesty again consent to
“ His majesty's consent to such a measure would not
be asked by servants who truly loved him. He should be
carried off a prisoner to a more peaceful country.”
“ Such was the scheme which the opinion delivered by
General La Fayette to the Assembly, on the 22d of June,
appears to suggest."
“ La Fayette is— but I leave it to time and to posterity
to develop the mysteries of his character," observed the
queen, hastily checking herself.
" No!-- Heaven knows
I have no further craving that my husband or my son
should reign over France !”
“ I beseech you, madam, do not, even in your just in-
dignation, blaspheme our beautiful and fertile country,”
cried Euphroisine.
“ The glorious realms of the East produce the most
terrific monsters of the universe,” observed the queen.
“ Hush, madam,” cried Euphroisine Delplanque, eagerly
covering the lips of her sovereign with her small fair hand.
My companion has retired into the dressing cabinet.
We are, I trust, secure from observation ;- but I am in-
debted for his confederacy to pecuniary considerations, not
to the impulse of kindness or loyalty ;- and how can we
confide in the fidelity which has been purchased by a bribe ?
-Restrain, therefore, I beseech your majesty, this vehe-
mence of expression.”

“ Good girl!” – said Marie Antoinette, with moistened
eyes ; your head is no less valuable than your heart.
Where-- where did you acquire this nobleness of senti-
ment?”
“ From the inspiration of the Almighty spirit by which
it was fashioned, and the sublime religion bestowed on me
by his mercy!" replied Euphroisine, with haughty hu-
mility.
“ Yet methinks that souls as lofty,” said the queen, with
somewhat of an ironical smile,“ have been vilely tamed
and alloyed by too prolonged a sojourn among the servile
crew besetting my antechambers ! I remember,” said the
queen, insensibly carried back to the recollection of those
scenes and moments,—" I remember, Euphroisine, as if
it were yesterday, the first occasion of our meeting. — I
was still but the dauphiness of France. — Nor had I yet
learned to love the land which has since so sternly repaid
my partiality ;-for, alas! I was still doubtful of the af-
fection of
my
husband — still childless !-One day, having
ventured to express the isolation of my heart, and its regrets
for the cheerful simple German home in which, unmolested
by those forms of etiquette unnecessary to maintain the in-
nate dignity of the imperial crown, - our good Madame
Thibautwas it not ? led to my feet a little fairy girl -
a lovely, gentle, sportive creature, some three years old ;-
and told me, that one such pledge offered on my part to
the French nation, would bind me by indissoluble bonds
to its interests.”
Mademoiselle Delplanque listened with gratified tender-
ness to the gracious reminiscences of the unfortunate prin-
cess; to whom an hour of unrestrained colloquial intercourse
was now an almost prohibited indulgence; and as she noted
the clear blue eyes glancing beneath her disordered night-
dress, and the arm of marble whiteness, appearing under
the laced ruffles of her sleeve, it seemed impossible that a
being so lovely and so feminine, could provoke the seve-
rities of mankind.
“ I forget by what bribe I won the good graces of that
little Euphroisine!--My bonbonnière, or some other bauble,
so worked upon her gratitude, that when I begged her of

her mother who was waiting in my antechamber, and had
been, if I mistake not, attached before her marriage to the
royal household, — the child clung to me, and asked leave
to stay with the kind lady whose robe glittered so like sun-
shine.”
“ And did my poor mother presume, madam, to deny
the request of her future sovereign ?" inquired Euphroisine.
“No! she denied me nothing. But she sealed her con-
sent with so many tears, that I withdrew my petition ; and
grateful for my sympathy with her maternal feelings, she
told me that her own experience had taught her to dread
the influence of the delusions of a court on the destiny of
her child. Suffer me,' said she, “to educate my daughter
to love and serve you in an humble home; where she will
be secure from seductions which might hereafter tend to
render her love and service valueless in the eyes of your
majesty.'- I consented readily, and readily did I believe
her, Euphroisine ;--for good faith was painted in your
mother's countenance. -But I did not dream that her in-
structions would bring forth such good fruit from the little
plant I had so wished to naturalise in my garden.— No!
I did not dream that Marie Antoinette of France would
live to rely on that dark-haired child of Versailles, as on
one of the most trustworthy of her followers !”
“Would, madam,” said Mademoiselle Delplanque, with
tears streaming down her cheeks, 66 would that circum-
stances had rendered my assiduity unnoticeable ! - Far
better, that the loyalty of your adherents should have con-
cealed my devoted affection amid the mighty crowd, than
that the desertion of others should render my poor assist-
ance so ostensible. - But you spoke of escape-
triation. — May I presume to ask whether your majesty
still entertains a hope of leaving this corrupted land ?”.
“ No! Euphroisine, I have taken up my cross, prepared
for the last extremity, The king, --resolved to die at his
post, and repair by the firmness of his fortitude in mis-
fortune, the misplaced leniency with which he suffered the
ruffians of the Revolution to raise themselves to his level,
that they might depress him to theirs, - will sanction no
further revolutionary measures. Taught to regard the

haughảy obstinacy of Charles of England as a political
error, my husband has essayed under similar trials the
power of conciliation and gentleness ;-has acted as a
guardian angel, where the harshness of an avenger was
doubly requisite. But abased as he has been by the factious
and the wicked, I trust and believe the king will never con-
sent to abdicate the crown, whose brightest jewels have been
ravished before his eyes ; but which he regards as a sacred
deposit to be transmitted to his children and their posterity.”
“ But their present safety, madam the safety of your
majesties?”
Euphroisine !” said the queen, raising herself upon
her elbow, and speaking with grave solemnity - " That
crown will never recover, in the eyes of the French nation,
the sacred stability with which it was formerly invested in
the opinion of our subjects ! - A time will come - mark
me, child! a time will come, when the royal authority of
France will be placed as absolutely at the disposal of a
majority of voices in the popular representation, as the
mere premiership of the ministry of St. James's !"-
Mademoiselle Delplanque cared little to inquire into
such probabilities; she was a Bourbonist,—not a royalist
not a politician ; and was more interested for the safety
of the royal family than for the establishment of the
purest form of Utopian government which ever haunted
the dreams of prince or statesman.
" Then less than ever, madam, must its possession ap-
pear precious in your sight. Surely.
“ Precious, Euphroisine ? Held on its present terms of
tenure, the diadem of France is a degradation to the brow
of a daughter of the Imperial House of Hapsburg. - Were
my own will — my own preference - paramount on this
occasion, I would surrender it into the rude hands by
which it has been dishonoured, and seek refuge in the love
of my Austrian fellow-countrymen. – My brother would
not deny me the shelter of some obscure corner of his do-
minions. But not to subsist on his benevolence. — No!-
The wife or widow of a Bourbon would scorn to nourish
her humiliated existence saving on the labour

Henri IV.-would shrink from receiving alms from any
foreign state!”
While uttering these afflicting expressions, which seemed
the involuntary apostrophe of a breaking heart, Marie An-
toinette burst into an agony of tears; and it was some
time before the tender soothing of Euphroisine restored her
to composure.
“ Alas! madam,” whispered the weeping
girl, “ I cannot bear to witness these emotions, which pro-
ceed from too long -- too compulsory—a repression of your
sentiments.—I cannot bear to see you suffering thus
for I must speedily quit your side. The night passes, and
I must return to share the guard of my companion !”.
“ And you have not yet informed me, my poor child,
by what strange accident you have found your way hither.
- Your father
“ Trusting that the motive may excuse the unbecoming
boldness of my action, I have presumed to secure access to
your majesty, by enrolling myself as a substitute in the
National Guard, under the feigned name of Jacquot La-
voine, of the section of the Filles St. Thomas !”
“ Thank Heaven !” involuntarily ejaculated the queen.
“ You have thus secured me an unfailing medium of com-
munication with my friends, --an unceasing source of con-
solation for my loneliness. — Tell me, when shall you be
again on guard ?”
“But once more, madam, within the week. — But,
hark! I hear footsteps in the antechamber," faltered Eu-
phroisine, rising from her knees, and gliding towards the
door ; which, without presuming to utter another word of
farewell, she gently opened.
As she disappeared from the bed-chamber of her ma-
jesty, Mademoiselle Delplanque pressed her hand to her
heart, in token of a reverential but silent adieu. But a
rude struggle in the anteroom convinced the unfortunate
queen that their interview had been watched and be-
trayed !--

CHAPTER V.
A heavier task could not have been imposed,
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable. Comedy of Errors.
One of the first cares of Camille Valazy,-on arriving at
Paris, where his return was greeted with the warmest de-
light by his brother officers and comrades to whom he had
been represented as having fallen in a popular tumult at
Stenay,— was to seek out the abode of Mademoiselle Del-
planque, to replace in her hands the sum of thirty thousand
francs, which had been deposited with him through her
interference, previous to the expedition to Varennes, and
which he no longer understood the means of devoting to
the service of the king and queen.
But he was unsuc-
cessful in his search. The mansion of old Delplanque in
the Marais, was already inhabited by a strange tenant;
and neither the successor to his mercerie, nor any other
person, appeared at all aware that Euphroisine had absented
herself from Arras, where her father was said to be esta-
blished with his family.
His next effort was to seek an audience of Madame de
St. Florentin. — Not that he expected to derive either
pleasure or gratification from such an interview. He still
retained a cruel recollection of her demeanour towards him
on occasion of their last meeting ; and the fact that she
was now freed from her marriage-obligations appeared, if
possible, to render her still more difficult of approach.
He had, however, a painful duty to fulfil towards her; for
the dying commands of St. Florentin left him no alter-
native but that of personally placing in her hands the last
bequest of her husband.
On presenting himself at the gates of Florincthun, Va-
lazy was informed that no person even of their nearest
friends, had access to the Duc de Navelles or the Marquise
de St. Florentin, except the Chevalier de Mirepoix. He
desired to be admitted to Monsieur Laporte; and the

197
horror and disgust with which the old man recoiled from
his approach, justified this precaution. — At Florincthun,
Camille Valazy was still execrated as the murderer of St.
Florentin !
The ring and handwriting of the marquis, however,
were evidences of his innocence, too authentic to be doubted;
and when the poor old steward became satisfied that the
wasted figure and cadaverous countenance of the young
captain were the fruit of his exertions in favour of the
king and queen and in defence of his late master, he fell
upon his neck and wept aloud !-
But though Valazy persuaded himself he had learned
to look on Emiline without emotion, and witness the tears
of her widowed sorrow without sympathy, when her con-
sent was obtained, and he found himself on the point of an
interview, he grew speechless and almost breathless with
agitation. Laporte, naturally attributing his distress to the
mournful object of the solicited audience and the enfeebled
condition of his young friend, lent him an arm till he
found himself in the chamber of Madame de St. Florentin,
and within a few paces of her chair.
But he was mistaken in anticipating on this occasion
any renewal of her former haughtiness. Emiline, fore-
warned by her old domestic of the motive of his visit and
the misrepresentations by which he had been calumniated,
was touched to the very heart by the discovery of his ex-
ertions in defence of her beloved, as well as by consci-
ousness of the groundless rancour she had cherished towards
the child of her good Madelon. When Valazy entered
the room, she was in tears; and on finding him by her
side, she threw herself by a sudden impulse into his arms
as into those of a brother! Hiding her head in his bosom,
she wept without measure or restraint; while Laporte sobbed
aloud at the spectacle of her uncontrollable distress.-
For all the kingdoms of the earth, Camille could not have
uttered a word of consolation to the beautiful being in whose
arms he was thus strangely enfolded. But as soon as he
could disengage her from her position, he replaced her on
her chair; and kneeling before her, without raising his eyes
to her face, placed in her hand her husband's ring and

letter ! — He heard the passionate kisses imprinted by her
lips upon these hallowed pledges of affection ;-he listened
to the groans which appeared to be wrung out of the very
depths of her heart, as she gazed upon the lines traced by
that cherished hand now mouldered into dust. He per-
ceived her sighs bursting into the wild convulsed hysteric
laugh of agony yet he could neither speak nor move to
her assistance.
“ And you would have saved him for me-
-my Camille !
—my good brother Camille!” she exclaimed. “You would
have rescued him from the ruffians who tore him from his
miserable wife, - his unprotected children ! —ay! even at
the risk of your own existence !” — and bending towards
him, she laid her hand on his head in an attitude of bene-
diction. Camille Valazy felt as if a bolt of ice had shot
through his frame. — He was riveted to the spot!
“ Take the blessing of the widow and the orphan,” cried
Emiline. “ Take the thanks of a miserable woman, bereft
of all protection - all earthly hope -- all earthly happiness.
- How often, how fervently do I wish that my children
and myself had passed through our hour of sacrifice, and
were lying in the lonely grave of my poor lost St.
Florentin
“ Despond not thus, madame la marquise,” interrupted
poor old Laporte. Deign to remember that you have still
faithful followers and devoted friends, bound to the pro-
tection of yourself and your sweet babes by the holiest ties
of gratitude.”
“ Alas!” said Madame de St. Florentin with more com-
posure, “who among the nobility of France can now venture
to rely upon the fidelity of their dependents, or the guardian.
ship of their friends ? - Who can feel secure that a violent
death will not precipitate them into a dishonoured grave ?
I have no one now to defend my cause.
My father's
decrepitude renders him a cause of additional anxiety to
myself, rather than an efficient protection. -- My kinsman,
the Chevalier de Mirepoix, is too young and too enthusiastic
to be intrusted with my confidence. Yourself, Laporte-
with all your devotion — all your goodness, - are now too

utterly - utterly abandoned !”
“ Not so, madam !” said Valazy, affecting a composure
of mien, which the tremulous uncertainty of his voice suf-
ficed to contradict. “ You have deigned to recognise my
humble devotion, as evinced in the most terrible crisis of
your destiny. Vouchsafe to accept it for yourself - for
your children !”
66 But
Madame de St. Florentin despondingly waved her head.
“ I must," said she, “not again involve you in this fatal
cause."
" What am I but the creature of
your bounties !” per-
sisted Camille, without noticing her interruption.
for the education bestowed by the Duc de Navelles on my
early years, I had been still a senseless clod, lost in the
drudgery of Grand Moulin. My present fortunes are your
gifts, the better hopes of my existence have-
“No, no !” cried Madame de St. Florentin.
" You do
not deceive me by these flatteries. Your own energy, your
own steadiness and perseverance, have rendered you what
you are: and you have a paramount duty towards yourself
and towards your mother, which should prevent your par-
ticipation in the destinies of a ruined house. Yet think
not that I ungraciously reject your kindness. Return to
Paris, Camille ! Return to the fulfilment of those duties
which have already facilitated your services to me and
mine ; and believe, that should an occasion of danger pre-
sent itself in which the efforts of a friend may prove be-
neficial to my family, it is you on whom I will rely for
- it is yourself to whom I will appeal for assist-
ance and consolation !- Write to my good Madelon. — Tell
her, that precious as her doating affection would be to me
at this moment, I will not entice her into sharing my
wretchedness. Tell her that the home provided for her
old age by the attachment of her son is her best and most
honourable shelter; and that my sad presages forewarn me
I shall one day claim hospitality at her door, an exile and
a fugitive.”
Might I presume, madam, to torment you by unwel-
come counsels, I would implore you to forestal an event

which the circumstances of the times render but too pro-
bable. My mother's abode, cannot, it is true, match with
the splendours of Navelles, or the elegance of Florincthun.
But the comforts of life are not wanting within its walls;
and would you but consent to anticipate a day of evil and
adjourn there in unsuspected security with your children
and monsieur le duc, the first moment of returning sun-
shine might recall you to the more prosperous dwelling of
your ancestors !”
• Alas! Camille," said the marchioness, “I once re-
jected an offer of similar kindness upon your part, under
the influence of a perverse and jealous waywardness. But
I am not wayward now !” she continued, looking down on
her weeds, and by an irresistible impulse, snatching her
husband's letter from her bosom and covering it with kisses.
“ It has pleased Heaven by its chastisements to prove to me
the instability of the happiest human conditions, and subdue
my wilful spirit. But it may not be, Valazy! - My father,
who has borne threescore years of worldly dignity and re-
spect, is of an age past the schooling of the times. Even
did he acknowledge the necessity of yielding to their de-
vastating torrent, his chivalrous sense of honour would forbid
him to resign one iota of the privileges of his caste. My
father, feeble as he is, would rather die at his post, than seek
safety in flight."
“ I do not speak of emigration," said Camille.
not presume to counsel that the Duc de Navelles should,
during the absence of his son, set foot upon a foreign
territory.”
“ When the first symptoms of a revolutionary spirit
became apparent,” observed Emiline, “my brother, whose
feeble health has prolonged his stay in the south of Italy
beyond the period stipulated by the governor to whom his
education was intrusted, was on the point of returning

trayed any dereliction from the established principles of
his family,” said Valazy, respectfully.
“ It was our business to conceal a fact so unsatisfactory.
But no sooner was the Duc de Navelles aware of the pro-
gress made throughout all ranks of society in France by
the doctrines of the new school, than he framed his pecu-
niary engagements with my brother in such a manner, as
to preclude all possibility of his return from Italy. Amé.
dée is consequently upon the list of proscription; and
were my father to determine on emigration, the estates
which have been confirmed to our family by five hundred
years of stainless nobility, would become confiscated to this
mockery of a state which we have suffered to extend its
fulminating sceptre over our heads.”
“Yet surely, madam, the retainment of a few disaf-
fected fiefs is not sufficiently alluring to bribe you to the
encounter of death — nay, perhaps of more than death ? "
Heaven knows that it is not !” cried Madame de St.
Florentin, clasping her hands. “For my own part, the
poorest cottage in some obscure and unmolested land, with
my children around me and my good Madelon sharing my
exultation in their infantine beauty, their growing intelli-
gence,- would be to me a happier home than the proudest
palace of a realm whose tumults recall to my heart the
destiny of my murdered husband. But my father has
more disinterested views. He feels that public example
should derive its lesson from the highest class. My father
will not quit his post at the menaces of a factious populace.
And now, Camille, farewell ; - for he cannot support my
temporary absence from his side.
Leave your address
with Laporte, that we may be prepared to seek assistance
at the hands of so kind a friend.”
She placed her own in that of Valazy, as she passed him
to quit the room ; but instead of venturing to receive it as
a pledge of grateful affection, he raised it coldly and reve-
rentially to his lips, as though the act of graciousness of a
sovereign princess.
The conversation which ensued with the old steward of
the Duc de Navelles left on the mind of Camille a con-
viction that the family at Florincthun had every thing to

fear from the unrelenting virulence of Maximilien ; and
that the state of infirmity into which the old duke had
recently fallen, was such as to render his removal from
Florincthun both difficult and dangerous. Of Euphroisine
Delplanque, Laporte could give no certain intelligence.
Not having presented herself at Meaux on her return from
Boisgelin, the old man trusted and believed she had re-
turned to the protection of her father. He spoke of her
with affection, as of a lovely and promising child; but
predicted that her enthusiastic defiance to the opinion of
the world would expose her to irretrievable misfortunes.
On returning to Paris after this interview, Camille felt
gratified on every point it had tended to elucidate, except-
ing this latter doubt. His heart misgave him that had
Euphroisine finally deserted the capital and her loyal pro-
jects and principles, she would have taken measures to ac-
quaint him with her change of resolution, enabling him to
restore to its legitimate owner the deposit she had placed
in his hands. But he dared not pursue his researches, lest
he might direct official notice towards her movements;
neither could he bring himself to make inquiries on the
subject by letter, either of his mother or of Monsieur Del-
planque, lest he should renew in their minds the erroneous
suspicion they had formerly entertained of his attachment
to Euphroisine.
Meantime it became necessary for Camille to decide his
line of conduct. Previous to his convalescence and return
from Boisgelin, General la Fayette had resigned the
command of the National Guard, which for the future
was to pass successively into the hands of the command-
ants of its several divisions. After a farewell address to
its assembled legions, he had even quitted Paris, and
taken up his residence in Auvergne, his native province ;
affecting to believe, or believing, that the main purposes of
the Revolution were already achieved by the establishment
of a liberal constitution; and that the struggle of the pre-
ceding seven-and-twenty months had closed with honour
to himself, security to the nation, and unlimited submis-
sion on the part of the court of Versailles.
Previous to his departure, the city of Paris had issued

commands that a medal should be struck in his honour ;
and presented him with a statue of Washington, the model
of his own conduct and career, and a sword forged from
an iron bar of the Bastille. He was followed in his retreat
by the affection and confidence of the people, whose enthu-
siasm he had never atteinpted to mislead, and between
whom and the royalist party he had mediated with the mo-
deration of a generous but Christian spirit. It was un-
derstood that the partisans of La Fayette entertained
a hope of recalling him to the administration of public
affairs, by proposing his election as Mayor of Paris, on
the resignation of Bailly. But this object was thwarted
by the reliance placed on the ultra-republicanism of
Pethion : - the court and the party interested in forward--
ing a counter-revolution flattering themselves that the
excesses promoted by this exaggerated and violent poli--
tician would materially second the interests of their cause.
But though by the dismemberment of La Fayette's état
major, Camille found himself absolved from his engage-
ments, he no sooner presented himself at the head-quarters
of the National Guard, than the second regiment of cavalry
of the section of the Arsenal to which he had been tem-
porarily attached, fixed its choice upon him as its captain;
and he became once more included in the ranks of the
national army. On reconsideration of the honours thus
bestowed upon him, he was satisfied that, compelled to
remain in the capital, nothing but an official authority
of this description would secure him from the suspicion
and denouncement of Maximilen's Jacobin associates, and
enable him to offer material protection to Madame de St.
Florentin and her family.
But if, in the course of the spirit-stirring scenes in which
Camille Valazy had recently been an actor, he had learned
to reproach himself with his own inertness and alienation
from the great interests of his country still perilled before
his eyes, his present responsibility filled him with mis-
givings and vexation. “ I have now,” said he, as he
traversed his solitary apartment, on his return from the
Hôtel de Ville,“ placed my services at the disposal of a
government in which I have no confidence, and may be

called to uphold the execution of measures I abhor. Am I
justified in thus trifling with the interests of a mighty
nation, to serve my own selfish purpose ?
Am I right
to close my ears against the suggestions of my better
reason, to abandon myself to the promptings of one un-
governable passion ? - Yet wherefore not ? — The auspi.
cious moment is still distant, when my aid may be com-
manded by persons in whose hands the destinies of France
can be securely deposited ; and if, in the interval, my in-
tervention can allay the intemperance of the irritated mul-
titude and soften the destiny of a single sufferer, surely I
may stand excused for extending my exertions to the pro-
tection of a suffering woman, and of a family to which the
services of my forefathers were devoted for centuries by the
mutual bond of the feudal charter."
It was in vain that, on his return to Paris, Valazy
attempted to assume the social habits with which the youth-
ful friends he had formed during his military career be-
guiled the vexations of a period so inimical to the plea-
sures of their age. To avoid the character of a morose
misanthropist, he occasionally visited with them the public
haunts of dissipation still frequented and followed ; for
though the gallery of the National Assembly attracted
crowds of women of high condition, who interrupted the
most important debates, ay, even those affecting the life
and death of their fellow-citizens, by the clamour of their
giddy laughter and flippant pleasantries, the theatres of
Paris were still regularly attended. Even during the
horrors of the Reign of Terror, the curtain of the Opera
rose and fell at its usual hour, for the benefit of spec-
tators displaying more than their usual hilarity; and the
stones of that highway which had been traversed in the
morning by the fatal cart conveying the young, the
good, and the noble, to the scene of deliberate blood-
shed, were crowded at night by elegant equipages, bear-
ing the fair and frivolous Parisians to a region of public
amusement ! - With their ears yet wringing with the
shrieks of wives torn from their husbands,— children from
their parents, - they turned aside to weep for the painted
Iphigenia, ranting beneath the sacrificial knife; and sealed

CHAPTER VI.
They bid you
Deliver up the crown! and on your head
Denounce the widow's tears, the orphan's cries,
The dead man's blood, the pining maiden's groans,
For fathers, brothers, and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
Henry V.
The recent widowhood of Madame de St. Florentin and the
unceasing attendance exacted by the infirm condition of
the Duc de Navelles, exonerated her from all necessity of
intercourse with the illustrious prisoners of the Tuileries;
for in no other light could they be further regarded,
But Emiline, though her heart was involuntarily chilled
towards a cause which had cost her so dear without being
itself benefited by the sacrifice, could not, even in the
midst of her afflictions, withhold her sympathy from the
royal friend whom she had loved, — the queen whom she
had delighted to honour.
Shortly after the disastrous expedition to Varennes,
Marie Antoinette, in spite of the vigilance by which she
was surrounded, contrived to convey to the widow of the
devoted St. Florentin, a short billet expressive of her un-
qualified sympathy in the event rendering Emiline a widow,
and her infants fatherless. But it appeared to the delicate
and feeling Madame de St. Florentin, that the letter was
too royally worded for so affecting an occasion : that it
spoke too much of future protection, where the mere ten-
derness of gratitude was required. She knew that, through-
out her connection with the circle of the château, she had
not only been undistinguished by the benefits profusely
lavished upon others, but had been enabled to grant

favours, and afford obligations, to the several members of
the royal family. Nor could she bear to suppose that the
sovereigns she had served and reverenced estimated the
loss of a husband and a father,- a being so gifted and so
beloved as her martyred St. Florentin,— as capable of in-
demnification by worldly benefits. The position of their
majesties, was, however, too calamitous to permit her to
nourish one feeling of displeasure towards then).
Vainly did she despatch Laporte to the city, with a
charge to penetrate into the interior of the château, and
assure himself by personal inquiry of the attendants of her
majesty, that her health had not materially suffered under
the trials and mortifications to which she had been sub-
jected. The old man returned to Florincthun with intel-
ligence that all communication between the court and the
city was suspended. But he acquainted the marchioness,
that he had recommended the execution of her commands
to the Capitaine Valazy ; who, in consideration of her
anxiety, had undertaken to profit by the facilities of his
official situation, and assure himself by personal investi-
gation that the unfortunate inmates of the Tuileries en-
joyed the respect and deferential attendance so much their
due.
The spring of 1792 was passed by the illustrious pri-
soners in a series of mortifications and injurious privations.
Every successive measure of the Legislative Assembly ap-
peared to aggravate the humiliations of the king, and
open a still wider gulf between the tottering throne of
the Bourbons, and the people who still affected to retain
the name of their subjects. The religious institutions of
France were disorganised, the priesthood disavowed,
the sacerdotal habit proscribed ; while, at the instigation
of Dumouriez, war was declared against the new Emperor
of Germany, the nephew of Marie Antoinette.
By a decree of the Assembly, the royal guard was now
disbanded. Notwithstanding the virulent manifestation
of animosity against Louis XVI. which had long been ap-
parent, his person was left at the mercy of the miscreants
of ris, recently excited to their utmost pitch of violence
by the dismission of their three favourite ministers.

Servan, Roland, and Clavières ; a measure noticed in the
Assembly by a vote of disapprobation on the part of the
Girondists. The only defence for the king against the
operations of this mighty horde of enemies consisted in
the good-will of a few battalions of the National Guard,
which might have been still excited to rally round his
standard, and vindicate its rights against the ruffians of the
Faubourgs St. Antoine and St. Marceau. But, alas! no
effort was made on the part of their sovereign to re-animate
their loyalty.— His majesty's habits of life displayed the
unmanly inertness characterising a Roman pontiff, rather
than a descendant of the brave Béarnois; and Louis XVI.,
instead of teaching the Parisians in the words of Henri IV.
to rally round his panache blanche, on public occasions he
appeared in a carriage, like an old or infirm man, nor had
he once deigned to grace with his presence a review of the
national troops.
In his present helpless and defenceless
condition, it is not wonderful that the royal family was
subjected to new insults on the part of the populace.
On the 20th of June,—the anniversary of their flight
from Paris, a mob of insurgents of the lowest class,
headed by a democrat of the Faubourg St. Antoine, the
brewer Santerre, and accompanied by flags and standards
bearing the most monstrous inscriptions, burst into the
palace of the Tuileries ; the National Guard, disbanded
the preceding year and scarcely knowing whom to regard
as its commandant, affording little or no resistance to their
progress. Upwards of twenty thousand ruffians were suf-
fered to introduce themselves into the very presence of the
unfortunate king ; who, judging it better for the sake of
his unprotected family to submit with patience the de-
gradations imposed on him by the populace, so thoroughly
disarmed by his meekness their rage against his person,
that the insurgents, having been exhorted to quit the Tui-
leries by their favourite Pethion the new mayor of Paris,
the assemblage of barbarians consented to disperse without
further violence; and before night, the courts of the châ-
teau were cleared of the last stragglers of the insurgent
party.
But this eventful day, though ending without the com-

pletion of the crime for which its measures had been con-
certed,—the annihilation of the royal family, - afforded the
finishing stroke to the destruction of the monarchy ! — A
mob which had beheld the King of France compelled to
bow to its insults ay ! even to stoop to the adoption of
the bonnet rouge, the emblem of its defiance to the laws of
his realm,
could never again be expected to renew its
worship at the foot of an idol whose altars it had trampled
in the dust. From that period, the existence of Louis XVI.
became a toy for the sport of his revolted subjects.
It was in vain that the Duc de Liancourt invited him to
fly to Rouen, and place himself at the head of a few de-
voted regiments, which, with the united inhabitants of
La Vendée, might serve to turn the tide in his favour. It
was in vain that La Fayette flew to Paris, from his head
quarters at Sedan, and implored the royal family to accept
his escort to Compiègne, where he undertook to surround
them with the defence of the constitutional army. The
king, mistrusting the loyalty of his intentions, refused to
owe his safety to an advocate of the sovereignty of the
people.
By this ineffectual tender of service to Louis XVI.,
meanwhile, and his address to the National Assembly
against the excesses of the 20th of June, La Fayette for-
feited his last claim on the affections of the mob.
popular commander of the national army had the mortifi-
cation of seeing his effigy burned, with yells of triumph,
in all the public squares of the city ; and of knowing that
the citizens, whom he had believed devoted to his person,
betrayed utter indifference to his degradation, and to the
progress of national revolt. A second federation now took
place in the Champ de Mars; when the king renewed his
oath of fidelity to the constitution, and in some degree as-
suaged the tumult of the insurgents ; but they were speedily
rekindled by the publication of a manifesto on the part of
the royalist army at Coblentz, by the Duke of Brunswick,
containing menaces the most injurious to the honour of
the French nation.
These fresh discontents, fomented by the efforts of the
Jacobins and the injudicious proclamations of the army on

the frontier, were soon united into a focus of mischief.
On the 8th of August, Pethion proceeded to accuse Louis
XVI. at the bar of the Assembly, of having conspired
against the people ; and on the following day, Ræderer the
syndic of the department proclaimed that a general insur-
rection was on the point of breaking out. Yet notwith-
standing this acknowledgment on the part of the authori-
ties, no sufficient precautions were adopted. Early on the
fatal 10th, the tocsin sounded the signal of revolt; when
the king, after having undertaken the defence of the châ-
teau, and assigned the posts of the troops allotted for his
protection, appeared for the last time in the balcony of the
great court of the Tuileries. A faint cry of “ Vive le Roi!”
was raised at his presence; but his majesty was known to
place almost as much confidence in the national soldiers
assembled on that occasion as in his faithful Swiss.
On this memorable occasion was Valazy favoured by a
first opportunity of proving his devotion to the wishes of
his noble foster-sister. Previous to his return from Bois-
gelin, La Fayette, on resigning the command of the Na-
tional Guard and retiring to his head-quarters at Sedan as a
general of division, had diminished his état major, so that
the post of Camille was necessarily abolished; while the
feebleness incidental to his wound and long indisposition
afforded him, on his arrival in Paris, a fair pretext for de-
clining a further appointment in the general's staff. He
received, however, from his hand, an official testimonial of
his services; and Valazy observed that La Fayette, during
their brief and formal interview, never once alluded to the
disaster of Varennes, — to the commission he had himself
received on that occasion, -or to the St. Florentin family.
La Fayette did not part from his young aide-de-camp
with this ungracious reserve of official taciturnity.-“I
conclude," said he, “ that your connections and residence
at Paris, Captain Valazy, incline you to fulfil in the capi.
tal the functions and duties of a citizen. I shall rejoice to
hear, sir, that the sacred persons of their majesties are
guarded by one on whose fidelity I can repose my eager
anxiety for their safety and happiness; and venture to re-
commend that my young friend should enrol himself in the

battalion of the Faubourg St. Marceau, commanded by the
worthy Acloque — whose sentiments I believe to assimilate
with our own. I am not, Monsieur Valazy, so ignorant
of what is passing in the city or of the characters of those
with whom I surround myself, as to be unaware of the re-
serve you
have maintained in your connections with your
kinsman the deputy, a brilliant and attractive, but dan-
gerous companion. Cherish this honourable prudence, sir.
Pursue your temperate, but upright course. - It will
be the better with you and all whom you desire to serve."
Satisfied of the good intentions of the general towards
himself, however he might distrust his sentiments on poli-
tical points, Camille not only followed his advice by joining
a corps
which contained many of his former friends and as-
sociates, but had reason to believe, from the prompt cordi-
ality evinced towards him by his new commander, that
Acloque had received some private recommendation from
La Fayette. On several important occasions, the command
of the grenadiers stationed at the Tuileries was appointed
to him, in defiance of the regular routine of service ; and
it having proved his good fortune, in the attack of the 20th
of June, to divert the point of a pike directed against the
king, he was honoured by the private thanks and public
notice of Acloque; who, profoundly touched during that
eventful day by the patient humility of Louis, had formed
the most eager hopes to defend him throughout all extre-
mities. In his ranks he boasted many private soldiers
wearing the Cross of St. Louis; and all the inferior mem-
bers of the royal household proceeded to enrol themselves
either in the troop of the section of the Filles de St. Tho-
mas, or in the battalion of Acloque.
On the fatal morning of the 10th of August, the popu.
lace, having insisted on the withdrawal of Mandat from the
command of the day, Valazy, whose name rendered him
an unsuspected person with the mob, was proposed by
Acloque to undertake the guard of the royal staircase, kept
by the Swiss guards. It was a post of no mean import-
ance ; and had been deserted by two companies of National
Guards the section of the Feuillans; but Camille, to
whom the safety of the king appeared an eminently sacred

211
deposit, felt that his person was secure so long as the staircases
of the château were guarded by brave and loyal defence
against the approach of the populace. He beheld without
alarm the arrival of two deputations ; one from the depart-
ments, and another from the municipality, —who claimed
access to Louis XVI., for the fulfilment of a peaceful mis-
sion. But on observing that the former was headed by
Ræderer, his heart misgave him of some unfortunate result.
Scarcely had an hour elapsed after their arrival, when
his majesty, followed by Marie Antoinette and her lovely
sister-in-law Madame Elizabeth, appeared at the head of
the stairs. An instant rumour in the hall proclaimed that
the king and queen, instigated by the representations of
Ræderer and his colleagues, were about to throw them-
selves on the protection of the National Assembly! On
this announcement, the warm hearts of their adherents,
which but a moment before had beat with the hope of
labouring and perhaps dying in their defence, experienced
a general chill of despondency; for though it was generally
acknowledged that his majesty had been influenced by the
desire of preventing a further effusion of blood, it seemed
an act of fatal concession to abandon his post at such a
crisis. Once resigned to the power of the Assembly, the
destinies of the royal family of France were indeed
gloomy ! -
At that moment, however, no one anticipated the full
extent of the evil. The voice of the syndic was heard
from the antechamber of the guards, imploring the royal
suite and grenadiers of the Filles St. Thomas, to refrain
from accompanying their royal master; assuring them that
such an evidence of distrust would infuriate the exaspe-
rated populace assembled in the gardens of the Tuileries,
and endanger the safety of the king; and Camille, eager
to ascertain the effect of this plausible harangue, fixed his
eyes anxiously upon the stairs, and beheld the royal family
advance with slow and hesitating steps, amid cries of
« Vive la Nation !” « Vive Pethion !" " A bas Monsieur
et Madame: Véto !” distinctly audible among the yells of
the mob posted in the courts of the palace.
The aspect of the queen had already assumed the calm-
P 2

ness of despair! Except when she occasionally turned
round to assure herself that she was closely followed by
Mesdames de Lamballe and de Tourzel, and the bed-
chamber women conducting her children, it was evident
that she was almost insensible to the objects by which she
was surrounded. — She felt that she was descending for
the last time, those stairs which she had so often mounted
with the triumphant levity of happiness, youth, beauty,
and prosperity ; – that those halls which she had rendered
the resort of the gay and the noble, — which she so often
Alled with joyous strains and thrilling hearts, - were about
to resound with the groans of murdered victims, and to
be strewn with the insensible corpses of her faithful fol-
lowers; that a hopeless darkness had gathered round
her head; that “ her glory was departed from her!” –
And as Valazy gazed with upturned and mournful eyes on
her gradually descending figure, he saw her suddenly pause
midway upon the stairs, and motion back the crowd of
attendants which pressed on her steps, while she hastily
threw on every familiar object around her a look of such
unutterable anguish as woke in his own heart an over-
whelming sense of personal commiseration !
At the foot of the stairs, the crowd no longer repelled
by the divinity which is said to hedge a king — rushed
forwards to catch a last glimpse of the humiliated Louis,
with so bold a defiance of the decency due to anointed
sovereigns even in their downfall, that Marie Antoinette
lost sight of the dauphin. As she passed the spot where
Valazy stood with presented arms to do a last homage to
the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, remembering the
sea of fierce and menacing countenances she had just con-
templated, in that hall wont to exhibit only a confusion of
waving plumes, jewelled garments, and smiling faces,
pressed her hands upon her bosom, while a half-suppressed
cry of terror and anxiety for the fate of her beloved child,
burst from her lips ! -
The blood of Valazy curdled within him at this intense
expression of maternal agony. In the afflicted Marie
Antoinette, he no longer beheld the queen of his native
country, the daughter of an emperor. - He saw only the

friend of Emiline de St. Florentin, --- he heard only the
murmur of a suffering woman; and though he had re.
ceived no orders to justify him in accompanying the royal
cortège to the Feuillans, on perceiving that Madame de
Tourzel, the lady to whom the dauphin had been
intrusted, - was incapacitated by terror from fulfilling her
duties, he did not hesitate to place himself by her side,
and follow in the royal train.
On reaching the terrace leading through the gardens of
the Tuileries to the hall of the Assembly, the armed mul-
titude stationed there through the night, crowded on the
royal party with such insulting invectives and menacing
postures, that the deputies experienced great difficulty in
the preservation of the king and queen; when Camille,
satisfied of the personal danger of the young prince,
snatched him from the arms of his conductress, and bore
him aloft in his arms above the heads of the populace !
After striving and struggling with the human torrent
pouring towards the corridor of the Feuillans, he ex-
perienced the satisfaction of placing the child in safety in
the arms of the agonised mother; who, having missed the
dauphin, had believed him sacrificed by the fiends, whose
imprecations still seemed ringing through her ears.
“My son!” she exclaimed, —
my son, my dear
unhappy child, — salute your brave preserver ! But
Camille, having fulfilled this precious duty, had already
rushed from the spot, and was stemming the tide of the blas-
pheming and implacable multitude, on his way back to the
palace ; while Louis XVI., received by a deputation at the
door of the Assembly, took his seat at the left hand of the
president, and announced to the members and galleries,
his trust to find safety for his family among the repre-
sentatives of the nation.
As a first instance of the insults premeditated against
the royal family, it was now voted that, by the terms of
the constitution, the Assembly could not proceed to its
deliberations in their presence ; and they were accordingly
confined in the box of the logograph, or reporter of de-
bates, situated behind the chair of the president. From
time to time, witnesses were produced at the bar to give

evidence of the progress of affairs at the palace, now in
the hands of the rebels : witnesses belonging to the lowest
class of the Jacobins, - begrimed with smoke, and the blood
of their fellow-subjects ! It has even been said that these
miscreants were adorned, as trophies of victory, with por-
tions of the flesh of the murdered Swiss guard !
Before the close of that terrible day, Louis XVI. was
destined to sanction, by his presence, a decree suspending
him from his royal functions, and originating the conven-
tional form of government afterwards imposed upon the
nation. One only step remained towards the total oblitera.
tion of the monarchy, the captivity of the royal family;
and they were accordingly remanded from the Feuillans to
that antechamber of death, THE TEMPLE, under the
charge of the municipality of Paris !
Meanwhile scenes of unparalleled atrocity proceeded at
the Tuileries. The first object which struck the eyes of
Valazy on his return were the mangled bodies of Suleau
and Vigier, grenadiers of the guard, carried upon the pikes
of the insurgents. The Marseillois had already directed
the cannon on the palace; and having made themselves
masters of the gates, were engaged in butchering the un-
fortunate Swiss guards, with pikes formed of the iron
railings torn up from the gardens of the Tuileries. While
forcing, sword in hand, his way to the hall of the palace,
Camille perceived that the stairs he had recently quitted
were encumbered with heaps of dead ; over which, without
remorse or concern, a crowd of rapacious monsters fiercely
trampled their way to the pillage of the state apartments.
The atmosphere was oppressive from the repeated discharge
of musketry, — the roar of cannon in the courts without,
added to the confusion of the scene; when a lurid light
suddenly flashed through the windows, and a cry that the
palace was on fire, startled the barbarians engaged in pur-
suit of plunder in the upper
chambers.
It would perhaps be difficult to depict a scene of greater
horror than that rendered terrifically apparent by the rising
flames of the offices in a state of conflagration. The hall,
vestibule, the stairs, were choked with bodies of the slain ;
and the granite flags discoloured in places by streams of

withstanding the alarm that the progress of the conflagra-
tion would spread from the outhouses in the quadrangle to
the corps de logis, hundreds of half intoxicated wretches,
'who had been busied in the pillage of the cellars, continued
to rush blindly towards the state apartments ; partly urged
by the sight of their more fortunate comrades groping
their way among the corpses of the Swiss, and guarding
from observation some splendid fragment of the decorations
of her majesty's apartments ; - and partly by the ferocious
desire to assist in the horrible task appropriated by the
fishwomen and market porters, of stripping and mutilating
the bodies of the guards and royal suite, and throwing
them from the windows for the diversion of the cannibals
in triumphant possession of the court below.
Acloque and the élite of his companions having been
withdrawn to guard the avenues of the Feuillans, Valazy
perceived with dismay that the national troops, terrified
by the sight of the palpitating bodies of their companions
borne aloft on the pikes of the Marseillois, had joined the
standard of the assailants. To struggle singly against this
triumphant body of inebriated monsters, would have been
madness; and on hearing around him joyful anticipations
of the arrival of the remaining battalion of the Swiss
guards from Courbevoie, uttered by the wretches by whom
they were predestined to slaughter, he resolved to avoid
the spectacle of a massacre, which it was as impossible to
prevent as to force back the waves of the stormy ocean, by
eluding the scene of bloodshed. The royal family and
their suite were for the present in safety ; and he was
anxious to join the detachment of Acloque on the terrace,
where his aid must be acceptable to the guardians of the
public peace.
To escape from this scene of sanguinary intemperance
was no easy matter. The mob, shouting and rioting in
the madness of their triumph, were not to be blinded by
the mask of a national uniform to the air of disgust and
alienation visible on the countenance of several officers of
the National Guard, who presumed to remonstrate against
the atrocity of their proceedings.

“Who is this freluquet?” — they exclaimed, as Valazy,
affecting the breathless impatience of some official errand,
attempted to struggle through the groups of miscreants by
which the courts were beset.
“ If thou hast drawn that sword of thine in the cause of
the nation,” cried a being only distinguishable as a female
by the long dishevelled locks which gave her the air of a
fury, as she sat mounted across one of the pieces of ordnance
planted against the château, “ why has not the blade won
some honest gilding to-day from the blood of the Swiss
minions ?
“ Bah!” cried one of her companions, who was deco-
rated with strips of black and scarlet cloth, in token of
having assisted in the murder of the guards and suite of
Louis ;
“ 'tis one of La Fayette's modérés ! — Methinks it
were well to turn his soul on the wrong side*, that honest
men might learn of what washy materials these semi-
patriots are composed. The bodies of one or two such
fainéans would be a grateful offering on the funeral pile
which must consume those of our murdered confraternity
- the brave destroyers of the Bastille !”
“ Peace !” cried an amazon by her side, who with pis-
tols stuck in her girdle, a drawn sabre in her hand, and her
face defiled by traces of blood and smoke, had evidently
been actively engaged in the massacres of the day;
o think
you the ashes of the patriots would mix with those of a
pitiful lâche such as this?",
“Give him a sugar-plumb from thy trigger, Théroigne !"
-cried a voice from the mob. And Valazy, in the per-
son of the fury before him, immediately recognised the
notorious Théroigne de Méricourt, whom he had recently
beheld instigating the slaughter of Suleau and Vigier, and
who now drew a pistol from her belt, and levelled it at his
head.
“ Hold !” cried another voice from the crowd.

who marked his respect for the nation by easing the task
of le bonhomme Samson *, and cutting the throat of the
Austrian's favourite — St. Florentin !”
The unqualified refutation of such a charge which now
burst from the lips of Camille, would have infallibly as-
sured his instant immolation, had not the loud cries which
rose on all sides around him, of “ Vive Valazy! — Vive
l'ennemi des aristocrats!”– drowned his incautious self-
exculpation.
“Let him go, let him pass,—he is bound on an errand
to the Assembly!” cried the same voice; and he was im-
mediately allowed a free passage through the crowd.
Pursued by the yells of these misguided wretches, the
groans of the murdered soldiers, and the wild shrieks of
persons escaping from the conflagration of the offices, Va-
lazy, finding it impossible to reach the terrace, made his
way through the streets towards the guard-house of his
section. The shops were partially closed in those adjoin-
ing the Place Vendôme, which were filled by the mob of
Federates returning from their attack upon the château.
But in the more remote streets, the business of the day was
proceeding, and apparently with tranquillity and satisfac-
tion. He heard nothing but cries of gratulation, and be-
held none but smiling countenances ! - A moment's con-
sideration sufficed to remind him that the partisans of the
royalist party were compelled to retreat into their dwellings;
and that the well-disposed majority of the community was
mourning, in the saddened seclusion of their domestic
circles, the new and horrible crimes daily polluting the re-
cords of their native land.

CHAPTER VII.
Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone. This my mean task
Would be to me heavy as odious; but
The mistress whom I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures.
The Tempest.
It was to be expected that public outrages thus triumph-
antly achieved, should be followed by a total subversion of
civil government. One of the first measures of the newly-
elected executive council of which Roland was the ostensi-
ble chief, was to annul the committee of the different sec-
tions of Paris, and suspend the justices of peace from their
functions. The état majors of the gendarmerie were dis-
banded. Santerre, the sanguinary democrat of the Fau-
bourg St. Antoine, was appointed to the chief command of
the National Guard; and every successive decree of the
Assembly appeared designed to assure the progress of dis-
cord. Sanctioned by the character of Pethion's adminis-
tration in the city, the populace was suffered to follow up
the riots of the 10th of August, by solemnising a public
funeral for their comrades fallen in the attack upon the
Tuileries, and by the destruction of every public monument
wearing the attributes of royalty.
The statues of the former kings of France, even to that
beloved sovereign,
Qui fut de ses sujets le vainqueur et le père,
were broken into fragments by the factious multitude ;
while the ambassadors from the various courts of Europe,
relieved from their missions by the deposition and impri-
sonment of Louis XVI., hastened to quit a city given over
to the licentious misgovernment of the worst of factions.
Meanwhile Valazy, distracted between the shame of
wearing an uniform dishonoured by participation in the
crimes of the 10th of August, and the dread of resigning
all claim to a distinction so important to the protection of
the friends he loved, waited with impatience to learn the

part assumed by La Fayette in a crisis of so much moment
to his country. It was his hope that the military influence
possessed by the general would be exerted so as to enable
him to march upon Paris ; and maintain the constitution
of which he had been the main originator, and the illus-
trious family to whose qualified rule he had declared him-
self a loyal subject. But La Fayette had suffered the cri-
tical hour of bis popularity to pass, without striking so
decisive a blow as might render him the permanent prop of
the constitutional monarchy of France. T'hough actuated
by honourable intentions and a sincere desire for the liberty
of the land, he had no firmness to support the lofty cha-
racter of his political views. He had been unable to re-
tain the reins at one moment grasped within his hands ;
and the furious steed she had undertaken to restrain, had
not only overturned and broken in pieces the chariot of the
state, but had left their luckless charioteer far behind them
on their course.
On the 19th of August it became known in the capital
that La Fayette, --having vainly harangued the troops as-
sembled at his head-quarters at Sedan against the adminis-
tration of the Jacobins and the authors of the massacre of
the fatal 10th, had the mortification to perceive the total
.extinction of his authority with the constitutional army,
which had transferred its affection, and allegiance to the
bold and ambitious Dumouriez, who eagerly renewed the
oath entitled “ Liberty and Equality,” exacted by the
commissioners despatched to his brigade by the Assembly ;
while La Fayette replied to their proposals by arresting
them and raising the standard of revolt. Disavowed in
this step by the officers under his command, the munici-
pality of Sedan, and authorities of the department of the
Ardennes, — he was compelled to seek safety in flight;
and, accompanied by Latour Maubourg, Bureau de Puzy,
and Alexandre Lameth, quitted a land abandoned to the
control of Danton, Murat, Robespierre, Pethion, and the
regicide faction of the Cordeliers. On reaching the Aus-
trian outposts, they were publicly arrested as prisoners of
war !
This intelligence, and the rumour circulated among his

companions in arms of an intended re-organisation of the
National Guard of Paris by its new general, the demagogue
brewer Santerre, determined Valazy to retire from a post
in which he must become, through his connection with the
staff of La Fayette, a suspected person.
There were cer-
tain prudential measures, however, to be observed in re-
treating from any national employment ; and Camille,
whose princely fortune and personal interests formed too
important a stake to be petulantly hazarded, was deliberat-
ing upon the safest pretext for his resignation, when his
chamber was suddenly entered by the good old Laporte.
“ No unsatisfactory news I trust from Florincthun ?
exclaimed Camille, after greeting the venerable man with
filial deference, and seating him affectionately by his side. ;
“At present none, Monsieur Camille,” replied the intend-
ant with a mournful air. “ My poor old master's infirm
state of body and mind precludes all necessity for commu-
nicating to him the disastrous intelligence of the degrada-
tion of his sovereign. And yet I sometimes think, sir, it
might be better to acquaint him at once with the true state
of public affairs ; – which would either bring down his
grey hairs in sorrow to the grave unoutraged and undis-
honoured, or determine him to quit this fated country, I
scarcely dare reflect upon the destiny reserved for his help-
less daughter and her unprotected family, by remaining in
the vicinity of Paris ! But it was not upon that point,
sir, I came to consult you.”
“ You are safe from interruption here," observed Camille,
perceiving that Laporte hesitated to explain himself, and
kept throwing suspicious glances round the apartment.
“ We are secure from observation here. My servants are
out of hearing, and I can rely upon their fidelity.”
“ Your servants ? -observed the old intendant, with an
unconscious air of irritation ; for it was the noble accom-
modation of Camille's habitation which had distracted his
attention, and provoked his vexation. “ Well, well! no
matter— times are changed !-- The good king is a captive,
the Comte Amédée a proscribed exile, — the Marquis de
St. Florentin -no matter ! — Why do I talk of this!-
it was of other grievances I came to speak !”

Valazy, towards whom in his childhood the old steward
had ever assumed the tenderness of paternal partiality, main-
tained a forbearing silence, to give him time to recover his
com posure. At length, he could no longer repress his
uneasiness " The marchioness the children
well?”.
“ My honoured lady is as well as the distracted state of
her mind will admit. But new misfortunes crowd upon
her, new afflictions menace her. Have you not
heard,” he continued, lowering his voice to a confidential
pitch of caution ; “ have you heard that our dear
chevalier accompanied their majesties to the Temple ?”.
“ The Chevalier de Mirepoix ? — His fidelity does him
honour.”
“ Honour?” cried the old man impatiently ;
- the time
is lost for prating of honour in France. What has a nation
of cut-throats and sans-culottes to do with the virtues of
chivalry?”
Laporte !” interrupted Camille, alarmed by his vehe-
mence.
- I can,
“ 'Tis your own fault, if I am incautious; you told me
you could answer for the fidelity of your servants.”
-J do !” cried Valazy, with a heightened com-
plexion; “ but be just and reasonable. Refrain from con.
founding the crimes of a lawless mob, with the sentiments
entertained by the enlightened portion of the community.”
Enlightened - enlightened, — what has come of their
enlightenment ? - What has it done, but guide them to the
commission of excesses, such as
“ It has guided them to the emancipation of the tiers
état,” cried Camille, somewhat touched in temper, by the
vexatious contempt of the old man ; an achievement of
which the social benefits will remain, when this temporary
state of popular excitement shall have subsided.”
- Tiers état!— Canaille ! - who ever heard of its ex-
istence during the prosperity of the monarchy ?”–
Valazy involuntarily smiled. • At least acknowledge,
my good old friend, that your former reproaches to me, -
your former angry charges against General La Fayette,--are
satisfactorily answered. — Rather than yield the frontier to

an enemy, or maintain it under the authority of the Jaco-
bins, he has fled the country !”
Ay!” as the incendiary abandons the ruined pile he
has consigned to destruction ! But a truce to these dis-
cussions ! You cannot expect, Monsieur Valazy, that a
greybeard like myself can march with the new order of
things; or that I — who predicted the future malignancy
of the boy Maximilien — and the future
“ Say nothing of the boy Camille !" interrupted Valazy,
affecting an air of gaiety; "say nothing of him, but that the
Laporte, who once loved and protected him, loves him still ;
and scorns to resent the chances of destiny, which have so
strangely elevated him above the accident of his birth.”
Laporte winced a little at the word accident. His feudal
prejudices were still strong upon him: but he extended his
hand cordially, and grasped that of his former favourite with
warm affection.
“ But the chevalier !” said he, resuming
his consequential air ; “ I came hither, deputed by the
marchioness, to acquaint you that her noble kinsman has
been removed from his service to his majesty, and impri-
soned at La Force. Stay, - I have a billet addressed to
you on the subject, by madame le marquise
“ From the marchioness ! — why did you not give it
me instantly?
Having delivered the deposit to the impatient Camille,
he amused himself during his perusal of the note, by
gazing leisurely round the apartment, the solid magnifi-
cence of which so moved his indignation ; nor could he
sufficiently surmount his narrow prejudices, to separate in
his mind the association between the fine bronzes and
marble consoles of the Capitaine Valazy, and the village
patois and costume of his mother, the bonne of Mademoi-
selle de Navelles.
“Madame la marquise appears warmly interested in the
destinies of this gentleman,” said he, refolding the billet
and replacing it in his vest.
During the absence of Count Amédée, she regards the
Chevalier de Mirepoix in the sacred light of her nearest
kinsman. His sister, Ma'mselle Léonie is an inmate of
Florincthun. The marquis loved the chevalier for his

bold and ardent spirit, for the frank and generous cha-
racter which so well became his ancient name.'
The view entertained of the case by Caniille was not
amended by this suggestion. It suffices,” said he,
sternly, “ that my mother's foster-daughter commands my
services in his favour. It is not for me, Monsieur La-
porte to inquire her motives of interest in his favour.
Assure her of the humble zeal with which I shall address
myself to the execution of her charge ; and though my
interference in behalf of so eminent a royalist will probably
draw upon myself the suspicions of my section, I shall re-
gard my safety of poor account, compared with the happi-
ness of marking my devotion to her will.”
“My dear boy,” cried the old man, moved almost to
tears by expressions so consonant with his feelings and
opinions, "you speak like the child of our good Madelon !
Forgive me, if I seemed just now to grudge or envy
your prosperity, Camille:- I find it has wrought no evil
on your heart or mind.”
Valazy readily and affectionately accepted the old man's
outstretched hands; and having promised to make such
efforts for the enlargement of Mirepoix as circumstances
would allow, Laporte took his departure for Florincthun.
“ And it is thus she regards the safety of one who
shared the sports of her infancy,- of one so dear to the
poor fond old woman she affects to cherish with such
grateful affection !” exclaimed Camille, slowly pacing the
room on Laporte's departure. “ After all, what matters
it to such as Emiline, how many plebeian hearts cease to
beat in the course of this dreadful struggle, or what
streams of ignoble blood are poured in the support of the
aristocracy? - I was born for no better purpose than to
uphold the dignity of the house of Navelles. She believes
me honoured by a commission to encounter the fierce ani.
mosity of a jacobinical section, to relieve her anxiety for
the fate of one of her knights ! But I have promised -
ay, and should promise again were she to demand of me
a service thrice as unreasonable, a thousand times more
perilous to myself! Well may Maximilien deride the folly
of my devotion to a being, who at best endures my sub-

missive homage, even in these hours of danger and degra-
dation; and who, in the season of her prosperous pride,
regarded me as no worthier than the lackey who carried
her mantle, and wore the cognisance of her house."
The name of Maximilien, and the recollection of his
taunts, served to recall to his mind the only person on
whom he could rely for aid touching the imprisonment of
the Chevalier de Mirepoix. Though for the last fifteen
months he had entertained no social communication with
his cousin, when chance necessitated their encounter in the
pursuance of his public duties, their recognition was kins-
manlike and friendly. Camille retained sufficient remem-
brance of his uncle's early kindness towards him, to
entertain a degree of interest in the destinies of Maxi-
milien ; and regarding him in the delicate predicament of
a debtor, was cautious to moderate, in their outward ex-
pression, the feelings of detestation with which he con-
templated the principles and conduct of his cousin. Max-
imilien, on the contrary, felt that the moment of triumph
had not yet arrived, which would enable him to display
the real character of his feelings towards the merchant of
Lyons; and he was willing to conciliate his patience by a
friendly demeanour, so long as the least chance existed of a
retrogression of the interests of his own party, or of a claim
on the part of his creditor. When speaking of his relative
among his Jacobin friends or at the Feuillans, it was his
custom to designate Camille as a Fayettist,-a trimmer,
one too cautious to become an overt friend to the embryo
republic, and too feeble to be important as an enemy.
But there was another person connected with the per-
sonal interests of both cousins, with whom Camille enter-
tained a more familiar intercourse, and upon whom he
more relied for aid on the present occasion. During the
tedious period of his imprisonment at Boisgelin, and his
consideration and re-consideration of the prospects of the Na-
velles' family and the deadly animosity entertained towards
them by Maximilien, he remembered with consternation
that the domiciliation of Flavie in the household of Madame
de St. Florentin must have initiated her into a thousand
facts tending to re-animate the hatred of her lover towards

225
Emiline. Notwithstanding his abhorrence of the part
taken by this misguided woman in furtherance of the
schemes of Maximilien, he made it a matter of policy on
his return to Paris, to conciliate her good-will by pecuniary
liberality,—even to a degree of profuseness, which she did
not fail to attribute to his anxiety that she should preserve
the secret of his visit to Madame de St. Florentin, on the
night of the escape to Varennes.
Soothed by the gra-
ciousness of his demeanour, so different from that of her
brutal protector, as well as by his lavish generosity, she
was disposed to forward his wishes. Flavie was, in fact,
a vain, frivolous woman, betrayed by folly into vice; but
incapable of the malicious wickedness characterising Max-
imilien Valazy.
Camille, who had once or twice followed up his views of
policy regarding her, by visits to her gorgeous abode, was
easily recognised by her porter, on presenting himself at her
hotel. But he was informed that Mademoiselle Audicourt
- the name she had assumed since her dismissal from the
establishment of Madame de St. Florentin was gone with
a party of female friends to assist at a debate at the frater-
nity of the Cordeliers. He resolved to seek her among the
audience of this extraordinary society; where it was by
no means uncommon for females of the lowest class to
interrupt the orations pronounced from the tribune, by
dissertations in their own fierce language, and expressive
of views and principles assuredly consonant with no other
dialect.
Just as he was leaving the porter's lodge, a carriage
drove through the gateway; and the loud voices and coarse
laughter of its inmates having attracted his notice, he
hastened to offer his hand to Mademoiselle Audicourt and
her female companion, in whom he recognised the celebra-
ted Desmahis, the beautiful mistress of Barrère. Camille
accepted their vociferous invitation to accompany them into
the hotel, where he compelled himself to listen to their ad-
miring details of the séance of the Cordeliers, and criti-
cisms on the tragedy of Timoléon, at a representation of
which they had since assisted in the royal box of the
Theatre François ! Pausing till they had exhausted their

ridiculous rhapsodies, Valazy at length commenced his ap-
peal to the amiable complaisance of Mademoiselle Audi-
court; and having by this time obtained a tolerable insight
into the official habits of the patriots, did not hesitate to
offer a specific sum as the price of her assistance.
“For my part,” replied Flavie, with the most un-
blushing effrontery, “I would not refuse your promised
recompense, could I in my conscience afford you any hopes
of obtaining the liberty of the muscadin Mirepoix. But I
can tell you better than any one, the difficulty of procuring
his release. Your cousin Max abhors him with the in-
tensity of hatred he so liberally bestows upon every person
remotely connected with the old twaddling crew at Navelles.
He never forgave you, Camille, for rescuing the proud St.
Florentin from his projected retribution, by an honourable
death ; and as Count Amédée thinks proper to keep at a
respectful distance from the Samsons and the lantern-posts of
Paris, while the superannuated duke remains safe, like
an old badger in his hole, at Florincthun, - Max feels that
he must for the present perforce content himself with the
blood of Reginald de Mirepoix. For my own part, I am
somewhat grieved for the plight of the poor young man ;
for the chevalier and I have had many a bout at nutting
in our old forest, when he used to visit Navelles during
his holidays; and
“ For the sake of early predilections, mademoiselle,
surely you will incline yourself to execute my commission?”
“ That would I, both for your sake and his. For be-
tween ourselves, Camille Valazy, those old days are the
only ones I suffer myself to look back upon, when I am
sitting here alone. But you know your cousin !- Max
would think nothing of grinding my heart into dust, if he
discovered my inclination to cross any of his favourite de-
signs. I no more dare intercede with him in favour of a
Navelles, or Mirepoix, than of Madame Veto herself -
“ But I,” interrupted the Desmahis, " have no such
restrictions on my tongue. Barrère detests the royalists
But he does not honour any of them with spe-
cific rancour.
Your friend here speaks us fairly, Flavie ;
and for the consideration he offers, I will undertake to pro-
en masse.

cure admittance to his friend, that they may arrange some
pretext on which to demand his release.”
“ I did not come empty handed to encroach upon your
services, said Valazy, taking from his bosom a pocket-
book, containing in assignats the allotted price of her in-
terference.
“ Your friend is an honest fellow, Flavie !” cried La
Desmahis, whose feminine beauty formed a revolting contrast
with the boldness of her air and freedom of her discourse.
Though he affects so much interest in the fate of this
pestilent royalist, I believe 'tis a good patriot after all.”
« For patriot
- I can say but little,” said Flavie, as
she divided the packet of assignats between herself and her
companion. But this I will say for Camille, in spite of the
malice which Max delights to charge against him, that for
many a long year he has been my true friend; and that in
my better days, before I had seen Paris and its sins, but
the season is not good for whimpering, and we will say
no more upon the subject.”
“ Yes! we will say one word more, if you please,” said
the friend of Barrère, in a low and cautious voice; and
'tis one which he will do well to carry away under his belt
to a place of safety, and examine at leisure. I had not
thought to favour a stranger so far as to enrich him by such
à possession ; but these winning arguments ” — showing
the assignats - "and your good word, Flavie, speak vo-
lumes in his favour. Know then, sir, that had you suf-
fered your zeal in behalf of your friend to sleep for a week
or so, it would have woke too late. The prisons at Paris
have been made a depository of all the minions of Ver-
sailles - all the Austrian's cringing slaves all the fierce
aristocrats of the ancien régime — only to afford facilities
for their extirpation. — A conspiracy is said to exist among
them against the friends to republicanism, which will be
quelled thus ! —" She drew her hand across her throat,
to signify the action of the guillotine ; and Camille, hor-
ror-struck but not surprised by this confidential revelation,
gazed with loathing on the beautiful lips which calmly
gave utterance to such expressions. Though attired with
the most studied elegance, Valazy could not but notice

that Euphroisine, in her masculine garments, possessed an
air of womanly reserve far more modest ; and took his
leave of Mademoiselle Audicourt and her companion, with
an emotion of disgust such as would scarcely have aug-
mented the zeal of their promised services.
But notwithstanding his personal contempt for the Circe
from whom he derived his information, Valazy did not
withhold his credence from her announcement touching
the impending fate of the royalist prisoners. La Desmahis
was known to possess unlimited influence over the mind of
Barrère. Her house, as well as that of Mademoiselle
Audicourt, was the resort of Robespierre, Marat, and the
other chiefs of the Cordelier party ; — and the intelligence
voluntarily conceded of the evil intentions cherished against
the helpless victims trembling in their gripe, materially
tended to enhance the value of a document placed in the
hands of Valazy on the following morning.
It was a municipal order in proper form for the delivery of
“s the body of Reginald de Mirepoix, ex-chevalier, accused
of incivism, and detained for having followed Louis Capet
and his family to the Feuillans, in defiance of the com-
mands of the procureur syndic.” Within the envelope
were a few words exhibiting the grossest defiance of gram-
mar and orthography, requiring Camille to ask no ques-
tions, and provoke no observation on the subject of the
certificate. “ Seek your friend," said his adviser, whom
he rightly conjectured to be Desmahis herself, — “ seek
your friend in the dusk of the evening,
through the barrier in a hackney-coach,
value his life and your own safety, let him hasten beyond
the Rhine without further delay. I have discovered that
your kinsman, M.V., is likely to prove an implacable enemy
to both.”
The information thus conveyed was no matter of surprise
to Camille. As regarded himself, or the Chevalier de Mire-
poix, it assumed no very appalling character.
reflecting upon the persecutions in the power of such a
wretch towards the widowed daughter of the Duc de Na-
velles, the hint became a matter of cruel apprehension ;
and this renewal of his fears for Emiline almost served to
convey him

invalidate the satisfaction with which, towards evening,
he prepared to mark his submission to her commands.
" She bad me effect the liberation of one who is dear to
to her,” thought Camille, on his way to the Hôtel de la
Force, “ and I have not even allowed my jealous heart to
deliberate upon the motives of her attachment. Madness
of affection! which her own temperate bosom, her own
calm measure of mechanical attachment, unfits her to ap-
preciate, to what infatuated humility and subservience
dost thou betray me !— Amid the wreck of national pros-
perity, I labour but for her sake. For her I mingle with
the blood-thirsty and the oppressors.
- For her
nouncing the pleasures of my age, direct my steps to scenes
of carnage and desolation ; - for her, neglect the duties of
filial tenderness, the overtures of my young companions,
the emotions of patriotic ardour. — And to what end ?
- That when I am mingled with the dust with which she
classes my degraded existence, Emiline may feel that I
loved her, that I served her, that I died for her,
with a devotedness of heart and soul such as her aristo-
cratic kindred forgot to task in her behalf.”
Such was the state of his mind, as he entered the
carriage in which he trusted to convey the Chevalier de
Mirepoix in safety to the presence of Madame de St. Flo-
rentin.

A prison is a house of care,
A place where none may thrive,
A touchstone true to try a friend,
A grave for one alive.

Sometimes a place of wrong,
Sometimes a place of rogues and thieves,
And honest men among.

berus, Le Beau, does not hear me proclaim the excellence
of any thing pertaining to female royalty,” cried the Che-
valier de Mirepoix, who was trying to beguile the tedious-
ness of imprisonment, and the oppression of the small and
stifling chamber which he occupied in common with seven
other prisoners detained at La Force on charges arising out
of the excesses of the 10th of August, by a game of piquet
with his relative, the Chevalier de Rhulières. or Tierce
to a knave ? Come ! that is somewhat more in our friend
Gaoler Le Beau's line of business."
“ Good, chevalier, very good.”
Play, then.”
“ Hark! the evening bell ! they might have spared
us that sonata of tintinnabular discord to-night. Not a soul
has ventured into the court this rainy afternoon.”
" Pardon me! - Lavoine has been stationed since din-
ner at his usual post under the great plane tree.”
" That boy must be in love ! I have never once seen
him smile since I made part of this honourable community;
though, to do justice to my own merits, I am not apt to
find my companions preserve an habitual gravity of fea-
ture.”
“Now you speak of it,” said the Comte de Beunouville,
another of the prisoners, “I no longer doubt that it is
Mirepoix's jokes which have rendered the unlucky lad so
melancholy! Ever since you read us your Quatrain at
dessert, my dear chevalier, Lavoine has posted himself
upon that solitary stone, where he perches like a hawk or
osprey from sunrise till sunset.'
* By the way,” exclaimed Mirepoix, nowise abashed by
the reproof of his friend, “ we shall be spared the repeti-
tion of Le Beau's courtesies this evening. We must con-
tent ourselves with the two blood-hounds with whom I
presume he has taken the Cerberian oath of 'Egalité et
fraternité;' or with the ingratiating Madame Le Beau
- that gentlest Scylla, whose barking and snarling pro-
pensities surpass the united properties of the three !
“ True ! he is taking his own turn of interrogation be-
fore the National Assembly. Madame Le Beau protested

frame with the fumet of our soup at dinner-time, that
Robespierre and the rest of the Cordelier faction insist
upon it we have formed a conspiracy against the admini-
stration, here in this lordly palace of ours. - A pretty in-
dependent place for a plot !”
“How can you jest on such a topic ? observed the
Chevalier de Rhulières, gravely. “Do you not perceive that
the object for charging us with supposititious crimes, must
be to form a plea for summary punishment ?
“ Perhaps that reflection makes poor Lavoine so doleful
this evening! I found him in tears just now, as I passed
through the court.”
“ Chicken-hearted vagabond ! Don't you know that
he belongs to the corps par excellence the lions of the
Tuileries, the grenadiers of the Filles St. Thomas ? -A
soldier in tears !”
“Chicken-hearted, or not,” observed Monsieur de St.
Brice, “I saw him escort Madame Thibaut through the
mob of poissards on the 10th of August, with a brow
wholly unchanged by menaces and imprecations such as
might have blanched the cheek of a veteran ; ay ! and with
as many muskets directed against his breast as there are
leaves on his favourite plane tree.”
As regards Rhulières' conjecture,” cried the chevalier,
“ of our impending fate, I am well content to close my
eyes on a world where peruques have given way to the
greasy coiffure of the bonnet rouge. Not so much as a
pliant left for the princesses at the Tuileries,
tabouret for our dear duchesses at Versailles ! And I
would rather be as dead as Marlbrook, than owe my liberty
to a gang of cut-throats, headed by the giant Maximilien
Valazy and his pet dwarf Couthon. But who comes
here? - That was not, after all, the curfew that jangled
so harmoniously just now. It was the porter's bell, who
is traversing the court-yard with the turnkeys and their
dogs, and a good-looking fellew, whose person seems fami-
liar to me. — Ha ! poor Lavoine ! the brutes have passed
the plane tree, without so much as looking upon him !
The lad must surely have thought they were bringing an

order for his liberation ; for observe how he stands gazing
after them, and wringing his hands.”
“ Poor fellow ! he will have many a disappointment of
this nature to encounter before he finds his way to the
right side of the Palais Le Beau. 'Tis strange how earnest
an expectation he seems to have formed of his release!
He sleeps in his uniform, lest he should be summoned
away in the night, and
“Hark! it is our chamber they are about to visit.
What can they want at this hour ?
“We want,” said the elder of the two turnkeys, entering
the room with a sulky demeanour,” the signature of citizen
Reginald Mirepoix, to certify that he was delivered up by
our hands to the agent of the Commune of Paris, in obedi-
ence to a summons to that effect, signed by Pethion, mayor,
and Barrère, commissioner of public safety."
“ Give you joy, — give you joy, chevalier !” cried the
voices of his companions; while Mirepoix, almost stupefied
by amazement, gazed upon the fine person of Camille
Valazy, who was standing between the two rugged turn-
keys, as if to receive him into custody, in a vain attempt
to discover the motive of his own deliverance, and the
views of his liberator.
“ Thanks, a thousand thanks !” cried Mirepoix,
striving to rouse himself. “ I trust I may be able to accept
the joy you give me, on ascertaining to what end I am
thus rescued from this cheerful summer residence ; at

“At present, sir,” hastily interrupted Valazy,
time presses for your departure. It is almost the hour for
closing the prisons."
“Which is as much as to say, that I am about, sir, to
become your prisoner instead of that of Citoyen Le
Beau ?
" I shall have the honour of conducting you as far as
Florincthun,” observed Camille, calmly, hoping to discover
what effect was produced upon the mind of Mirepoix by
this announcement.
“ To Florincthun ? --- Is it then my sister or my uncle

Impossible! the unhappy old man has scarcely discern-
ment left to know the difference between the Hôtel de la
Force, and the Hôtel de Navelles. But my fair cousin,

de St. Florentin who interested herself to procure the order
liberation ?”
My commission, monsieur le chevalier, extends no
further than to inform you you are free.”
“ Ha! I should surely know that ton d'Orosmane ?
Surely I address the foster-brother of my cousin Emiline,
one with whom I have played truant before now in the
forest of Navelles ? "
“My name, sir, is Valazy.”
“For your own sake, I could wish it a better one,
young man !” involuntarily exclaimed the Count de Beu-
nouville.
“ But Mirepoix,” inquired Monsieur de Rhulières,
“ surely you will not, after all, make up your mind to re-
turn to Salons without tabourets or plians ?
“ Bah! Let me only find myself among your Yankee
friends, yonder in Pennsylvania, — who sit upon sugar-
casks and rum-puncheons, and never heard the gentle
name of highness ! Let me only escape the grim smiles
of the ogress Le Beau ; and the flavour of poireaux, with
which our uncivilised chef repugnates the suppers of La
Force! Do me the justice to believe with what regret I
leave you, my good friends, to such fare, and in such
company !”

ado!” bawled the hoarse voice of the gaoler, who was driv-
ing the young grenadier from the court-yard to be locked
in with his companions for the night.
“By the mass,
Citoyen Valazy, I wish it had pleased you to fetch off
this starveling from our perch, instead of the young cheva-
lier there ; who, to do him justice, sings while he flaps his
wings against the wires. - But this moping owl whines
us to death."
Valazy, who was waiting impatiently while the chevalier
paused to receive the parting commissions of his friends
in misfortune, threw a hurried and careless glance on the
new-comer, who was slinking into his accustomed corner.
But it sufficed for recognition ! It told him, and with
what painful certainty, — that in the person of the prisoner
thus reviled, Euphroisine Delplanque stood before him !-
While the warm blood rushed betrayingly to his face, and
his voice faltered with excess of emotion, he perceived, by
a signal of caution on the part of his young friend, that
she forbad all expression of personal acknowledgment.
Yet how difficult to repress the exclamations of surprise,
sympathy, terror, and regret, with which he gazed on the
wasted outline of that beautiful countenance, and the tre-
mulousness of that faltering step! Disease and despair had
furrowed her youthful cheeks with strange defeatures ; and
when she advanced in turn to bid adieu to the Chevalier
de Mirepoix, her voice was hoarse with affliction,— yea,
hoarse as that which had so eagerly interposed in Camille's
behalf in the court-yard of the Tuileries, to pacify the
animosity of Théroigne de Méricourt !
Camille could scarcely subdue the conflict of his feelings,
on beholding this noble being so cruelly and perilously
situated. Gladly would he have devoted to her liberation the
interest which Madame de St. Florentin had obliged him to
exert in favour of her kinsman;-gladly would he have pur-
chased her freedom by any personal sacrifice; for to leave
the young and fair and excellent Euphroisine thus es-
tranged from companionship with her own sex, thus ex-
posed to the habitual conversation of libertines, and the
harsh insults of the gaolers of La Force, was a trial of pa-
tience almost beyond his fortitude.

“ Have you no commission, sir, for your friends in the
city ?” said he, advancing towards her as if prompted by
the common graciousness of compassion.
“I have no friends,” replied she, in the same hoarse
tone which had so startled him in the first instance.
" Some have abandoned me ; some I have abandoned.
I have no friends in Paris.”
- You have at least those who are interested to procure
your freedom ? '
She shook her head mournfully. “ The only liberator
I look to find, is one which I fancy no partisan of the
royal cause,
-the guillotine! Farewell, sir! Had I indeed
a friend, he would think as I do, that Death were my
most effectual comforter."
“No, by Heaven !” exclaimed Valazy, seizing and
pressing her hand. “ You have, I am persuaded, admiring
and tender friends, who will leave no effort unattempted
for your security.”
“Do not waste your eloquence on that mopard !” ex-
claimed the Comte de Beunouville. “ You will do little
towards his consolation, unless you bring him a provision
of sucre de pommes. 'Tis but a peevish homesick boy !”
Come, come !” said the Chevalier de Rhulières,
have all a right to cope with our wretchedness in our own
way : Lavoine with tears, and a sleepless pillow ;-our-
selves with piquet and calembourgs |--And now, Mirepoix,
if you are wise, be off while the wicket is still open. Do
not forget your friends and companions in misfortune ;
and we will occupy our leisure in praying Heaven to
prosper your efforts in our behalf. Above all, acquaint
us, if possible, minutely and authentically, with the con-
dition of the royal family."
The Chevalier de Mirepoix, profiting by this suggestion,
professed himself ready to accompany Valazy, whose tra-
velling-carriage was waiting at the outer gate ; and tore
himself from the friendly inhabitants of the little chamber
in which he had so impatiently borne his imprisonment,
with affected levity and sincere concern. Upon taking his
seat beside his companion, and finding himself on the road
we

to Claye, he had no voice in which to express his self-gra-
tulation or his gratitude for so unlooked for a deliverance.
But Camille was unconscious of the emotion of the che-
valier. He could not drive from his thoughts the piteous
smile with which the disguised Euphroisine had marked
his departure, or the grievous circumstance of finding her
thus situated, -- thus surrounded ; — with the miseries of
captivity in endurance, and the terrors of an ignominious
death in prospect. He was aware that Backmann, the
general of the Swiss guards, - Durozoi, the loyal journalist,
and La Porte, the intendant of the civil list, had been
beheaded on the preceding day in the Place du Carrousel,
- now called the Place Egalité — for their efforts on the
10th of August; and it was anticipated that few persons
having subjected themselves to imprisonment as partisans
of the royal cause would escape a similar severity of pu-
nishment.
Nor did the accounts of the state of the prison of La
Force, as carelessly related to him by the Chevalier de
Mirepoix by way of beguiling their journey, tend to relieve
his uneasiness; while his incidental allusions to the de-
spondency and broken constitution of the young grenadier,
Lavoine, sank deeply into the heart of Valazy. There was
something, indeed, in the character of Euphroisine's loyal
devotion, so heroic - so elevated So touched with un-
earthly fervour, -- that Camille could scarcely persuade him-
self to believe her subjected to the common casualties or
dangers of life. Still, so profoundly was he interested in
her unprotected destinies, that he would not hear of pass-
ing the night at Florincthun, lest he should lose a single
hour that might be improved to her advantage.
It was midnight when they arrived at the château ; and
Madame de St. Florentin, unexpectant of so speedy a ful-
filment of the commission she had addressed to her foster-
brother, had retired to rest. Yet notwithstanding the
promise offered as a bribe by Laporte, that madame la
marquise would give him an audience at the earliest hour
of the morning if he consented to remain, — notwithstanding
his fervent anticipation of her gratitude for so diligent a
compliance with her request, Camille would have considered

237
it as a criminal indulgence of selfishness,-a sacrilege
against the holiest of ties,— had he ventured at such an
instigation to estrange himself from the cause of a person
so good, and fair, and friendless, as Euphroisine.
His first care was to decide on the means of purchasing
further aid from such vile instruments as Flavie and her
friend. He had devoted all the funds at his command, to
the enlargement of the Chevalier de Mirepoix ; and was so
situated that he could not instantly produce a sum suffi.
ciently important to promise success, without exciting the
suspicions and inquiry of the notary in whose hands the
larger share of his fortune was deposited. Valazy had so
long and completely laid aside the sum of gold committed
to his charge by Euphroisine herself, that for a moment it
escaped his recollection. But when it occurred to him that
he was still in possession of the thirty thousand livres, he
no longer hesitated to address himself to his former assist-
ants.
But on visiting Mademoiselle Audicourt the following
morning, Camille found her in one of those fits of wayward
sullenness, with which persons of her degraded caste are
wont to avenge upon others their consciousness of degrad-
ation. Maximilien, she said, who was just gone to the
Assembly with Robespierre and Marat, had been so savage
as to refuse her the purchase of a beautiful château near
Ermenonville ; — the confiscated property of an emigrant
who, on hearing his sentence, had exclaimed like one of
the Roman patricians proscribed by Sylla, “ Ah! this is
for my villa ‘at Alba !” — By way of pretext for venting
her ill-humour, she protested that Maximilien's denial
could only result from his suspicion of the share she had
taken in the liberation of the Chevalier de Mirepoix.
“ With which at present,” observed Camille, coldly,
“ he cannot possibly be acquainted! Besides, if you are
apprehensive of exciting his displeasure by a further act of
mercy, say nothing to him on the subject; but persuade
your friend to use her influence with Barrère, and I will
assure you, in return, the purchase of the villa at Erme-
nonville.”

“ Camille !” said Flavie, looking him steadfastly in the
face, “ either you are a very great fool, or Lyons must be
paved with gold !-- What can you mean by throwing away
your money for a pack of thriftless, useless, ungrateful
aristocrats; who, if the wheel of fortune should turn,
would hold you unworthy even to grace their presence ?
– There is the proud woman your foster-sister, for ex-
,ample, whose caprices Maximilien compelled me to endure,
that I might give the alarm of any measures projected at
the Tuileries. — Do you remember how haughtily she re-
pelled your offers of service, the night her husband went
off upon his fool's errand to help the royalties over the
frontier ? - Think you that Madame de St. Florentin, even
if compelled to accept life and limb at your hands, would
ever learn to regard you otherwise than the parvenu son of
her old servant?”
Flavie was little aware how deeply she probed the
wounded pride of her visiter by this interrogation. The
plight of Euphroisine alone repressed the angry rejoinder
rising to his lips.
“ But we are not speaking now of Madame de St. Flo-
rentin. — We are not now speaking even of an aristocrat.
This poor young soldier —”
Nay! if it be a soldier, and young, Eulalie will not
dare urge a word in his favour. Barrère is as jealous as a
tiger; and reproached her even to tears this morning for
her interference in behalf of a muscadin, such as Mirepoix.”
“ If that be all,” cried Camille incautiously, your
friend may plead the cause of mine without incurring
hazard or suspicion; the Lavoine for whom I would have
her intercede, is in truth a woman!”
“ Ahi, ahi, ahi!” - cried Flavie, bursting into an im-
moderate shout of laughter – « Our cousin Camille the
precisian, formerly so nice in his company and so prudish
in his preachments, and whom we hear ridiculed as a Cato
by all his brethren of the epaulet, improves, methinks,
with his sojourn in the capital !”
“ Have a care, Flavie !" observed Camille, gravely.
“ Forbear to trifle, even in thought, with the good name of

my whole soul !” cried Valazy, with fervour.
“ Then Camille, my friend,” returned Mademoiselle
Audicourt, in a confidential tone, “ spare not labour, nor
money, nor intercession, to procure her release. I have
no power to assist you; and common charity prompts me
to own that within a week, every royalist prisoner in
Paris will have contributed with his life towards the
foundation of a republic !”
“ Great God, what do I hear? ” ejaculated Camille ;
“ and the king and queen
“ Are reserved for a slower, but not less assured con-
demnation. Eulalie Desmahis advised you to hasten the
flight of that popinjay cousin of the St. Florentins; and
now -- and with far greater certainty of the coming evil, I
warn you to save your friend from the general massacre."
“My poor, unbappy Euphroisine!"-
Surely, not the daughter of the pompous old silk-
mercer, who used to live in the Rue St. Honoré; and
whose books I still honour, by keeping my name inscribed
therein to the amount of a few thousand livres ?”
Camille did not reply. The querist read assent in his
looks.
“ That silly girl was ever a mad-brained enthusiast !
A pretty doll, treasured up into self-conceit by the notice
of the queen, and the flatteries of Madame Thibaut.”
Still compassion cannot but urge you -
“ To do my best in her favour. Not, however,
because you would bribe my assistance - or because the
Austrian tenders her minion with so dear an affection.
But I reverence the girl, and will serve her ; - because,

knowing me to be the abject thing I am, she never de-
meaned herself towards me with pride or contempt.-
Grave she was in truth —nor ever jested with me, nor
spoke in other terms than the course of business might
demand between us. But no stranger would have guessed,
from her carriage towards me, that she despised and
loathed me as so different - so very different from her-
self.”
“ Unfortunate being !” cried Valazy. " With such
generous sentiments, why degrade yourself by enduring
the condition to which your folly has betrayed you ? — 1,
Flavie, - I who remember you at Navelles, — who have
seen you turning your wheel at your mother's door, cannot
bear to reflect-
“ Hush ! hush!- I am in no humour for your prosings.
Do not vex me, do not distress me. I must lose no time
in the furtherance of our project. It would be a thorn to
my future peace, to know that poor Euphroisine Del-
planque was suffered to perish, when exertions on my own
part might have saved her.
Go, Camille ! — If you
chance to meet with Max, speak him fair, and do not
exasperate him by allusions to politics, or pecuniary mat-
ters; for it is these two points that provoke him to seek
your ruin.”
" To seek my ruin ?”
“ I have said more than I intended ; yet you cannot be
ignorant that modérantisme on the part of one bearing his
name must be sufficiently galling to a good patriot.
Maximilien detests a Fayettist more than even a thorough-
paced royalist ! But go!—I have no time to waste on
politics !"

FLAVIE AUDICOURT did not offer her pledge of service
without a sincere intention of redeeming it; and her first
measure was to pay a visit of consultation to Mademoiselle
Desmahis; the arrangement of whose abode rendered it
necessary, as in most Parisian dwellings of the middling
class, to traverse the dining-room to reach the boudoir of
her friend. In this first chamber, to which she was at
first denied admittance, Flavie was astonished to find
assembled round a table covered with files of papers,
Danton, Pethion, Max Valazy, Robespierre, Tallien,
Camille Desmoulins, Marat, as well as the master of the
house, and several members of the assembly belonging to
the Cordelier faction.
“ Who interrupts us?” -exclaimed Barrère, fiercely,
as she entered the room; while Robespierre accosted her
with the gracious and benignant air he could so well as-
sume; and Desmoulins addressed her as she passed with
some of those flowery phrases of which he was habitually
prodigal.
“ 'Tis only that fool Flavie !” cried Maximilien, im-
patiently. “Let her go in, Barrère. She will engage
that
bird of yours, who is sulking yonder in her cage, in such
feminine chirupings as will keep our counsel safe from the
ears of both. — Go, Flavie! — Let us hear and see no more
of you.”
During the short space of time in which she had ap-
proached the gloomy conclave, where she stood with her
hand wresting upon the shoulder of Maximilien Valazy, her
quick eye had caught sight of muster rolls, and a large plan
outspread upon the table, in which the relative positions of

the prisons of Paris were so coloured as to stand in pro-
minent relief. Flavie entertained not the slightest doubt,
that in spite of the ferocious mirth and noisy pleasantry of
the party, they were arranging the measures to be adopted
in a general massacre of the prisoners, the design of which
had been already hinted in her presence by several of the
gang! In her suspicions, she was fully confirmed by the
information of Desmahis; nor did these two worthy asso-
ciates express any further sympathy in the fate of the pre-
destined victims, than as connected with the disguised
grenadier of the Filles St. Thomas, whose safety was ren-
dered a matter of interest to their rapacity by the generous
proposals of Camille Valazy,
After a discussion between them as to the most feasible
plan of lending, or rather selling him their assistance, the
treacherous confederate of Barrère conducted her visiter to
a dilapidated part of the wainscot, through which the deli-
berations of the salle à manger were occasionally audible.
For the most part, the members of the secret committee
expressed their sentiments in the deep, low, concentrated
tones becoming the lugubrious character of the discussion.
Twice, however, Danton-in his allusions to the sacrifice
of the beautiful Princesse de Lamballe, the virtuous
daughter-in-law of the Duc de Penthièvre, the beloved friend
-- was heard to burst into a paroxysm of tri-
umphant joy; while Marat, the fiercest and most depraved
of the demons gathered in that fiendish couneil, expressed
his exultation in terms terrific even to the contaminated
beings who were concealed auditors of his invectives.
Robespierre, meanwhile, who had not yet cast off that
exquisite mask of hypocrisy under which he long concealed
from his most intimate associates the uncompromising and
engrossing ambition to which he had predetermined to sa-
crifice both rival and friend, affected to moderate the san-
guinary menaces of Marat ; and to concoct with Barrère
some new scheme of decimation, by which at least a por.
tion of the prisoners might be withheld from slaughter,
till the temper of the public mind should have manifested
itself. But nothing, he admitted, could form a more judi-
cious prologue to the sacrifice of the king and queen, than
of the queen

the still stronger bond of a common interest, should take

goblins and loup-garoux ? – We were told the citizens
would interfere to prevent the abduction of the king and
queen from Versailles. We were assured the citizens'
would rescue Foulon and Berthier ; — would guard the
Tuileries against the insane ruffians of St. oine on the
20th of June ; would forbid the incarceration of Capet
and his wife! And have we not ever found that the

ragged urchins, will suffice to keep them safely barricaded

“You defame your countrymen !" cried Camille Des-
moulins, angrily. “They have ever called for vengeance
on the perpetrators of public outrages.”
“ Call for vengeance ! — ay ! as they would call for a
glass of iced lemonade at the Café de Foi ! - Easy to
invoke the deliberate assistance of the laws, and punish the
excesses of an hour of irritation by a stroke of the pen
from a pack of pompous blockheads in black robes !

the government whose protection it affects to venerate,
whose constitution to maintain, - trust me it is not to be
found within the six sections of Paris."
“An auspicious prospect for the future republic !” ob-
served Maximilien Valazy, with a sneer.
“We must educate our good citizens to our own good
liking !” cried Danton, with a coarse laugh. “We must
teach them a few useful lessons before their schooling is
ended ; beginning with a general cleansing of the prisons
from the aristocratic lumber thrown into them to be out of

Flavie and her companion exchanged glances of dismay.
“But these infected members of the community amount,
according to the lists before us, to three thousand souls?”
said Robespierre, with an affectation of uneasiness.
“ And what then ? - If you destine a flock of one
hundred sheep to the abattoir, you double the number of
knives you would hire for the slaughter of fifty. We shall
find honest fellows enough in the Faubourgs, and among
the market porters, to exterminate the vermin in our war-
rens at so much per hundred.”
“A pretty census the list will form for the future ar-
chives of history !”
History ? —the transmitted lie of ages ! - What rea-
sonable being cares for posthumous sermons ! - Besides, let
the first object of our emissaries be to commit to the flames
every document and register found in the bureaux. We
will at least cheat the curiosity of the uninitiated as to the
extent of our retribution.”
“ But the National Guard ? ”– inquired Robespierre.
“Remember the part they acted on the 10th of August.”
“ Be assured that it was only the mercenaries who joined
the Federates in their attack upon the Tuileries. The
national troops, - the military representation of the people,
— will scarcely endure the spectacle of summary execution
without trial.”
They will follow wherever their commandant is pleased
to point the way."

• They would have followed La Fayette, like a drove of
moles, into the crater of Vesuvius, had he assured them
that such was their civic duty ; or that Liberty, like a sala-
mander, was glowing at the bottom. But since they fancied
themselves betrayed by him in his defence of the king, they
have thought proper to open their eyes : I doubt whether
they would follow Santerre further than his kitchen fire !"
“Even in Santerre himself,” interrupted Marat, “I
have no decided confidence. The brute has a thousand
physical accomplishments,-has a bold word for the ear
of the people, and a bold arm to make it good; and were
the strength of our bonhomme Samson to fail him, Santerre
would gladly volunteer to administer the sharp physic of
the guillotine to every member of the royal family. But
I am doubtful whether the principles of his republicanism
are sufficiently firm and comprehensive, to assist in plunging
three thousand individuals into the gulf of Curtius.”
“ Be under no further apprehension on the subject of
the National Guard,” cried Danton. “I settled this
morning, with Santerre and Acloque, that a grand review
should take place at Versailles on one of the first days of
September, so as to rid us of their blundering officiousness;
while by appearing there ourselves, we shall escape all sus-
picion of personal interference in the massacre of the
prisons. I will now read to you the subordinate arrange-
ments I have formed among the turnkeys and our private
troops, who are to be made known to each other by wearing
a tri-coloured sash and a wheat-ear by way of decoration !”
“ And the bodies — surely you will not leave them in
the prison courts, to spread a pestilence in the city, and
provoke the comments of the citizens ? "
“Do not distress yourself !- Valazy has undertaken to
bespeak half-a-dozen carts from his workmen of St. Mar-
ceau, to convey the corpses to Charenton without further
ceremony.'
The list of hired assassins was now inaudibly run over
by the conspirators; and the two women, sickened by all
they had heard, crept away into another chamber to debate
on their probabilities of success in the rescue of young

Lavoine. For Flavie had not judged it expedient to make
her bolder and more unfeeling companion familiar with
the whole truth; nor did she even dare acquaint Camille,
when he visited her on the morrow to learn the result of
her inquiries, with the information she had surreptitiously
acquired. She stood too much in awe of the savage Max-
imilien and his terrible associates, to trifle unnecessarily
with their secrets.
From the intelligence she gathered on the other hand
from Camille Valazy himself, Mademoiselle Audicourt was
enabled to verify her previous information. He had al-
ready received from Acloque instructions relative to the
projected review; and being equally unwilling to quit
Paris while his unfortunate young friend remained in so
critical a predicament, or prolong his service in a body
which, under its new generalissimo, gave daily evidence of
tractability to the influence of those unprincipled beings
who had usurped the reins of government, he sought a
private audience with the commandant of his legion, and
informed him that the state of his health no longer per-
mitting his residence in the capital, he was under the ne-
cessity of seceding from his post, and retiring to his estates
in Artois. With the intention of entering into the pro-
vincial gendarmerie, he solicited such certificates and re-
commendations as might insure him the notice of the
commune of Arras; and Acloque, who in any other in-
stance would have exerted a jealous cognisance of the
motives inducing one of the most distinguished officers of
the National Guard to withdraw himself at such a moment,
to seek enrolment in the paltry militia of the provinces,
was well content to accept the resignation of Camille with-
out further investigation.
He had been long jealous of Valazy's popularity with
the ranks, and of the bold self-possession with which he
occasionally delivered his opinion at head-quarters; and
ascribed what he considered his youthful self-conceit to his
apprenticeship in the school of La Fayette, and the in-
fluence derived from his famlly connection with one of the
leading orators of the Assembly. Having gladly furnished
him with the necessary documents, he took leave of his
young subordinate with affected sympathy in the infirmities

class;
necessitating his retirement from service so active as that re-
cently imposed upon the military guard of the metropolis.
Just as Camille Valazy was descending the steps of the
convent in which the sittings of his section were held, he
espied at the corner of the street his cousin Maximilien
engaged in earnest discourse with three men of the lowest
two of them apparently mechanics of the Fau-
bourg, and the third a species of ruffianly swaggerer of
that equivocal and nameless order, which the disorders of
the revolution drew into notice from the infamous retreats
in which it had previously concealed itself from legal in-
quisition. To evade a meeting, or pass him without recog-
nition, would have afforded an idle provocation. Camille,
with great reluctance, compelled himself en passant to offer
his hand in friendly greeting to his kinsman.
Maximilien, who had apparently terminated his colloquy
with his respectable associates, not only returned this mark
of graciousness with threefold but turning hastily
round, inquired of Camille whither he was going, as if dis-
posed to bear him company.
“I am bound on a tedious errand,” said Camille, who
could not endure to lend his arm to a man against whom
he nourished such feelings of dislike. “I am going to
cross the water to Vaugirard.”
“ With all my heart. I have business on the Place
Egalité, where we will part convoy.
But how come you
to be on foot, my dainty coz? — I hear you have chariots
and horsemen at command like the kings of antiquity; for,
thank Heaven! the king' ceases to be a term of com-
parison.”
“ I have been engaged on municipal business at my
section. A citizen cannot be too modest in his mode of
fulfilling his public duties.”
“ I could scarcely trot it myself on more patriotic prin-
ciples ! - But perhaps you will not object to the modest
luxury of a fiacre ?"
“ Nay! let us walk - since walking is the order of the
day," cried Camille, unwilling to place himself in a position
which would render it difficult to escape his undesirable
companion.

" I conclude
you have been taking the orders of that ass
Acloque, for the exhibition he is about to make of his
military insufficiencies at Versailles ? — It was a pity that
we could not conscientiously retain the services of a few
such fellows as Mandat; who, from their former duties in
the royal guard, had at least learned to distinguish their
right hand from their left; which is more than one can
expect from an automaton that has been swimming in
barm ever since it was as high as a hogshead.- But it
would not do! those fellows of Capet's are branded as
soul-deep with the fleur-de-lys, as a galley-slave bears his
cauterised sentence of “Travaux forcés !' The civic guard
is one of the great limbs of the nation ; and like a human
limb betraying symptoms of gangrene fatal to the body,
the mischief must be sought out, — and amputation
promptly employed. At present, we have been satisfied to
lop away merely the infected parts.”
He looked significantly at Camille, as he spoke.
“I believe Acloque to be a thorough-going and zealous
revolutionist,” said he, affecting an air of unconcern. I
know not what you can desire more.”
“Do you not ? — Then in compassion to your ignorance
I will inform you.
We want republicans,
stern, self-
contemning republicans, — who, like the elder Brutus, will
sanction with averted face the outpouring of kindred blood;
or, like his great descendant, plunge a dagger in the
heart of their dearest friend in defence of the liberties of
their country. - We want men who will not shrink from
the clamour of the tyranny of Europe, while the fierce
necks of the aristocracy of France demand the spurning
foot, the exterminating guillotine! We want men who
will loose with unsparing hand those sluices of noble blood;
which can alone wash out the stains of degradation from
the destinies of an insulted people. — We want men whom
the bugbear name of regicide will not deter from affording
a lesson to the nations of the earth, such as may re-
deem whole centuries from impending oppression.

“Where?” — exclaimed Maximilien, fiercely; for he
anticipated an allusion, on the part of his cousin, to the
companions he had just quitted.
" In the authors of the Publiciste - the Père Duchesne
the Vieux Cordelier ! In Danton, Marat, Hébert, and
Laclos!”
"By the way,” interrupted Maximilien, “ I learn from
Flavie that it was your golden eloquence which persuaded
her to interfere in procuring the enlargement of that reptile,
Mirepoix ; — the fellow I had reserved to open the ball of
a little entertainment that will shortly recreate the aris-
tocrats of Paris ? “ Please to observe, that if you con-
tinue your worship to my household gods-
or house-
hold goods, — the time may come when I shall make
reprisals.”
“I accept the challenge,” said Camille, anxious to dis-
cover whether Mademoiselle Audicourt had acquainted him
with his interest in the fate of young Lavoine, or with any
other particulars respecting that unhappy prisoner.
“ But, remember, Camille, my fine fellow, when next
you are inclined to buy a condemned sheep out of the flock
belonging to the nation," resumed Maximilien, laughing,
you will make a better bargain by applying to one of the
shepherds ; – to myself, for example.'
“ You jest, Maximilien !”
“ Not I - by the beard of Charlemagne ! Excepting
one of the family of Navelles, I would sell you half a
dozen aristocrats at the price which Flavie and her friend
fixed on the head of young Mirepoix ; which, by the by,
was not, à juste prix, worth more than a head of brocoli
Maltese.”
“ I have still a friend detained in the prison of La
Force,” hesitated Camille, “ whom I would willingly ran-
som on such terms, and
“ For whose release you have been already trafficking !
I thought as much, in spite of Flavie's indignant denial !

My predilections are less ambitious. I offer you five
hundred Louis d'ors for the liberation of a young soldier of
the section Des Filles St Thomas."
“ By name?”
Jacques Lavoine !” answered Camille, with a degree
of confusion that could not have escaped Maximilien's
notice, had he not been engaged in running over the leaves
of a note book which he took from his bosom.
“ Um ! — um ! - Jacques or Jacquot Lavoine aged
19 — arrested on the 10th of August, while defending the
door of the queen's apartment against the Marseillois !”
« The same.”
" And what may
be
your
motive of interest in a miserable
dog, worthy only to turn a spit or a cutler's wheel?”
Camille, perceiving that Maximilien was in the act of
recourse to his former modes of cross-examination, calmed
down his ruffled spirit, and replied, “ Nay, if I buy your
mercy, you must purchase my secret. I shall diminish
twenty louis d'ors for every interrogatory you require me
to answer.”
“ You will get no gold from me.
I am poorer than
a Franciscan. Yet Flavie complains of my niggardli-
ness !”
“ These are not times for prodigality of any kind,” re-
joined Camille, coldly. “But it is every man's business
to look to the needs of a kinsman. Oblige me, therefore,
Max, by compliance with the request I have urged on your
good nature ; and I will double the sum proposed by
way of loan.”

“ On your own terms. Make a note of my demand in
your tablets; and on the fulfilment of the compact on your
part, the money shall be forthcoming. When may I expect
an order for the release of this unlucky lad?”
By to-morrow night — or never!” replied Maximilien,
significantly. “ But you will be at Versailles ?"

“ You will obtain neither leave nor indulgence at the
present crisis. But what if I were to grant hospitality to
your friend until your return ?'
“ Not for worlds !” cried Camille, with inadvertent
eagerness.
“ Nay! then it is as I thought,” muttered Maximilien.
And having transacted his pecuniary business with his
cousin, he took a hasty leave, and turned into an adjoining
bookseller's shop, frequented by Ramond, Vergniaud, Carra,
St. Just, Louvet, Desmoulins, and other of the literary
fomenters of the revolutionary troubles.
" It is as I
thought! Some mystery attaches itself to the pet prisoner
of my cousin Camille. As I have no intention to sell my
cat in a basket, I will visit La Force this evening, and
acquaint myself with the truth.”
CHAPTER X.
Les générations futures se refuseront à croire que ces forfaits exécrables ont
pu avoir lieu chez un peuple civilisé, en présence du corps législatif, sous les
yeux et par la volonté des dépositaires des lois, dans une ville peuplée de huit
cent mille habitans; restés immobiles et frappés de stupeur à l'aspect d'une
poignée de scélérats soudoyé pour commettre des crimes. Le nombre des as-
sassins n'excédoit pas trois cens.- Paris en 1792.
CAMILLE, who was restrained by his declarations to his
late commandant, from venturing into public till the Na-
tional Guard should have taken its departure to Versailles,
resolved to remain in strict seclusion, in the hope of re.
ceiving such a missive from Max Valazy, or Mademoiselle
Desmahis, as would enable him to visit La Force in triumph,
and rescue his young friend. He entertained little doubt
of procuring an immediate refuge at Florincthun for the
unfortunate girl.
Evening came,
but still no letter arrived from either of
his agents; and Camille was forced to content himself with

despatching to the prison a present of fruit and wine, which,
as a pretext for a cheering message, one of the turnkeys
was induced by a bribe to convey to the soldier Lavoine.
Though Camille was persuaded that time had been found
necessary to legalise the documents he demanded, and that
the morrow would assuredly produce the fulfilment of an
engagement rendered urgent by the well-known disorder of
his cousin's finances, he could not divest himself of a vague
apprehension, - a painful presentiment, a thousand chi-
meras of indefinite evil. It was not till morning he threw
himself on his couch ; and being roused from his sleep a
few hours afterwards by a startling sound in the street, he
perceived that the day was already advancing to its meri-
dian. For a moment he flattered himself he had been dis-
turbed by the arival of a messenger from Maximilien. But
he was soon undeceived by the bawling of a common crier
under his windows, — announcing the taking of the city
of Verdun by the Prussians; and accusing its inhabitants
of having favoured the entrance of the enemy.
The first idea which suggested itself to Camille, was
that of Boisgelin and its worthy inhabitants, exposed to
the excesses of a conquering army. His next was that of
surprise, that the authorities should permit the circulation
of intelligence diffusing general alarm throughout the city.
Already the Parisians were running from house to house,
with assurances that the Prussian troops were on their
march towards the capital ; and the celebrated decree of
the 11th of July, that “ The country was in danger," was
recognised as on the point of justification. In defiance of
all personal considerations, Camille resolved to visit the
Hôtel de Ville, to satisfy himself of the authenticity of
the news. But long before he reached the Place de Grève,
he encountered a throng of municipal officers, riding in
scattered groups through the quays, and Boulevards, – at-
tempting by proclamations to animate the zeal of the
populace, and excite the more respectable portion of the
citizens to arm themselves against the enemy.
He learned also from the casual information of several
of his friends who, like himself, were tempted forth by
the great interests of the day, that the Assembly had been

engaged in a nocturnal sitting ; and attributing to this
official duty the negligence evinced by Maximilien in the
discharge of his private engagements, determined to make
his way towards the Feuillans, and await the breaking up
of the Assembly, for the purpose of renewing his solicit-
ations. To reach this point, it was desirable to traverse
the gardens of the Palais Royal ; which, during the early
part of the Revolution, was the gathering place of the male.

lieu towards the archway, he was touched familiarly on the
shoulder by a young lieutenant of artillery, with whom he
had become intimately acquainted during his service on the
staff of La Fayette.

“ And the Prussians,— will you not defer your depart-
ure, that you may welcome them to the Porte St. Denis ?”
“ I should as soon expect to find them next week at Mar-
seilles ! A handful of Prussian troops march upon Paris ?

that armed force now in existence would
venture to defy the palladium of such a city ? — or do you
perceive signs of terror among these badauds?”- continued
Buonaparte, pointing contemptuously to a throng of well-
dressed citizens, crowding the shops of the restaurateurs.
“Trust me," persisted Valazy, we have still arduous
work upon our hands.”

dainty for munition-bread, I would persuade you to re-
nounce the old-woman work of the civic guard, and come
with me to Chambéry.”
“ I fancy,” said Camille, unwilling to enter into an ex-
planation of his position, “ we shall soon want a few old
women to qualify the fierce impatience of the National
Guard."
“ ça ira — ça ira !” cried the young Corsican, with an
ironical smile. “ For my part, I feel no impatience unless
in listening to the empty nothings with which your cousin
Max Valazy's charlatan friends attract a tribe of gaping
fools in wonder of their eloquence. Enter the garden
yonder, and you shall see Couthon surrounded by a flock
of wide-mouthed idiots, waiting to swallow every shallow
phrase he is pleased to utter; --- as if a single deed were
not worth a legion of words !”
“ Not such deeds as some we have latterly witnessed.”
“ Bah! a thousand idle tongues become busy in exag-
gerating every excess committed during the heat and in-
temperance of revolutionary movements. Those which
disfigured the ancient monarchy, were whispered over in
the polite murmurs of courtly subservience, or hidden be-
neath the threefold screen of the Bastille !”
« Well, well! - we know you of old for a malecontent.
But at least, let our next news from Sardinia speak of
actions worthy of words.”
I ask but time, to give you ample subject for conver-
sation,” cried the young soldier, with a stern smile; then
bidding adieu to Valazy, he was lost among the contending
crowds emerging from the gateway.
“ And such, but for this mad, this engrossing passion,
such would be my own destiny," thought Camille, as
almost unconsciously he threaded the crowd congregated
in the courts and gardens of the Palais Royal. “ Buona.

military life that heraldic escutcheon SO valueless in
itself, —so weighty in the world's esteem,--denied me by
my birth. 'Tis but to efface the obscurity of his origin,
that Max Valazy would draw down the aristocracy of
France to his level; while I, on the contrary, would wil-
lingly array myself in social honours, of which the acquire-
ment might serve to elevate me in my own estimation and
that of the world. And why should not I, too, seek ser-
vice in Sardinia ? The certificates I hold would obtain
for me the notice of the minister of war. -Napoleon Buo-
naparte bas no protector but his sword. Like him, I might
obtain a grade in this new corps. Like him, indulge in
hopes that my hand might hereafter assist in planting
laurels for my country. My mother is settled in prospe-
rous tranquillity in the station of life best suited to her
happiness ;-and Emiline has in her favourite Mirepoix a
friend whom her pride will never tempt her to disavow.”
While his thoughts proceeded in this strain, and his
eurling lip and flashing eye bore evidence to the fierce
emotions of his soul, a female, who had repeatedly at-
tempted to attract his notice, laid her hand upon his sleeve,
and walked on as if inviting him to follow. Camille, ir-
ritated by this interruption to the course of his meditations,
turned abruptly round, and was on the point of proceeding
in an opposite direction, when the same muffled figure was
again by his side.
“ I would speak to you
would speak to you of La
Force !” – muttered the stranger, in a disguised voice; and
Camille was no longer resentful of her importunities. - He
turned anxiously to accompany her in the direction she
had originally indicated ; but on perceiving that she seemed
anxious to avoid the appearance of being accompanied,
delayed his steps for a few seconds; then deliberately
followed her through the crowded gardens, and into the
obscurity of a narrow street, traversing the Rue St. Honoré,
where she turned into the archway of a mean porte cochere.
Here she paused ; and Camille was by her side in a
moment. But though she did not attempt to remove the
veil by which her features were obscured, and panted with
haste and agitation so as to be almost inaudible, he soon

discovered that his mysterious companion was no other
than Flavie herself.
“ Camille,” said she, incoherently, “why did you leave
homewhy not await intelligence from me? — I have been
following you far and near, for I know that not a moment
is to be lost-but.
“ Take breath, Flavie ! compose yourself accept

By my bold disobedience to the commands of
Max in seeking this meeting, you little guess what a penalty
of reproaches and cruelty I may have incurred !”

“ You! Nay, Camille, neither you nor any other person
can protect me from the torments to which I have bound
myself. I loved him—I loved Max—followed him
quitted all for him—and he has beaten and reviled me for
my folly. Yet again would I forfeit all for his sake,
again follow him, -again cleave to him, — though I know
that it would be only to encounter evil usage — for I love
him still! - Now, Camille, do you perceive that you can-
not protect me?”
" I do indeed -and pity your infatuation! But your
business with me, dear Flavie !— In mercy proceed.”
“ Well may you hasten me— for, alas ! life and death
hang upon this day; and I — who thought I had courage
to bear many things, and glory in every event fulfilling the
hopes of Max and of his party — cannot endure to think
of this.”
“ To what horrible circumstance do you allude ? — Be
more explicit, I beseech you. Have you succeeded in your
attempt to procure the liberation of Euphroisine ?

mine !-Spies are dispersed throughout the city, - posted

ations ?”.
- Alas!
a terrible oath, forbids me to un-
fold the truth ! Thus much I may acknowledge, without
compromising my duty to Maximilien and my own safety.

instead of prospering in my efforts to serve the cause of
Lavoine, I have been bitterly reviled for the assistance I
presumed to yield you in procuring a certificate of release
for the young aristocrat, Mirepoix. This very night, the
destiny of that unhappy creature, Euphroisine, will be
placed beyond the reach of mercy, unless by bribery, stra-
tagem, or personal exertion, you contrive to extricate her
from La Force!”
“ You cannot mean that violence will be attempted
on a poor defenceless prisoner; - that the blood of a
captive

" But you, who are aware of the full extent of this pe-
rilous secret, you, Flavie, will counsel me

more than
all
- shall be yours.
“ Camille !-this is not a service to be chaffered for with

insignia of the murderers are a tri-coloured sash, and a
wheat-ear in the button
A lugubrious and well-known sound arrested the words
upon her lips.
“ Hark !” cried Camille, “it is the toc-
sin ! -- The municipality, terrified by the intelligence
from the frontier, warns the citizens to arms.”
« Oh ! – no no !” cried Flavie wildly ;“ I tell you
'tis a signal for a massacre of the prisoners. The work of
death is beginning: has begun! Farewell, Camille !
I dare not delay another moment.”
She dashed from his side as she spoke ; and her manner
and expressions were qualified with such frantic violence,
that Camille was vempted to believe the whole of her re-
velation had been prompted by insanity. The tocsin,
which still resounded through the air, might be a precau-
tionary signal bespeaking further news of the march of the
Prussian army.
To satisfy himself more fully, he directed his steps
towards the Hôtel de la Force; and as he approached that
fated spot, it appeared to him that every face he en-
countered was expressive of increasing horror. His heart
began to beat with vague uneasiness; when, in an adjoin-
ing street, he perceived Monsieur Bresson, the deputy of
Les Vosges, known to him in his capacity of a private
citizen, as an upright man, and unbiassed lover of his
country, who was stopping in his cabriolet to question a
corporal of the National Guard.
“ You are well met,” said he, on receiving the greeting
of Camille. “Santerre, I find, sleeps to-night at Versailles
for the review. - Tell me, I beseech you, to whom must
I address myself as second in command ?
“I am ignorant what sections have been included in
the projected manoeuvres," said Valazy, greatly embarrassed;
“ for I no longer form part of the civic force. But I
imagine that in case of any popular tumult, the section in
which it arises can furnish troops for its suppression.”

the Hôtel de Ville. In case of any
real emergency, they would sound the tocsin.”
“ You hear it, you hear it ! — yet not a soldier is
under arms!
“ Have you observed any further symptoms of vio-
lence?”
“ Symptoms ! — Great God !
are you ignorant that
organised bands of ruffians have broken into the prisons of
Paris, and that a general massacre has commenced ? "
Valazy clasped his hands with a deep groan, and rushed
forward without reply, - flying along the streets like a
madman till he reached the prison. - A riotous multitude
was assembled in a state of the most furious excitement,
vociferating, “that a conspiracy had been discovered,
that the prisoners of the capital, —the priests and aristo-
crats, — had been detected in a plot to fall on the friends
of the nation, and put them to death ; and that the lives of
all good patriots must be protected by the extermination of
such contumacious assassins."
Following the impulsion of this misled populace, Camille
reached the wall of the prison opposite to the Théatre de
Beaumarchais ; where the street was blocked up by a row
of carts, guarded by a dozen men of ferocious aspect,
wearing a tri-coloured sash, and a wheat-ear in the button-
hole of their jackets !
There needed not this confirmation to prove the authenti-
city of Flavie's intelligence ; and he now learned, from the
gratuitous imprecations of the mob, that they were waiting
there to witness the edifying spectacle of the deposition in
these carts of the bleeding bodies of the wretched inmates
of La Force, who were undergoing the bootless ceremony
of appearing before a mock tribunal. Almost maddened
by feelings of horror and indignation, the expression of
which would have proved as impotent as the rage of a
chastised child, Camille felt the necessity of repressing his
emotions. Affecting a patriot's interest in the scene, he
inquired of the pikemen whether the extermination of the
s 2

accursed aristocrats had been secured by a proper number
of executioners ?
Something in the struggling agony of his utterance at-
tracted the notice of the ruffian. «. Tudieu !” cried he,
66 who art thou to come meddling in the business of the
nation ? Thou hast too tender a cheek and too good a
suit upon thy back to be trusted with the councils of
patriots. Be off with thee, unless thou art seeking a prick
with the bayonet to help thee on with thy finical cate-
chism. I take thee for a court muscadin thyself ; or at
best for some prestolet défroque.”
The termination of this harangue was echoed by the
crowd with a chorus of hootings; and Valazy, buffeted
from side to side by their insults, was glad to escape by
skirting the wall of La Force, and making his way towards
the Cul de Sac des Prêtres, leading to the Rue St. Antoine.
Just as he attained that narrow passage, he perceived by
the light of a réverbère, for the gloomy dusk of an
autumnal evening had already gathered round the scene,
that a file of men, bearing the cognisance of Robespierre's
band of assassins, was stationed along the street. Every
time the wicket of La Force was opened
an event which
the intercepting crowd concealed from his view, though
their intemperate exclamations circulated the intelligence,
the of “ à l'Abbaye !” was accompanied by a shriek
of horror ; while that of " à Coblentz!” was followed by
the appearance of a prisoner escorted through the armed,
line between two soldiers of the national guard — or mer-
cenaries of the Faubourg St. Antoine ; who, amid cries of
i Vive la Nation!” and the gratulations of the mob, con-,
ducted the rescued captive in the direction of the section of
the arsenal.
Ay, ay !” cried one of the furies by whom he was
surrounded, as a young man of noble appearance was thus,
dragged through the struggling multitude, we must
spare a few singing birds, or the cage will become empty,
and spoil our sport. That is the fourth prisoner declared
innocent by the tribunal. - They will carry him to the

companion. “Do you want to find your way into La
Force, by prating of saints and churches ?
Valazy, perceiving by the dispositions of the populace
the impossibility of exciting an attempt at rescue in favour
of the miserable victims, resolved to fly to the mayoralty
and invoke the interposition of Pethion ; of whose senti-
ments he entertained a more favourable opinion than of the
rest of the Montagnard party. While hurrying to a stand
of hackney coaches, he noticed a considerable gathering of
the National Guard, summoned by the sound of the tocsin;
and trusting that among them his person might be recog-
nised, and his command obeyed, though every company
commanded by his friends was excluded in the review, he
ordered them to follow him to La Force, and replace the
prison under the command of the municipal officers.
“ And who are you, sir, who presume to address the
word of command to the citizens of this section ? " said an
officer of the Committee of Public Safety, evidently stationed
on the spot to direct the movements of the populace.
“ A soldier of the nation,
Valazy!”
“Valazy, the Fayettist! - We know nothing now,
thank Heaven ! of the minions of the Blondinet of the
Tuileries. In what section do
you
serve ?
Camille, who felt the danger of giving the name of his
late troop, which was bivouacked at Versailles, evaded the
inquiry by imploring the soldiers to remain on the spot,
whither he would instantly return with an order from the
-mairie.
“ You will be puzzled to find your way to Pethion to-
night !” said the officer with a sneer. " The mairie is in-
vested, by decree of the Assembly. As to you, my friends,
he continued, turning to the National Guards, who were
assembled to the number of two hundred, “ let me recom-
mend you to disperse, and go quietly to your homes. The
alarm was a malicious contrivance of ill-disposed persons,
-such as the officious gentleman who has just favoured you
with his commands; and it will only increase the terror of
the citizens to behold you under arms.”
A conference ensued among the soldiers, in which the
interference of Camille was coarsely repelled.
“We

obey the call of a fellow who does not so much as wear
our uniform ? "
“Nay,” cried another, “we have work enough on our
hands without troubling ourselves to fight with shadows.
Let us go home and wait till we receive the summons of
our officers. Vive Santerre, - morbleu ! vive Santerre !
we will have nothing to do with Pethion, or the parch-
ment-and-pounce soldiers of the mairie.”
Camille's presence of mind began to abandon him. It
seemed as if the hour-glass were filled with blood ;.
every lost moment were counted by ensanguined drops.
But how to arrest their course ? Alone against that
brawling multitude, how might the still small voice of rea-
son, - of pity, - make itself heard ? For a moment,
he thought of arming himself, and with the aid of one or
two young friends on whom he could rely, attempting by
the national uniform to rally a detachment of the better
order, and bear down on the insurgents. But the inter-
ference already experienced on the part of the officers of
Public Safety, and the assurances received from Flavie of
the pre-organisation of the attack upon the prisons, satis-
fied him that the conspiracy was sanctioned by authority,
against which the indignant resistance of a few hundreds
of virtuous citizens would be of small avail.
Again, the counsels of Flavie Audicourt occurred to his
mind. “ If there be a single prisoner whose safety you
tender, — be on the spot ! Mingle with the assassins.-
Lose not a single moment sight of the victims !
suance of this advice, he resolved to return home and divest
himself of those outward characteristics of respectability
which had drawn upon him the insults of the mob. But
Valazy was still at the distance of more than a mile from
his residence ; and as he was making his way, for expedi.
tion-sake, through the more unfrequented streets, he per-
ceived that the track of a man whom he had unintention-
ally followed from the mob surrounding La Force was
marked on the pavement by traces of blood. For a moment,
Camille turned to look upon his own foot-marks, expect-
ing to find them bear witness in a manner equally terrible
In pur-

to the nature of the scene he had quitted. But finding
that the sanguinary drops must have issued from some
wound on the person of the fugitive, he quickened his steps,
to fulfil the claims of humanity by a tender of assistance.
The steps of the wounded man were enfeebled by loss
of blood ; and when Valazy came up with him, he was
leaning against the post of a gateway, attempting to bind
up his arm with a handkerchief already saturated.
“ You are seriously hurt!" cried Camille, supposing
him a victim escaped from the fury of the multitude.
“Let me assist you!” But lo! on reaching the object
of his solicitude, he perceived him to be an artisan of the
Faubourg St. Antoine ; wearing round his waist a tri.
coloured sash, and in his button-hole an ear of wheat !
Involuntarily Camille recoiled from the contact of such
a miscreant; but recollecting himself in a moment, he re-
solved to turn this encounter to advantage.
“ Hot, mon brave !” he exclaimed, “ have the con-
spirators, after all, turned upon the defenders of the nation.
Are the aristocrats armed, that you find yourself thus dis-
abled ?'
Armed, morguienne !. - for what do we pay the gui-

“No, my worthy friend, your wife would be wise

“ If that be the case," said the wounded man,

endure. Throwing the coin on the pavement, and snatch-
ing the cutlass from the wretch whom he knew to be too
much weakened for resis ce, he was out of sight in a

Staggered by the shock, the hired assassin exclaimed
with ferocious imprecations against his violence; then
throwing his new vestments over his left arm, and having
secured the louis d'or, he bent his way towards a neigh-
bouring tapis franc, the cant term of the infamous re-
sorts of the ruffians of the Revolution.
“ Est y drôle sti-là !” murmured the bleeding patriot:
- Parbleu,
o'tis a better citizen than myself. I was to
have earned good wages by my labour ; while he, on the
contrary, pays six times the market-price for the mere
pleasure of doing it !- 'Twas a good cutlass, though, after
all ! — I stole it the day of the taking of the Bastille ; and
since then, it has seen service. But its day is over !
I warrant me, yonder muscadin will flourish it like a girl.”,

de semblable.--Perefixe.
On returning to the fatal spot, Valazy encountered one of
those itinerant venders of eau-de-vie, always to be found
in the vicinity of the revolutionary mobs, supplying the
rioters with draughts of unnatural excitement; and having
fortified his nerves to meet the spectacle of horror he was
prepared to encounter, he pushed his way through the crowd
towards the wickets of La Force.
The ferocious assemblage readily gave way to a person
wearing the badge assumed by the chartered assassins of
the Jacobins; and even encouraged him in his passage by
expressions too sanguinary to be perpetuated in these
pages. From their outcries, it appeared that the favourite
anticipation of the hour was the murder of the lovely
Princesse de Lamballe. At every successive opening of the
wicket, an inquiry ran from mouth to mouth, whether the
Sardinian had yet made her appearance ; while the agents
of her father-in-law, the Duc de Penthièvre, who were

-
posted in the crowd, in the hope of defending her from
further insult, drew closer and closer to the scene of blood-
shed. Immediately fronting the main entrance of the
prison, the crowd was kept back from a small open space,
by the mercenaries of the National Guard of St. Antoine ;
among whom were mingled ten or twelve assassins, wear-
ing dresses similar to that of Valazy, and armed with axes,
hatchets, sabres, and other implements of destruction,
the mob having objected to a discharge of musketry, as
interfering too noisily with their pastime. By these mis-
creants the work of death was so speedily and unsparingly
accomplished, that a horrible accusation was borne against
their labours, by a pile of bleeding bodies heaped against
the wall, and scantily covered with sacks; while an ensan-
guined stream filled the channel. Such was the scene—and
such the spot— where Valazy, with dilated eyes and burning -
brow, stood waiting the appearance of Euphroisine ! — In-
voluntarily, alas ! his thoughts recurred to that brilliant
theatre of the Trianon, in which he had beheld her for the
first time,
so young, so innocent, so beautiful,
prosperous !
Again the wicket was unclosed. By the light of the
lamps and a profusion of torches stuck against the prison-
wall, emitting a lurid light and volumes of pungent smoke
above the sea of ferocious visages filling the area, Camille
saw the Chevalier du Rhulières, the former commandant
of the gendarmerie of Paris, whom he had lately beheld
engaged in cheerful sport with Réginald de Mirepoix, con-
ducted with his head uncovered and his countenance
marked by an expression of calm resignation, between two
men attired in habits similar to his own.-In a moment,
the shouting populace subsided into silence !-- Those sa-
vage faces were characterised by a simultaneous stare of
curiosity and suspense, while awaiting the sentence on this
fresh victim ; while Rhulières, prepared for the worst,
cast a comprehensive glance of astonishment and disgust on
the extraordinary scene he had been dragged from his bed
to witness.

267
To witness ? alas ! his doom was already sealed !
On the termination of the insolent interrogation to which
he had been subjected by a species of burlesque tribunal
held in the court of the prison, he had heard by way of
sentence, the words “ à l'Abbaye !” pronounced by his
self-elected judges ; and believing himself condemned to
be transported only to another and probably more gloomy
dungeon, submitted without reluctance to the guidance of
the soldiers who presented themselves to guard his person
through the wicket of La Force.
And now, amid the unnatural stillness of that midnight
multitude, he heard the same words repeated ! — A l’Ab-
baye !” cried one of his conductors, in a hoarse voice,
which, penetrated to the remotest straggler of the crowd,
was followed by a yell of applause.—But Rhulières heard
it not! - The inhumanity of his fellow-citizens added no
anguish to the present hour; nor was the last feeling of his
heart a throb of indignation against the debasement of the
human species. Ignorant of the destiny prepared for him,
he offered not the least resistance. Stunned by the first
blow of the assassins, the stroke of the axe which se-
parated his head from his body, was only a further insult
offered to his senseless remains !
Camille, breathless with consternation, was still so ham-
pered in the throng, that he did not appear withheld by
reluctance from participating in the murderous task. But
when a second helpless victim was introduced through the
fatal wicket,
an aged priest, marked like Rhulières by
the condemnatory announcement, - and still, with sus-
pended breath and lands and teeth clenched with the in-
tensity of repressed emotions, he stood aloof from the scene
of action,
he was contemptuously upbraided by the spec-
tators.
“ Art thou asleep, sluggard ?"- cried one of the worthy
emulators of Théroigne de Méricourt, posted among the
foremost ranks of the populace, whose vociferation had
long obtained it the name of the “huaille de Paris.”.
“Art thou asleep, that thou bearest no hand in the labours
of thy companions ?"
Fortunately for Valazy, the rage agitating his soul from

the spectacle of murderous injustice he had that moment
witnessed, rose to his lips ; imparting to his reply a tone
of savage moroseness that well became his assumed cha-
racter.
“ Be silent, wretched woman !” said he, nor presume
to judge the actions of the patriots. Dost thou not per-
ceive that I am wounded, and disabled from duty ?
And the mob to whom he exhibited his sleeve rent asunder
and stained with blood, expressed a ready sympathy in his
mischance.
“ This is the second of our fellow-citizens, who has
suffered a serious injury in the extermination of these rep-
tiles, cried one of the forts de la Halle or market porters,
who had come forward to volunteer his 'services. « Benoit
Hardouin, who quitted us just now, had his right arm
cloven to the bone; and here is another citizen wounded
by the resistance of the aristocrats. Take my advice,
friend ! — Be off to the pharmacien's at the sign of the
Good Samaritan, in the Rue St. Antoine, and get thy cut
salved, or the smart will spoil thy work to-morrow. They
say there are prisoners here in La Force to keep us on the
alert these three days to come.”
“I thank thee, citoyen ! growled Camille to his
friendly counsellor. “ The spectacle before me will work
my best cure.'
“He says right!” cried several of the huaille.
not Robespierre often told us at the Cordeliers, that the
sacrifice of an aristocrat is more refreshing to a good
patriot than food or sleep?"
Fortunately for Camille's presence of mind in the cruel
position in which he was placed, the two next prisoners
emitted from the wicket received the absolving sentence of
“ To Coblentz!” While an universal growl marked the
disappointment of the crowd, the rescued victims were
severally conducted by their guards through the armed file
extending through the Cul de Sac, towards the Dépot des
Innocens ; and Valazy profited by the interval, to inquire
of the spectators with whom he kept up the grumbling
lamentations of a wounded man, whether many of the
grenadiers of the Filles St. Thomas had been executed.

panting for breath.
“ Let me die, let me die,— and
close my eyes on this scene of horror and iniquity!"
“Nay," cried his companions, misinterpreting the motive
of his ejaculation. Why not suffer the wound to be
properly dressed at once ? — Though these aristocrats are
a disgusting spectacle, dost thou not see that every half
hour delivers us from half-a-dozen of the gang ? - But
hush! the wicket opens. — A woman, too,—a woman who
might be young and pretty, were she not as worn and thin
as one of the hatchets yonder.”
“ How deadly white are her face and arms !- the
terrors of conscience !”
“ That sackcloth garment, supplied by the prison to its
pauper-inmates, is somewhat different, I suspect, from the
robe in which the Sardinian princess will make her ap-
pearance. —Aha! our wounded friend pushes forward now,
- he wishes to have a touch at this lamb of the fold.”
“ The sentence !” cried several of the mob, somewhat
interested by the youthful and humiliated air of a girl un-
recognised as belonging to the obnoxious aristocracy.

Even the soldiers seemed to pause before they pronounced
the fiat of destiny on their pale and shrinking victim. A
dead silence again prevailed.
“A l'Abbaye !” - roared out the elder of the two guards.
“ A l'Abbaye !” — re-echoed the crowd ; and already the
executioners approached with their uplifted weapons. But
Euphroisine Delplanque recoiled not, nor uttered the faintest
cry of alarm. – Her soul was concentrated in prayer !
“ Do not strike !” — cried one of the assassins, inter-
posing a bleeding arm between them and their victim.
“You owe me some recompense for this accursed gash.
Give me the woman for my prize.”
“Rather aid me of my miserable existence !” cried Eu-
phroisine, roused to a consciousness of their proceedings,
and sinking upon her knees.
“ Thou wert but too well off to save thy life by be-
coming mate to a good patriot !” exclaimed the old soldier,
to whose knees she was clinging. “Up, and thank him
for his mercy.”
“Nay,” shrieked the agonised prisoner, "give me not
into the hands of this wretch. Man!” she persisted,
folding her arms round her executioner, “ you are old
your hairs are grey !- I have an aged and grey-headed
father. — For his sake--for the sake of his sorrow - kill
me at once rather
Enough of this raving !” — cried another of the mis-
creants, “ let her die at once,- it is her sentence.” And
he swung round his axe to insure a steadier aim.
“ Friends !” cried Camille, turning to the mob," it is
for you to decide. My wounds should purchase, methinks,
the good-will of my fellow-patriots.--Do you adjudge me
this whimpering fool to be my house-drudge ?.”
“ Sans phrase !” — cried the foremost of the populace.
66 She seems to hate thee worse than the axe. -So take
her, and break her stubborn neck in thine own way."
Euphroisine had fallen insensible on the ground at this
horrible sentence. But Camille, recovering his strength in
such a crisis, snatched her from the earth ; and flinging
her across his shoulder, forced his way through the mob
who greeted him with acclamations and shouts of

laughter for what they conceived to be a project of further
evil. — Bewildered, -oppressed,— but with the vague con-
sciousness of triumph uppermost in his thoughts, he stag-
gered through several adjacent streets; still fancying that
the avengers of blood were behind him,—that the as-
sassins of La Force would overtake him, and wrest his
unhappy victim from his arms. - All his care was to get
beyond the reach of the echoing shouts of the fatal huaille.
Remembering the obscure passage he had traversed early
in the evening, Camille bent his course thither in hopes of
finding it deserted. But it was now crowded with persons
anxiously inquiring the progress of events at La Force ;
among whom his wild and distracted appearance, and the
figure he held in his arms with her long black tresses en-
tangled round her, excited observation and suspicion.
He would have given worlds for shelter. But every
house was closed for the night which might have opened
to receive two persons of an appearance so suspicious ;
nor did he dare encounter the scrutiny of any frequented
part of the city.- At length his exertions enabled him to
reach a stand of fiacres; and in a few minutes, he found
himself jolting towards his own home, with Euphroisine
senseless in his arms. Welcome as was even that anxious
interval of danger, Camille did not consider it prudent to
afford the driver a clue to his identity; but desiring to be
conveyed towards the Feuillans, dismissed the coach as if
from motives of economy, and dragged on beneath his
burden ; which, by the few passengers astir at that hour
of the night, was judged to be the body of some murdered
prisoner.
In this distressing condition, they reached the court-
yard of his hotel; and ascending the staircase with dif-
ficulty, he attempted to open the door with a passe par
tout. — Alas! it was carefully barred from within !
Camille rang a furious peal; cursing the zealous pre-
caution of his domestics, which thus served to prolong his
annoyance; when, after a delay of some minutes, having
renewed his summons, the door was cautiously opened and
as instantly closed against his entrance. Toinon Marmin,
who on Valazy's return to Paris the preceding year, had

insisted on following him from Boisgelin to become valet
de pied, or de chambre, or d'écurie, or, in short, de any
thing he pleased, to monsieur le capitaine, having learned
in the course of the morning the disastrous intelligence of
the success of the Prussians, and being in hourly expect-
ation of their descent upon the capital, could by no means
make up his mind to the propriety of admitting into the
house in the dead of the night, a wounded ruffian of the
Faubourg St. Antoine, bearing the dead body of a woman.
“ Do you not recognise me?” cried Camille, having
summoned him a second time to the door.
" Houai ! ora pro nobis — sanctissime Trinitas! -
ora pro nobis — beatissime Maria! — Monsir Bauveau !
Madame Bauveau ! - Here is a thief of a patriot with
my master's voice, claiming admittance during his absence.
-Jésus noť sauveur! - It is certainly his spectre-
Thank Heaven !” ejaculated Valazy, when his homme
de confiance, roused from his sleep by Toinon's vocifera-
tions, at length made his appearance, and recognising his
master, threw
open
the door of the antechamber. " Thank

Toinon; " the master a-guisarding as if Shrove Tuesday

lost. But Madame Bauveau, the respectable housekeeper of
Camille, having made her appearance, and satisfied herself
that the murdered woman announced to her in the incohe-
rent phrase of Antoine Marmin was no other than an un-
fortunate young lady rescued from the prison of La Force,
exerted herself with becoming adroitness. A warm and
comfortable chamber was instantly prepared ; and when
Euphroisine partially recovered her senses, she found her-
self lying on a strange bed in a strange apartment; attended
by the motherly middle-aged woman, by whose cares she
had been restored to consciousness.
“ Take me from this terrible place !”
was her half-
delirious exclamation. ." Save me from the arms of that
miscreant and let me die at once. Ha ! where am
I- this house this tranquil spot
a woman too ? -
Where are my horrible gaolers — where my judges — where
the executioner the fierce multitude - the Tell
- tell me
where am I — and who brought me
hither?
“ Monsieur le Capitaine Valazy, my good master, brought
you hither, my dear young lady,” whispered Madame
Bauveau, with soothing compassion.
“ Camille !" again cried Euphroisine, attempting to raise
herself from her couch.
“ The same, Mademoiselle. Be composed
nothing further to fear.”
Euphroisine, relieved from her conflicting terrors, threw
herself back upon the pillow, and burst into an agony of
tears ! - They were the first she had shed since the com-
mencement of her agonising trial ; for at the approach of
death, — at the approach of shame, — her burning eye-
balls were sealed against the involuntary relief of weeping.
It was only the powerful touch of gratitude,–gratitude to
Heaven, and to its earthly agent, which caused those
fountains of consolation to flow anew.
In the mean time, the anxieties of Camille were taking a
new and scarcely less painful direction. During his ab-
sence, he had been visited a second time by Laporte, with
intelligence of the most alarming nature from Florincthun!

She's up and gone - my graceless girl -
And lett my failing years !

Hoon.
The harvests of Manoir had ripened beneath the summer
sunshine, and been reaped and garnered under the glowing
brightness of the early autumn, as regularly and providently
as though no excitement of patriotic rage distracted the
capital, and as though the sovereigns of France still dis-
pensed their smiles of luxurious egotism from the throne of
Versailles. In the tranquil valley of the Lianne, little was
heard of the revolutionary excesses of Paris ; and saving
that a tri-coloured pennant waved from the attic story of
the Mairie of Samer on state occasions, instead of the milk-
white streamer which had floated there from century to
century on the Fête St. Louis and other high solemnities
of the ancien régime, and that the National Guard had
been organised at Boulogne, Desvres, Samer, and St. Pol,
the triumph over the wreck of royalty was but slightly
perceptible on the coast of Picardy, or in the states of
Artois.
Satisfied by the affectionate letters she received from
time to time from her dear Camille, which although inex-
plicit on political topics, contained a general statement of
the well-being of Madame de St. Florentin and his own
health and prosperity, — that her dear Emiline, in devoting
her attention to the care of her aged father, was prevented
from returning to her own desolate hotel, and incurring the
animosity of the populace, — Madame Valazy no longer
lamented the circumstances which had forbidden the little
party to take refuge at noir.
“ When monsieur le duc is no more,” said she, as she

traversed the trimly alleys of her garden, or made her
daily round through the pastures of the water-meadows,
“ the marchioness will deign to bring her sweet children
and pass a summer at Manoir. The sea-breezes will ani-
mate their little frames, and even madame derive benefit
by losing sight for a time of the sad scene of her mis-
fortunes. I shall labour with such affection to insure her
comfort, and my son will strive so vigilantly that she
should miss none of her accustomed luxuries ! – Nor will
she lack companions to beguile her leisure. There are the
Sénéchal de Campaigno, my neighbour yonder at Hesdin
l'Abbé; and there is the noble family of Rosamel ;-
ay! and even the St. Aldegondes so far as Colamberg, who
will hasten to offer their homage to one who has the best
blood of France warm in her veins. My poor dear lady
will have no reason to lament Navelles, - no motive to
sigh for Florincthun.”
With these sanguine expectations to cheer her through
the spring and summer, Madelon suffered the roses to bud,
blow, and fade away, without repining. In embellishing
her homely but cheerful retreat, she felt that her toils
might be eventually rewarded by the approval and enjoy-
ment of her foster-daughter; and she was even at the
trouble of planting a little flower-garden at Manoir for the
future recreation of little Emiline and Aglaë de St. Flo-
rentin, an exact fac-simile of that devoted to the amuse-
ment of her own little Emiline de Navelles, in the stately
gardens in Lorraine, some twenty years before. — She
heard, indeed, from the abhorrent lamentations of the
Curé Blaisel, when he occasionally took his cup of café
noir and petit verre at Manoir, on his way to visit some
sick parishioner in the commune of Isques, that the king
and
queen
had been driven from their palace and plunged
into a prison of common malefactors. But she fancied all
these public calamities of a transitory nature ;
that the
allies and the army of Condé would appear, like the good
genii at the termination of some spectacle-féerie ; and so
long as Camille was safe as an official functionary of the
provisional government and her noble patrons through
their seclusion at Florincthun, she was content to devote

her cares to her granary, her fleeces, and the domestic dis-
tillation which was to supply Curé Blaisel's petit verre
with cassis for the ensuing year, without troubling herself
concerning newspaper announcements, or political pre-
dictions.
One day, as she was superintending the autumnal knot-
ting of the roots of thrift along the raised terrace of the
little garden projected for ces chères petites marmottes,
Madame Valazy perceived along the vista of the avenue
the approach of a mysterious vehicle, which was neither
the covered cart of the miller of Isques, nor of the
coquetier supplying himself at the adjoining farm with
eggs for the English speculators of the Calais market, –
the demie-fortune of old Madame Duhamel of Quéhen, nor
the calèche of the superintendent of the Ponts et Chaussées
from Condette, who, on the national decree for the sup-
pression of armorial bearings, is said to have caused the
interposition of a mysterious cloud on his carriage, as if in
concealment of a distinction which had never existed on
its panels ! A cabriolet-de-poste was standing at her
door; and hurrying, "on hospitable thoughts intent,” to-
wards the entrance, she beheld a personage, announced by
Tonton as a
gros Moussieu tout biau, tout zentil,”
approaching with hasty strides along her garden-terrace ;
- a three-cornered hat flourished in his hand, and an
enamel watch-chain, three-quarters of a yard in length,
dangling from his waistcoat.
“ I have the honour to salute my excellent friend,
Madame Valazy,” said the old gentleman, with a peevish
tone and air, which accorded ill with the courtly politeness
of his diction.
Madelon's sunshiny smile of hospitality was ready for
any stranger within her gates; but she detected no traces
in the poor old, wasted, dwindled man before her, (whose
doublet — albeit of the choicest velours épinglé, was a
world too wide for his shrunken person,)— of the pom-
pous, rotund, and superannuated mercer of the Rue St.
Honoré, who had so tormented her with his officious
civilities during the illness of her son some four years
before ; and who, at that period, was as profoundly pene-

one of or
trated with a sense of his innate dignity, as the Delhai
Lama, or the head of the Celestial Empire.
“ Your humble servant, sir !” she rejoined, with a
respectful obeisance, nothing doubting that her visiter was
ces nobles” from the populous valley of Samer ;
intent on the purchase of a few of her mérinos, or on a
neighbourly appeal to her generosity touching the far-
famed breed of bantams. “ You will do me the favour of
walking into the house?” And having preceded him into
her salon, and stationed him in the bergère de cérémonie
covered with Utrecht velvet, in which only the Curé Blaisel
was permitted to refresh his dislocated bones after a pil-
grimage on the old black pony, she waited patiently for an
opening of the negotiation.
But the ex-mercier, — who, in spite of his recent af-
flictions, had still the great soul of a plenipotentiary swell-
ing in his bosom, took a voluminous foulard from his
pocket, on which he proceeded to sprinkle drops of Hungary
water from a small flacon, and deliberately refreshed his
face and forehead, while he cast upon every successive ob-
ject in the room an irritated glance of surprise and con-
tempt; — muttering something beneath his handkerchief
of luxe de roturier, which caused Madame Valazy's cheeks
to tingle with indignation.
“ It must be Monsieur le Comte de St Aldégonde him-
self!” thought Madelon. “ And yet the noble owner of
the Château de Colamberg has too much gentleness of
breeding to come here and affront me in my own dwelling,
where I cannot so much as give him a woman's word of
reproof in return. I wish the pompous old don would
explain himself; for I do not like to feel that such a per-
son has the power of placing a padlock on my lips.
Dame! have I not been addressed at Navelles by mon-
seigneur the late dauphin — by the illustrious Prince de
Conti — by You have had a likely morning, sir, for
your drive” —-suddenly exclaimed Madelon, gathering
courage from this mental recapitulation.
“Without interrupting you, madam,” (as a Frenchman
generally prefaces any speech which offers a most deter-

mined interruption) — “may I venture to ask when you
last heard from your son ?
My son!” reiterated Madame Valazy, fearing by her
reply to implicate her Camille in some mysterious mischief.
“I am no great pen-woman, sir, and my son has too
many avocations to allow him much leisure for writing.”
“Madame Valazy !” cried the stranger, with a con-
siderable extension of the lungs, and disentangling his
right hand from the foulard in order to enforce his indig-
nation by an emphatic thump upon the arm of the bergère,
“ this subterfuge will not serve.
- This evasion will not
satisfy the vengeance of an outraged parent. - I accuse
your son, madam, as the base betrayer of my daughter.”
“ I do not understand you, sir !” cried the bewildered
Madelon, recurring to all she had heard in the country of
the beauty and distinctions of the young Countess at
Colamberg.
“ And yet I speak plain!” exclaimed the old man,
with increasing warmth. “ I tell you, Madelon Valazy, I
am indebted to the seductions of your detested son, for my
unhappy Euphroisine's departure from the path of duty.
“ Euphroisine ! - cried Madame Valazy, rising from
her chair with a welcome sensation of relief, both moral
and physical. “ Have I, then, after all, the satisfaction
of addressing Monsieur Delplanque, the silk mercer of
Madame la Marquise de St. Florentin ?
Delplanque-ex-mercier de la majesté, et de la cour
de France ! ” — emended the old man with a profound
bow; not, indeed, addressed to his auditress, the Commère
Valazy — but to the august designations passing through
his lips.
“ So altered so sadly altered !— Dame! who could
have recognised him? "- she exclaimed, involuntarily
perusing the wasted lineaments of the poor old man.
“ Altered ! You may say so, madam !” he replied,
with a total change of manner; for even the vanity of
Delplanque's nature subsided at any allusion to his pater-
nal grievances. “ And wherefore am I altered — how
have I been bowed down to the dust ?'

que diable !"
Oh!
“You have received tidings, I trust, of Mademoiselle
Euphroisine, since her imprudent flight?
“Imprudent !” repeated the angry old man; “is that
the word to qualify an act of cruelty which has dishonoured
the grey hairs of her aged father in the sight of all his
fellow townsmen ;
and left his infirm years to the mercy
of aliens and strangers ? Imprudent !.
“ The excellent and amiable qualities of Mademoiselle
Euphroisine, forbid me to use a harsher term !” cried Ma-
delon, feelingly.
“Yes, she was indeed excellent !” ejaculated Delplanque,
forgetting his foulard, his anger, and his dignity, and
clasping his hands together in utter anguish.
Madame Valazy,
great and mysterious is the tenderness
of a father, since, in spite of all my child's misdoings,
my
heart
yearns at the mention of her name, and melts
with forgiveness at the sound of her praise. So promising
a creature so sweet a child ! The queen herself, at-
tracted by her grace and loveliness, would willingly have
adopted my little Euphroisine, but that her poor mother
would not hear of parting with her. And she was right;
for how would it have ended ? - Where are Mesdames
Thibaut and Campan - her protectresses of old ?- Where
is Madame la Princesse de Lamballe, the surintendante
where Madame de Tourzel ? — Where are they, for the
recompense of all their services, and all their loyalty ? -
But why do I speak of their misfortunes - of their de-
gradation ? How know I that my own Euphroisine,
my cruel, rebellious, precious daughter,
- may not have
encountered a destiny far more disastrous ? ” And tears
began to fall abundantly from the eyes of the afflicted
mercer ; nor could Madelon, with all the sincerity of her
sympathy, hit upon any argument for his consolation.
- What was there, what indulgence, what luxury,
· what whimsey, — in which she was denied ? — The
ladies of the queen slept not softer, nor were less charged
with the vexatious cares of life. — Her father's purse,
but what of purses ? - her father's fond, doting heart,
was open to her command ! And yet she left me, Ma-
dame Valazy, - left me without preparation for the blow ;

diction over her head; forsook me with the callous ingrati-
tude of an alien and a cast-away !"
“ But you have surely heard from mademoiselle since
she quitted Arras ? It is now more than a year since
she visited me, when I attempted to dissuade her from
following up her mad adventure.”
“ From time to time, a mysterious billet has reached me,
imploring a continuance of my affection towards my re-
bellious child. These letters acknowledged, in a vague
and unsatisfactory manner, that their writer was resident
in Paris ; and devoted to a course of perilous exertion,
such as demanded the protection of my prayers ; a course
which she stated herself to have embraced in this clandes-
tine manner, only with the view of avoiding the pain of
my prohibition and interference.”
“ Ma'amselle Euphroisine told me,” observed Madelon,
“ when she visited me immediately on the return of the
royal family from Varennes, that she was going to Paris
in disguise
66 To join her destinies with those of Monsieur Camille
Valazy – the ex négociant of Lyons, and present leader of
a notorious troop of the national banditti ! I thought
so ! - With whom, it seems, she was prevailed to indulge
in furtive interviews, even so long ago as the time when I
unsuspectingly afforded him the hospitality of my humble
retreat in the Marais.”
“No such thing!” cried Madelon, indignantly.

other time."
“ Ah! woeful was the day to poor Jean Thomas Alex-
andre Delplanque, when he received a recommendation of
the young scape-grace from the worthy Dacquin family
his excellent correspondents at Lyons ! Woeful the day
when he undertook to present an obscure provincial of such
equivocal reputation in the courtly precincts of Versailles !
-The Bastille was still standing in that triumphant jubilee
of royalty. Would to Heaven I had employed my interest
with the Duc de Liancourt to get a lettre-de-cachet enforced
upon one who commenced his career in Paris by an at-
tempt at assassination in the royal theatre of the Trianon ;

and ended it by bearing the banner of the renegade La
Fayette, and carrying off the daughter of the ex-mercier
bréveté de la cour de France !"
“ Heard any one ever so provoking and wicked a mis-
representation !” cried Madelon, half inclined to call in the
assistance of Tonton, and command the forcible ejectment
of this base maligner of her Camille's reputation, but the
sight of the old man's withered countenance disarmed her
indignation. “As to carrying off, monsieur le mercier,"
said she at length, in a tone of expostulation, “I can
myself bear witness that there was neither violence nor
persuasion in the case. Mademoiselle Euphroisine assured
me, face to face,
here in this very room,
that her
errand in Paris was to devote her humble attendance to
her majesty during her imprisonment at the Tuileries.”
“ For a long time - for many months
I persuaded
myself that such was the case. I knew the girl to be in-
fatuated in her zeal for the cause of Marie Antoinette,
from which I vainly attempted to wean her by removing
to Arras. But what is the use, Madame Valazy, of at-
tempting to traverse a woman's will ? - Close up the
door, and she will gain intelligence through the window:
- close up the window, and the birds of the air will visit
her with the tidings she covets ! - Satisfied of the impos-
sibility of distracting her attention and affections from the
Tuileries and its inmates, and believing her to be under
the protection of her kind friend, Madame Thibaut, I
reconciled myself to my loneliness. When I rose in the
morning, and found no Euphroisine to bless me with her
sweet smiles, and when at night no daughter bent her
knee to me to crave my blessing in return, - I used to con-
tent myself with the thought that when the misfortunes of
the royal family were happily alleviated, she would return
to her father, — return to her home, to her duty, and
prove once more the pride and comfort of my days.”
“ And wherefore should you now think otherwise, my
good sir?” – said Madelon, touched by the faltering voice
in which these words dropped from the lips of Delplanque.
“ Time, which brings round January and June in
their due season, will settle all these difficulties. — The

king shall enjoy his own again, and our children be restored
to us.”
“ Never will I again fold to my heart a girl who has
proved a shame to the name of her father and the memory
of her excellent mother!”
“ Shame is a harsh word,” observed Madelon, sooth-
ingly. “ It might be counted indeed a rash measure for a
young person to go wandering about a city like Paris in
male attire, and
“ Male attire !” shouted the old man, furiously. “She
who seemed so modest, so demure, that the young nobles
who visited my comptoir could not so much as break a harm-
less jest touching the colour of their vest, or the fashion of
their brocaded roquelaures in her presence ! - Out on her
hypocrisy!"
“But may I inquire," said Madelon, trusting that
Delplanque's ire had expended itself, “through what inter-
pretation you impute the levity displayed by Ma'amselle
Euphroisine to the evil counsels of my son ?”
• The thing is manifest enough, even without attaching
importance to their previous good understanding — their
secret meetings - their interchange of gifts and letters -
of which I derive the certainty from the confession of my
domestics. I told you I believed my daughter to have
sought the guardianship of Madame Thibaut. But when
I saw by every public document, a certification of the
names of those who followed her majesty to the Feuillans
and the Temple, I wrote to my successor in the Rue
St. Honoré, to prosecute inquiries on the subject. I
had the pain of learning in reply, that no person of the
name of Euphroisine Delplanque had been at any time in-
cluded in the service of the Tuileries, or known as the
inmate of the palace !”
“ But I do not see in what manner this intelligence
criminates my son ? ”
Laporte, the intendant of the Navelles family, writes
word that nothing has been heard at Florincthun of Made-
moiselle Delplanque, since she thought proper to set off
unattended and disguised into Lorraine in search of the fos-
ter-brother of Madame de St. Florentin, but that the said

capitaine denies all knowledge of the present position of the
young lady.”
My son's word may be trusted,” observed Madelon,
with dignity.
“ My daughter was traced to his residence, Madame
Valazy ; and since that period
At this moment the door was slowly opened, and the
figure of the Cure of Isques was slightly intruded.
“ Ah! Monsieur Blaisel — deign to enter !” cried
Madame Valazy ; hoping by means of a stranger's pre-
sence, to give a more general turn to the conversation.
“ You have ridden far this morning, if I may judge by
your wearied air.”
“ My sadness springs from other sources than those of
bodily fatigue,” said the good old man, waving his head.
“ A horrible massacre has taken place in Paris, and many
thousand innocent victims have been slaughtered in cool
blood !”
“ Just Heaven !” exclaimed Madelon. “ Surely the

“ Are neither the objects nor the perpetrators of so foul
a deed !— Your son has incurred neither danger nor re-
proach."

the sufferers from this new crime ? —Oh! why didst thou
leave thy father's protection, — who would have saved thee
from all evil,—and who will receive his death-blow in any
tidings of thy mischance !". - and he hastily traversed the
chamber with clasped and trembling hands.
- A courier — not bourgeoise - a courier all the way
from Montreuil !” cried Tonton, rushing into the chamber,
and placing a letter in the hands of Madame Valazy.
“ Jésus Maria !” cried Madelon, after perusing the first
lines of the epistle. “ What a horrible catastrophe !
Yet why should I make it a matter of lamentation, since it
will bring those loved ones to my arms! Monsieur le
Curé ! worthy Monsieur Delplanque !-- rejoice with me
I shall see my son to-night. Camille is on his road to

CHAPTER XIII.
The incendiary!-
Creeping in stealthy malice through the night ;
While his dense cloak enshrouds a muffled torch
By demons kindled !
VANE.
For some preceding months, the inhabitants of the villages
and plains round Meaux had exhibited unequivocal symp-
toms of unison with the democratic party of the capital ;
confirmed and ripened into ferocity by the triumphant
spectacle afforded by Louis XVI. and his family, dragged
from Varennes to Paris. The National Guard, organised in
these disaffected provinces, experienced danger and diffi-
culty in restraining the peasantry within the already en-
larged limits of subordination.
Day after day, new disorders in the domains of the no-
bles became the cause of further emigration. Châteaux
were burnt and pillaged, - their defenceless inhabitants
outraged, - their lands devastated by the very persons de-
pendent for subsistence on the prosperity of their proprie-
tors. Instead of labouring to efface the terrible conse-
quences of the scanty harvests which for two succcessive
years had menaced the provisionment of the capital, the
culture of the land was neglected for the disorderly indul-
gence of political enmities; and the produce of former sea-
sons squandered in the wanton intoxication of the hour, by
the destruction of the granaries of every obnoxious land-
holder throughout the district.
This afflicting intelligence had been partially communi-
cated by Laporte to Camille Valazy, on the night he visited
Florincthun with the Chevalier de Mirepoix. But the
agitation of mind arising from his recent interview with
the disguised Euphroisine in the prison of La Force, had
prevented him from giving to the subject all that eager so-
licitude which, at any other moment, would have attached
itself to details involving the interests of Emiline. He
attributed, too, a considerable portion of the horrors of the

narrative, to the advanced age of the intendant, which ren-
dered him susceptible of alarm on trivial occasions; while
in such emergencies there was no longer safety in relying
on the statements of the public journals, which for the
most part emanated from the enemy's camp, and were
framed to forward the individual views of their proprietors.
Camille was aware that the caducity of the Duc de Na-
velles and the strict seclusion maintained by his daughter
during her widowhood had in a great measure alienated
the animosity of the populace from their persons ;—and
he conceived that a feeble woman and a still more feeble
old man were in no danger of provoking the enmity of
the Jacobin party. This opinion might have been veri-
fied, but for the tempting bait still afforded by their opu-
lence, and the intense detestation nourished against them
by Maximilien Valazy.
Even when Laporte acquainted him that his cousin had
recently visited Meaux, on occasion of some popular dis-
turbance, and in spite of Madame de St. Florentin's re-
luctance, insisted upon access to her presence, his irritation
subsided at the suggestion that the interview might be
necessitated by the official duties of the deputy. But Ca-
mille's suspicions were now awakened ; and he determined
to devote his first moments, after procuring the enlarge-
ment of Mademoiselle Delplanque, to an elucidation of the
mystery.
The intendant also hinted at a series of mys-
terious letters which madame la marquise was in the habit
of receiving from Paris, and which never failed to plunge
her into affliction for the remainder of the day.- Some-
times, he said, his noble lady would sit for hours leaning
upon the shoulder of her cousin, Mademoiselle Léonie de
Mirepoix, in the silence of utter despair.
But Laporte was not enabled to insinuate,- for the
wounded pride of the marchioness retained so revolting a
fact in the strict secrecy of her own bosom, – that the
object of Maximilien Valazy, in seeking her presence, was
to inform her that the Duc de Navelles and herself had
been denounced to the conventional government as sus-

Sardinia ; that their estates were marked for proscription,
and their persons for imprisonment; and, finally, that her
only chance of evading the terrible fate impending over
herself and her family, was — to accept the offer of his
protection, by granting him her hand in marriage!
The dismay of the marchioness on this startling pro-
posal, was so great as to suspend the utterance of half her
indignation! She could scarcely believe herself awake or
in a right frame of understanding ; for though she knew
that the titles and privileges of the aristocracy, already
virtually abolished, would shortly become obliterated from
the charters of the land,— there existed in her estimation
as vast a distinction between the daughter of the Duke of
Navelles, and the peasant of Grand Moulin,— between the
widow of the royalist St. Florentin, and the deputy of the
Montagnard faction, as. between the children of frail
mortality, and the disembodied spirits of a higher sphere !
- There was probably something of a woman's petulance
in her mode of demonstrating this conviction to Maximilien
Valazy; for the sneer which disfigured his face as he lis-
tened to her burst of resentment was such as might have
animated the physiognomy of Satan when meditating his
projects of evil against the favoured creatures of his Maker.
But his projects were too deeply laid to be discoun-
tenanced by her opposition. The scorn of Emiline served
to lend new bitterness to his intentions.
Though Maximilien no longer possessed that master-
key to every movement, measure, and project of the
Navelles family, which he held during the domestication
of Flavie in the Hôtel de St. Florentin, he had emissaries
in the village of Florincthun, and even in the inferior
offices of the château, through whom he was acquainted
with every important circumstance connected with the
affairs of the establishment. The arrival of the Chevalier
de Mirepoix under the escort of his officious cousin had
not been kept a secret from him ; and only tended to in-
flame his animosities against both. It was in this frame
of mind he encountered Camille, the day preceding the
attack on the prisons; and in the hope of mastering the
further designs of Mirepoix, wormed out of him, by

promises of service, the secret of his interest in another
prisoner within the predestined walls of La Force.
On quitting him, Maximilien hastened, not to the Com-
mittee of Public Safety to procure a certificate for his en-
largement, but to the prison itself ; where, in the person
of Jacquot Lavoine, he had no difficulty in recognising the
hapless Euphroisine, whose active operations in the service
of Marie Antoinette were well known to him, through
Flavie Audicourt; and whose claims on his wealthy cousin,
he believed to be cemented by the tie of betrothment as
his future wife.
Having gratified his vengeance by denouncing at La
Force the sex of the disguised prisoner, he entered an
especial prohibition against her release upon any ordinary
judicial document; and satisfied that the interest enter-
tained by Camille in her favour would engross his personal
defence so soon as the news of the slaughter in the various
prisons became public, he conceived that no better moment
could be selected for a renewal of his designs upon the
château de Florincthun.
Though the mansion contained a small chapel dedi-
cated to the devotions of the family, frequented by the
infirm duke, and served by his confessor the Père Désenne,
who had hitherto escaped the enforcement of the new
ecclesiastical oath or denouncement to the Assembly for its
evasion, the piety of Madame de St. Florentin induced her
to attend the daily celebration of mass in the village church;
where, during the first year of her widowhood, her presence
was greeted with affectionate respect. But these evidences
soon began to relax. — Emiline, on her errands of devo-
tion and charity in the village, found her ears assailed by
coarse allusions, and invectives equally strange and terrible.
Such were the consequences of the visits made by the
Deputy Valazy to the commune of Meaux !
At length, neither her servants nor herself could venture
to quit the château, from the apprehension of being in-
sulted, The Duc de Navelles was no longer permitted to
take the daily airing so essential to his infirm health ; and
the walks of the little Emiline and Aglaë, the younger
of
whom was still an infant, were restricted by their attend-

ants within the boundaries of the garden. The arrival of
the Chevalier de Mirepoix, instead of affording to Madame
de St. Florentin the protection she anticipated, appeared to
excite the evil will of the villagers into a still more deter-
mined opposition to the authority of the family ; and the
day following his visit to Florincthun, threatening letters
were thrown into the court-yard, and an address to the
disaffected tenantry posted against the church-door, inviting
them to throw off the yoke of the family of St. Florentin.
Their first overt act of defiance was the destruction of a
small wood sloping from the château towards the river
Marne, which disappeared in the course of twenty-four
hours. The indignation of the Duc de Navelles on this
insulting spoliation, induced him to apply to the authorities
of Meaux for a detachment of the National Guard to be
stationed at the château. But Madame de St. Florentin
was not satisfied with such defence; and having persuaded
Laporte to undertake her errand, despatched him a second
time to their friend and counsellor, with a letter, contain-
ing an intimation of their danger, and a statement of the
alarmning position of the village of Florincthun.
Had time been allowed to Camille Valazy to organise
measures for the defence of the château, had he even re-
ceived this intelligence at the early hour of Laporte’s visit
on the preceding day, he might have assembled a sufficient
number of men among the mechanics thrown out of em-
ploy by the recent destruction of several important factories
in the suburbs of Paris, to repel the meditated attack.
But even with the certainty of maintaining this temporary
advantage, he would have felt reluctant to encourage the
obstinate residence of the Navelles family in so disturbed
and excited a district. There appeared in this emergency,
as in the strait arising from the connivance of the marquis
in the flight of the king and queen, only the chance of
rescuing Emiline and her children by an immediate escape
from the fatal spot. In case of the duke's refusal to
abandon Florincthun, he determined to place the rash old
man in the guardianship of his nephew the Chevalier de
Mirepoix, and carry off the marchioness and her daughters
without leaving her a voice in the measure. Having sum-

moned Bauveau to his councils and intrusted him with a
sufficient sum of money to carry his project into execution,
he desired him to procure horses to render him indepen-
dent of the post-stations, and proceed with a carriage to
Florincthun; sending forward relays, so as to cross by
Senlis to the Calais road, and avoid the necessity of re-
entering Paris.
Bauveau, sincerely attached to the master, whom he
still hoped would eventually return to the city of the loom,
and terminate his days in a showy Hôtel Valazy on the
Place Bellecour, after a prosperous union with the heiress
of the house of Dacquin, vainly endeavoured to dissuade
him from rushing into needless danger. Having learned
from old Laporte, the preceding day, the imminency of
the danger menacing the inhabitants of Florincthun, he
assured him that by this time the château was probably in
ashes, and the family pursuing their flight to the frontier,
where the Chevalier de Mirepoix was about to join the
arnıy of Condé; and implored his master to reflect on the
dangers and horrors from which he had that day barely
escaped.
“ If I rightly understand your orders, sir, it is your in-
tention to accompany the Florincthun family to Manoir,"
said Bauveau. “ The young lady on whom my wife
is attending, will therefore be left unprotected to the malice
of those from whom you have with so much difficulty
rescued her.”
“No! Bauveau. Return with the horses about to
carry me to Meaux. Act for me during my absence, till
you receive further instructions. In any future difficulty,
apply to my notary for assistance and advice ; and should
I fall in the course of these disorders, he will regulate
every thing for your satisfaction, and the advantage of
my family.”
Again Bauveau remonstrated. But his arguments were
met with so much decision on the part of his master, that
the man, instead of pursuing his objections, found himself
compelled to set off in search of the horses; while Camille,
after appointing a more explicit place of rendezvous,

mounted his own; and, followed by Marmin, was out of
sight in a moment.
In order to reach the gate of the barrière St. Martin,
that spot already a scene of so much interest to his feelings,
-- he was compelled to pass a part of the Faubourg, in which
he encountered a band of ruffians, evidently returning from
their horrible operations at the Conciergerie and wearing
the fatal cognisance. — But Camille had no time to indulge
his sympathy with the defenceless beings at that moment
under the edge of the sword. — Florincthun was before his
eyes, exposed to all the terrors of Maximilien's powerful
vengeance, and the excesses of an infuriated multitude !
He had long since, as a precautionary measure, enrolled
young Marmin in his troop of the National Guard ; and
though he had procured his discharge at the moment of
his own resignation, both re-assumed, on the present oc-
casion the national uniform ; so that neither surprise nor
inquiry was excited by their activity at so early an hour in
the villages lying between Claye and Meaux.
On entering the cross road leading from the latter town
along the banks of the Marne towards the château, Camille
to whom the aspect of Florincthun was familiar ob-
served the loss of the fine wood which formerly fringed the
rising ground towards the avenue. But, alas ! a dark
lurid vapour was rising into the autumnal clearness of the
morning sky, in the immediate direction of the château !
“ On, for your life, Toinon !” exclaimed Valazy, push-
ing his horse towards a dike which separated the road
from a field to be traversed by a short cut towards the
village. ‘On for your life ! Dismount in the market-
place, and spread a report that we precede a detachment of
the national cavalry from Paris, despatched for the protec-
tion of the château, confiscated as national property !”
A few minutes afterwards, Camille entered the court-
yard of Florincthun! During the night, disorderly bands
from the neighbouring commune, aided, as it afterwards
appeared, by more regularly organised companies of depre-
dators from the capital, had been busied with the spoliation
of the château. As in most instances of popular excess,
they had not contented themselves with the gratification of

291
their rapacity, in the removal of the valuables placed within
their reach ; but the property it was impossible to abstract,
was condemned to total destruction. Around the château,
therefore, both in the court-yard and on the terraces, were
scattered fragments and piles of splendid decorations,
heir-looms, through succeeding generations, of the St.
Florentin family, — the produce of foreign travel, foreign
achievements, and the liberal patronage of national talent.
Shattered mirrors were visible among the disorder, whose
frames, precipitated from the windows above, proclaimed
the most precious specimens of Venetian industry ; tattered
remnants of the beautiful tissues of the Gobelins, torn in
wantonness from the walls of the state-saloons ; and far
more precious than all, portraits of a line of honoured an-
cestors, of statesmen, warriors, and beauties whose names
belong to history, and whose persons had sought a more
palpable immortality at the hands of Titian, Vandyke,
Rigaud, Mignard, or Greuze,— were seen fluttering in can-
vas strips, among heaps of fractured mouldings, gilt en-
tablatures, and fragments of porcelain.
Among these, at scattered intervals, lay piles of human
bodies, which Camille mistook at first sight for the victims
of an affray ; but, on a nearer inspection, he found them,
with the exception of some ten or twelve murdered retainers
of the castle, to consist of living members of the insurgent
party, disabled by brutal intoxication. He had no dif-
ficulty in tracing their condition to the vast hogsheads of
precious wines, which had been rolled into the court-yard,
and devoted to the revelry of the assailants, until the
inebriated hand of the wassailer forgot its duty, and the
contents were suffered to run unchecked and foaming on the
pavement, in horrible commixture with the blood of their
fellow-creatures, recently spilled upon the spot. Dozens of
flaring waxen flambeaux were stuck against the wasting
barrels of Bourdeaux ; affording a strange contrast with the
bright beams of the morning sun, and a record of the sa-
crilegious defiance which had snatched them from the con-
secrated stores of the chapel and its altars.
These incongruous objects were scarcely comprehended in
u 2

the hasty glance which Camille Valazy threw over the scene;
for his eyes rested on an incident of this loathsome spectacle
obliterating the trace of every other outrage. Under the
platform of the double flight of marble steps leading to the
state entrance of the château, the ruffians had placed one
of the guilded fauteuils from the saloon ; in which,
fastened with cords, was seated the mutilated body of the
Duc de Navelles: -before him, a prie-dieu with a breviary
upon the desk, and propped on its knees at his feet, in
an attitude of menial servility, the corpse of Laporte, his
faithful and grey-headed servitor of half a century !
The blood of Camille ran cold in his veins when he per-
ceived that the right arm of the murdered duke was sus-
pended high above his head; and that the hand had been
severed from the stump whose mutilated remains pite-
ously exhibited the withered attenuation attendant on the
extreme age of the noble victim.- In that act of aggra-
vated barbarity, he read the fulfilment of Maximilien's
early denunciation! The ruin of Florincthun had evidently
arisen from the malignant operations of his cousin !
Averting his eyes from this terrible object, he cast them
round in agonised search of those whom he feared must
have shared the unspeakable calamities of the hour.
“ Let me but look on her bleeding remains to wind up
to its extreme pitch the anguish of my soul !”. muttered
Valazy. Let me but satiate my maddened eyes with the
butchery of my beloved, and then for vengeance on the
monster who has wrought this tissue of crime!”
But there was trace of female existence amid
the horrors of the scene! — The flames bursting with
fierce tongues of fire above the desolated pile proceeded
from the offices, and had begun to communicate with the
corps de logis. But a slight vapour of smoke was percep-
tible from the grand entrance, as if the conflagration alone
respected the outraged human relics stationed there in hor-
rible mockery of the authority of the dead.
Camille held his breath as he exclaimed to a reeling sol-
dier, who was pointing out the progress of the fire to a
few peasants still wandering among the ruins, —“And the

Surely they are not included in the massacre ?”
- More or less,” replied the man, doggedly.

was a kitchen-wench who refused to discover
“ But the marchioness — the children ?”
"The aristocrats ? — Why you see, as the Dame de Flo-
rentin, and her pretty kinswoman and dainty brats, could
not be persuaded to join us good fellows in broaching the
cognac, we provided her with a good fire to keep off the
chill of the night air. She is warming her hands finely
over the embers by this time. I hunted her myself as far
as the parapet, and lost her at last among the wilderness of
turrets and chimneys. But though I could not reach her,
the flames will !”.
He looked up to the roof of the château as he spoke ;
and Camille distinctly perceived at the juncture of the
gables of the wing, two or three cowering female figures.
-His companion also discerned the distant objects of their
baffled search ; and calling loudly to his troop, a volley of
carbines was instantly discharged in that direction.
“ I knew not, morbleu! that doves and gulls could
make out so lofty a perch,” said the soldier, proceeding to
re-load his piece. “ But if I cannot reach them at a fair
mark, I shall scarcely venture through the flames rushing
yonder through the galleries, in order to snatch so paltry a
prize ; no! not even at the price offered by the citizen dé-
puté, who is skulking at Meaux. I have risked my neck
more than enough, peste! in running after her among
the
roofs.”
Valazy had vanished from his side. Already he was
traversing the volumes of smoke which filled the staircase
of the château ; already, from corridor to grenier, he had
attained the entrance leading to the leads. Trembling lest
the sight of an approaching soldier should terrify the
marchioness into some act of desperation, and perhaps
startle her into throwing herself from the parapet, he
strove to announce the arrival of a friend, by calling aloud
in every varied accent of tenderness " Emiline

It was the first time such words of endearment had es-
caped his lips ; alas ! what a moment for the declaration
of his long-repressed attachment !

VOLUME THE THIRD.
CHAPTER I.
Exterminez, grands Dieux ! de la terre où nous sommes,
Quiconque avec plaisir répand le sang des hommes. VOLTAIRE.
It was at the close of evening on the same day, that Ma-
dame de St. Florentin, on recovering from the state of
mental torpor by which she was overwhelmed, discovered
herself to be in a travelling carriage on an unknown route.
She had been snatched in a state almost amounting to
mental alienation from her perilous position, by the intrepid
hand of Valazy ; and carried in his arms through the
circling smoke, whose eddies filled the interior of the châ-
teau, while Marmin possessed himself, at his master's
bidding, of her two children. The female companions of
Madame St. Florentin, consisting of her cousin, Léonie de
Mirepoix, and Louise, the attendant of the little girls,
gratefully obeyed the directions of the two soldiers who
thus opportunely presented themselves for their defence ;
following with trembling steps through the suffocating va-
pours of the spreading conflagration, till they found theni-
selves standing by the side of Camille on the threshold of
the garden-entrance of the château. Mademoiselle de Mire-
poix still retaining her presence of mind, unmaddened by
the maternal anxiety which redoubled the terrors of Emi-
line, suggested that, as the gardens were invested by the
national soldiers, they should be arrested in attempting to
traverse the very first alley; and hastily revealed to Va-
lazy the existence of a side-door opening from the salle à
manger to the offices, through which it might be still pos-
sible to gain the woods of Florincthun.
“ But the offices are a heap of smoking ruins. The

burning rafters are falling in every direction. You saw it,
mademoiselle, from the roof, as well as myself,” cried the
children's attendant.
“ So much the better !”. cried Valazy, following the
path pointed out by Mademoiselle de Mirepoix ;-" the
less likely to meet with stragglers loitering in that direc-
tion.”
With the glare of insanity, Madame de St. Florentin
gazed on the wilderness of desolation through which she
was hastily borne along, half smothered by the scorching
atmosphere, and every moment intercepted by masses of
smouldering ruins, which suddenly threw up a column of
flames as fragments of blazing timber fell with a tremen-
dous crash from the roof, through the devastated framework
of the building.
Toinon, keep close ! — another moment and we are
safe !” cried Camille, as they reached a spot, where the
reflection of the flames was less fierce, but where a dense
vapour of black and pungent smoke revealed their vicinity
to the stables and granaries, where the forage gave out in
burning the most oppressive exhalations.
Yet it was here they encountered the first living being
visible during their progress through the scene of peril and
horror. On perceiving a human figure skulking among the
smouldering outhouses, Camille drew a pistol from his bo-
som, with a hand which, with some difficulty, he extricated
from Emiline's support. But he was arrested by Made-
moiselle de Mirepoix's assurance that the man was
the postilions of the duke ; to whom she made a friendly
sign to join their party.
They soon reached the postern opening from the stable-
court into the woods. But Camille had the mortification
of finding it torn from its hinges; while the underwood
and high grass without, trodden down in every direction,
proved that it had been made the common entrance of the
mutineers from the village, and therefore afforded little
promise of security to the fugitives. Any prospect, how-
ever, was preferable to return ; and having broken a way
through the thickest covert of the hazel-bushes, followed
with pain and difficulty by his trembling companions, Va-
ne of

lazy marshalled their way towards a small patch of holly
trees completely screened by entangled furze from the fre-
quented paths of the wood.
Having motioned to the little party to preserve the most
cautious silence, he carefully deposited Madame de St. Flo-
rentin, whose mind was now completely alienated, on
a bed of moss and fern; then, turning to reconnoitre the
condition of his companions, he perceived that Antoine
Marmin, whose hair and the shoulder of whose uniform
were singed and blackened, carried but one of the children
in his arms !-- Fearful of calling the attention of the mar-
chioness to this appalling fact, he motioned an inquiry
after little Emiline ; but Toinon, who had no tact to enter
into the delicacies of the case, exclaimed aloud,
Jésus noť bon Sauveur! I fear we shall see no more of
the petite demoiselle! Her nurse snatched her from my
arms when I was entangled in the flaming rafters, and I
lost sight of them in the smoke !”
“ Not another word !” —said Valazy, in a low emphatic
tone ; and having stationed Toinon and the young postilion
at the entrance of the thicket, and regardless of the prayers
of Mademoiselle de Mirepoix that he would not abandon
them, he hurried back through the path they had quitted,
and re-entered the postern of the lower court. But, alas !
no vestige of the little innocent or her attendant; and just
as Cainille was pressing onwards towards the spot where
he remembered to have been struck by the cries of the wo-
men during their transit, a horrible crash, succeeded by a
new burst of flames and a suffocating emission of smoke
and dust, proclaimed that the roof and outer wall of the
offices had fallen. No hope remained of discovering the
objects of his search, who were probably crushed in the
ruins.
Heart-sickened by this painful consideration, and op-
pressed almost to fainting by the noxious vapours, Camille
re-directed his flight towards the wood ; where perceiving
that in the direction of the holly thicket all was still and
deserted, he attempted to skirt the plantations towards the
road, and ascertain whether any traces were visible of
Bauveau and the carriage,—to the arrival of which he

looked as the sole chance for the surviving inmates of
Florincthun.
Panting with agitation, he attained a hillock on the out-
skirts of the wood, which commanded the route in either
direction. But the only objects that met his view were a
group of drunken labourers, reeling towards the village,
roaring snatches of the Marseillaise, and sinking under the
weight of burdens evidently forming part of the pillage
of the château. Further on, he discerned the body of a
man half concealed in the rushes of a ditch by the road-
side, which, for a moment, he believed to be that of his
unfortunate domestic ; but as he was leaping into the
road to satisfy his anxiety, he detected, at the extremity
of an opposite field, the carriage of which he was in search,
making its way with some difficulty along the cart-track of
the traversée. Instantly hailing Bauveau, whom he joyfully
recognised upon the driving-seat, Valazy motioned to him
to advance no further, dreading that the appearance of an
equipage on the Florincthun road might excite suspicion ;
but flying back to the thicket, and taking once more into his
arms the burden rendered doubly precious by the perils of
the hour, he succeeded in guiding his companions in safety
towards the place of rendezvous. — They crossed the road
without molestation. In another minute, the marchioness,
her child, and Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, were deposited
in the carriage.
“My servant Toinon must, with your permission, be-
come your companion,” whispered Valazy to Mademoiselle
de Mirepoix, who was supporting the senseless form of her
cousin. “I will occupy the seat by the coachman till we
attain the Calais road. You, Bauveau, must also accompany

“One word more !” interposed the young man, with
moistened eyes.
- The children of madame la marquise ;
-surely you placed but one in the carriage ?”.
“ Hush !” said Camille, cautiously ;
o the other is
missing. But I implore you, Bauveau, quit not the
neighbourhood of Meaux till you have recovered the little
girl.”
Camille now gave the signal for departure ; and notwith-
standing the deliberate pace at which the vehicle was com-
pelled to follow the deep cart-ruts of the route, Camille
could discover no trace of the fugitives. Satisfied, however,
that he could intrust the prosecution of the search to the
faithful and humane Bauveau, he uttered another hasty
word of farewell to his worthy domestic, and the vehicle
proceeded at a more rapid rate of speed along the lofty
avenue skirting the road towards Senlis. At the first inn,
where a relay waited his arrival, Camille made out a formal
certificate, which assigned him an apparent authority of
arrest over the little party, in case inquiry should arise
among the provincial authorities; while his own appear-
ance on the box, armed, and wearing the national uniform,
and that of a soldier of the National Guard with the ladies
within, gave an air of probability to the plot.
Meanwhile, Emiline remained wholly unconscious of the
situation of her affairs.
“ Better, far better, that it should be thus with her !”
said Léonie de Mirepoix to her distressed companion.
“During this torpor of mind and body, nature will re-in-
vigorate her powers, to meet the grievous tidings which
await her.”
“Hush !” whispered Valazy-“she may possibly over-
hear you.”
“No! her slumbers are as heavy as the wreck of every
shattered nerve can render them! Suffer me, therefore,
Monsieur Valazy, before I thank you for the valueless life
which I feel I owe to your interposition, to express the
gratitude of my family for the liberation of my brother.

condition of his estate of Navelles, poor Reginald will

Valazy, with all his generosity of mind, could scarcely
prevail on himself to sympathise in the afflictions of Ma-
dame de St. Florentin's favourite cousin.
“ Bewildered as I am,” resumed Léonie, after a pause,
“by all the horrible scenes I have lately witnessed, I
have never inquired, Monsieur Valazy, to what shelter
you are about to conduct us.
on the route
to Calais. Tell me, is emigration inevitable ? Must we
indeed fly to England ?”
I trust not !” replied Valazy. “I cannot but hope
that the flagrancy of the crimes recently committed in
Paris will call forth a severity of retribution such as must
terminate the licentious career of revolutionary violence.
Meanwhile, mademoiselle, the humble residence of my
mother, who inhabits a farm in the neighbourhood of
Samer, must afford a refuge for those to whom she will
eagerly devote the affectionate attentions their condition
may require.”
Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, an orphan from her birth,
who, like most of the daughters of the nobility, had been
educated at Panthémont with the view of eventually
uniting her destinies with those of her cousin Amédée de
Navelles, knew little of the connection of the Valazy fa-
mily with that of her uncle. Camille perceiving her air
of surprise, proceeded with his explanations.
‘My mother, mademoiselle, was many years a domestic
servant to the Duc de Navelles. The devotion you have
seen me apply to the assistance of the Marchioness de St.
Florentin derives its warmth from the kindness with
which, in former days, she deigned to accept the services
of her foster-brother.”
“Ah! it is Madelon, then, of whom I have heard my
uncle and cousins speak,- it is Madelon who will afford
us a home in our misfortunes ?-1 am satisfied ! Poor
Emiline will derive the utmost comfort from the presence
of one whom she loves as a mother.”
Camille was gratified by this unpremeditated corrobo-
ration of Madame de St. Florentin's fidelity to her early

companions visited by slumbers as heavy as those of the
child whose little head was pillowed in his bosom ; and
even ventured to afford them a few hours' respite from
their fatigues, at Abbeville; whence he despatched the
courier to his mother, announcing their immediate arrival.
Late in the evening of the second day, the little party

Though unaware of the afflicting state of the marchioness,
Madelon had pre-arranged her immediate removal to her
sleeping room, which Emiline persisted in mistaking for her
apartment at Versailles. Addressing her trembling old nurse
as Madame de Tourzel, and Mademoiselle de Mirepoix as
the Comtesse Pauline, she solicited an immediate audience of
Marie Antoinette, -assuring them that the absence of St.
Florentin was caused by his imprisonment in the hands of
Maximilien Valazy. It was only on their entreaty that she
would defer the interview until morning, as her majesty
had retired to rest, that the poor maniac, instead of ex-
hibiting the refractory petulance which Madelon anti-
cipated, suffered herself to be undressed, and lay quietly
down to sleep.
Meanwhile Camille, though he had attained that long-
wished for haven of security in which he had latterly de-
spaired of placing the beloved object of his solicitudes,
was greeted on his arrival by fresh vexations. Among
the persons assembled at the foot of the avenue of Manoir
to greet the arrival of the carriage, the importunate pre-
sence of old Delplanque,— who, on the announcement of
the coming guests, insisted on remaining to seek further
explanations relative to his daughter,—forced itself upon

his notice. He observed the old mercer busying himself
with a thousand officious directions to Tonton as to the
most advantageous mode of turning the carriage in the
little court, and the best position for the lanterns which
were to enlighten the path of its inmates ; and he was
even commencing a long oration to the bewildered Emi-
line, with the offer of the “ l'hommage de son plus profond
respect,” when Madelon unceremoniously pushed him by
the shoulders into the sitting-room, and turned the key so
as to rescue from his officious curiosity the terrible spec-
tacle of Madame de St. Florentin's afflictions.
The first precautionary measure taken by Valazy after
dismissing the post-horses, was to distribute arms to An-
toine Marmin, to Bénoit the postilion, and Tonton, and
cause the gates of the avenue and court to be locked and
barred; while, before the latter, a broken cart was so dis-
posed as to prevent the appearance of recent passage.
After these operations, he was proceeding to seek refresh-
ment in the chamber devoted to his use at Manoir, when,
in passing along the corridor, his ears were assailed by
violent attempts from within to break down the door of
the salle à manger. His first movement was to lay his
hand on the pistol in his bosom, under a persuasion that
the house was attacked, his next, to recoil with horror
in the dread that these acts of violence might proceed
from the delirious excitement of Madame de St. Florentin.
Both apprehensions were calmed in a moment by the sound
of a thousand execrations and accusations, uttered in the
voice of the irate Sieur Delplanque; who, though little in-
clined to the liberal side in politics, mingled a variety of
adjurations touching the liberties of the subject and the
rights of man, in the recapitulation of his grievances!
Nor did the indignation of the furious old gentleman
subside, when he found himself indebted for his release
from durance to the interference of Monsieur le Capitaine
Valazy; and for some minutes, his remonstrances touch-
ing his incarceration and the abduction of his daughter
were so singularly and inextricably blended, that Camille
judged it best to allow the explosion of his verbosity to ex-
pend itself, ere he attempted explanation or apology. But

the great soul of the mercer waxed hot within him; and
it was some time before the humming-top gave any symp-
toms of weariness in its vibrations.
“1-sir,” said he, “ moi qui vous parle - I-Jean-
Thomas — Alexandre Delplanque- a name well-known at
the court of Versailles, - I received you, sir, in ingenu-
ous confidence, into the bosom of my family ; - made
your provincial obscurity worthy acceptance in the high
circle of the court of France, - feasted you under my
domestic roof-tree, -cherished you during the tedious hours
of sickness !- When others would have shunned a young
éventé, whom the common voice of fame had reprobated
with the name of assassin, — when others
“ Pardon me, sir, for interrupting a recapitulation of
favours which I am far from inclined to deny, to solicit an
immediate explanation of your accusations against my con-
duct towards a young lady, whom I am grieved to hear in-
culpated in groundless and offensive insinuations.”
“ How, sir! Do you presume to deny the fact of
having decoyed Mademoiselle Euphroisine Delplanque into
becoming your companion in Lorraine, -- your inmate in
Paris, - your
“ I deny nothing !--- I have nothing to say to so absurd
a charge !” — replied Camille, fearful that the old man's
vociferations would reach the ears, and disturb the rest of
his unhappy guests.
The wretchedness of four sleepless
nights, of four days distracted by the most atrocious spec-
tacles of crime and misery, oppress my mind beyond all
power of controverting your accusations. But a person has
fortunately accompanied me to Manoir, who was at once an
eye-witness of the one brief interview which occurred be-
tween Mademoiselle Delplanque and myself at Boisgelin,
and of the frightful circumstances under which she sought
an asylum in my dwelling at Paris.”
And having commanded the attendance of young Mar-
min, Camille referred to his evidence all further explanation
on the subject; while the fretful old man, although satis-
fied that no collusion could have been practised between the
master and man, expressed himself highly discontented with
the result of his cross-examination.

“ I perfectly agree with you, sir,” observed Camille,
coolly, “ that the situation of your daughter in my abode
is indecorous, and her stay in Paris perilous to her own
safety. I therefore presume to recommend that you depart
instantly for the capital, and restore her to the respectability
afforded by your own protection. The diligence from Ca-
lais passes the end of the avenue of Manoir at midnight.”
“You are right, sir," said Delplanque, haughtily, as he
accepted the written address tendered him by Camille.
“ You are right, Monsieur Valazy ; though others might
have felt the reluctance of delicacy in enforcing such an
argument under their own roof, and at the approach of
night. But I have the honour, sir, of bidding you fare-
well, and of assuring you that I shall find a moment to
verify the truth of your account; ay, sir, and in case of
any false entry, render you severely accountable for the ba-
lance due to the indignation of an injured father.”
Valazy was too much exhausted to recommence his ex-
planations. Begging his irritated inmate to issue such
orders in the house as might suit his comfort and conve-
nience, he hastened to throw his weary frame upon a bed ;
and long before Monsieur Delplanque and his valise had
been guided by Tonton along the avenue towards the
Calais road, his feverish susceptibility was calmed into
profound sleep.
“ The events we eagerly desire,” says La Bruyère,
rarely occur; or they happen at a moment and under
circumstances which diminish the pleasure they originally
promised."
If Camille Valazy, from his first hour of maturity till
the present, could have pointed out a hope dear to his
heart, an event desirable beyond his most sanguine expect-
ations, it would have been the power of conferring an im-
portant obligation on Madame de St. Florentin. But, alas!
wish had been gratified at the expense of the
cruel sacrifice of her father, the loss of her child ;—and
how little might it avail to soften her feelings towards him-
self !-- The exertions he had effected in the preservation of
her life would for the future be inextricably connected in
her mind with a catastrophe, such as she must naturally

labour to efface from her recollection. Even his prompt
obedience to her summons in the hour of danger, would be
shunned amid the cruel reminiscences attached to the de-
struction of Florincthun.
So eagerly—so enduringly—as he had wished to behold
her sheltered with her family in the tranquil seclusion of
his mother's farm, -so long as he had considered Manoir
devoted to her accommodation !- And now she was there,
beneath the same roof, — separated from him but by a wall,
- watched by the mother who had cherished the infancy
of both! Her destiny was connected with his by a
closer bond of union than he had ever ventured to an-
ticipate ; and yet she appeared a thousand times more
divided from him, than as the heiress of Navelles, --- as the
wife of St. Florentin! -At that period, he had looked on
Emiline as so guarded round by friends and protectors,
that there was no danger in the intensity of his affection,
- that he might render her, without hesitation, the idol of
his secret heart. But now that she was protected only by
the sacred halo of misfortune,—that she had no longer a
father, -a husband, to repel the presumption of his
gaze, he felt as if a wall of ice were interposed between
them ; – that an empress upon her throne could not be
more elevated above his head ; — and that even the at-
tentions due from him to his guests must be paid with the
strictest reserve, lest they be regarded as an intrusion
arising from their dependent condition.
Her health too, - dare he hope that the broken heart
already withered by distress, would bear up against the
miseries yet demanding fortitude ? - Could he expect that
the vacant, wandering eye which he had now gazed upon
for hours without attracting its recognition, would resume
the sweet intelligence of its former glance ? —that the fair
cheek, blanched into the hue and temperature of marble,
would become re-animated into the youthful glow of health
and beauty ? - Would she ever smile again, as in the
holyday of her wedded happiness ; ever waken anew to the
joys of human existence ?
Alas! he was hopeless of such a change ! The hideous
dreams which soon distracted his rest were scarcely so

much the result of the agitation and fatigue he had under-
gone, as of his desponding anticipations touching the future
destiny of his afflicted Emiline !
The following morning chanced to be one of those in-
tensely bright autumnal sunshines, which, instead of cheer.
ing the heart like the brilliancy of the early spring,
serve only to remind us that they embellish the latest fes-
tivals of the closing year ; -- that its best smiles are gone
to swell the treasury of past recollections, irrevocably ab-
stracted from the sum of our earthly existence !-- The
hues of the decaying leaves, — the mournful fragrance of a
few scattered flowers half withered by the frosty night air,
the sharpness of the distant landscape, — the unnatural
transparency of the atmosphere, -are but memorials of the
departure of another summer!
To the inmates of Manoir, these associations assumed a
character of still more definite melancholy! It was not
alone the sweetness and gladness of the year which had fled
from their enjoyment with the fleeting season. Worldly
prosperity,— the best affections of the heart, — the firmest
reliances of the mind, were included in the wreck !-
The institutions of their native land were broken up, its
moral union disorganised beyond redemption,-its name
tarnished in the records of history ; while their own homes
were made desolate,—their kindred precipitated into the
grave. These miseries appeared to jar against the feel.
ings of the youthful Léonie for the first time, when she
gazed from the window of Manoir upon its little garden
basking in the sunshine, and upon the tranquil valley
beyond, in whose narrow pastures the cattle were rising
lazily from their dewy lair. All seemed so tranquil, so
monotonously soft and calm. Nature appeared to luxu-
riate with such unmolested security in the stillness of
that obscure retreat, that she felt with a redoubled sense
of wonder and injury, the infuriated turbulence prompting
the inhabitants of the metropolis to such intemperance of
crime.
What a contrast ! — The roaring of the fierce multitude
in the court-yard of Florincthun, - the flashing and rat-
tling of the discharges of musketry against the windows,

the darkening volumes of smoke,—the groans and shrieks
of the little band of faithful followers which had remained
true to its dying seigneur, the fierce imprecations of the
populace,- the crackling flames gathering from wing to
wing of that beautiful pile, — had subsided into the holy
tranquillity of a lonely valley, into the murmur of the
morning breeze among the elm-trees, the hum of Madelon's
bees clustered over lofty bushes of the Michaelmas daisy,
united with the twittering of the birds which had sus-
pended their “procreant cradles” from the little turret in
which her chamber was situated !- Willingly would she
have persuaded herself that the past was a hideous chi-
Terrible realities were intermingled with her remi-
niscences, which forbad the delusion! From the parapet
where Madame de St. Florentin's local knowledge of Flo-
rincthun had fortunately pointed out a secure refuge from
the search of the populace, Léonie had discerned the
insults offered to the remains of the Duc de Navelles; and
beheld the savage immolation of his faithful Laporte, by
the hirelings of Maximilien Valazy !
The condition of Madame de St. Florentin, too, was a
direful corroboration of the veracity of her recollections ;
and though Mademoiselle de Mirepoix confidently antici-
pated the recovery of the child and her cousin's eventual
restoration to sense and composure, she was overcome with
the consciousness of her friendless and destitute condition,
and the necessity of relying on the mercy of compara-
tive strangers for the succours so much needed by the
unhappy Emiline. The first instigations of her heart,
however, were those of gratitude ; and her morning salu-
tations to Valazy expressed sincere and eager acknow-
ledgments of her obligations, and those of her cousin,
“I will not shrink, mademoiselle,” said Camille, in
reply, “ from professions which appear to relieve your
feelings. But speak not to me, I conjure you, of the ob-
ligations of Madame de St. Florentin ! The ties which
bind us together are of too ancient and sacred an origin
to permit the existence of such a word between us.'
Meanwhile could any thing have increased the intense
emotion excited in the heart of Madelon, by the condition

;
of the Marquise de St. Florentin, it would have been that
it owed its origin to the malicious wickedness of Maximilien
Valazy. Excepting in a trifling disturbance in the village
of Navelles arising from the instigation of the same evil
spirit, poor Madelon had witnessed nothing of the progress
of the Revolution. She had quitted Grand Moulin rather
in obedience to the counsels of Laporte and the prayers
of her son, than from personal apprehensions; and amid
the tranquil routine of her cares at Manoir, the gossip of
the good Curé Blaisel and the tremendous narrative put
forth by Jean Thomas Alexandre Delplanque failed to
impress upon her mind the horrors of the reality. — She
persuaded herself that her informants gained their intelli-
gence from the public journals, the hired organs of faction.
But Mademoiselle de Mirepoix's shuddering revelations
admitted of no further doubt. The poor old duke, her
ancient benefactor,- Laporte, her coadjutor in fidelity and
trust, - had been sacrificed to the bloodthirsty animosity
of the populace.—Florincthun, that historical monument
of family importance, Florincthun was in ashes the
good, the gallant St. Florentin in his
grave;
- and his
child, his lovely and innocent child, abandoned to the mur-
derous hatred of her father's enemies ! But of all these
evils, great as they were, - and appalling, and humili.
ating, -none struck upon her heart like the aspect of the
marchioness. Throughout the night of her arrival, Madelon
refreshed her vigils in tears; and when in the morning she
was greeted by her precious charge with the gracious smiles
and sportive tones she was in the habit of bestowing on
her favourite femme de chambre, for whom she persisted in
mistaking her good old nurse, but who was now, alas ! lying
cold and stiff among the ruins of Florincthun,- Madame
Valazy wrung her hands in utter dismay at the terrible
havoc before her eyes.
Soon, very soon, this cheerful mood of Emiline's deep-
ened into extravagant gaiety. She laughed and sung, and
called aloud on the familiar names of those whose ears
were for ever closed against the sound ; and at length
burst into peals of ungovernable and frightful laughter ;
then on a sudden, without any visible motive for the tran-

sition, checked her mirth, and subsided into her former
state of lethargic despondency. A thoughtful scowl was on
her brow; yet it was evident that the operations of her
mind were wholly suspended. And in this condition did
poor Madelon sit by her side ; attempting to soothe her into
a more natural mood, by the fondest terms of motherly
endearment; and holding between her own that fair white
hand which she had seen enlarge from the waxen and
diminutive softness of infancy into the graceful symmetry
of womanhood. How often had Madelon fondled it in the
unwitting playfulness of her childhood !—And now, Emi-
line was again before her eyes, - helpless and witless as a
child !
While Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, sharing her anxieties,
suggested a thousand modes to attract the attention of the
sufferer, and direct her thoughts into their natural channel,
Camille having despatched Tonton to Samer to inquire for
letters, resolved to traverse the meadows towards Isques,
in the hope of obtaining from the curé some intelligence
of the progress of the Prussian troops, and the march of
public events at Paris. He knew that Blaisel, from
his access to the neighbouring châteaux of MM. de Cam-
paigno and Rosamel, was acquainted with the popular
movements; and having warned Benoit and Antoine to
be on the alert in case of the appearance of strangers, and
left them, briquet in hand, seated upon the trunk of a
fallen tree near the head of the avenue, mutually re-
counting the horrors they had recently witnessed and the
miracles of valour they had enacted, Valazy leapt over
the stile leading beside the banks of the Lianne towards
the Condette warren, through the village of Isques,
path where all was stillness, solitude, and peace !
Of all vicissitudes, none so striking as a sudden removal
from the haste, intemperance, and tumult, of a populous
city, to the loneliness of a country landscape; loneli-
ness where nothing appears to intervene betwixt our
hearts and heaven! - Amid the hurry of a metropolis,
we close our ears against that still small voice which in
the silence of the fields speaks as with the stirring tone of
a trumpet ;-- that voice which, in the hearing of the first

murderer, assumed the terrors of a rebuke spoken by the
lips of the Almighty !
While Valazy hurried along those solitary meadows,
where it was easy to doubt the very existence of the tu-
multuous throng of the capital, his thoughts were less of
the marvellous chain of events through which Emiline de
Navelles had been fated to realise his vision of abiding
under his protection as a persecuted and distracted fugi-
tive, than of the desperate wickedness of the human heart
when left to its unrestrained devices, as exemplified by the
assassins of La Force, the ravagers of Florincthun !
Although he had attempted to tranquillise the mind of
the agitated Mademoiselle de Mirepoix during her journey
by discouraging the project of emigration, he was secretly
persuaded that the malice of Maximilien Valazy would
neglect no means of searching out his destined victims;
and having been made acquainted by Léonie with the de-
signs of the ruffian on the hand of her cousin, his feelings
of loathing and horror assured him that there was no safety
on the soil of France for the lovely object of his idolatry.
It was no difficult matter to quit the country, now that
the vicinity of the ocean and the auspiciousness of the
skies combined to favour their departure. But with
the prospect of speedily re-uniting her favourite child to
the little group, he felt unwilling to profit by the helpless
and unresisting condition of the unfortunate Madame de
St. Florentin, to remove her from a country still endeared
to her by the possession of that cherished treasure; and
resolved to suspend the preparations of their flight till
some conclusive intelligence from Bauveau satisfied his
mind of the safety of little Emiline.
Nor were his apprehensions diminished by the inform-
ation which awaited him from the good curé, that the ad-
ministration of Paris had addressed circulars to the dif-
ferent communes of the republic, inviting the departments
to follow the example of the capital, and evacuate their
prisons by a general massacre of the captive aristocracy;
stating that the Parisians, on the eve of marching to meet
the
enemy, had determined on the extermination of a party

food ;
which they must otherwise leave behind to slaughter their
wives and children.
The curé aggravated the apprehensions of his visiter by
a confession that a spirit of disaffection had begun to ma-
nifest itself in the adjoining valley, and that several con-
siderable families of the commune had already sought
safety in emigration. The inhabitants of Artois and the
north of Picardy having forfeited through the evacuation
of the country the crowd of English residents from time
immemorial the source of their prosperity, began to turn
for vengeance upon those whom they regarded as the
origin of this sudden deprivation. Our aristocrats, said
the fickle Boulonnais, have deprived us of work, of pay, of
- we will seek retribution at their hands, by nou-
rishing our destitution from their substance.
“In short,” continued the curé, with an air of profound
resignation, “I feel assured that a day of reckoning is at
hand; and though prepared to tarry here and encounter
such difficulties and perils as the Almighty may have
decreed, so long as I entertain the least hope of restrain-
ing by the shepherd's voice a single lamb of my flock
within the fold of heaven, I cannot feel myself jus-
tified in counselling your prolonged stay at Manoir.
Madame Valazy, by her benevolence and simplicity of
mind and manners, has acquired the affection and esteem
of every class throughout the district, and forms no part
of the obnoxious race. But your unfortunate friends, sir,
would be easily recognised as fugitive nobles from some
other department; and, in affording a harbour for their
safety, your good mother might endanger her own. Fe-
males, Monsieur Valazy, have no longer a portion in
this fated land; and since their presence can in nought
avail to its deliveranee, they cannot too speedily quit the
precincts of desolation.”
“ No alternative remains but emigration !” exclaimed
Camille, tossing his hands in despair. “Even those who
would willingly cling to the sinking vessel, are driven
from the deck by the violence of its inebriated mariners. —
All is lost for France !"
“Not so," interrupted the curé, mildly. “ Amid the

a
storm raging round us, let us anticipate the rainbow of
returning sunshine. — God will not abandon his people!
He permits our afflictions for a time, but closes not his
heart against the cry of Israel in her bondage.”
“ Another doubt perplexes my mind,” said Camille.
“In my hurried interview with you last night, while
irritated and perplexed by the importunate folly of that
blockhead Delplanque, I could not unfold half the family
afflictions our noble friend has undergone, - half the cruel
effect they have wrought upon her gentle feelings."
“Nay, Monsieur Valazy, the loss of a husband

“I had wished,” continued Camille, “ that no mortal
eye should witness the mental alienation of the unfortu.
nate daughter of the Duc de Navelles, saving the one
which watched over her childhood. But the holy ex-
hortations of your lips may reach those wandering senses
which are sealed against our voices. From the healing
words of a minister of her faith, I expect more benefit
than from the art of the physician.”
“Will you then permit me,” said Blaisel, “ to accom-
pany you back to Manoir ? To comfort the afflicted is
as precious a duty of our vocation, as to guide the erring
to repentance! It was not always,” he continued, reach-
ing down his hat and glancing at his secular attire, “ that
I mingled with the children intrusted to my care, in a
guise so little distinguishing as a teacher of the word of
God. But I trust, Mon Valazy, that my lessons are
not the less fervently imparted, nor my care the less
actively bestowed, now that neither stole nor cassock dig-
nify their authority.”
As they approached the farm through pastures white
with the flocks which formed the pride of the simple
Madelon, Monsieur Blaisel vainly attempted to divert the
attention of Valazy from his distresses, by pointing out to
his notice the improvements arising from his mother's
vigilance and good order; and commenting, with unaf-
fected and manly piety, upon the rich fertility of the land,
and its testimony to the bounty and tenderness of Pro.
vidence. But Camille had no ears for his homily; he

perceived at a little distance Tonton loosing into the pad-
dock the blind pony on which he performed his daily pil-
grimage to the post-office at Samer; and on hastening
towards that very deliberate piece of human machinery,
learned, in the first place, that “ Sandis ! y faisoit diable-
ment chiaud sur le grand camin !”. and, secondly, that
no letter was to be heard of!
Camille was in despair ; and still more so when, on the
following day, and the next and the next, the same answer
was renewed till he grew apprehensive of exciting by his
solicitude the suspicions of the post-master. Again he
despatched a letter of inquiry and remonstrance to Bau-
veau, addressing it to the care of his notary; and nothing
but reluctance to leave the inhabitants of Manoir to the
defence of a feeble priest and a handful of servants, pre-
vented him from returning in person to Paris, to ascertain
the destiny of the little girl, and the position of Ma-
demoiselle Delplanque.
Meanwhile, the curé had been introduced into the
presence of the unfortunate sufferer. But his patient at-
tempts to engage her attention were wholly fruitless. As
the distinguished appearance of the marchioness and
Mademoiselle de Mirepoix could not fail of exciting sus-
picion in case of a domiciliary visit on the part of the
authorities of Samer, it was deemed advisable for them to
assume the peasant costume, and the character of relatives
of Madelon, arrived from her native province to assist in
the labours of her household ; and a dress was accordingly
prepared for each by the diligence of Léonie, after the
model of the garments worn by Tonton's helpmate. She
anticipated that her cousin might possibly be roused to
notice this change of vesture, and resent the removal of
her widow's weeds; but, alas ! Emiline suffered herself to
be arrayed in this unwonted and unnatural guise, without
observation or resistance !
From motives of respect, as well as from the repug-
nance of affection, Camille forbore to enter the presence of
the sufferer ; but having one day, on approaching the little
tower inhabited by the marchioness, descried the gaunt
figure of Tonton returning from his usual embassy to

Had you
Samer, and elevated his voice to inquire for letters, the
window of Emiline's apartment was instantly thrown open
by Madame Valazy, who made eager signs that he should
join her without delay. — By some strange association, the
sound of Camille's voice, which she heard for the first
time since her indisposition, had penetrated to the heart
and soul of the invalid !
“ That is my good brother Camille's voice !” she sud-
denly exclaimed. “ I sent for him so long -- so very long
ago, and he has come at last to save me !-- Ah! ma bonne
maman!” she continued, turning towards Madelon with a
look of recognition, and throwing her arms round her neck,

been with me, dearest friend, I should not have suffered
so severely !-- But where is Camille ?”
It was on this sudden change, that Madame Valazy
summoned her son and Mademoiselle de Mirepoix ; and
had the satisfaction of perceiving that their appearance pro-
duced no relapse of symptoms on the part of her patient.
Léonie, my dear cousin !” she exclaimed, as she en.
tered the room,
why did you suffer them to remove
me to this strange place, away from my father ? --- Here
we are again at Navelles, -a place I had so solemnly pro-
mised myself never to revisit; while my poor father is left
alone at Florincthun among those fierce democrats.
“ Pardon me !” replied Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, with
great presence of mind. Every thing at Florincthun is
now as tranquil as you see it here ; and my uncle is not
alone, - little Emiline is bearing him company."
“ And why am I sent hither with only this darling
child ?” —she resumed, snatching Aglaë with eagerness
from Madelon's knee, and covering her little cheeks with
kisses.
“ You have both been indisposed, dear cousin !” an-
swered Léonie, with tremulous lips; " and are residing
here to avoid the danger of infection to the family.”
“ Ah! very true— I had forgotten that !” said Emiline,
resuming her air of childish imbecility in so frightful a
manner, that Madelon apprehended a renewed paroxysm.
But from that first interval of reason, Emiline relapsed

not into her former unconsciousness. — She wandered at
times, and never sufficiently recovered herself to doubt the
veracity of the statements she received ; nor could any
thing be more afflicting than the air of feeble credulity
with which she daily demanded of Valazy — “I am better
to-day, Camille - am I not?
Shall I soon be sufficiently
recovered to go back to Florincthun?”. Her restoration
was, in fact, as gradual as her seizure had been abrupt.
Every day her anxious attendants perceived some trifling
amendment -some more distinct arrangement of ideas;
and so satisfied was Léonie that perfect comprehension of
the past, and the present, would renew her agonising terrors
for the future, that Camille was the only person who mur-
mured touching the retardment of her recovery.
It was at this period, that the paternal zeal and kindness
of the worthy curé became effective. The rebellious mood
of his parishioners fortunately left at his disposal a larger por-
tion of leisure than since his settlement at Isques; which was
all passed'in companionship with the invalid at Manoir, in
attempting by his instructions both read and spoken, to
bring her into a frame of mind to endure the mighty trials
she had still to undergo.
By degrees, a considerable portion of the dreadful truth
was partly related and partly recalled by a spontaneous
effort to her mind; and Valazy, who watched her with
the doting solicitude that directs the eyes of a parent to
a favourite child, had the satisfaction of perceiving that
Heaven tempered the ind to the shorn lamb, --- that the
tears which flowed silently and soothingly, from the eyes
of Madame de St. Florentin as she leaned on his arm, when
every evening at dusk she was persuaded to drag her feeble
limbs along the avenue of Manoir, were as balm to the
wounds of her filial tenderness.
She was, however, still persuaded of the safety and
health of her little girl, whom Camille assured her to be
resident at Paris under the care of Mademoiselle Del-
planque, in his own household, and projected to return to
the capital the moment the restoration of her bodily
strength would sanction the attempt.

CHAPTER III.
Die ? - So would sullen children! -
Women that want their wills - slaves disobedient,
That fear the law, would die; the noblest live
And brave their fate.
Bonduca.
LÉONIE DE MIREPOIX submitted to her afflictions with a
degree of fortitude little to be expected from her youth
and inexperience; and so long as her attentions were re-
quired by the miserable plight of her cousin, resolutely
closed her eyes upon her personal sorrows.
But now
that the health of Emiline was partially restored, she no
longer hesitated to confide to Madame Valazy and Camille
her painful anxieties respecting the destiny of her brother;
and implore the assistance of the latter in seeking intelli-
gence of his welfare, and acquainting him with her own.
She entertained little doubt that the chevalier and the Père
Désenne, on learning the disasters at Florincthun,—where
an opinion was prevalent that Madame de St. Florentin
and her family had perished in the flames,--would direct
their flight without delay to Condé's army; and if this
were the case, there remained no possibility of present
communication with their friends.
Whenever the question was agitated in the presence of
Emiline, she enlarged on her interest in the fate of her
cousin Réginald, with a degree of frankness which almost
obliterated from Valazy's mind his former suspicions of
her partiality; and referred herself so confidingly to his
services in favour of the chevalier, that he was more gra-
tified than vexed by the expression of her solicitude.
Having been made acquainted in a qualified manner with
the massacre of the prisoners in Paris, she was fully
aware of the extent of Mirepoix's obligations to her foster-
brother.
“ You were so kind so prompt, Camille,'
said she,
“in your interposition for Réginald. But when have you
been otherwise than kind and prompt in your exertions for

me and mine? - St. Florentin's dying instructions,—nay,
the very air I breathe, remind me of a thousand — thou-
sand motives of gratitude. How strange, Camille ! that
the dearest friend and deadliest enemy I own on earth
should be recorded in my prayers by the self-same name;
- for, thank Heaven ! I am still able to pray for forgive-
ness for my father's murderer !”
« In the exertions you are thus pleased to over-rate,
madam," replied Valazy, 56 I do but fulfil a sacred duty,
- though one which is powerfully advocated by my own
feelings."
' No, dear Camille,—this generous profession does not
deceive me. You renounced a highly advantageous posi-
tion at Lyons to forward the cause of liberty, and assist
in the regeneration of the constitution ; and however I
may contemn the nature of your political creed, be assured
I am fully conscious of the extent of the sacrifice you have
made in favour of my family.”
“Of yourself - yourself only!" replied Valazy, with
inadvertent emphasis. You, who are united to my heart
by the closest and holiest ties, — you, madam, have blinded
me to the position of my country — to the demands of my
interests. Throughout the stormy period of the Revolu-
tion, I have fixed my eye on one frail vessel buffeted by
its commotions; still repeating to myself, Let me but
prove the pilot to guide it into a haven of peace, let me
but see her safe, - prosperous, — happy
“Ah! Camille," interrupted the marchioness, clasping
her hands, “ happiness is a thing beyond my reach,-
beyond even the granting of your zealous attachment.
More easy for France to renew the ancient institutions she
has demolished, and close up the grievous wounds she has
inflicted, than for Emiline de St. Florentin to experience
one hour of unmingled joy !".
“Our lives, which are the gift of God,” said Madelon,
who was present at this conversation, are never beyond
reach of his blessings! His mercy has decreed that our
heaviness shall not alway prevail, — that joy shall come
with the morning. — Time imparts comfort to the severest
afflictions.”

These arguments, frequently renewed among the little
party so strangely gathered into a family group at Manoir,
as the creatures of the earth crowd together for mutual
support in the darkness of a storm, gradually produced
a degree of intimacy, an interchange of opinions and feel-
ings between Valazy and Emiline, such as ages passed in
their original circumstances could never have effected.
He was careful to shun all intrusion on the presence of his
mother's gentle guests, at hours rendering his society a
constraint; but the company of a faithful friend, an
enlightened scholar, and discriminating counsellor, was
accounted by them a valuable and gratifying resource.
Léonie, who was acquainted with Valazy only in the light
of a gentleman of prepossessing person and address, spoke
of him and to him with consideration and regard. Even
Emiline, who, as a daughter of the Duc de Navelles, had
in former days dwelt so strongly on the meanness of his
origin, unconsciously acquired towards him the air of esti-
mation she beheld him receive from others. He had
ceased to be the Camille of Grand Moulin in her recollec-
tion. He was now only the dearest of her friends, — the
defender of her husband, — the preserver of her children ;
and if sometimes prompted to wonder at her cousin's com-
ments on his personal attractions, it was only that she
beheld him in a light still more sacred and reverential.
With the encouragement conveyed by this alteration of
manner and the unlimited advantages of their relative
position, it was not wonderful that Valazy should suffer his
former feelings to renew their fatal potency. Reckless of
coming dangers or political terrors, he gave himself up
to the joy of the hour. Day after day he allowed himself
to sit listening to her voice, and gazing upon her beauty ;
and, without further project or expectation, luxuriate in
that self-abandonment of passion which acknowledges
only the existence of one engrossing object. He had ob-
tained Madame de St. Florentin's assent to his project of
emigration ; and it was settled among them that imme.
diately on the arrival of little Emiline from Paris with
Bauveau and his wife, the whole party should embark for

England, till the amended destinies of their native country
afforded a renewal of national tranquillity.
Yet, in spite of himself, Carnille could not repress a
thousand vague presentiments of further evil. Often,
in the midst of his happiest and most familiar acceptance
in the society of the two cousins, when he had suc-
ceeded for a time in withdrawing their attention from their
unfortunate situation, he would fly from their presence,
mount his horse, and seek the wild solitudes of the sand-
hills and the sea-shore; or plunge himself into the depths
of the forest of Hardelot, with its melancholy waste of sere
and yellow leaves; writhing beneath a sense of his pre-
sent infatuation and future disappointments.
" When all these commotions shall have ended,” said
he, as he wandered listlessly among the wild tracts of the
woods, “ when the tranquil routine of social order shall be
re-established in France, Emiline will learn to regard me
as the abject thing I am; and I shall have preserved her
but to become the prize of one more richly gifted with the
adventitious distinctions of society. The very familiarity
which appears to my deluded heart a precious and endear-
ing token, is but the involuntary evidence of Emiline's
sense of superiority! - So conscious is her heart of the
disparity between us, that she sees no danger in admitting
me to the intimacy of friendship."
Meanwhile, in spite of the tranquillity of the happy
valley, the progress of affairs in the capital was any thing
but uneventful. Successful in every foreign struggle, the
army of the north under Kellerman had driven back the
Prussians from their rash conquests in Lorraine ; while in
the south, Chamberry was occupied by Montesquieu, under
whose banners the unknown hero of the age was perfecting
his military education, while Custine pursued his eastward
course of successes in Alsace.
In the metropolis itself, measures still more vital to the
interests of the nation were accelerating the progress of
the new order of things. The Legislative Assembly had
been dissolved, to give place to the Convention ; the first
decree of the new Assembly had effected the radical sup-
pression of royalty; and at the instigation of Collot

d'Herbois, a strolling player — and of the constitutional
Bishop Grégoire, a village-curate · France became a re-
public !
Death was decreed to all emigrants convicted of having
borne arms; the ordinary titles of the nobility were ex-
changed for those of citoyen and citoyenne ; a sentence of
proscription was recorded against the royalists ; and
a public trial decreed by the Convention on the per-
sons of its dethroned sovereigns. The military suc-
cesses arising under the new administration served to daz-
zle the eyes of the people, and disguise its feebleness and
incapacity ; and while the ferocity of the populace became
privileged by the tone of its rulers, the aristocracy of France
was daily humiliated by the sacrifice of fresh victims.
But as if the sanguinary resolutions of the conven-
tional assembly were insufficient to satisfy the thirst of the
multitude, a secondary convention pursued its delibera-
tions in the ancient convent of the Jacobins ; boasting
among its members all the desperate and infamous cha-
racters of the metropolis, as well as all the master spirits
of the democratic party, skilled to turn to account these
instruments of mischief. Many of the leading deputies of
the Assembly did not hesitate to lend their pernicious elo-
quence to its debates, which were prolonged far into the
depth of the night, in a gloomy hall of the ancient monas-
tery, lighted by a few scattered lamps, and crowded to suf-
focation with the lowest class of revolutionary ruffians.
Projects and measures too horrible to proceed from the
better order of patriots, were placed in the mouths of the
more brutalised of the throng ; scarcely conscious of the
meaning of the atrocities they were taught to utter. The
sittings of the conclave were opened by the vociferation of
hymns of barbarous triumph ; alternately gloomy as the
menaces they illustrated, and hideous from the contrast of
their unnatural gaiety. The correspondence of the frater-
nal societies of the provinces was next read for the advan-
tage of the Parisian members, amounting to about fifteen
hundred. Every evil passion and savage instinct, was
triumphantly exhibited by men, who affected to advance
the cause of virtue and of liberty by indulgence in vices

and crimes prohibited by religious creeds of whatever de.
nomination, and by the laws and customs of civilised
countries.
One day when Camille was engaged in reciting to Emi-
line and her companion the victorious progress of the re-
publican troops in Piedmont, and attempting to interest
their attention by his lively sketch of the military, enthu-
siasm of his young friend of the artillery service - Napo-
leon Buonaparte, -- Tonton suddenly intruded his uncouth
structure into the apartment to announce that a gentleman,
- a stranger,— was anxious to speak to le Capitaine.
Both ladies started from their seats in terror; but Va-
lazy, assuring them that the mysterious stranger was only a
municipal officer levying some circular tax, accompanied
Tonton to the hall ; where he was greeted by the eager
salutations of his servant Bauveau.
“For the love of Heaven !” cried Valazy as he closed
the door, “why have you prolonged our anxieties by ne-
glecting to forward intelligence ?"
Bauveau mournfully waved his head.
" You hesitate !- The child ! reply, I conjure you,
Bauveau, is the little girl in safety ?”
“ Alas! monsieur le capitaine I have reason to hope
that she is in good hands — but
“ You could not have exerted yourself,” cried Valazy in
despair

“Suffer me to explain the progress of my misfortunes,
said the man, with an air of so much distress, that his
master became doubly alarmed.
“ I had the satisfaction, sir, of seeing the nurse and child
at Florincthun, and installing them as you proposed under
the care of my wife. The young lady you left with us
appeared to comfort herself with the innocent playfulness
of the little companion I had brought her. For three days,
sir, all remained quiet and well, and Mademoiselle Del-
planque was gradually recovering her strength and courage,
when we were disturbed by the arrival of an old gentle-
man, her father; who conducted himself in the most out-
rageous manner, indulging in invectives and accusations

against his daughter, which my respect for you, sir, for-
bids wie to repeat.
“I was persuaded that miserable old blockhead would
be the origin of mischief,” cried Camille, impatiently.
6 Go on
-go on.”
“He insisted that his daughter should quit your house
without a moment's delay ; and I heartily wish that the
common courtesies of life had not induced me to request
he would defer removing Ma'amselle Euphroisine till
morning. His indiscreet manner of seeking out your
abode had excited suspicion; and before daylight, sir, the
house was invested for a domiciliary visit. But though
nothing suspicious was detected, Delplanque and his
daughter were arrested as disguised aristocrats.”
“I have no doubt he was consoled for his misfortune by
falling under such a suspicion,” said Camille, peevishly.
“ One of the officers persisted in recognising made-
moiselle and the little girl, as the Marchioness and Ma'am-
selle de St. Florentin ; and the child, when interrogated,
naturally confirmed the suspicion by a frank acknow-
ledgment of her name.”
“ But surely the ruffians did not drag to prison an
innocent of Mademoiselle St. Florentin's age ?”
“ She was removed with Delplanque's daughter to the
house of detention at the Carmelites; while the old man
and myself were conducted together to the Salpétrière.”
- Alas! my poor
Bauveau - you
have then been the
inmate of a prison, while I ventured to accuse you of
negligence in my service ?”
“For nearly three weeks, I suffered the galling irri-
tations of my position, and the dread of your anxiety
at my silence.
At the end of that period, I was dis-
charged without further comment;— and had the morti.
fication of ascertaining that on the same day, both Del-
planque and the prisoners of the Carmelites were removed
to some other prison,- which, alas ! my utmost efforts
have failed in discovering.”
“Great God! they have perhaps been already sacri-
ficed!”

provincial commune of Delplanque. Anxious for your
further instructions, I have placed my wife in safety with
her family, - and
He was interrupted by the voice of Madame de St.
Florentin, at the door of the chamber, claiming admittance.
Having ascertained the stranger to be the Parisian do-
mestic of Camille, she flew to question him relative to
her child.
Confirm
every
word
you hear me utter,” whispered
Valazy to Bauveau as he hastened to open the door ;-
and when Emiline, supported on the arm of her cousin,
staggered towards him, he assured her that Bauveau had
left her child well and in good hands at Paris ; but that
the nurse having quitted her charge, he did not venture on
so long a journey without female attendance.
This state-
ment was eagerly seconded by Bauveau. But the air of
trepidation visible upon the countenances of both could
not escape the scrutiny of a mother!
“You are deceiving me,- I am persuaded you are de-
ceiving me !” she exclaimed, sinking into a chair.
some days past, my suspicions have been awakened,” fal-
tered the marchioness. Camille, who understands so
well the claims of affection, Camille, who knows the
duties of a parent,—and who, in his own person, would
shrink from the perilous execution of none,— has attempted
to dissuade me from returning to Paris and re-possessing
myself of my helpless child !-Had any hope remained for
me, would he have acted thus ? - No— no !-I see how
it is — another of the blessings of my existence has been
wrested from me,- I have lost my precious Emiline !”
“ Not so, madam la marquise,” interrupted Bauveau
respectfully,-“ Mademoiselle de St. Florentin is safe-

seat and with clasped hands advancing towards the dis-
tressed Valazy, -"you have never deceived me. - You
have been a true and steadfast friend. — Do not, do not
trifle with me now !”

approaching her foster-brother and seizing his unresisting
hands within her own. -"Dearest Camille !- the truth-

“On my life on my honour— I have no intelligence,
madam, to the contrary.”
Alas, alas! he prevaricates !” exclaimed the distracted
mother.—“ He does not dare explain himself more fully.
One word more, —and as you value my existence, my
reason — be explicit.— Is my poor precious babe still re-
sident at Paris beneath your roof?”
She fixed her eyes with so penetrating an expression of
anguish on those of Valazy as she spoke, that involuntarily
he evaded their mute inquiry and hesitated to reply. But
all answer had been superfluous. The marchioness had
fallen to the floor in a state of insensibility.

It is astonishing with what facility the most timid persons
become familiarised with the aspect of danger and death,
during a period of revolution. It was scarcely a matter
of surprise to Euphroisine Delplanque to find herself a
second time in the hands of the minions of the new go-
vernment. Having long abandoned all hope of affording
effectual service to the royal victims, against whose lives all
France all Europe - - seemed leagued in a common bond
of cruelty or indifference, her own seemed to lose all esti-

to die in peace,

mation in her eyes.
The cause for which she had lived,
and moved, and had her being, was trampled in the dust;
and Euphroisine, on recovering her senses under the tender
cares of Madame Bauveau, deviated not a moment from
the expression of her regret that Valazy had not suffered
her to perish among the victims to the royal cause, in the
undistinguishing butchery of the prisoners of Paris. She
foresaw herself reserved for a similar destiny. There was
nothing on the earth to move her regrets; and willingly
would she have laid down her head upon a decent pillow,
with a parting prayer of gratitude for
Camille-— of intercession for the persecuted family of her
sovereign !
She was not, however, prepared with fortitude to find
her poor old father involved in her ruin ; nor to bear up
against the maledictions which, in the mortification and
terror of his arrest, he pronounced against herself.
was not nerved with courage to hear, without tears, the cries
of the little Emiline de St. Florentin after her mother and
sister, - nor to see the innocent child condemned to the
rigours and confinement of a prison.
· In the bitterness of these aggravations to her former
misery, she had been detained a fortnight at the Carmelites,
when one morning she heard herself summoned by the
turnkey to be transferred to the Conciergerie ; and recol.
lecting the dreadful events connected with her last removal
in La Force, instantly disentangled the arms of little
Emiline from her neck, and addressing herself with hurried
but earnest eloquence to a lady,-a young and beautiful
stranger, whom she had repeatedly noticed for the grace
and tenderness of her demeanour towards an aged friend,
whom she comforted by daily visits during her captivity,-
implored her to take charge of the helpless child, and pre-
serve her from immediate death. “ If you are a mother,"
cried Euphroisine, in incoherent accents, you
will not
withhold your mercy from the orphan of one of the noblest
houses in France.”
“ Fear not, replied the stranger, receiving the little girl
into her arms, as the turnkeys rudely pushed forward to
expedite the slackened progress of Mademoiselle Delplanque

through the prison-court. “I am a mother — I have a
mother's heart—your little nursling shall share its pro-
tection.”
Finding that she was by no means more painfully si-
tuated at the Conciergerie than in her former durance,
Euphroisine was soon tempted to lament the precipitation
with which she had delivered the daughter of Madame de
St. Florentin into unknown guardianship. But the act
was irrecallable ; and her warm recollection of the mild
and endearing expression of the lady's countenance, and
of the tears which hung upon the silken lashes of her deep
blue eyes in accepting the pledge, almost satisfied the
scruples of the prisoner.
Euphroisine had, in truth, other sorrows to disturb the
weariness of captivity. She knew not whether the old
man her father were yet alive; and though she passed the
greater portion of her time in framing letters of inquiry
addressed to his friends in Paris, had every reason to
suspect that they served no better purpose than to light
the pipe of her gaoler. The inmates of the ward in which
she was confined, which was one marked for peculiar se-
verity, consisted of four women of the highest rank, of
advanced age ; but not sufficiently softened by prison dis-
cipline to renounce the haughty pretensions of their aris-
tocratic estate. When they discovered their youthful com-
panion to be a tradesman's daughter, each was anxious to
purchase her services as femme de chambre; and on her
mild excuses, began to treat her with the hauteur due to a
retired bourgeoise du Marais, and the disgust they con-
sidered due to their discovery of her temporary assumption
of male attire and military duties.
But notwithstanding the degraded and monotonous iso-
lation of her existence, Euphroisine was never tempted to
wish she had met with other companions; for the occa-
sional visits paid to the fierce Duchesse d'Annécy and the
two countesses her sisters, afforded her those tidings of
the condition of the unhappy prisoners in the Temple,
which she might not have gathered from meaner asso-
ciates. She even ascertained incidentally from their dis-
course that Madame de St. Florentin, her children, and

Léonie de Mirepoix were believed to have perished in the
flames of the Château de Florincthun; and as the decree
of death passed by the Convention on all emigrants re-
turning to France rendered the re-appearance of the mar-
chioness impossible, Euphroisine ceased to regret the mea-
sures she had taken for the safety of Emiline. Little did
she imagine that the party which so often occupied her
solicitudes had never quitted their native soil ;— little did
she conjecture what days, what weeks, what months of
pain and solicitude were passed by the inmates of Manoir,
while Valazy vainly attempted to recover traces of herself
and the child.
Meanwhile, the course of public events was marked in
characters of blood ! - At 'every sitting, the Convention
became more deeply involved in a system of terrorism and
severity. The trial of the king-his condemnation-his
execution ; -the murder of Marie Antoinette, of the in-
nocent Madame Elizabeth -- followed like gradations of
crime. Already the name of Robespierre was rising into
horrible pre-eminence ;-— while Marat, his rival in sin, had
encountered the retributive hand of a female assassin. Yet
these catastrophes, so memorable to the pen of history,
so mighty in their causes and effects throughout their scat-
tered progress, - produced no change in the destiny of the
obscure prisoner of the Conciergerie, who had adventured
her life and safety to retard their operation. Month after
month brought tidings of some further humiliation in-
flicted on the queen; and Euphroisine, blinded by the
tears of her infructuous indignation, was accustomed to sit
ruminating on the afflictions of the captive of the Temple,
till she became unconscious of her own.
At length that dreadful year of probation was at an end.
On the 16th of October, 1793, Marie Antoinette of
France perished on the scaffold, — having atoned by the
severest earthly sufferings for the venial transgressions of
a life of frivolity. “ The sacrifice of your head at the
guillotine,” said one of her most ferocious judges, in an-
nouncing her fatal sentence to the queen,

Errors, but no crimes!” interrupted the daughter of
Maria Theresa ; — and thus expiring with the humility of
a Christian and the dignity of a queen, the illustrious
victim bequeathed to the abhorrence of all times and
countries the memory of her assassins.
A few days previous to this heart-rending catastrophe,
which afflicted no subject of the kingdom with more
severity than the humble Euphroisine, three of the noble
companions of her captivity were dragged forth to the
scaffold, and replaced by persons of inferior and more
companionable degree ; who, from the recency of their
imprisonment, were enabled to initiate her with appalling
accuracy into the present condition of the metropolis,
the overthrow of all the decencies of society, the estab-
lishment of the most sanguinary of despotisms under the
banner of Liberty and the sanction of men who felt that the
first person venturing to pause in the career of the Revolu-
tion must be crushed by the mighty machine he had set in
motion ! - St. Just, the mouthpiece of Robespierre, was
often heard to declare, that “ to dare all things was the prin-
ciple of the new administration.”
Nor were the atrocious distinctions achieved by Maxi-
milien Valazy forgotten among the records afforded by the
newly arrived victims of the Conciergerie. He had at-
tained the summit of his “bad eminence ; ” and his un-
equalled command over the passions of the Jacobin party
was supposed to have attracted the envy and jealousy of the
Cordelier faction. Enriched in a most suspicious degree
by that sanguinary coinage facetiously said by Danton to
issue from the mint of the guillotine, he was distin-
guished by the wanton profusion of his habits of life, and
the imperial magnificence displayed by the miserable girl
now metamorphosed into the beatified priestess of the new
creed. The mistress of Maximilien Valazy was selected
to receive the adoration of the most civilised capital of
Europe, under the title of the Goddess of Reason !
But Euphroisine had no indignation to bestow on this
part of the narrative. The position of Flavie suggested a
hope that her interference might procure tidings of her
poor old father; nor did she hesitate to address the object

of her contempt with an earnest prayer for her interest to
secure their confinement in the same prison.
A letter addressed to a person boasting the protection of
one of the most influential members of the Convention,
was more sacred in the eyes of the turnkey than those
bearing the superscription of a paltry citizen of the Rue
St. Honoré; and most unfortunately for the imprudent
daughter of Delplanque, he chose to deliver it into the
hands of Maximilien himself, who believed Euphroisine to
have fallen during the massacres of the preceding Septem-
ber. Too much occupied during the intervals of his public
duty with the indulgence of his libertine pursuits, to enter
minutely into the details of the outrages committed under
his sanction, his sole regret in the success of his projects was
the escape of Camille from his revengeful designs, and the
feeble execution of his will at Florincthun, by the death of
the marchioness, who, with her family possessions, he had
in ded to make own by marriage. He was not only
ignorant of her actual escape, and the part taken by his
cousin in her favour, but from that memorable day had
never obtained the slightest clue to the motives of Camille's
sudden departure from Paris, or the cause of his flight.
He knew that two persons had been falsely arrested as
the deceased Duc de Navelles and his daughter ; and be-
lieved them to have been set at liberty, without troubling
himself with further inquiries.
Great, therefore, was his astonishment on learning, from
the startling communication of Euphroisine Delplanque,
that a victim whom he had sentenced to especial execution
the preceding year, should have evaded the massacre at
La Force, and still survive in the dungeons of Paris ! De-
testing her as a person connected with his kinsman, he
resolved to visit her in prison, with the hope of obtaining
intelligence relative to the present retreat of Camille.
It was the second time Euphroisine Delplanque had
been confronted, in all the insolence of office, by the
Citoyen Valazy ; - it was the second time her contemp-
tuous glance had found occasion to note the malevolent
expression and bullying air, with which the spirit of evil
disfigures the noblest form. Maximilien possessed an

incomparably higher cast of personal beauty than his
cousin ; yet her remembrance of the gentle grace of Ca-
mille's figure, and the romantic and somewhat mournful
expression of his intelligent countenance, formed a disad-
vantageous contrast with the ruffianly audacity of the
fierce Jacobin before her.
Seating himself in the wooden chair of her miserable
cell, he motioned Euphroisine to place herself opposite;
and as he proceeded in his coarse interrogations, scanned
with a deliberate sneer the ravages effected by a year's
imprisonment on her beautiful person.
“ You are the Citoyenne Delplanque ?”
Euphroisine bowed her assent.
“ I should scarcely have thought so, upon the evidence
of my recollection ! Convicted of having afforded im-
portant assistance to the royal cause ? "
Suspected of being suspected,” replied Euphroisine,
calmly.
It is you, however, who have addressed a letter to the
Citoyenne Audicourt, requiring her interest to procure
an interview with your father?
“ It is, indeed!” cried Euphroisine, losing at once all
the coldness and rigidity of her demeanour in the hope
that she had misinterpreted the intentions of Valazy; and
that he had been prevailed upon by Flavie to further her
restoration to her father. " You are come to announce
your assent to my prayer!”-
Softly, softly !” said Maximilien, putting her back
with the knotted stick he habitually carried.
“ When
do you ever hear of favours being granted without an equi-
valent?
“ Alas! what have I to offer ? " exclaimed Euphroisine,
despondingly. “ Twelve months have expired since my
father's arrest and my own. — I know not even where
they have confined him ; — and for our worldly posses-
sions, they have fallen into the hands of the nation, or of
those surviving relatives who believe us to be no more.
No, citoyen ! — if a bribe be necessary to secure your
acquiescence in my petition, I must resign myself to my
destiny. My trial will not be long; for the change you

ingly -
“ Bah!” interrupted Maximilien, with a brutal laugh.
“ Think you I came hither to bandy tirades of sentiment
with a puling romanticist ? I know you, citoyenne, for
a silly, flighty girl, whose head has been turned by the
notice of Capet's wife. But I have no desire to favour
myself with one of your declamations. Keep them for
my wishy-washy cousin, who will perhaps be willing to
turn an ear to them when he shall have dried his tears for
the loss of St. Florentin's widow.”
“ Is Emiline dead?”_involuntarily exclaimed Euphroi.
sine.
Ay! we have rid you of a troublesome rival ; and sent
her to join her royalist marquis from a pile as glorious as
that of a Hindoo Suttee! But to the point ! -
You are
acquainted with the secret retreat of the merchant of Lyons,
who, I am assured, has not passed the frontier. Give me
a clue to Camille Valazy's abode, and within an hour, I will
place you in your father's arms.'
Euphroisine staggered back a few paces and covered her
face with her hands. A snare had been woven for her,
almost beyond her powers of avoidance. She thought of
the poor old man whose tenderness for herself, for his
only child, — had been the means of betraying his infirm
age into the hands of the enemy.—She thought of her pro-
longed resistance to his commands in clinging to the cause
and service of the court; and trembled under the sense
of her temptation !
Her hesitation satisfied the mind of the observant
deputy, that the secret was at her disposal.
Speak but the word,” said he; “ for I have confidence
in your peevish veracity to know that you would not de-
ceive me.
- Say but that in such and such a place Camille
Valazy lies in concealment, and I promise you your father's
liberty and your own.”
This excess of generosity startled the suspicions of Eu-
phroisine. She was satisfied that some double meaning,

some delusion, - lurked under such specious offers.
Perhaps my poor father is already dead !” thought she;
“ but if not, Heaven forbid that I should purchase his
release with treachery — with the price of blood ! - This
monster, who believes the family of the Duc de Navelles
to have perished in the conflagration at Florincthun, would
doubtless devote them to destruction on discovering their
retreat at Manoir ! - Let me not die with the weight of
their betrayal on my conscience !”
“ I have the honour to wait your pleasure, citoyenne !”
cried Maximilien with profound scorn.
" And however
agreeable you may find your residence at the Conciergerie,
I am by no means ambitious of prolonging mine beyond
a reasonable limit. Do you accept my terms?”
56 I do not !”
“But you acknowledge yourself to be in possession of
the information I seek ?"
“I have made no such confession.”
“Fool!” cried Maximilien, stamping impatiently on the
pavement; see you not that you are trifling with your
own perdition ; and that, making all due allowance for fe-
minine obstinacy and stupidity, I have no time to waste
upon your heroics ? — Hark ye, girl!— I have just compas-
sion enough for your infatuation, to place the truth plainly
before you !— The Convention, by way of satisfying its
parental misgivings touching the principles and affections
of its beloved provinces, is about to extend the discipline
bestowed on Lyons, Nantes, Avignon, and others of its
cities, towards your tapestry-weaving bourgade of the north.
A special commission is on the point of visiting Arras,
with Lebon, - our worthy citizen, Joseph Lebon, - at its
head."
“Lebon !” faltered Euphroisine with quivering lips, for
the name of this emulator of Robespierre, this Seïd of the
Mahomet of Paris, had penetrated even the walls of the
Conciergerie.
“Robespierre marks his attachment towards his native
city by expediting, for its special reformation, the pro-
mising priestling whom we anticipate as the rival of his

333
reputation. And as my friend Lebon will naturally want
a few subjects on whom to give a specimen of his oper-
ations, I promise you, unless you comply with my propo-
sals, the honour of handselling his guillotine. Your father
and yourself shall be despatched back to judgment in his
native city, to be ready for the opening of the new
tribunal."
- You dare not!" - cried Euphroisine, with kindling
energy.
" You dare not thus pervert to the purposes of
private vengeance the laws of this misgoverned country.
Vile as you are,
- vile as are the suborned instruments
which serve to disseminate your polluted principles, and
deceive the people of France into a blind confidence in
your guardianship, you dare not adjudge to death an in-
nocent old man who in his life never breathed a political
opinion. No! you dare not !”
With a sudden impulse of rage, Valazy seized the arm
of the imprudent Euphroisine, while the Comtesse Eléo-
nore d’Annécy, who was sitting gathered like a ball in one
corner of the chamber, uttered a shriek of consternation.
6 Go! worm!” said he, recovering himself; “it
were an act of mercy to trample on thee :- I reserve thee
for a more exemplary destiny. Despite thy self-sufficiency,
thou shalt learn that the population which gazed un-
moved on the annihilation of a monarchy of eight centu-
ries' duration, which assisted as a public festival at the
execution of the ci-devant king — his wife - his sister -
his ministers will be little inclined to stir itself in be-
half of the insolent daughter of a demented old shopkeeper
of the Rue St. Honoré. Thou shalt learn thine own mi-
serable insignificance. Thou shalt implore my aid, — and
implore it in vain.”
It was some minutes after Valazy had quitted the
room, before Euphroisine could recover the stunning effects
of his denunciation ; and the first circumstance which re-
called her to recollection, was the gracious courtesy with
which she was greeted by her female companion. This
alteration of demeanour was attributed by the Countess
d'Annecy, the survivor of her original fellow-captives, to
-

the esteem excited by the spectacle of her undaunted cou-
rage ; but her recommendations that Euphroisine should
forward terms of submission to a person gifted with the
most unlimited power as well as a disposition to exert it
in her favour, convinced her that the countess had inter-
ested views.
But she was soon rescued from these importunities and
counsels. On the following day the Citoyenne Delplanque
was required to sign her certificate of safe discharge from
the Conciergerie ; and instal herself with fetters on her
hands in a covered cart, filled with prisoners and officers
of justice bound to Arras. In defiance of the inclement
weather, they travelled leisurely and without the pause
of a single hour to their destination ; with no better sub-
ject for their midnight study, than the execrations of the
assassins to whose safe conduct they were committed, and
the horrible pageant in which their own part was pre-
appointed.
Meanwhile, during Mademoiselle Delplanque's secret and
protracted imprisonment at the Conciergerie, the disconsolate
inhabitants of Manoir could scarcely be said to enjoy much
greater freedom of action. Beholding in the approach of
every inoffensive neighbour subject of terror and anxiety,
there was no hour of the day, no vicissitude of the season,
which relieved them from their solicitudes, or diverted their
minds from their afflictions and those of their distracted
country. Every research which could be prosecuted con-
cerning the place of Euphroisine's imprisonment, without
endangering the personal safety of Madame de St. Florentin
by attracting notice towards the unsuspected obscurity of
Manoir, was effected by the untiring exertions of her foster-
brother. More than once, on the encouragement of secret
information, he visited Paris in disguise; confronting the
danger of detection and the afflicting spectacle of the sub-
version of order and decency during the Reign of Terror.
At the instigation of Léonie, he even reluctantly sought the
ruins of Florincthun; which, though claimed by the next
kinsman of the St. Florentin family as the hereditary pro-
perty of an unproscribed and unemigrated race, still re-
mained in dispute and in the occupation of national officers,

335
But it was only to learn from the vaunts of the villagers,
that it was at the instigation of a stanch friend of the na-
tion—Valazy, one of the popular members of the Conven-
tion — they had triumphed over their former masters, de-
stroyed the château by fire, and consumed the whole family
on the burning pile !
Such were the insufficient tidings collected by Camille.
On the advice of his notary, he enrolled himself in the
archives of the état civil of the commune at Arras, as a member
of the republic available for the duties of the National
Guard; and during his sojourn in that city obtained such
information from the correspondent of his man of business,
-a worthy notary of advanced years, named Voisenon,
as satisfied him that the wealthy relatives of Delplanque
and his daughter believed them to have perished in the in-
discriminate massacre of the Parisian prisons.
He was cautious, however, to withhold this intelligence
from the still sanguine Emiline; for though certain that
both had survived that sanguinary epoch, the state of
Madame de St. Florentin's mind was such as to render all
communications of a dispiriting character highly dangerous.
More than once, the alternations of hope and fear to which
she was subjected touching the recovery of her little girl,
produced a relapse of her former alarming attack; and
during these dreadful paroxysms, Camille and his mother,
with undeviating and vigilant tenderness, devoted them-
selves to watch over her - to wait upon her caprices-
to soothe her irritations; while Léonie appropriated her
cares to the half-orphaned child, and her humble prayers
to Heaven for an alleviation of their common wretched-
ness !
Meanwhile, the conventional edict passed for a nominary
census throughout the provinces, with a view to the detec-
tion of secreted royalists and unconstitutional priests, tended
to aggravate their apprehensions of recognition or betrayal.
Without consulting the prejudices of the marchioness,
Camille caused the two noble cousins to be entered in the
parochial certificate as the Citoyennes Dumanoir, kinswomen
to the proprietor of the farm; but this new measure of th
administration, by placing every individual of every family

under the surveillance of the authorities of the district,
tended to redouble his uneasiness for his guests, and his
desire that they should quit the kingdom without delay.
The year which had crept over their heads since the fatal
catastrophe of Florincthun had produced a powerful effect
upon the feelings of Camille. The mind of his adored
Emiline, however intelligent or however fortified by prin-
ciples of religion, was not of a tone to rise with circumstances.
Overpowered by those calamities which the energetic firm-
ness of Euphroisine might have enabled her to surmount,
she was alternately exalted by unnatural excitement, and
overwhelmed by despondency. Her heart, apparently
cauterised by the domestic bereavements she had undergone,
became insensible to the influence of public events; and
even the recital of the destinies of the sovereigns she loved
and honoured, appeared to fall unnoticed on her ear. Her
personal sorrows imparted a species of bitterness to her con-
templation of the political evils attributed to the misgovern-
ment of the court of Versailles.
But though this feebleness of character had insensibly
deadened the aspirations of her infatuated lover, at a period
of life when the heart and its impulses acquire so undue a
supremacy over all human conduct, the qualities and powers
of his mind were not always to be retained in this fatal
subjection. Developed by the progress of time, as well as
by the ordeal of a great public crisis, the spirit of Valazy
began to chafe against the boundaries within which he had
too patiently limited his career. So long as the existence
of Louis XVI. afforded the probability of a modified re-
establishment of the French monarchy, the troubles of the
kingdom might be esteemed a temporary struggle, making
way for the formation of a liberal constitution. But this
very constitution had assumed so independent and unpre-
cedented a form, its measures and organisation were so
notoriously perverted and retarded by the operations of the
band of ruffians to which the retribution of Providence had
intrusted the chastisement of the kingdom, that no lover
of liberty or of his country could suffer himself to remain
inactive in the cause. The sovereigns of Europe had

337
leagued themselves to exterminate the spurious national
power which had risen up during their lethargy and existed
in defiance of their threats; and the question was no longer
the modification of monarchical and aristocratical institu.
tions, but the combination of the people of France against
their foreign enemies and domestic traitors.
The heart of Valazy revolted within him as he dwelt
upon these things ! He felt that he had no right to
betray his
Noon of manhood to a myrtle shade,
while the hydra, bred on the soil of his native country,
was spreading a pestilence over her devastated plains.
Yet how to tear himself away from the guardianship of
the precious deposit committed to his care ; — how re-
linquish the affecting ties which circumstances had ren-
dered as sacred as they were dear? — His domestication
under the same roof with the object of his earliest attach-
ment, instead of diminishing the charm by which he had
been so long infatuated, served rather to magnify its in-
fluence. The beauty of Emiline, - her grace of de-
meanour,—and that perfect and pure refinement of thought,
word, and action, which no casual humiliation can degrade,
- not only fascinated his eyes and formed an embellishment
to his daily existence, but her helplessness,— her feebleness,
- her reliance on himself, – her tenderness to his mother,
- her womanliness, in short, in every sentiment and every
frailty, — trebled the bond of his devotion to her cause !-
He loathed himself whenever he reflected upon the inert-
ness which had retarded the progress of his public career;
but he loathed himself still more when, on rumour of some
new commotion, he was tempted to a momentary design of
quitting Manoir,- of devoting his sword to the call of his
country, and bequeathing the strangers within his gates
to the protection of a merciful Providence !
Profiting by the improvement which became visible in
the health of the marchioness on the return of spring,
Valazy proceeded to lay before her with the utmost de-
licacy, but with firmness and energy, the degrading and
z

painful situation in which he was placed by her refusal to
quit the country.
“ So long as it is your will to remain my mother's
inmate," said he, “ so long will her son devote himself to
your protection.
While Maximilien Valazy exists, the
daughter of Navelles possesses too deadly an enemy to be
intrusted to any common mode of defence. But could
you be persuaded, madam, to seek refuge for a time in
England, would you but permit me to escort you thither
and witness your establishment, I might return to my
country, - to my duty, — without the paralysing thought
of Emiline's danger to unnerve my soul.”
“ Be merciful, dearest cousin,” cried Léonie, entwining
her arms round her waist. “By cherishing an expecta-
tion rejected by your better reason, you endanger yourself,
- your little Aglaë, your faithful Madelon, -- and embitter
the existence of our friend.”
Why cannot Camille depart upon the duty which he
considers so imperious - and
Be not ungenerous ! - Has he not for eigh-
teen miserable months devoted his existence to our aid and
consolation ? — and can you suppose the conduct of your
foster-brother actuated by any ordinary measure of attach-
ment?”
“I do not ! - But he would mark it in a manner more
satisfactory to my feelings by suffering me to remain here
under the care of my dear, good Madelon, than by forcing
me into desolate and unprotected banishment.”
“ If my service be conducive to your happiness, my
child,” said Madame Valazy to her refractory nursling,
“ fear not but that I will gladly accompany you into
exile.”
“ And on receiving intelligence that our lives have been
so miraculously preserved, my brother will hasten to meet
us in England,” persisted Léonie.
“ do not reject our petition," resumed Valazy, throw-
ing himself at her feet. “ These provinces will soon be
a still more dangerous residence than even the capital of
France; and the sacrifice I am making of my honour,
Why?

great as it is, may not suffice to preserve you from the
detection of my vile kinsman, or the persecutions of Lebon's
commission.”
It was not possible for the obstinacy of Madame de St.
Florentin to resist these arguments. She consented that
Valazy should visit Arras to effect such an arrangement
of his pecuniary affairs as would enable him to conduct
them to England, and return without delay to engage as a
volunteer in the republican army.
His departure, however, was not contemplated without
anxiety by Mademoiselle de Mirepoix or her cousin.
They were now so accustomed to feel themselves secured
by his guardianship and solaced by his society, that a day
passed without Camille, became a season of dread and deso-
lation; and when the second night arrived appointed for
his return to Manoir, and he failed to make his appear-
ance, a thousand apprehensions took possession of their
minds. Bitterly did Emiline revile herself for having
sanctioned his departure.
Why did we suffer him to leave us ? Madelon
Léonie wherefore did you persuade me to concur in his
mad project?” cried she.“ In Camille's absence, I become
conscious of my helplessness, of my afflictions ; for
while he is with us, his tenderness obliterates all remem-
brance of the past. - Why did we suffer him to quit
Manoir !"
While they were anxiously looking for the arrival of
the truant, a national soldier attached to the mairie of
Samer made his appearance at the farm ; bearing a letter
superscribed not to the Citoyenne Dumanoir - but to the
ci-devant Marchioness of St. Florentin ; - a letter signed
with the name, not of Camille, - but of MAXIMILIEN
VALAZY !- The fugitives were betrayed !

BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.
On his arrival at the chef lieu, whither he had re-
sorted on more than one occasion during the early part
of his residence at Manoir, in the hope of gaining tidings
of Euphroisine, Camille was startled by an unusual
appearance of activity and animation in the streets.
Arras, in its ordinary character, presents so monotonous
and desolate an appearance, that he was at a loss to what
popular festivity or unwonted celebration to attribute the
change. But on presenting himself at the house of a re-
spectable notary of the town, whom he had repeatedly
visited upon business in company with the Curé Blaisel,
he learnt that the revolutionary tribunal had opened its
sittings during the preceding week ; that Lebon, the pre-
sident of the commission, had received powers and instruc-
tions from the Convention of a strangely ferocious descrip-
tion ; that the proceedings which had taken place were
calculated to foreshow the most tyrannous and sanguinary
administration ; and worse than all, that under sanction of
such authority, a spirit of jacobinical violence had mani-
fested itself among the populace, highly alarming to the
moderate party and all persons of respectable degree
throughout the city.
“I am now about to proceed to the tribunal,” said
monsieur - or, as he was now called, the Citoyen Voise-

a most
non, so which must be my excuse for not accompanying
you to the head quarters of the Garde Nationale, as you
desire. But in truth I have a most disagreeable
painful business on hand.”
“ Connected with this revolutionary commission ? '
“ Connected with a young person issued from the family
of a respectable burgess of this town. Arrested in Paris
on suspicion of having been concerned, through the most
improbable and romantic connection, in the adventures of
the royal family and the projects of the Tuileries, - she
has been sent hither to afford an example to the aristo-
cratic and moderate party of Arras ; and much against my
will, I am retained by the family of this poor girl to under-
take her defence, and that of her old father. I have little
hope for either party ; but unless old Delplanque's personal
folly
Delplanque ! — not the former silk-mercer of the Rue
St. Honoré? " cried Camille.
“ The very sanie. Surely you formerly interrogated me
touching this family, at a time when their wealthy relatives
in Arras believed both father and daughter to have
perished in the massacre of the 2d of September?
" True, true! But I delay you, - your presence is
required at the tribunal. Suffer me, Monsieur Voisenon,
to accompany you. I am more interested far, far more
- in this miserable affair, than in that which brought me
hither. – Euphroisine ! – poor unhappy girl !”
• Nay, then
I shall certainly not suffer you to bear
me company At your age, monsieur le capitaine, it is a
difficult task to place a vizard on the countenance, and a
padlock on the tongue, while the life and death of those
we love are trafficking before our eyes. I must not suffer
you to get into trouble by an intemperate testimony of
sympathy in the fate of my clients. No, no! my young
friend ! it is bad enough for an old practitioner like my-
self to witness the condemnation of youth, beauty, and
innocence. I will not have the outbreak of your indig-
nation to answer for.”
Nevertheless you must not prevent me from posting

myself in some inostensible situation, which will enable me
to follow the examination of the prisoners. My self-
command will better enable me to endure the visible pro-
gress of their destiny, than the anxiety of wandering about
the streets of Arras during the procedure.”
“ Remain here in my study till my return !” still per-
sisted Voisenon, solicitous for the safety of a young man
whom he highly esteemed.
“No !” replied Camille, with an air of calm determin-
ation, drawing nearer to the lawyer, who was now equipping
himself for departure. “You have nothing to fear from
my indiscretion.
The times we live in subvert our very
natures ; and I, who have served so long an apprenticeship
to simulation, - 1, who every day and every hour, am
compelled to place the most revolting constraint upon my
feelings, may be surely trusted in a case where the eyes
of thousands will be upon me.”
Voisenon, perceiving all further remonstrance to be
fruitless, departed in company with his young friend ; and
on approaching the fatal hall, pointed out to him the door
open to the ingress of such citizens as chose to profit by
the edifying lessons imparted for their instruction. From
the struggle which Valazy encountered in making good his
entrance, it appeared that the inhabitants of Arras were
still unsatiated with the terrible pageant prepared for them
by the providence of their infamous townsman, Maximilian
Robespierre ; but on paying a small gratuity to one of the
national ushers, Camille was accommodated with a seat in
a small gallery, the front benches of which were occupied
by respectable burgesses and well-dressed females.
The area below was filled with a tumultuous mob of
sans-culottes of the lowest description ; and as in most
instances of popular assemblage during the demoralising
period of the Revolution, chiefly females.
It is true,
that on occasion of some of its earlier scenes of riot and
bloodshed, such as the attack on Versailles, the entry of
the populace into the Tuileries, and the massacre of the
prisons, the costume of poissardes and market women
was assumed by many well-known leaders of the Jacobin

343
party, who did not think proper to render themselves
responsible by open participation in these acts of violence,
But it is also certain, that many of the most savage out-
rages of the Revolution were committed under the eyes,
and even at the instigation, of females ! During the trial of
Louis XVI., one end of the Hall of Assembly was con-
verted into a place of fashionable resort. Women, ele-
gantly dressed and characterised by grace and loveliness
which might have adorned the most humane and feminine
of their sex, were seated day after day in the different
boxes ; eating ices and oranges, smiling and coquetting,
and inciting the ferocious resolutions of such among the
deputies as divided their attention between the duties of
their post and of their gallantry.
In justice to the female character of the Parisians, it
must be admitted, that such personages as Flavie Audi.
court and La Desmahis already assumed the importance
assigned by ill-gotten wealth and the supremacy of crime
during the reign of terror to the most degraded individuals;
-and that the female frequenters of the clubs of Paris
were of the same wretched class who adorned themselves
with flaxen tresses, purchased of the executioner Samson
as those of the Princess de Lamballe, and instituted balls
à-la-victime, held in desecrated churches, where the light
feet of the dancers bounded over sepulchral stones !-
Such were the women who presided over the trial of the
unfortunate king; and who, as every member made his
appearance singly in the tribunal to offer his vote, saluted
with intemperate applauses the memorable affirmative of
“ LA MORT !” —and assailed with hootings and insult the
merciful minority, which demanded deposition, imprison-
ment, or an appeal to the people, A scene of judgment
such as might be supposed to proceed in reverent and
, breathless tranquillity, assumed the tone of a brawling and
disreputable election riot!
The spectators, male and female, assembled in the tri-
bunal-hall at Arras, though of a somewhat different order
from the factious idlers of Paris, were by no means secondary

in ferocity of purpose. Prepared by the exordium of the
new commissioner to witness a liberal outpouring of blood,
and accustomed to the spectacle of such an effusion, they
considered themselves ill used if defrauded of this habitual
recreation. The sanguinary Lebon, whose age, aspect,
and profession accorded strangely with the monstrous
atrocities of his official proceedings, had been careful to
select for the revolutionary committee delegated under his
authority, men branded with infamy in their previous
courses of life, and capable of all excesses in the execution
of their revolutionary duties. Yet in more than one in-
stance, when even these notorious ruffians hesitated in the
condemnation of an innocent person, the wretched prisoner
was brought back from his dungeon to the bar of the tri-
bunal, while the president in a violent harangue to the
court, announced that the first member convicted of modéa
rantisme should be instantly dragged to the guillotine.
And thus, mercy became a forgotten word under his juris-
diction; and Camille Valazy, when on entering the gallery
he cast a shuddering glance on the four prisoners standing
within the bar, perceived at once in their countenances the
impassive expression of utter despair !
The individual on trial was a rich merchant of Cambray;
whose prosperity and opulence had drawn upon him the
enmity of the Jacobin party of his native city. He was
accused— like the respectable and unfortunate citizens who
illustrated the despotism exercised at Bourdeaux by Tallien
and Isabeau—of belonging to the mercantile aristocracy,
a crime newly invented by the Convention ;-of having
amassed his riches by monopoly, and an usurious use of his
capital ;---and, finally, of having openly inveighed against
the law of maximum. It was in vain that the agitated and
bewildered prisoner implored his judges to discriminate be-
tween pernicious monopoly and the right of warehousing
(emmagazinement), so essential to the course of commerce.
He was cut short in his defence as prolix and importunate,
and condemned almost unheard.
On being dragged from the hall, his place at the bar was
occupied by a young woman holding an infant in her arms,

apparently a simple. peasant of the province of Artois.
As she held up her head to cast a glance of appeal to-
wards the committee, the sinister countenances which met
her view penetrated the trembling mother with such a thrill
of despair, that with an involuntary movement she folded
her child more closely to her bosom ; holding it there for
a moment, as if to guard its innocent life and her own by
that mighty and protecting union of natural affections.
To the accusation recorded against her, (of having
aided a correspondence between her former seigneur, a ci-
devant noble under sentence of death, and his wife and
daughter,) the poor woman pleaded guilty ; on the in-
stigation of her counsel, that to throw herself on the mercy
of the court might possibly procure a remission of her
sentence. But Lebon was not prepared to see a single
victim escape from the army of martyrs, with whose names
he promised himself to swell the list of his services to the
Convention. Having applied to his tablets for the private
information with which he had provided himself relative to
the accused, he assumed that artificial smile characterising
the plausibility of the neophytes of Robespierre, and pro-
ceeded to cross-examine the artless prisoner; demanding of
her, among other things, whether she had not adorned her-
self in her holyday attire on a certain Sunday, and secretly
confessed herself to an unconstitutional priest, living in
concealment in some village in the neighbourhood of
Arras? - The woman was put on her oath, and the ques-
tion reiterated by one of the committee. But she only
turned pale and shuddered, without venturing to deny the
truth of the charge.
“ Answer me, credulous idiot !” cried Lebon, with a
torrent of blasphemous invectives: “ the court waits your
reply.”
“ If your lordships would consider

zens of the French republic. Have you or have you not

terrified mother, straining her infant in her arms, as the
soldiers presented themselves to drag her away.

tender, friendless babe ! - My husband, my family,
- all have perished who could
A general shudder affected the better class of the spec-
tators, as the savage men by whom she was surrounded
attempted to tear the little creature from its mother's
grasp.
“ Will no merciful woman present here receive it from
me?” cried the frantic prisoner, extending her arms
towards the audience. “ Will no one purchase the fervent
blessing of a dying woman ?”
A young and very beautiful girl seated near the pri-
soner behind the bar, rose on this appeal, and moved
towards the unfortunate mother. But the scornful laugh
of the Assembly recalled to her remembrance her own
predicament; and, abashed and distressed, she cowered
back behind an old man who was also numbered among
the prisoners waiting their turn of summons,
and who
whispered loud enough to be heard by Camille, -
pity's sake, Euphroisine, meddle not with what so little
concerns you.
Consult your own dignity, child. - Be
silent, wait your turn; and do not aggravate our danger
by further temerity.”
“ Take the urchin from its mother,” cried Lebon, irri-
tated by this delay, “ and toss it into the lime-pit with her
dead body.--Away with them both ! — We have no leisure
to institute a nursery for the bantlings of refractory
royalists."
This iniquitous sentence was instantly obeyed; and the
hideous heart-piercing scream uttered by the mother as
they tore the little victim from her arms, froze the hearts
of the audience who wanted courage to betray
their indignation, and who, by this seeming concurrence,
led the way to those atrocities of Lebon, which penetrated

even into their own homes ; such as the condemnation
enforced on a miserable woman of lying for hours beneath
the guillotine, with the life-blood of a beloved husband
dropping on her face. *
But there was one spectator of the scene, who could not
so easily repress her abhorrence. For an instant, Eu-
phroisine Delplanque was transfixed with horror by that
searching cry of maternal agony; and stood pale, and
shuddering, and speechless. But the warm tide of feeling
which had deserted her stricken heart, returned with ten-
fold impetuosity. Urged by an irresistible impulse, she
rushed to the front of the bar, exclaiming in rapid but ar-
ticulate accents, “ I appeal to the God of the orphan and
the widow against this wanton outpouring of innocent
blood ! I denounce you before his tribunal as a trespasser
on his laws
Her father, forcibly interrupting this frantic expostu-
lation, clung round the resisting girl, and attempted to
withdraw her from farther exposure. But on this unpre-
cedented interruption, a sudden silence pervaded the tu-
multuous assembly; and all eyes were fixed on the youthful
prisoner who stood pale, stern, and nerved with high resolve,
defying the iniquitous magistrate on his very judgment-
seat ! - A constable of the court attempted to drag her
from the bar.
“ No, no !” cried Lebon, with a smile of bitter irony,
“ let the lady proceed !” and in terms of the coarsest
description, he requested her to favour him with the con-
clusion of her maledictory oration.
“ I have done !” said Euphroisine, in an altered
voice, while tears of wounded delicacy stole down her
cheeks. “ I have nothing left to urge ;
- for what avail
the murmurs of the lamb within the grasp of a beast of
Yet trust me, my voice - small and worthless as
it is may reach unto the throne of Omnipotence !

figure of the prophetess to the countenance of her judge,
where every fiendish and malignant passion appeared
concentrated. But the murmurs of the assembly, whose
transitory panic soon relaxed into rage at the insult offered
to their tribunal, burst on all sides around him, like
the surges of a chafing ocean ; and while Euphroisine
was hastily put aside by the minions of Lebon, old Del.
planque himself was thrust forward for examination. In-
voluntarily Camille recoiled on his seat; prepared by his
conviction of the old man's feebleness and egotism, for a
degrading exhibition of human imbecility. The first
pompous response of the ex-mercer excited at once the
risibility of the court, before which he was cited as the
“Citizen Delplanque, accused of aiding and abetting the
practices of certain nobles and royalists."
My name, gentlemen citizens,” said he, 6 is. Jean
Thomas Alexandre Delplanque; formerly a mercantile
employé of the court of France."
« Å tradesman of the queen ? inquired one of the
clerks of the tribunal, pen in hand.
“ Mercer by appointment to her majesty and the prin-
cesses !” replied the old man with his accustomed flourish;
" who may be said to have aided the practices of the court,
in so far as he has eaten with gratitude the bread of its
bestowing. For years, my family, my wife, my daughter,
were distinguished by the favour of the court of Ver-
sailles
“I must be permitted to warn my client,” said Voise-
non, hastily rising from his seat near the official table,
“ that he need not incriminate himself by entering into
particulars unexacted by the interrogatories of the com-
mission.”
“ I know it, citoyen notaire, — I know it !” cried the
old man, impatient of interruption.
" But neither my
silence nor your arguments will avail to save for a single
hour the life of my imprudent daughter ; and since that
is forfeited, what would be the value of my childless
days ? -No, sirs ! Since my poor Euphroisine is marked
for death, I have nothing more to do with caution or de-

fence; nor will I dishonour the last hour of an honourable
life, by denying the royal patrons who are gone before me.'
Euphroisine, who had remained standing by her father's
side, threw herself upon her knees before him, bathing his
hands with tears of veneration and gratitude, for this noble
and unexpected display of fortitude and loyalty ; while
Voisenon proceeded to address the court in favour of his
client. But without suffering him to proceed, Lebon, after
a diligent perusal of the instruction contained in his private
tablets, demanded that the examination of the daughter
should be included in that of the father ; and Euphroisine
was roughly raised from her knees, and placed at the bar
to meet the interrogatory.
But Valazy felt his own presence of mind unequal to
sustain the spectacle of Mademoiselle Delplanque's humi-
liation. He would have hazarded much to do her service ;
he never thought of her save with a thrill of admiration
and affection, — affection which, under any other circum-
stances than those in which he was involved, must have
ripened into warmth of attachment. Nay, sometimes, in
moments which forced with degrading prominence on his
notice the self-abasement with which he clung to ties above
his attainment, he had been prompted to upbraid himself
with wilful insensibility to the merits and partiality of a
being so well assorted to his condition and predilections as
Euphroisine Delplanque.
And to see such a woman baited by the injurious taunts
of a ruffian,-insulted by the overbearing arrogance of a
bench of sans-culotte ministers of justice,—and, finally,
perhaps, dragged forth to unresisting slaughter!-- A cold
dew rose on his forehead at the anticipation ; and hastily
rising from his seat, and quitting the tribunal of blood, he
hurried along the streets towards the bridge crossing the
Scarpe to avoid the clamorous cries of exultation rising
from the mob in the market-place, where a permanent
guillotine was erected, and where the populace waited
patiently for the tribunal to disgorge some fresh victim to
be offered up for their gratification !
Spring was already budding, and the gardens through

which the irritated Valazy pursued his course were clothed
with the exuberance of early blossoms, rendering the
orchard-suburbs of every French town so gay and beautiful
towards the close of April. The pastures were bright
with field-flowers; and where the waters of the Scarpe
went eddying along through the fertile meadows, tufts of
yellow iris and other aquatic plants reflected back the
cheering radiance of sunshine. But Camille pressed his
hand upon his eyes, as if to shut out the spectacle of the
creation and its loveliness,-- as if to efface all images con-
nected with man and his contaminating influence ! — It
seemed as if the spirits of evil had obtained a sanction of
authority over the soil of France, and were walking abroad
visibly in their accursedness. As he hurried along with
agitated footsteps, he execrated aloud the officious zeal
with which he had preserved the innocent Euphroisine from
the axe of the assassin, only to prolong her martyrdom by
eighteen months of wearisome imprisonment, ending in
trying exposure to the most merciless of tribunals !
Unable to endure the suspense under which he laboured,
he turned towards the city, with an intention of seeking
further information at the house of Voisenon ; but as he
passed the Cemetery without the city gate, he perceived
an excited and clamorous mob, conveying to the common
pit prepared with quicklime for the victims of the conven-
tional committee, the remains of those whom he had re-
cently beheld animated by the impulses of life and health!
With averted eyes, he turned aside from the reeking
basket which he believed to contain the body of the en-
thusiastic and beautiful Euphroisine !

Than to behold a creature, who, till grief

Above vexation, - and whose fragile leaf,
While yet 'twas blossoming in a genial clime,
Trembled at every breath, and sought relief

“What are you doing here?” cried Voisenon, hastily
closing the door of his study, as Camille presented him-
self before him. “ Come in, if you value your life ! -
Are you not aware that the bloodhounds are unloosed upon
your track?”

Camille gazed upon the worthy notary with tearful and

of our new legislator, who but too well understands the art
of varying his torments. But yourself, Monsieur Valazy

“ That for months past she had known nothing of your

- The president appeared to frame his inquiries accord.

" Then he has been ess instigated against the un-
fortunate Delplanque family by the malice of Maximilien
Valazy!” cried Camille, in the deepest affliction.
“ It matters little by whom. — Their doom is fixed;

prove less summary. Let me implore you, therefore, to
depart without delay.”

“I am to visit her this evening in prison,” replied
Voisenon, touched by the distress of his young friend.
My professional authority procures me this privilege.
Shall I bear her any message on your part?”
- None- none ! – You must suffer me to accompany
you.'
“ To what purpose ? Believe me, — and, alas ! my
experience too often enables me to avouch the fact,
these parting interviews serve only to aggravate the tor-
tures of the condemned, and bequeath an agonising recol-
lection to the survivor.”
“ Heaven knows I would not willingly inflict one ad-
ditional pang on so innocent, so amiable a sufferer!— Yet
I must see her, Monsieur Voisenon. · The happiness of a
whole family hangs upon a secret in the keeping of
Euphroisine Delplanque.”
“ At least, wait till it is dusk," said Voisenon. “I can-
not suffer you to adventure the danger of appearing in the
streets of Arras. I have interest enough with the governor
of the château to procure your admission. At nightfall
we will visit my unhappy client.”
With a sinking heart and faltering step, accordingly,
Valazy followed the guidance of his friend through various
obscure passages of the town, towards the gloomy retreat

of the Bastille of Arras; and after having removed by a
douceur of assignats the scruples of the turnkey, they were
ushered through damp and hollow passages dimly lighted
by an iron lamp carried by their companion, into the cell
inhabited by the citoyenne Delplanque.
“ You have not been very courteous in the assignment
of her lodgings,” said Voisenoni, in a propitiating tone of
jocularity to the man, as he selected from his rusty bunch
the key of the dungeon. “ This hole, if I mistake not, is
below the level of the ditch, and a fountain-head of
pestilence.”
" Tudieu ! What need to be dainty? The girl was
sent from Paris tarred with the sign of a black sheep.
What matters her lodging for to-night, who will sleep to-
morrow in the pit of the guillotined ? — I warrant her hard
pillow there will cost her no uneasy nights.”
Valazy would gladly have retarded his intrusion on the
captive till his approach had been announced by his friend,
dreading that his sudden appearance might startle her
depressed spirits. But the guichetier, little susceptible of
the delicacies of life, thrust him forward as
the heavy door creaked upon its 'hinges, exclaiming,
“ Cheer up, citoyenne! I have brought you friends to
make your last evening pass pleasantly." He was even
moved, by the liberality of the visitors, to deposit on the
floor, for their advantage, the flaring and fetid lamp, whose
light was regarded as an indulgence by the wretches com-
mitted to his charge.
As the turnkey departed on his routine of business after
carefully locking the door of the cell, Voisenon, ad-
vancing with fatherly kindness towards the wasted figure
which raised itself from a straw pallet in a corner of the
dungeon, to welcome his approach, was about to explain
the intrusion of his companion, when Camille urged by his
swelling emotions beyond all observation of forms, rushed
towards Euphroisine, and kneeling beside her, clasped her
to his bosom with sobs of uncontrollable distress.
“ Alas, alas !” cried she, not recognising him by the
imperfect light—“Have I yet a friend thus capable of
ympathy in my miseries? --I thought the only heart

A slight scream of delight burst from the lips of the
prisoner at the sound of his voice.
“ Camille Valazy-

resigned to the keeping of its enemies ? - Long, very

pose in my behalf;.

“ You wrong me!” faltered Camille, deeply touched by
the feeble tones of her voice, so changed from the lofty
inspiration it had breathed in addressing the tribunal of
Lebon.—“You wrong me, Euphroisine ! - On my life-
my honour— I have left no effort unattempted to trace out
the place of your imprisonment. Some evil agency has
till this day prevailed against the discovery."
“As I can truly testify!”-interposed the worthy Voi-
“ Monsieur Valazy has, on many occasions, made
me the instrument of his inquiries concerning yourself and
your unfortunate father.”
“Call him not unfortunate," said the prisoner in fal-
tering accents. “My father's probation is ended ;– how
gloriously for himself—how triumphantly for the filial
pride of his unhappy child !-- But, gracious Heaven !”
she exclaimed, clasping her hands in sudden affright, as,
through some association with her father's appearance be-
fore the judgment seat of Lebon, the recollection of Ca-
senon.

mille's danger glanced upon her mind. " What evil
chance has brought you, Monsieur Valazy, to this horrible
place ? — Your life is beset,-a price placed on your ar-
rest ;—your cousin's hatred pursues you with unabated
intensity.-Quit this spot — let me entreat you, quit this
spot. Once recognised, you leave it not again !"
“ I am aware how much I owe to your forbearance,”
replied Valazy. “ And were it not certain that my sur-
render would but add another victim to the triumph of
Lebon, without remitting by a single hour the execution
of your sentence, trust me I had not hesitated to give
myself up to justice.”
“ Think not of it !” cried Euphroisine with eagerness.
“For me, I have placed myself beyond the reach of
mercy.
The worst aggravation of my fate would be the
knowledge that another victim was about to be added to
the martyrs of the cause for which I am to perish. But
do not loiter! Let the darkness of the night cover your
flight from this plague-stricken city ---"
“No, Euphroisine, my secret is in the safe keeping of
the two trusty friends before me; my person unknown to
Lebon and his satellites. I have no fear of molestation in
quitting Arras to-morrow.”
“ To-morrow !” reiterated Mademoiselle Delplanque.
6 Alas! I have ceased to count the alternation of night
and day!—A few hours, and the mighty dawn of eternity
will brighten the gloom which is upon my soul. But, for
my sake, I pray you, leave this place! You have com-
forted me by the token of human interest vouchsafed in
this parting interview. You will still further re-assure me
by the certainty that none but the eyes of strangers will
witness any last struggle,-my ignominious death. My
soul is resolute, Camille ! - my heart anchored upon a
rock of eternal hope!— But this frail body,—this shrinking
frame of flesh,—may yet bring shame upon me by its
paltry weakness.'
“No, my dear young lady, no !” exclaimed Voisenon,
taking her hand with the tenderness of paternal interest.
“ On that score you have nothing to fear. Such fortitude
as yours will be upheld by the protection of Heaven, to be

an example and a token in the land. One step more will
conduct you in all safety through the last ordeal, to the
blessed haven of your eternal reward.”
“No!” replied Euphroisine Delplanque, in calmer and
clearer accents, “ that consolatory hope has abandoned me.
I have too long—too closely contemplated the moment of
rendering my account, to deceive myself as to the extent
of my earthly transgressions. That I am here, that the
grey hairs of my father have been polluted by the hand of
the executioner, is the work of my vain temerity ; of that
visionary loyalty which springs from the presumptuous
prompting of human vanity.— I loved the queen, without
examining the motives of my love !—I loved her as
Marie Antoinette of France, who had deigned to notice
the obscure child of the mercer Delplanque ;—not for her
virtues, not for her fortitude - her
“ You loved her with the duty of a loyal subject,” in-
terrupted Voisenon. 6. The best of human actions is
scarcely framed to meet so trying a scrutiny as you would
impose.”
- The best and worst of human actions must!” — said
Euphroisine, with devout reverence. “In the loneliness of
my captivity, I have discovered the one sole principle of
my unhappy life to have been a snare too ably spread for
an ambitious heart! Negligent of the duties of my sex
and age, I forgot mine own people and my father's house ;
and presumptuously brought down the lightnings of judg-
ment on that obscure roof, which, but for my rash expe-
riment, might have escaped the storm! I despised the
voice of my father,—of my poor old father !- I turned
aside from the warning of friend and foe. Heaven will
judge the hardness and impenitence of my
heart!”
“No!” cried Camille no!-Such generosity—such
intrepidity—such noble forgetfulness of self, must not be
thus traduced.”
“ Euphroisine !" said the good old Voisenon, motioning
Valazy to silence, " in these days of anarchy, when the
shepherds of the fold are no longer permitted to watch over
their flock, a crook should be in every aged hand. My
child !

thy parting moments by the sacrament of thy faith, I
tell thee be of good cheer, I tell thee that thy sins are
forgiven thee ! — Thy present mood of lowliness and self-
examination better becomes the departure of a Christian
spirit, than the triumphant pæans breathed by the minions
of the church round the death-bed of kings ! Like the
divine Institutor of thy faith, thou shalt die in ignominy ;
but like him, thy soul shall be lifted up in the glories of
eternity!"
At the solemn sound of the old man's voice, Mademoiselle
Delplanque knelt down at his feet; and crossing her hands
reverentially on her bosom, received his benediction with as
much inward satisfaction as if it had proceeded from the
sovereign pontiff. Camille, who had been silent from pro-
found emotion, cast his eyes on that kneeling figure, whose
white garments, set forth by the filthy obscurity of the
dungeon, imparted to its graceful outline an air of virgin
purity befitting some saintly martyr of the church. He
advanced to raise her from her knees; but on becoming
conscious of his approach, she appeared to repel his touch.
Unbidden tears rushed into her eyes, and a crimson flush
succeeded to the deadly paleness of her countenance, as she
seated herself once more beside Voisenon on her wretched
pallet.
Nay-speak not to me again, Camille Valazy,” said
Bring back my thoughts no more to this wilderness
of human sorrow! Thou hast been to me as one of the
sharpest thorns of my crown of probation !- What avails
to deny it now, that all earthly things have become un-
substantial shadows in my sight !- I loved thee, Camille!

istent in the heart of woman, defies estrangement — cold-
contempt! Under its influence, my household-

enthusiasm arose from the gloomy
certainty that domestic happiness,—the patient-humble

" My father - forgive his partial judgment first
kindled my delusive affection by an assurance of thine. He
told me I was beloved — and very easy did I find it to
believe him, and to love again. — But when I discovered
with the bitterest disappointment the infatuated passion
cherished by Camille towards another, I closed up the
wounds of my bosom as with the searing of iron. -1
turned my hopes from all prospect of womanly joy.— I tried
to fill my mind with the vain aspirings of enthusiasm.
I made the weal of my country, the person of the queen,
the objects of my idolatry. Yet even then, Camille, I
estranged not my soul from thy destiny ; but regarding
thee with a sister's partial pride, attempted to involve thee
in a career which I regarded as that of virtue and distinc-
tion.”
“ And did I withhold myself from such gracious endea-
vours ? ” —said Camille, in a low and agitated voice.
“ Did I not, while occasion offered, fulfil the duties com-
mitted to my charge ?”
“ But not at the instigation of Euphroisine! Do not
deceive thyself! Throughout the progress of events in-
volving the destiny of thy native land, thine anointed
prince — thy parent - thy friends, one single motive
has urged thy feeble and vacillating course-
Camille started indignantly.
“ For how could a course be otherwise than vacillating,
which derived its impulses from a fatal, a guilty passion ?
· While the prospect of death embittered the cruel days
of my captivity in La Force, I made a solemn vow that
should I survive to witness the re-establishment of social
order, I would expiate the delusions of my youth in a
convent, -and from the moment of that resolution, began
to look without fear or misconception upon these things. I
saw thee fixed for life at the feet of one who will reward
thy passionate devotion by turning from thee in the day of
her prosperity as from the son of the bondswoman.”
“ These are harsh words,” interrupted old Voisenon.
“ Let her speak on!” said Camille, with great earnest-

truth.".

“ Thou thinkest, Camille, that in the disorganised frame
of society, the distinctions of birth will become despised in
France. — Never ! - This weak vanity of human nature is
an innate and ineffaceable failing, common to thee, to
me, to all gradations of the living. — Even thou, Camille,
deny it not, wert tempted to reject the idea of an union
with Euphroisine, chiefly as beholding in her a mercer's
daughter! My very virtues became obliterated in thy sight
by association with my low degree; and had I been highly
born, thou wouldst have looked with admiration on actions,
which appeared suggested by intrusive temerity on the part
of a tradesman's child."
Many a conscious reminiscence started to the mind of
Camille on this accusation.
“But it was not of thy frailties I had thought to speak;
it was of my own. May thy persevering attachment meet
a happier reward than I dare anticipate ; and if, in some
future hour of domestic union with the daughter of Navelles,
thy recollections should recur to one who loved thee with-
out hope or desire of return, to one who was wont to
receive with gratitude thy merest token of regard
“ Have mercy upon me!” cried Valazy, falling at her
feet. “ I have not deserved this cruel probation.— I nourish
no such hope ---no such expectations. Emiline dwells as a
daughter beneath my mother's roof — for she is homeless
-friendless – destitute. Do not, however, suppose that
my interest in your feelings is effaced by the claims of hers.
In the engrossing spectacle of your misfortunes, I have even
forgotten to seek from you that intelligence respecting the
child so long divided from her bosom by participation in
your destiny!”
" How! - has not little Emiline been restored to her ?
Have these long weary months elapsed, and
Away — off — fly!”. cried the turnkey, suddenly

to thrust out the person of Voisenon and his companion.
“ The citoyen president is on a round of visits this un-
lucky evening, and will not care to be interrupted by
strangers."
But Valazy could not so instantly tear himself from the

clinging hands of Euphroisine. In spite of Voisenon's
exhortations, he continued to linger in agonised hope of
her explanation touching the disposal of the child.
“ He is here!” cried the turnkey, with a furious
oath, “and a pretty responsibility you have left upon my
shoulders.”
“ Ha! who are these ? ” inquired Lebon, with harsh
insolence, as he pushed open the door of the cell. “ Have
I not forbidden all chaffering and gossiping with condemned
prisoners ? — Close the door, and turn the lantern on these
night-birds, varlet !”
Citoyen commissaire !” said Voisenon, with an air
of stern self-possession, “I am here on an errand of bu-
siness with my client, in hope of persuading her to tender
such submission to the Conventional Committee as
“ Think you the committee will endure to be trifled
with by the caprices of the offspring of an insignificant
burgess of Arras ? No! since you must needs be med-
dling where your calling is not in question, stay and learn
my errand with this mincing damsel. And the fellow
bearing you company?”
Is
my
clerk and official witness, citoyen commis-
saire.”
“ Officious, rather, citoyen notaire, if in any thing re-
sembling yourself. -- Rise up, Euphroisine Delplanque !
Rise up forthwith, and listen !”
The prisoner feebly obeyed; attempting to assume the
accustomed firmness of her demeanour as she confronted
the ferocious magistrate.
“ On thy coming here, wretched girl, know that thou
wert especially intrusted to my attention by a worthy bro-
ther-labourer of mine in Paris, who bad me tender thy
paltry life, not for any value that it bore, but like
some base vessel preserved for the sake of its contents.
There is a secret in thy keeping of some moment to the de-
puty Maximilien Valazy?
Camille instinctively moved forward, resolved to declare
himself, on the slightest indication that such a measure
might prove advantageous to Mademoiselle Delplanque ;
but Voisenon grasped his hand with an admonitory warn-
ing

“ To this end have I deferred the consummation of cri.
minal justice upon thy person, till I might possess myself
of the ultimate views of so stanch a friend to the cause
of the Revolution, as my good friend the citoyen Max.-
But the courier of this night has brought thy fiat of judg-
ment, my dainty damsel. I am advised to smooth the path
of thy departure with the pleasing intelligence that the in-
formation thou hast thought proper to withhold, has been
otherwise obtained. The persons whose concealment thou
hast abetted, are discovered and denounced !”
Euphroisine could not repress a start of terror and sur.
prise.
“ And, moreover, as my crony Maximilien will visit me
to-morrow night, on his way to a place called Manoir on
the Boulognese coast on some errand connected with the
discovery, I propose to recreate him on his arrival with the
spectacle of thy contumacious head in a charger; and so
-short hrift to thee, my Cicero in petticoats, - for thou
must die at sunrise.”
“ I am prepared,” said Euphroisine with proud resig-
nation. “ I have but one prayer to make.
tlemen, these intruders who would disturb my last mo-
ments with cares and interests of poor account to a parting
soul, ,—cause them, I beseech you, to be put forth, that
I may no longer be perplexed by their molestations.”
“Is it so ?” cried Lebon, slapping his hand with vio-
lence upon the shoulder of Voisenon. 6. Then is the old
crow a bird of better omen than I imagined ! — Silly girl!
thou dost but labour to place a scourge of chastisement
in
my
hands ! Put them forth, quotha ?
thy ghostly comforters ? No, no! since thou ab-
horrest their exhortations with so absolute a detestation,
I can have no better pleasure than in charging them to

of military accoutrements was heard in the corridor)

one solitary hour to make my peace with Heaven.”
“ Thou hast done too much to mar the peace of the
dwellers upon earth. Firebrand that thou art ! - I would
gladly see thee shed tears enough to quench the flames of
thine own mischievous ignition. These prosateurs quit
not thy presence to-night.”
“ I protest against this infringement of the liberty of
the subject !” cried Valazy, bursting forward in spite of
the efforts made by Voisenon to detain him. “ Unaccused,
-undenounced, unarrested, there is no pretence for
detaining us in a manner thus arbitrary and illegal. Come
what may, I appeal against so unwarrantable a proceeding.”
“ Well mouthed, my Oroondates of the plea-shop!
The liberty of the subject !- the liberty of a scurvy
notary's scurvy clerk - Que Diable ! The Convention
might extend its audience from now till the next century,
were it compelled to bestow its attention on such appeals !
The frogs in the marsh, methinks, might know better by
this time, than to intrude upon Jupiter with their impor-
tunate petitions."
“Nevertheless, citoyen president," said Voisenon sternly,
even the Convention is accountable to the body of the
people, by whose voice it was summoned into being ;
and
- Silence ! - In the court of the commission this morn-
ing I had an abundant share of thy frothy logic. Keep
it for the spiritual consolation of thy fair hostess here ; and
beware lest in the morning I send thee to ballast her

sage over the Styx.”
With a scowl of malicious hatred, Lebon stalked from
the cell ; and was about to be followed by his faithful
guichetier, when Camille rushing on the ruffian threw
him to the earth, and cried out to Voisenon to follow him,
But the inoment he reached the passage, scantily lighted
by a lamp at the other extremity, he perceived that it was
occupied by sentries, whose crossed bayonets instantly in-
tercepted his movements.
Compelled to return, he was thrust back into the fatal
den: and the grated door was closed against the remon-

strances of Voisenon and Valazy, amid the execrations of
the infuriated turnkey, and the jeering laughter of the
soldiers.
CHAPTER VII.
L'art de subjuguer une nation est donc celui de la terrifier! - Les Romains
ont bâti des temples à la peur; la nation Française en masse lui doit un large
autel! - Essai sur les Maurs Parisiens.
TO THE CITOYENNE DUMANOIR, CI-DEVANT MARCHIONESS
DE ST. FLORENTIN.
“ Aristocrate, je te retrouve ! Emiline de Navelles,
child of my arch enemy, thou art again within my grasp !
The influence of the census hath reached even thy ob-
scurity; and though the cunning of Madelon Valazy's son
thy friend, or perchance thy paramour - by enrolling
himself a soldier of the Republic, places him for a time
beyond my reach—yet thou my Emiline Dumanoir, art
denounced ! The tribunal of Lebon gapes for thee, — the
guillotine shall render thy children orphans, — the pro-
scription, beggars ; - unless, (and mark the merciful sug-
gestion of the alternative,) unless thou evade the warrant
of arrest by becoming the wife of a servant of the state.
Within twenty-fours I shall be at thy feet. Prepare to
accept me as a husband, or to be escorted to Arras as the
prisoner of the conventional committee.
“ MAXIMILIEN VALAZY,
“ Deputy to the Conventional Assembly.”
Such was the missive placed in the hands of the unfor-
tunate Emiline, and read aloud at her suggestion by
Léonie de Mirepoix. Speechless motionless with
clasping hands and quivering lips — she listened to the
recital ; nor till her child was considerately placed by Ma-
delon within her arms, and tears relieved her overcharged
feelings, could she give utterance to the emotions struggling
in her bosom.

“ And has it come to this?” she exclaimed in frantic
irritation. “ Have all our delays — our irresolutions
our boasted security —ended in this worst of destinies !
Marry him! -escape the scaffold by screening myself in
the arms of an assassin red with the blood of my father !
Never ! Welcome shame destitution - death
before such base humiliation !”
“ Think you we have any prospect
of
your
son's return
within the fatal period ? ” cried Léonie, addressing Ma-
dame Valazy in an anxious whisper,
“Alas !” cried the afflicted Madelon, striving to conceal
the tears gushing down her aged cheeks, - how can I ven-
ture to pronounce ? — He should have been here last
night, — this morning. He is probably now on the road.
But a storm is gathering — he may be yet delayed !-
God grant that some evil may not have overtaken my
son !”
Grievous evils had in truth overtaken him !-Since his
arrival at Arras, every moment had been marked by some
painful incident:-his discovery of Euphroisine,- her
trial and condemnation,—her unsatisfactory details relative
to the lost child of Madame de St. Florentin, —her touch-
ing confession relative to herself,—the announcement of
Maximilien's arrival put forth by Lebon,—and finally his
own sentence of detention while the wolves of destruction
were loosed upon the helpless prey sheltered in his deserted
home!—What hours of torture did the despotic sentence of
the tyrant of Arras afford during that interminable night
to his patience!
Yet he dared not give vent to the galling impatience of
his mind! With Euphroisine before his eyes, —mild,
humble, resigned,—the condemned Euphroisine, whose
moments were numbered, whose feelings nerved to meet
the last agonising throe of her earthly struggle, and the
first and still more awful consciousness of her mortal
change, — how could he venture to disturb her tranquillity
by the intrusion of his selfish sorrows and anxieties ?
Amid his first irrepressible murmurs, he detected her eyes
glittering with tears fixed mournfully upon him ; and was
sensible of the indelicacy of expressing his eagerness to

break through the vexatious thraldom inflicted on him by
Lebon, since it afforded to the uncomplaining sufferer the
solace of human companionship during the last weary hours
of her earthly pilgrimage. For some time, the worthy
Voisenon attempted to sustain the courage of one of his
youthful companions, and dispel the forebodings of the
other, by kindly exhortations and Christian counsels. But
the old man was worn out by the anxious efforts of the
day. He had not a stake at issue momentous as theirs.-
His head gradually declined upon his bosom as, seated
upon the floor, he rested himself against the humid walls
of the dungeon ; — and when at length he sank into a heavy
and unnatural sleep, Camille and Euphroisine were left
alone.
The chilly twilight of spring, slanting down from the
narrow grating of the cell, soon mingled its grey uncertain
light with the smoky glare of the lamp fleckering upon the
pavement; enabling Euphroisine to discern the total ex-
haustion of frame, and abstraction of faculties, in which
Valazy stood leaning against that iron-knobbed door sepa-
rating him from the interests of the inhabited earth. In-
voluntarily, she rose from her seat, and traversing the few
steps of the long narrow chamber that divided them, stood
before him with a beseeching air.
“ Fear not to unfold your sorrow to me, Camille,” she
faltered. “ Fear not to speak of these impending evils to a
dying sister, a grateful friend. I warned you against that
overweening passion, while guilty from the opposing claims
of a living husband.— I warn you still, when I reflect
upon the harsh reflections it will compel you to undergo-
the bitter contumely to which it will expose every generous
impulse of your heart. But not for these reproofs, for
these misgivings, do I withhold my sympathy from your
sorrow !”
“Forgive my selfishness !” cried Camille, clasping her
hands tenderly within his own ; — “ forgive me, dearest
Euphroisine ! I am indeed most miserable.”
“ Alas ! the origin of your grief was revealed in the
changeful countenance with which you listened Lebon's
announcement of Maximilien Valazy's detection of your

-
66 how does my
retreat. I read in your looks that Emiline is sheltered at
Manoir !”
“ You judge aright! For my own safety, it is to me as
the cobweb on yonder rafter,—a thing of nought,— which
a breath may obliterate without notice; but for her. for
Emiline !” He shuddered ; - a spasmodic contraction
convulsed his countenance.
“ Yes! her destiny is indeed more appalling than mine !"
replied Euphroisine, with terrible composure.
« Death
certain death — will soon remit this tortured spirit into
the hands of my heavenly Father. But Emiline de St.
Florentin hath earthly trials to undergo — uncertain in their
measure and character alas ! how awfully uncertain !
Grieve, then, for her-grieve for her ; nor fear that I
should envy your pity, or blame your tenderness. Trust
me, she has my prayers as fervently as your own.”
“My generous admonitress -
my better angel ! ” said
Valazy, looking upon her with the reverence he might have
bestowed upon her disembodied spirit;
mind bow down before you ! Well had it been for ine to
have followed more implicitly your guidance ! I feel how
vainly my life has been lavished how idly its warm
affections wasted. But it is too late for either of us to
retract or amend our destinies! My baffled spirit wrestles
vainly with the irritating sense of its impotence;- of its
infirmity of purpose, its feeble, despicable inefficiency.
Oh, Euphroisine! Euphroisine ! teach me the secret of
your heavenly patience, your noble victory over selfish
passions !”
Open your heart to the Almighty as I do, and he will
fill it with his majesty beyond the participation of all
meaner feelings," said Euphroisine, raising her eyes to
heaven, and devoutly pressing her folded hands on her
bosom. “But hark !— hear you not the cries of the
early boatmen upon the river ? - heard you not a low
hollow-distant sound? Camille ! it is the morning
drum of the garrison ! — My friends, pray for me — with
me !—The hour of my deliverance hath struck, but it
is one of darkness and trembling.— My God !--my mighty
support, -- be not thou far from me !"

Already Voisenon had folded her in a paternal embrace.
The companions of Euphroisine sobbed aloud in contem-
plation of her fortitude; nor did either of them for a mo-
ment suffer their personal anxieties to interfere with their
sympathy in the fate of this heroic and most innocent
victim. But on their own account, as Mademoiselle Del-
planque from the first predicted, they had little to appre-
hend. Joseph Lebon was too well aware of the necessity
of propitiating the tribunal of Arras, to provoke its ani-
mosity by further injury practised against one of its mem.
bers so respectable in his degree as the notary Voisenon ;
and regarding Camille in the light of his clerk, had issued
orders previous to retiring to rest, that their enlargement
should take place when their female companion was led
forth to the market-place, where she was sentenced to
stand for the mockery of the rabble, two hours previous to
her execution! The blood froze in the heart of Valazy,
as he heard the measured tramp of the soldiers in the
corridor leading to the cell.
“ They come !" said old Voisenon, in a hoarse
whisper. “ Euphroisine ! the God of mercy sustain
thee! Shrink not, dear child, from this cup of bitter-
ness,
Of triumph! - interrupted his fated companion,
with a sudden assumption of energy.
“No! I am not
abandoned. — The aid of Heaven has put strength into
my soul.-Friends ! dear friends - farewell — Camille
whom I have so loved — my father's friend - my own
farewell !”
The arms of her companions were still fervently en-
twined round her, when the door of the cell was flung
open, and a file of soldiers became visible in the pas-
sage.
Citoyens, you are free !” said the surly turnkey, who
was commissioned with the president's commands.
pleased to take yourselves off without delay, that ye inter-
rupt not the special course of justice.” And in a moment,
without the slightest power of resistance, Voisenon and
Valazy were shoved forward, and marched fiercely on-
wards between the soldiers filling the corridor. The last

sound they heard, in spite of the heavy tread of their
guards, was the voice of Euphroisine, exclaiming, “No!
do not bind me — do not bind my hands. — No cords !
Indeed I am submissive. You have nothing — nothing
to fear from my resistance.”
“ Can this be borne?". -cried Camille, as Voisenon,
having passed the wicket, attempted to guide his stagger-
ing steps along the street in which the prison was situated,
towards his own residence. No, no! do not drag me
away! – Tell me not of danger.— I must - I will see
her to the last.— I have no fortitude for this struggle -
this cruel trial ! - They are murdering her ! - Let me go
– let me die — Euphroisine — Euphroisine !"
It was fortunate for Valazy that the early hour of the
morning prevented his violence from attracting the atten-
tion of persons less favourably disposed towards him than
Voisenon. Having succeeded in confining him in his
own abode during the fatal hour of the execution, the
worthy notary profited by this interval, to arrange the pre-
paratives for his immediate departure from Arras.
Every moment you remain here is fraught with peril
to you and yours, said he, attempting to rouse Camille
from the stupor of grief which succeeded his first pa-
roxysm. “ Grieve not for Euphroisine. She is at rest!
If you have friends or inmates dependent upon you, to
whom the arrival of Maximilien Valazy affords a prospect
of danger, fly to your defenceless home, and place them
in security ere it be too late !"
“She is at rest!” – mechanically repeated Valazy —
that generous heart has ceased to beat!”.
“For Euphroisine Delplanque, my dear young friend,
your exertions and your pity are alike profitless. Think
of the living."
“ True 1" - cried Valazy, starting up, impetuously.
“ The birds of prey are on the wing, and woe to the nest
exposed to their desolating swoop! I must hasten to quit
this city.”
“ Your horse has been saddled at my suggestion, and
waits you at the postern gate of my garden opening to the
ramparts. I will not detain you to say farewell. Fly,

THE SOLDIER OF LYONS,

Monsieur Valazy - fly this fatal spot. May we meet
again under happier auspices.”
Instinctively Camille obeyed the counsel of his friend;
and having passed the gates of the city without further
interruption than the necessity of exhibiting his carte
civique, a species of republican certificate in general use, he
pursued his way to St. Pol with the speed of one fleeing
from the pursuit of an enemy.
The
very aspect of the in-
habitants of Arras was to him as that of a company of
assassins; its very atmosphere appeared charged with the
sighs of the expiring Euphroisine. So young - so beauti-
ful so innocent — to be given up to slaughter; — with-
out one arm one voice uplifted in her defence !- No
wonder that he fled from the scene of such a sacrifice, with
curses on his lips, and the hope of vengeance burning in
his soul !
Cainille had been many hours on the road, before he
recovered sufficiently to determine on any future measures.
In the dizzy sickness of his mind and body, he seemed to
live over again the dreadful scene of his recent tortures;
every step appeared to spurn the bleeding body of some
mangled royalist. Pausing in the little town of St. Pol to
give an hour's respite to his panting horse, he resolved to
avoid the environs of Samer, -- to the municipal autho-
rities of which place Maximilien was probably indebted
for his information relative to the inmates of Manoir.
Having skirted the ridge of hills lying between the Paris
road and Desvres, he arrived early in the afternoon upon
that point of the côte which overlooks the fertile and
richly wooded valley of Samer.
A dark cloud was rising from the sea, as if about to
traverse like a menacing giant the vale outstretched below.
Thunder was already murmuring in the distant horizon, as
if to announce the coming enemy; and occasionally a lurid
flash broke from the obscurity extending over the scene.
Upon the verge of the hill, Camille paused for a moment
in involuntary contemplation of the solemnity of the land-
scape. The summits of the lofty sand-hills seemed to
reflect on the glaring whiteness of their fissured ridge,
the vivid flashes glancing at intervals over the warren;
в в

and as the dark mass of stormy clouds rolled onward in
slow and dreadful majesty athwart the valley, not a breath
was stirring to agitate the long streamers of coarse grass
overhanging the heathy precipice along whose verge he was
skirting the valley.
Again and again, the thunder peals reverberated from
the hills of Quéhen and Herquélingues, among the dales
opening towards the sea. The little church of Hesdin
l'Abbé appeared to shrink beneath the shelter of its an.
cient elms; and when the first heavy storm-drops fell on the
parched earth, the shepherds of Desvres were seen at a
distance betaking themselves to the insufficient shelter of
the turfen hovels dotted upon the côte, to afford a retreat
from the vicissitudes of the atmosphere. And as his
horse swerved and started from the fierce brilliancy of the
lightning, he directed the intensity of a lover's glance
towards the pointed roofs and gables of Manoir, rising
above their wooded screen, and presenting the ancient and
obsolete character of the manorial houses of Picardy,–
half farm, half fort,-commemorated in the illustrations
of Froissart. -His heart was softened by a presentiment
that he was gazing for the last time on that cherished and
familiar landscape. He cast his eyes over the wide sweep
of the undulating plain crowned far on the left by the
gloomy forests towards Neufchâtel, as if to gather the scene
into the treasury of his recollections for future reminis-
cence and future solace.
Strange !” murmured he to himself “ strange that
these scenes to which I am an alien, should have acquired
an interest in my heart, far beyond that of the haunts
of my childhood or the busy spot where my prosperity
grew as by the decree of Heaven ! - Yet wherefore should
I marvel at their influence ? - Have I not wandered amid
these woods,—have I not dwelt beneath that roof, in
companionship with her ? Have we not stood toge-
ther beneath these skies which lour upon me now with so
gloomy a presage, till our hearts, touched by their be-
nignant and balmy influence, were united for a moment in
the mutual thr of de and gratitude ? — Here, spell-
bound by the fascination of her smile-her voice - her

gracious and endearing words,—here, have I forgotten all
earthly duties — all earthly cares, -—all — all things— but
herself! It may be, that I shall become a ranger of dis-
tant countries,— homeless — exiled lonely. It may be,
that in a season of renewed prosperity, I shall dwell once
more in the region of my early fortunes ; but no change
of time or place or destiny will render the scene before me
as that of a land of strangers. Commingled in my heart
with the best hopes of my existence, it will hallow my
dreams as an ineffaceable and blessed image of the past."
While he traversed a cross road through the copses
of
the low grounds, towards Manoir, the storm, following the
uncertain attractions of a hilly country bordering the sea,
passed away to the west ; and the afternoon sun was soon
glittering on the budding trees and sparkling on the early
blossoms of the farm as if in reproach to his despondency.
Familiar with every by-path of the country, he pushed
his way across the pastures ; and having crossed the little
bridge towards the meadows encircling the garden to reach
the back entrance, was saluted by young Bénoit, who has-
tened towards him with a look of dismay.
Without hazarding a word of interrogation, he hurried
through the garden. All was deserted—all still as death.
But on ascending the flight of steps leading to the door of
the sitting room,
the first sound that struck his ear was a
convulsive sob. For a moment, he paused on the threshold
of the open door ; on a couch beside which, lay Madame de
St. Florentin,— her dress disordered, her eyes closed, and
yielding no token of life, save when the slow tears trickled
from her sealed eyelids.
“ In the name of Heaven, what has befallen her?”
exclaimed Camille to the trembling Léonie, who was
chafing her hands. - .“ Can the storm have terrified her
thus ?
Mademoiselle de Mirepoix shook her head; and Madelon,
in whose bosom little Aglaë was hiding her face from the spec-
tacle of her mother's terrible condition, pointed out to her
son the fatal letter of his kinsman which had now been some
hours in the possession of Emiline. At that moment, Madame
de St. Florentin, roused by the welcome sound of his voice,
в в 2

extended her hand towards him; and while Camille raised
it to his lips, Léonie, taking the crushed paper from the
couch, motioned an entreaty that he would read it without
delay.
Valazy started, as the first hateful sentence of the letter
met his eye.
His first impulse was to rush into the ad-
joining chamber, and secure his pistols. He was hastily
followed by Léonie.
“ When and where did she receive this insulting letter ?”
cried Camille.
* By express, and more than three hours ago. Surely,
surely, Camille, we might escape into the forest before this
miscreant's arrival ?"
“ Alas! your persons have been recognised and de-
nounced. It would be easy to the minions at his disposal
to seek out your track; and a price would doubtless be set
upon your arrest."
“ Yet how many months has our good curé contrived to
evade detection !”.
“ His life wears the protection of personal sanctity in
the
eyes of the greater number of his parishioners; and a
solitary person, inured to privation, fatigue, and danger, is
more susceptible of concealment than two feeble women en-
cumbered by a child !”
“ Yet you cannot surely wish that Emiline should ac-
cede to this loathsome proposal ?"_faltered Léonie, with
an irrepressible shudder.
“ Rather let all perish !” was his solemn reply.-
There was a deep pause, during which he covered his face
with his hands. When he again withdrew them from his
features, they were pale and rigid as marble; and in ad-
dressing Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, his measured words
appeared impelled from his lips as though by a power be-
yond his own control.
“ Mademoiselle de Mirepoix,” said he, “it is for you to
decide between us ! Judge for your cousin more dis-
passionately than mine or her own feelings will permit.
By uniting herself in marriage with a citizen under the
protection of the Republic, she may defy the addresses of
even this ruffianly conventionalist. — Let her only by civil

Mademoiselle de Mirepoix started and trembled.
“I see your repugnance-I foresee her own. The
pride of patrician blood recoils from even the semblance of
such an alliance. Alas, alas ! her preservation hangs on
this baneful prejudice !”
“ You mistake me!” cried Léonie, with emotion ;
“ it was your generous promptitude of purpose which
moved my surprise. — Repugnance ? — no, no, Camille !
you have judged wisely and well.— I was aware that there
existed but this alternative. Delicacy alone forbad me to
propose to you the sacrifice of your destinies. But Emi-
line!- will she consent? - will there even be time to
achieve a legal union ?”
Speak to her. Urge the claims of her child, the de-
votion of my whole soul. Tell her the legal form which
must pass between us is but a shadow interposing to shield
her from destruction ; that these nominal ties shall be
dissolved the moment returning prosperity shall enable her
to resume her independence. - Nay,” he continued, ga-
thering courage as the dangers of delay rose before his
eyes,
"I will overcome my reserve,
I will myself
explain the truth."
Hurrying into the saloon, Camille threw himself once
more on his knees before the sufferer. “ Emiline !” said
he, in a low intense tone, "rouse yourself! Collect your
faculties for decision in this terrible crisis. Listen to me
with indulgence, listen to your faithful, your last sur-
viving protector."
“Exert your courage, dearest cousin," added Léonie.
“ Rescue yourself, your babe, and all who love you, from
the destiny by which you are menaced.”
“ Courage ?” faltered the marchioness, gazing wildly
round her. “How may courage avail me in such a trial ?
How may I venture to dispute the will of Maximilien
Valazy ? -Let me die, and escape all.”
“Hear me !" interposed Camille, detaining her as she
attempted to rush from the room in utter distraction-

“ Hear me, Emiline ! One alternative remains for your
preservation. Unite your destiny with mine by the bond of
a civil marriage, and defy the projects of our arch-enemy.
As the wife of a republican soldier, the whole authority of

save
cried Camille, pacing the room in agony.
" What can be
done?
-“ She is incapable of deciding ! ” faltered Léonie, in the
deepest distress. “Yet, surely, in such a desperate crisis,
the friends who love her may venture to act in her behalf.
Camille, Camille ! not a moment remains for deliber-
ation !- Fetch hither Thomain, the mayor of Isques !
The old man is our friend, and will overlook all difficulties.
Even in her present afflicting condition, be generous,-
her from destruction, accord to her the protection of
your name!”
Camille cast a look of agonised irresolution on the beau-
tiful creature who sat with her eyes fixed vacantly upon
them, a ghastly smile on her lips, and her hand wan-
dering with the wildness of imbecility among the dishe-
velled tresses of her hair.
“ Can I — dare I -- in her present state, actuate her
conduct in so solemn and sacred an instance ?”
“ Fear not !- On my own head be all the responsibi-
lity,” cried Mademoiselle de Mirepoix.— “ Fetch hither
the mayor of Isques. On your return, all shall be in
readiness for the ceremony!”

No need for the liberal donation with which Valazy at-
tempted to accelerate the diligence of the mayor of Isques ;
who, as in most villages of France, was merely a respect-
able farmer of the parish, qualified to affix his own signa-
ture and decipher those of other people, on the printed
circulars of the neighbouring commune of Samer.

quitted his agricultural labours, and hastened with the ne-
cessary certificates to the farm; and an hour had not
elapsed from the decision of Mademoiselle de Mirepoix,
when the old man was standing with Valazy beside a table
in the salon of Manoir, upon which Léonie had deposited
writing materials for their use. There was no person yet
present but Madelon ; whose faculties had been almost pa-
ralysed by the arrival of Maximilien's letter; and who,
under the stupifying influence of the marvellous events
passing around her, appeared to act with the mechanical
impulses of an automaton. She advanced, however, to-
wards her son, and placed her cold hand in his with a
gesture of affectionate approval, — incapable of uttering
a syllable !
In a few minutes, the door of the inner apartment was
thrown open by the wife of Tonton, who had assumed her
costume-de-fête ; and Mademoiselle de Mirepoix entered,
leading in the marchioness, - whose countenance appeared
to Camille in a great measure divested of the ghastly hue
it had worn at his departure. Her dress had been care-
fully arranged by the aid of the trembling Léonie ; but
though her demeanour was grave and mournful even to a
degree of appalling solemnity, it was evident that the ar-
guments and persuasions of her cousin had succeeded in
restoring her to perfect consciousness of her situation, and
obtaining her acquiescence in the projects of Valazy. For
a moment, she paused abruptly on her entrance, as if to sur.
vey the preparations, and explain to herself the presence
of Thomain, as well as of Tonton and his wife, who were
to act as witnesses to the civil contract. Then, dropping
the arm of her conductress, she advanced deliberately, and
with a firm step, towards Camille.— There was a profound
silence in the room when she deliberately placed her hand
in his !
With what a thrill of mingled emotions did he receive
the pledge !-- Yet he dared not press it within his own.
He dared not gaze steadfastly on the lovely figure of
Emiline as she placed herself by his side !--He was ap-
prehensive that the most trifling assiduity on his part
might again disorder her feelings; and strove to make the

customary responses to the demands of the mayor, and
fulfil the necessary forms of the ceremony, with an air of
business-like indifference, such as might tend to re-assure
her misgivings. He felt how fearfully misplaced would be
the slightest inference of tenderness at such a moment !
Emiline, to the surprise of every person present, exe-
cuted the requisite formalities of the contract with the
grave earnestness of a mind nerved to desperation. Having
thrown one shuddering glance round the chamber, as if in
expectation that some supernatural agency would interfere
in arraignment of such a profanation, she signed her name
with a steady hand, Emiline—veuve St. Florentin—née Na-
velles, beneath that of Camille Valazy-of her husband ;
who immediately took the pen from her unconscious grasp
without the utterance of a single word — without a single
demonstration of satisfaction in the accomplishment of the
event!
Léonie, alone retaining the least presence of mind or
power of sympathising in the interest of the moment,
tendered her hand affectionately to Valazy, as if in consi-
deration of his feelings, and in the ordinary form of congra-
tulation ; but while he was whispering an entreaty to Made-
moiselle de Mirepoix to remove her cousin to the silence
and solitude of her own chamber, little Aglaë, followed by
her attendant, rushed into the room, proclaiming that a
body of armed horsemen were galloping down the avenue.
They are come !—The miscreant is at hand !” cried
Camille, seizing his arms, and rushing into the court-yard,
followed by Thomain and Bénoit, and attempting to dis-
cover among the men who had dismounted at the gate the
abhorred person of his kinsman.
Nationals,” muttered Thomain, in a tone of respect
as the soldiers approached — “but not of this district.'
“ What is your business, camarades ?” said Camille,
somewhat re-assured by the absence of his cousin.
“ Softly !” replied (the sergeant of the troop, who now
advanced to the head of the party.
- We must know you
better before we admit that fraternisation. —Your name

“ Valazy."

“ All's right, then! advance !” cried he, beckoning
forward his men. “ We arrest you, citoyen, on the spe-
cial warrant of the Convention, as convicted of conspiracy
against the French Republic. Be pleased to follow us to
Samer without delay.”
“I have this moment returned from Arras,” said
Camille, inadvertently ; "and claim the respite of an hour
for repose, and the arrangement of my affairs.”
“ From Arras ? — right again ! We were advised to
look for our prisoner in the goodly fellowship of Lebon.
An hour? - too long by three tedious quarters! Ten
minutes will suffice to gather a few assignats into your
purse - and then en route !
If your own horse is
blown, take that of one of my troopers, who will remain
here in guard of this old crenelated rat-hole.”
Stay !” said Thomain, interposing with an air of
authority, considerably enhanced by his accidental investi-
ture in his official habit.
“ Be it known to you, cit
cavaliers, that no legal arrest can take place here unless
the warrant be countersigned by the municipal officer of
this district. Now as I have the honour to preside over
the mairie of Isques
“ You may recreate your official eyes, if it suit their
leisure, with a perusal of our warrant; which, being an
especial document from the hand of Robespierre, would
acquire little validity from such an endorsement as that of
the mayor of ten measures of Calaisian pasture-land,
shared by the proprietors of thrice
hovels.”
“ It is indeed in form !” said Thomain, after de-
liberately affixing his spectacles to his nose, and examining
the credentials of the sergeant. " But what do I see !.
It bears the name of Maximilien - not of Camille Valazy!
What error is here?”
“ It is doubtless designed for the person
of
my
kinsman,
whom
every hour we expect here from Paris.”
“ That is a plea of evasion which has been tolerably
hackneyed of late, and may hardly serve your turn,” said
the man, indignant from a suspicion that some subterfuge
was about to be practised on himn. “ We are commissioned

by the Hôtel de Ville of Montreuil sur Mer to arrest the
person of one Valazy ; — who, having escaped detection by
passing surreptitiously through that town on his road from
Paris to Arras, is known to have sheltered himself in a
farm called Manoir, on the confines of the Condette and
Samer districts. We find you here, citoyen, avowing your
name and recent arrival from Arras. Without further
parley, we arrest you as our prisoner.”
At your peril!” cried Camille, satisfied that by some
unaccountable vicissitude, probably through the envious
hatred of Robespierre, which had already conveyed Dan-
ton and others of his associates to the guillotine, Maxi-
milien had been denounced to the Convention.
rThis
warrant refers to another individual; and I warn you
against any violation of the person of a republican
citizen."
As he spoke, he tendered his carte civique for their
inspection. “Is your identity recognisable at the mairie
of Samer?” said the man, doggedly,
66 and will
you consent
to accompany us thither"
“Willingly. But in abandoning your post here, re-
member you forfeit all chance of the arrest of your legi-
timate prisoner."
“Your friend speaks fairly, Mr. Mayor,” cried the ser-
geant to old Thomain, who had hobbled across the court-
yard to satisfy the apprehensions of his neighbour, Madame
Valazy. “But he should know that we wild-geese usually
fly en enfilade. I have a detachment posted yonder in the
rear of the house, and another at the head of the avenue,
whom I will leave in occupation during my absence. It
would be hard if we should miss fire in both directions;"
and taking his briquet from his pocket, he proceeded to
light his cigar, while Thomain expostulated apart with
Camille.
“ Words were wasted upon men as brave but as im-
penetrable as their own sabres. Best accompany them
without dispute to Samer, where you can be officially
identified and released," said the prudent old man.
“And leave my family exposed to the tumult and terror
of Maximilien Valazy's arrival ?”

“ He must be a gaillard of some importance, who has
earned a scrape of Robespierre's own quill, and the
abhorrence of his own near relatives !” exclaimed the
mayor. “ But fear not, my young friend ! -- I will un-
dertake the defence of the garrison till your return.”
Weary and wayworn, irritated by every new contrariety,
and fevered by the struggle of contending passions, Camille,
on this re-assurance, hastened his departure and that of his
most unwelcome guests. Instead of being preceded by
the national dragoons into the little town of Samer, he
himself galloped at the head of the cortège into the square
of the market-place.
Here, however, equally to his surprise and vexation, he
encountered further delay, and fresh annoyances. Night
was coming on. The mighty magistracy of the town of
Samer had retired from its cares of state to the otium cum
dignitate of sirop de groseille and the Boston table; and the
only reply vouchsafed to the eager Valazy by the porter of
the clerk of the secretary of the adjoint of the mayor of
the commune, was an order of detention for the night in
the crowded prison of the town, till the mystery of Maxi-
milien's arrest should be cleared up by magisterial cross-
examination ! — It was in vain to remonstrate - to storm
There were the military minions of the law,
to enforce the capricious mandates of official despotism;
and there was the old convent of St. Marie de Boulogne,
which still uplifts its dingy walls beside the parish church of
Samer, but which, during the reign of terror, revolutionary
sacrilege converted into a receptacle for suspected persons.
In spite of his eager resistance, he was deposited in its
cheerless thraldom; and thus, for the second time, by an
accidental chain of mischances, did Camille Valazy become
a prisoner, without the incurrence of any legal charge, and
at a moment imparting tenfold importance to his loss of
freedom.
With the fiercest impatience, and the bitterest re-
pentance of his credulity in following the counsels' of
Thomain, he paced the miserable chamber apportioned
as his place of rest. The food which was forced into his
presence as a plea for sub-official extortion was removed
to rage.

untasted, while he urged his entreaties to the surly turnkey,
(a being strictly fulfilling Mercier's definition of un verrou
animal) — that at the earliest possible hour of the morn-
ing such news from Manoir as might have reached the
town, should be imparted to him without delay.
“Out on thy grumbling !" cried the brute, pointing to
the wretched bed destined for his accommodation. “What
wouldst have? - Thou hast supped like an emperor, and
'twill be thy own fault if thy sleep match not with thy
meal. As to thy Manoir — peste ! e’en wait the worship-
ful pleasure of thy betters and mine.” And the coarse and
insolent janitor jarred the door in his face, and left him
for the night to the safe keeping of bolt and staple, and
the dreariness of solitude.
In spite of his struggling emotions, of apprehensions
only the more dreadful from their vagueness, the weari-
ness of exhausted nature prevailed. Like a wretch bowed
down by the torments of impalement, he slept ! Fling-
ing himself on the bed, in the vestments of which for two
days and nights he had not been disencumbered, his
harassed spirit sank into such unquiet and feverish slum.
bers, as impart little refreshment to the suffering frame. —
A thousand horrible visions floated in his brain, connected
with the scenes in which he had recently been an actor.
The clay-cold face of Euphroisine appeared to bend over
his own, and freeze his very heart's blood with ghastly
endearments, till he was moved to fly from her loathsome
pursuit. But his steps failed him! - Wherever he
turned, the ground was slippery with blood, and his flight
arrested by a countless multitude of revolutionary victims,
meeting him and surrounding him on every side.
Headless and gory figures of the Lyonese victims,
Vendéens,- Bordelais, Parisians, -appeared to rise and
greet him in horrible succession.
Another and more dreadful picture shaped itself before
his eyes. He seemed to stand arrayed in the national uni.
form, in that field of blood in the neighbourhood of Nantes
where five hundred children, the orphans of murdered
royalists, were condemned by Carrier to be shot !-At
every discharge, troops of fairy figures were levelled with

the earth ; and the mutilated infants, turning their im-
ploring hands and dying faces towards him, exhibited the
lovely countenances of little Aglaë and her lost sister !
Again, he fancied himself standing amid the tufts of
gorse upon the hills above Rosamel ; - again he looked
down, in the delusion of sleep, upon the valley of the
storm ; again the peaked roofs of Manoir appeared to rise
above the lofty groves in which they were embedded. And
suddenly, a stream of vivid lightning descended on the
house ; while bursting flames, like those of the Château
de Florincthun, gushed upwards from the contact. He
laboured to fly to the assistance of its beloved inmates ; but
his feet were rooted to the spot! He heard their voices
calling on his name ;—he beheld them struggling with
the inroads of the fiery element, — till he cried aloud
in his agony, and broke the spell of his agonising slum-
bers !
The morning sun was bright upon him, and a cla-
mour in the market-place below the walls of the convent,
assured him that the citizens were already astir. Yet
no one came to appease his anxiety and tranquillise the
stirring emotions of his heart. At length it occurred to
him to pile together the few wretched fragments of furni-
ture in the room, and reach the upper panes of a grated
window, the remainder of which had been walled up, to
restrict the curiosity of the prisoners. He had the sa-
tisfaction of obtaining, through this narrow and perplex-
ing aperture, a partial view of the square in which, im-
mediately opposite to the convent, stood the paltry Hôtel
de Ville of Samer. Not a house was yet open for the
day
not an inhabitant stirring : but a glance sufficed
to satisfy him that the tumult he had heard arose from
the arrival of the detachment of dragoons from Manoir.
Clustered round the steps leading to the hotel were se-
veral soldiers, whom he recognised as having formed
part of his own escort, in company with others wear-
ing a similar uniform, whose horses were tied to the iron
props round the fountain in the centre of the square
serving to support the market booths; and who, with much
mirth and prodigious demonstration and gesture, were

busied in relating some wonderful narrative for the amuse-
ment of their comrades. The sergeant who had so strongly
insisted on his arrest, was standing, pipe in mouth, waiting
the opening of the official tribunal; with the morning sun
glittering brightly on the ornaments of his schakos, and
shining through the light fumes which circled in misty
volumes round his head. Occasionally, in the course of
their recital, the soldiers pointed to some dark object-
something wrapt in a military cloak, which lay upon the
upper step ; and once when, on turning towards this mys-
terious thing, the veteran perceived a straggling dog or
two attracted towards it, and inquisitively snuffing to dis-
cover its contents, he stamped with the heel of his boot so
angrily on the pavement, that the ringing of his brass ac-
coutrements reached even the ears of Valazy.
It was a moment of terrible suspense; more especially
when the doors of the Hôtel de Ville being leisurely un-
barred by the concierge, the soldiers lifted the heavy object
upon their shoulders and bore it into the hall. It was
evidently a human body—the stiffened relic of some victim
from Manoir !
Still still — no sound was audible in the vast corridor of
the prison; and as Camille strained his ears to discover
some faint token of approaching footsteps, he could detect
nothing but the trickling of the fountain in the market-
place, and the occasional jingling of the snaffle chains of
the chargers, as they tossed their heads in impatience of
the prolonged absence of their masters.
After a pause of about twenty minutes, the dragoons
rushed impetuously forth from the doors of the Hôtel de
Ville, laughing and shouting in tumultuous exultation,-
mounted their horses, and galloped from the square ; and
Camille, with an involuntary shudder, observed that one
of the men flung over the crupper of his saddle, with an
air of disgust, the cloak which had been disencumbered in
the tribunal within, of its mysterious burden.
Still no person came near him; and he felt as if some
artery must burst, in his efforts to attract by shouts the
attendance of his tardy gaoler. At one moment, he re-
solved to descend from his tantalising post, in order to re-

examine the bolts of his apartment; but having soon
remounted to his giddy eminence and resumed his recon-
noissance, he was struck by the sight of two figures issuing
from the official gateway, of which he had not happened to
observe the entrance.
His joy burst into benedictions, as he recognised the fa-
miliar figures of Benoit and the mayor of Isques !

To the impatience of the prisoner, an age appeared to
intervene between his first glance of recognition as his
friends crossed the market place towards the convent, and
his detection of the heavy tramp of footsteps ascending the
stair leading to his chamber. As the key grated harshly
in its rusty lock, Camille fancied he could discern in the
voice of Thomain, who was conversing with the familiarity
of old acquaintance with his gaoler, a species of self-
contented garrulity, a certain chuckle of triumph, which
could not be the harbinger of evil. In an instant, the
door was flung open ; and the rustic magistrate of Isques
advanced towards him with outstretched arms, while Benoit
danced and capered round his master.

“ The citoyen your kinsman is no more !” interrupted
Thomain, who felt that the details of the narrative belonged
more particularly to himself.
“ But your lady ? ” cried Camille, addressing himself to
Benoit, and regardless of the presence of the guichetier.
“ The citoyenne, your worthy mother, is in excellent
health," again interrupted the Mayor of Isques. “Though
the ladies at Manoir suffered considerably from the affright
of having a company of strange dragoons quartered upon
them as guests, yet my presence, and their confidence in
my power and will to defend them through all emer-
gencies –
“ For the love of Heaven, be brief !” exclaimed Camille.
“Remember, my dear good Thomain, I am ignorant of all
that has proceeded during my confinement."
“ In the first place, then," said Thomain, seating him-
self angular-wise upon the solitary wooden chair afforded
by the cell — “you had no sooner departed, than all the
female inhabitants of Manoir set upon me with the most
violent vociferation and gesticulation, to upbraid me with

impatience at his prolixity.

the report of fire-arms in the avenue. Helter-skelter
went the dragoons posted on the bridge ; and off I set with
your honour's pistols in one hand, and my stable lantern in
another. But before I could reach the upper gate of the
avenue, several straggling shots were fired; and when I
came up with the Nationals, I saw a calêche standing on
the turn from the road to the avenue, surrounded by
troopers. In a minute, my lantern was snatched from my
hand, and held down to the face of a man who had been
dragged from the carriage, and was lying on the bank,
dead I thought, when the light gleamed over his livid
visage. But no ! sacrématin !- I had the happiness
10 hear him give several groans of agony. For, as you
surely guess, sir, the wounded man was no other than the
ruffianly murderer of my noble master.”
“ Maximilien Valazy, then, is no more ? ”
“ Dead as Marlbrook ! — The soldiers fell a disputing
for the honour of who had aimed the fatal blow. For it
was a sabre-cut which reached the villain ; and as a price

not to slay the caitiff?
“ But the caitiff," proceeded Thomain, taking up the
narrative, “refused to obey the warrant, resisted,
drew arms in his own defence; and so was dragged
from the carriage, and sacrificed to his obstinacy. His
servants, after backing him in the onset, fled under cover
of the darkness, and were not judged by the national troops
worthy of pursuit in a strange country.'
5. And so the soldiers bivouacked under the great elm for
the night, after crowning their labours with a hearty carouse;
and were off hither to Samer before daylight, on their
way back to their garrison. I hoped they would leave the
carcase of the murderer behind them ; that, as he had
dealt with my gracious master the duke, so might I
deal with himself. But the soldiers had their reward to
win of the municipality -
“ And I my procès verbal to deliver !” observed Tho-
main, with official solemnity. “ Whereupon the town

from Paris, and discovered especial instructions that any
proceedings begun or attempted by the traitor Maximilien
Valazy against any person or persons bearing his own
name, within the liberties of their commune, should be
forth with abandoned and discharged, my worshipful
colleague yonder conceiving that this favourable pro-
visory clause must apply to the inhabitants of Manoir, be-
gan to repent that, in his love of leisure last night, he had
caused you to be so unhandsomely detained ; and so,
issued an order for your enlargement.”
“ Am I then free?" - cried Camille.
“ As the wind, my dear master,” cried Bénoit, rubbing
his hands. “ The brown mare waits for you below.”
“ Softly!” said the concierge — vexed to be so quickly
defrauded of a promising inmate ; “there are dues to be
paid, besides an extra supper, which might have served"
“There !”- cried Camille, impatiently Ainging him
his purse as he bounded down the filthy stone stairs of the
convent; and in a moment, he was perilling his own neck
and that of his favourite mare, by proceeding at full speed
down the broken and slippery pavé of the suburbs;
leaving Thomain and Benoit to follow at leisure, after the
refreshment of a bottle of ordinaire shared between them
at the renowned hotel of the Brochet-d'or.
As Valazy approached the avenue of Manoir, and beheld
its gables glittering under the morning sun, involuntarily he
relaxed his speed. The carriage which had conveyed the
assassin of Florincthun on his malicious errand still lay
overturned against the dike fencing the avenue. The loose
dust bore the impression of a confusion of trampling horse.
men ; and further on, upon the short grass of the em-
bankment, was a large dark spot matting the verdure,
which Valazy with a shudder of abhorrence justly attri-
buted to the mortal effusion of his detested kinsman !
An involuntary association recalled to recollection his old
grey-headed uncle of Grand Moulin, with a feeling of
satisfaction that he should have been spared the sorrow of
witnessing such a termination to the career of such a
son !

curdled his blood, as he proceeded along the avenue with as
much deliberation as if no especial interest hung on the
moment of his arrival. He was about to behold her again,
to look again on Emiline, — to find her relieved by the
death of her only enemy from all further terrors for her
destiny, to behold in her the arbiter of his future fate
- his wife ! — Every pulse throbbed with emotion — but
of a character any thing but pleasurable.
“ I must not, I cannot remain here !” he involuntarily
exclaimed, as he obtained a more distinct view of the win-
dows on approaching the house.
“I will secure every
arrangement for their departure to England, and then,
away to the army! — My friend, young Buonaparte, has
obtained the command of the artillery in the south, I
will join him as a volunteer. Let who will and what will
influence the helm of state, the duty of every Frenchman

both, our sakes I must fly, - I must leave her. That
which has chanced, places an irremovable bar between us
for evermore.”
At the door of Manoir, he was met by his mother, who
bestowed an unsought blessing on his head with a degree
of mournful solemnity that accorded ill with the sympathy
he anticipated on his triumphant return; and instead of
summoning the attendance of Tonton, he tied his horse to
the railing of the little court, and accompanied her silently
into the saloon.
The first person he remarked was little Aglaë, arranging
flowers in an osier basket, who uttered a cry of delight on
perceiving her favourite Camille; when lifting the child
from the floor, he bestowed a thousand caresses upon her,
in return for this involuntary token of affection. But on
turning towards the sofa, the habitual seat of the marchio-
ness, he saw that Mademoiselle de Mirepoix who occupied
her place, made no effort to approach or address him.
“ Pardon me, mademoiselle !” said he, at length, “I
was unprepared to find your demeanour thus changed
towards me
I was unprepared to find
you
thus abruptly
resentful of my intrusion.”

“ Camille !” cried Léonie, bursting into tears, “is this
accusation generous or just ?”
“ The unfortunate occurrence of yesterday
“ Has wrought no change in my sentiments towards
you, unless by converting the regard of an obliged friend
into the affection of a kinswoman !” said Mademoiselle de
Mirepoix, frankly tendering him her hand. “I-I who
ve witnessed your silent struggles,— your generous self-
renouncement, -your more than chivalrous devotion,
can best appreciate the nobleness of your conduct; and
could
my influence prevail over the obstinate prejudices of
my cousin, the affection which has hazarded peril and
privation for her sake would be rewarded on her part
with the grateful affection of a wife. -But alas !
At that instant the marchioness, having recognised from
her window the horse usually ridden by Camille, burst into
the room ; her looks haggard, — her dress hanging in wild
confusion, - her hair unbound. Léonie and Camille
were speechless from consternåtion, as she walked delibe-
rately towards them, and fixed full upon Valazy the glance
of her deep blue eyes, in which every human sentiment of
loathing and contempt appeared concentrated.
“ And the plotter is come again!” — whispered she, in
an accent of distraction. 'Thou, who hast practised
against my peace with months and years of patient
malignity, watched me from day to day, to forward the
accomplishment of thy treacherous ends, — prithee note
thy triumph and rejoice !-- I was bereft of every thing,–
all earthly possessions had been wrested from me. For-
tune, fame, — distinction, - my filial pride,
piness of a wife, - the solace of a mother's love. - But I
had still one treasure left. — Yes! I had still one jewel in
my casket, — and of that thou hast robbed me
“ Do not listen to her,” interposed Léonie, colouring
deeply. “ Leave the room, Valazy, — she raves !”
“I do not ! - he shall listen!”. cried Emiline,
throwing back her hair from her face. “I am rational
as yourself ; - nay, crafty as the son of Madelon Va.

Of what have I robbed you, Emiline ?” inquired

Camille in a subdued voice, anxious to soothe a frenzy
which he believed to be a relapse of her former infirmity.
“ Of my fidelity to the dead !” said the marchioness,
in the same appalling whisper as before. “ Had I died
yesterday, I had gone down to my grave the devoted widow
of St. Florentin ! What am I now? the degraded
wife of the lowest and most despised of human beings!”
66 When will our calamities end?” cried Camille.
“ Léonie -- Léonie – speak to her!-- expostulate with
this infatuation.
Nay! wherefore shouldst thou complain ? " said the
marchioness. Hast thou not compassed thine ends ?
Have not all thy cold — deliberate artful plots suc-
ceeded? - Vassal of my father's house! — has not the
daughter of Navelles become the abject wife of a Va-
lazy ? "
With the energy of desperation, Camille now advanced
towards the marchioness; and taking her firmly by the
arm, conducted her to the sofa, and seated her by the side
of the agitated Mademoiselle de Mirepoix.
“ Emiline !” said he, “notwithstanding all this intem-
perance, you are capable of understanding my words.
I command you to listen to me before we part for ever."
Startled by his resolute demeanour, the frantic sufferer
sat as still as death,
“ I little thought,” he resumed, in a less determined
tone, « that the time would come when I should be com-
pelled in self-defence, - in justification of my own
motives, to recapitulate my benefits to you and yours;
to set forth the devotion of my whole life to your
service, to remind you of all I have suffered, all I have
renounced for your sake. In our infancy, Emiline, we
were playmates. — The same bosom nursed us into life,–
the same scenes witnessed our progress towards maturity.
I loved you then with a tenderness which, however exclu-
sive, was free from presumption ; for I knew not yet by
what an impassable barrier the child Emiline was divided
from the adoration of the child Camille ! - You grew into
womanhood, - and then it was I became conscious of the
humiliations of my birth !-- You were wedded to an

honourable and adoring husband ; but little did you dream
how long, how fervently, the growth of my passion had
forestalled his own!”
He paused for breath ; and the colour of Léonie de
Mirepoix went and came as she observed with how power-
ful a struggle of emotions he was contending.
" You became a mother ! You presided over the
household happiness of another. Yet still, at an humble
distance, I loved you, noted the developement of your
loveliness,
your excellence.
- Dangers lurked around
your prosperity, I was the first to warn and to defend
you.
- A terrible destiny loured over the aristocracy of
France; and the ignoble foster-brother of the Marchio-
ness de St. Florentin thenceforward renounced all care for
his personal prosperity, - all interest in the duties of his
station, that he might devote himself to her protection
in the hour of peril. — Nay, more, - with a dissimulation
hateful to his feelings, he humiliated himself to dwell in
the enemy's camp, that he might acquire the power to
serve her with a surer influence. In defiance of the
claims of official duty, I perilled my life in attempting the
preservation of him who was dear to Emiline. — I ven-
tured it again and again, — and oh! with what fond
enthusiasm,
rescue herself from destruction. I
abandoned the cause of my native land, the duties of
manhood.—To be her defender and keeper in a land of
strangers, I closed my ears against the cry of my
struggling fellow-countrymen, - and in that only do I
repent my error. My soul has long rebelled against this
treachery to its better impulses. But it is not yet too
late! — A baptism of blood shall still wash out the
stain."
For a moment he drew up his fine figure to its utmost
height, and a consolatory hope appeared to expand within
his bosom. But very quickly did his voice resume its
former tone of subdued and pathetic tenderness; and his
eyes their powerful earnestness, as leaning against the
table near which she was seated, he fixed their impas-
sioned gaze on Emiline.
During the tedious hours of sickness I watched over

you with the self-denying and patient love of a brother:-
nor from my cradle till this hour have I felt - breathed
– thought — acted — save with reference to the object
of my infatuated passion. — And finally — and may the
God who hears me attest the sincerity of my honest
dealing, - finally, Emiline! - - when an accursed marriage
appeared to threaten you with ties abhorrent to your heart,
1 presumed, as the only means of evasion, to offer
you the security of a nominal union with myself ;
knowing and feeling with the bitterest and most degrading
consciousness, that my hand would be accepted with
secret sentiments of contempt and disgust. — Yet this
sacrifice of my pride, - great as it was to a generous
spirit, - you have construed into an act of the basest
selfishness!”
The marchioness, who during the progress of Valazy's
expostulations had gradually assumed greater composure
of demeanour, now hid her face on the shoulder of Léonie
de Mirepoix, and sobbed aloud. But without noticing
this change in the character of her emotions, he made
a desperate effort over his feelings, and resumed his
appeal.
- madam — I am about to bid you fare.
- a long a last farewell, my own adored Emiline!
Even had your interpretation been juster and kinder, I
had judged it necessary to tear myself from your com-
panionship under the circumstances which have enwoven
themselves around us. But now, — - after your cruel
accusations, there exists not that spot of earth on which
we could breathe together in peace !- It is for me there-
fore to quit your presence ; and I go where my exertions
may wipe out the blot of my plebeian descent, and
where the grave assumes its most alluring aspect.”
“ Camille, Camille ! ” cried Léonie, with streaming
eyes, “this is mere petulance ! — You have no right to
agitate us thus."
But Valazy was unconscious of her interruption; his
gaze, his heart, his whole soul were centred upon Emiline.
“I could have wished,” said he, still pointedly address-
ing her, “ I could have wished that your parting words

had been gentler,
your parting looks less coldly bent
upon me! - But it matters not ! the whole truth is now
revealed to me.— I feel that no excess of personal sacrifice,
no intensity of devotedness, can ever win me the recom-
pense of your regard. Now, at the eleventh hour, I
discover that my life has been lavished in vain ! — But it
matters not. — My fruitless tenderness shall importune you
no more !”
No! do not leave Manoir !”— exclaimed Madame de
St. Florentin. “Remember the claims of your mother !”
“ Forget not those her fidelity has wrought upon your
own affection, or her old age will indeed be desolate ! - It
were ungrateful to visit upon her blameless existence the
presumption of her son. But I loiter !
Léonie, my
indulgent friend, all things are prepared to conduct you
in safety with your cousin to the protection of your
brother.
Heaven's blessings be upon you both! Emiline ! -
may you find truer and worthier friends when I shall be at
rest!”
He knelt down before her, kissed the hem of her
garments, - took her clasped and unresisting hands be-
tween his own ; then, rising in speechless emotion,
quitted the chamber. His mother, ignorant of all that had
been passing, and supposing him on the point of quitting
home for some short absence, received as he passed his part-
ing embraces without surprise ; and followed him to the gate
to see him mount his horse, with little Aglaë who had run
to inquire the cause of his going away.
Camille mo-
tioned to her to lift the child into his arms for a farewell
kiss.
Unable to utter one syllable in reply to the little girl's affec-
tionate interrogations, he strained her to his heart, - bent
over her for a moment in bitter and choking emotion,
then leaping into his saddle, galloped along the avenue,
without turning one regretful look towards the mansion
which he had quitted
never to return !

For days -- for weeks - the broken-hearted Emiline,
relying on the fervency of a passion so long and faithfully
demonstrated, refused all faith in the predictions of Made-

ever.
moiselle de Mirepoix that they should see him no more. It
soon appeared that on quitting them, Camille sought out
the retreat of the curé of Isques ; and placing in his hands
the ample funds provided for their emigration, obtained his
promise to accompany them to England, nor quit them till
they obtained the guardianship of the Chevalier de Mire-
poix or the young Duc de Navelles. He suggested that
Bénoit should accompany his lady; and recommended to
Blaisel the interests of the whole party, in terms which left
no doubt on the mind of the curé as to his intentions of
permanent alienation.
Still, nothing could prevail on Madame de St. Florentin
to believe that the noble heart of Valazy was lost to her for
It was so new to Emiline to find herself an object
of less than exclusive devotion, - to find her steps un-
noted by the eye of adoration, — her words untasted by
the partial ear of a lover, that her spirit drooped into
utter despondency. – While Camille remained by her side,
she had never been fully conscious of the desolateness of
her social position ; — while his tender solicitudes guarded
her round with the observance and deference due to some
supernatural being, she had scarcely recognised herself as
the survivor of all her kindred saving an expatriated and
infirm brother,
as a person supposed to be numbered
with the dead, - as the helpless and destitute mother of a
still more helpless child. - - Even Madelon appeared to love
her less, as the froward cause of banishment to her only
son ; — while Léonie did not attempt to disguise her disap-
proval of the graceless construction which Emiline had
been tempted to affix on the conduct and motives of one
whom she so truly loved and honoured as Camille Valazy.
Her only softening impulse towards her obdurate cousin arose
from secret conviction that the conduct of the marchioness
arose less from mistrust and indignation, than from the
self-reproaches of her own heart for its unacknowledged
predilection in favour of her ignoble husband.
“ She loves him !” said Léonie, in her solitary musings
among the pastures of the Lianne. “ In spite of her
pride, -of her prejudices, of herself, she loves him.
Every precept in which she has been nurtured, every

395
impulse of her nature, rebels against such an avowal ; and
Emiline has not energy to cast off the paltry restrictions of
her birth, and rise superior to the mean suggestions of
vanity. Yet had he deigned to abide with patience the
turning of the tide, poor Camille might not long have
found cause to murmur against her ingratitude.”
She was shortly confirmed in these opinions by a strange
and sudden resolution declared by the marchioness.—“Let
us hasten to England, Léonie !” said she. I am wretched
here. - The sight of these familiar objects eats into my
heart. Every hope is lost of the recovery
of
my precious
child; and it was his wish, —his suggestion that we
should quit the country. I am bound to fulfil his injunc-
tions.”
“ Alas !” whispered Léonie to Madame Valazy, while
hurrying their preparations for departure, “could our dear
Camille but hear her thus submissively acknowledge his
authority, surely he would not despair of softening the
claim into the tenderness of a wife !”
“ Camille is for ever lost to her and me !” was the con-
clusive reply of his afflicted mother. And her augury was
only too strictly fulfilled.

YEARS passed away.
The rainbow foretold by the pro-
phetic eye of the curé of Isques now irradiated the horizon
of France. A new era had dawned upon her fortunes !
The French republic might be said to have attained its
utmost prosperity when, at the commencement of July, on
the first year of the new century, the First Consul arrived
at the palace of the Tuileries, in all the triumphant glory
of the recent victory of Marengo! This crowning event
of the celebrated campaign of the thirty days had not

only completed the conquest of Lombardy and Piedmont,
but, like a new Actium, afforded a pretext for closing the
temple of Janus, and for the pretensions of a new Augustus.
Buonaparte is said to have achieved upon the field of
Marengo the conquest of France as well as that of Italy.
The citizens of Paris, the most susceptible of all cities
to the intoxications of military triumph,
were excited
by the intelligence of this unexpected and signal success
of the army of Italy, into a degree of personal affection for
their victorious consul such as he had never yet experi-
enced.
Suspected by many of favouring the return of
the exiled family of the Bourbons, with whom he was
known to have entered into a species of negotiation through
the medium of the fascinating Duchesse de Guiche; by
others, and with far more probability, accused of aiming
at the re-establishment of the monarchy in his own person,
-Buonaparte was regarded with a degree of mistrust which
nothing but the boldness of his measures, and the dazzling
brilliancy of his military career, could have enabled him to
confront. For a time, - MARENGO!” was an answer to
every murmur and every accusation.
Having quitted Milan ten days after a victory in which
the only drawback was the loss of the young and distin-
guished Désaix, the progress of the Chief Consul from the
Alps to the Tuileries resembled an ovation rather than an
ordinary journey. Followed by the officers of his staff,
and having triumphed over the still existing difficulties and
dangers of Mont Cénis, his haste was arrested at Lyons by
a deputation of the chief inhabitants of the city, (at the
head of which was a grey-haired man named Dacquin, the
Nestor of the municipality,) entreating him to lay the first
stone of the rebuilding of the Place Bellecour; whose
princely edifices had been condemned to demolition in
1793, by the malignant hand of Collet d'Herbois, and
which had been finally devastated during the bombardment
of General Doppet.
Trusting with sanguine confidence,” said the organ of
the wealthy Lyonnese, “ that this unfortunate city may
entertain a hope of rising from its ruins under the auspices
of the victorious consulate of France, commerce looks for

its best protection to that powerful hand which has planted
the eagles of the Republic beneath the shadow of the Apen-
nines ! – Lyons regards it as a favourable omen that the
hand which organised the triumph of Marengo will lay
the foundation of a monument of her renovated pros-
perity.”
An office so flattering having been graciously accepted
on the part of the triumphant consul, the worthy magis-
trate ventured to express the satisfaction experienced by
his fellow-citizens, in their discovery that a former member
of their community, the distinguished Mainville, the Sol-
DIER OF Lyons, should have participated in the glories of
General Buonaparte on the sands of Egypt, as well as upon
the plains of Italy; and in spite of the gravity of the au-
dience of the Hôtel des Célestins, General Mainville could
no longer refrain from throwing himself into the arms of
the old man who had loved him like a father, and who now
recognised him with such eager exultation. While the
populace, with acclamations and cries of triumph, insisted
that the victor of Marengo should exhibit himself to their
eager gaze from the balcony of the chamber, a few hurried
explanations occurred between these ancient associates.
« Even had not the good Bauveau apprised me of your
sudden apparition at his comptoir, I should have known
you,” cried the old man. “In spite of the fervid bronze
of an oriental sun, and of your change of name and vo-
cation. Ah! my dear Camille ! you did right to wean me
from my manufactory! — Your prescience of the misfor-
tunes of this fated city saved me from ruin. During
Kellerman’s siege, every stone was rased to the ground,
and I consider myself your debtor for all I rescued from
the wreck.”
“ It is nearly ten years since we parted,” said Camille.
“ I scarcely dare inquire after your family.”
“ All well ! — too obscure for the guillotine ! But
while you have been gathering laurels, my dear general,
my daughter who was wont to regard you with so much par-
tiality, has united herself to my successor at the factory,
and
you have lost your chance. Wait, however, a few
years, and I have a pretty little grandchild to supply her

66 But see,
place, and endow with old Michel Dacquin's dollars one of
the most eminent heroes of the republic. — After the toils
of war, you must return to shelter your old age in the home
of your youth.”
Mainville shook his head.
“ By your change of name, perhaps, you are no longer
a candidate for matrimony ?
“ To avoid the unpleasing recollections connected with
that of Max Valazy, I have assumed the name of a small
estate I possess near Meaux."
“ During the days of terror we heard that you had
united yourself with -
Camille started, and would have turned away.
With the daughter of my poor old numskull of a cor-
respondent, the mercer Delplanque,” continued Dacquin.
“ Both father and child perished on the scaffold of their
native city!" was his evasive reply.
- the
Consul re-enters !”
Dacquin and his black-robed procession were now com-
pelled to retire ; and on the following night, Buonaparte
and his staff passed on to Dijon, having devoted the
morning to the solemn ceremony organised by the Lyonnese
magistracy.
Honours of every description awaited his arrival. Groups
of well-born and beautiful women, crowned with flowers,
assumed the appearance of a mythological mask or the
triumph of some Olympic victor. No sooner was his ar-
rival at the palace of the consulate known in Paris, than
the gardens of the Tuileries, – the adjoining quays, —
even the streets commanding a view of its lofty roofs, –
were filled by an excited multitude, welcoming with shouts
of exultation the hero of Marengo. The city was illu-
minated by unanimous resolution ; and all parties and
classes were united by the enthusiasm of the moment !
The armistice recently concluded with Austria suspended
the anxieties even of those whose nearest and dearest were
serving under the banners of the Republic in the army of
Italy.
Previous to the Consul's departure for the army, the

palace of the Tuileries presented the germ of that future
court, whose imperial magnificence was destined to amaze
the inexperience of more legitimate sovereigns. The
gracious and graceful Joséphine had re-established in her
own circle those forms of French politeness, accounted
sinful during the sanguinary disorganisation of the Revo-
lution ; and had received, in return, the tokens of personal
homage formerly bestowed upon the queens of France.
On quitting their audience of the Consul, the republican
ministers were introduced to her presence ; delighted,
after the tedium of official labour, to unbend their minds
in the society of the accomplished protectress of the new
order.
Under her auspices, Paris resumed something of that gay
and brilliant aspect which has procured for her the name of
the guinguette de l'univers. The horrible anniversaries of
sanguinary triumph were abolished; and in their stead, the
masked balls of the opera, the concerts spirituels, the fa-
vourite promenades of Longchamps, all the cherished scenes
of Parisian festivity, mirth, elegance, and coquetry, were re-
established. The Tuileries and Malmaison afforded an
example of graceful hospitality rivalling the former bril-
liancy of Versailles ; while St. Cloud, rising from its ruins
under the patronage of the First Consul, promised to renew
the rural fêtes of the Petit Trianon.
Madame Buonaparte, whose conciliating address had won
to her party some of the fiercest nobles of the Faubourg
St. Germain, already hailed the ancient names of France
gracing her salon; and in the sisters of Napoleon, and
the dawning maturity of her charming daughter, Hortense,
its circle possessed attractions such as few royal houses
could tender for the captivation of their courtiers. Nor
had imperial etiquette yet excluded from the coteries of
the château a crowd of eminent men, to whose triumphs in
the career of art, science, or literature, no patent of
nobility was necessary; and who surrounded the car of the
victorious consul with the star-crowned visions of glory
described by Schiller as heralding the progress of genius!
Already General Mainville had received the commands

of the Consul to present himself in that fascinating circle,
to which the names of Berthollet, Chaptal, David, Talley-
rand, Isabey, Millin, Coupigny, imparted the strongest
interest in his eyes. But an appointment was soon vouch-
safed him which for the present absorbed his faculties. It
was decided in council, that on the 14th of July,— that
memorable anniversary which commemorated at once the
establishment of the French republic, the taking of the
Bastille, and the federation of the Champ de Mars, — the
banners conquered at Marengo should be presented to the
consulate, and the sabres of honour decreed to Lannes,
Victor, Watrin, Gardenne, and Murat, tendered in return;
while the foundation of the Quai Desaix was to afford to
the memory of the departed hero a monument conducive
at once to the advantage of his fellow-citizens and his own
immortality.-- Napoleon had selected as the bearer of the
standards of Marengo the brave and popular Lannes,
afterwards Duc de Montebello ; but fearing that the sol-
dierly frankness of his address might not fulfil the expec-
tations of the assembly, he appointed his Lyonnese fa-
vourite to the office of haranguing the soldiers of the
Invalides, previous to the distribution of the medals appro-
priated by election to five of their number.
Who shall describe the enthusiasm the exaltation
of spirit pervading all classes of society in Paris, on that
memorable occasion ! — It was a beaming day in July,
bright as the glory it was destined to commemorate ; and
defying the ardours of the sunshine, the whole population
of the city poured itself into the vast area of the Champ de
Mars ;
gratulation and triumph on every lip, and the
hope of a permanent peace irradiating every countenance.
As the consular procession approached the church of the
Invalides, still designated as the Temple of Mars, the
eye of Camille seemed to rest on a condensed mass of
rejoicing human beings; and the inspiration derived from
80 touching a spectacle, imparted to his oration a tone of
animated eloquence such as its pre-appointed periods might
not have attained.
With the plausibility of office, Lucien Buonaparte, as mi-

nister of the interior, commenced the ceremony of the day
by an harangue comparing the actual position of France
with the anarchy of the Directory; and his discourse was
heard with the chilling silence due to the occasion. The
brilliant assembly which filled the tribunes and galleries
of the church, uniting all that was beautiful and illustrious
in the Republic, plainly demonstrated its consciousness of
the factitious emptiness of these vague declarations. But
when Lannes, - bronzed by the exposure of successive
campaigns and dignified solely by a character of martial
pride,—advanced towards the magistracy of the realm to lay
at their feet trophies of the valour of its sons, no rounded
periods flowed from his iron lips, no artful conciliation
tempered the tone of his address ! But the hearts of the
auditors beat as if a trumpet had spoken in their ears; and
while he girded to his side the sword of honour offered by
the Republic as the reward of his exploits, the silence of
deep emotion pervaded the temple.
It was now the turn of Camille to present himself to the
notice of the Assembly; and, for a moment, his spirit felt
rebuked by the necessity of claiming its attention after a
man whose victories endowed him with rights upon the
hearts and minds of his fellow-citizens. But no sooner
did he stand confronted with the consuls, and read on the
expressive countenance of the victor of Marengo an assur-
ance of perfect confidence in his acquittal of the duty
delegated to his hands, than the hero of Lyons felt a new
sense of enthusiasm invigorate his frame. While hundreds
were pointing him out as the soldier of fortune who had
crowned himself with laurels at Bassano and Arcola, and
attained his present rank by his triumphant sally from the
walls of Mantua, Camille appeared to feel himself alone
with his illustrious friend, and to direct to him only the
expression of those elevated emotions and enthusiastic sen-
timents, which had united their efforts on the held of
victory.
The fervour of General Mainville's noble oration caused
the hearts of its hearers to thrill with new sentiments of
admiration towards that extraordinary man ; who, in the
commemoration of this, the most remarkable of his vic-
D D

tories, was studious to conceal his triumph behind the
ostensible names of Berthier, Kellerman, and Massena.-
During the distribution of the medals, exclamations of
transport and gestures of sympathy animated the vast
assemblage that seemed to render the venerable church
instinct with life and joy. But when the Chief Consul
himself, rising from his seat, addressed in the names of
his silent colleagues a few heart-stirring words to the re-
presentatives of the republican armies, the multitude ap-
peared transfixed by some preternatural charm. Every
look was turned towards him—every soul appeared in-
spired by the presentiment of his future greatness !- And
lo! while his last accents lingered in the ears of his
breathless auditors, while they still seemed to listen to the
charge addressed to Lannes and his brave companions,
“Go back to the camp; and bid your soldiers send us
peace, or the remaining banners of the enemy !”— the
solemn tones of the organ rolled through the dome; and
the impressive ceremonies of the day were terminated by
a hymn of thanksgiving, in which the harmonies of Mé-
hul were breathed as by common inspiration.
On quitting the church, a still more affecting scene pre-
sented itself. The consular guard, arriving in all the dis-
array of its march from the glorious field of Marengo, was
paraded before Napoleon amid the deafening shouts of the
multitude, and the waving of unnumbered ensigns of
triumph. But while the eyes of the multitude in the
Champ de Mars were engrossed by the aspect of those
hardy veterans whose scorched visages spoke of the ar-
dent sun of an Italian summer, and their dilapidated arms
of the still fiercer encounter of an Austrian army, those of
General Mainville were riveted on two lovely children,
who, in company with Mademoiselle Beauharnais, occu-
pied the carriage of Joséphine ; — girls of some ten or
twelve years of age,- one of whom recalled to his mind a
vanished dream of his youth, by her extraordinary resem-
blance to the daughter of the Duc de Navelles. Riding
towards Duroc, whose attention was directed to the same
quarter by his well-known attachment for the lovely Hor-
tense, Camille hastily inquired the name of this interest-
ing object.

" It is Mademoiselle Beauharnais !” – replied the
young soldier, in answer rather to the suggestions of his
own heart than to the demand of Mainville.
“ No, no! — the children ?”
“ The children ! — Nay, you must address yourself to
la grandmaman Campan, who has the charge of these
doves of the consular aviary; — my fancy rests elsewhere.”
Still more unsuccessful were his inquiries of Fouché,
who impatiently shook off his interruption. — “Yonder
brats? - Bah! — some Creole kindred of Joséphine's.
We have consignments of them in every West India fleet,
with cages of green paroquets, ourang-outangs, and cases
of Ratafia de Martinique.”
An opportunity of better information soon presented
itself. On the following night, a fête in the gardens of
Neuilly, then the abode of Talleyrand, collected to-
gether the brilliant ranks of the incipient court. Though
neither of the consuls graced this splendid festival with
their presence, the graceful and ingratiating Joséphine was
its tutelary goddess.
The gorgeous saloon in which she sat reclining on a
low divan, was one of those creations of the decorative art
peculiar to fairy tales and fermiers généraux. -- Yet José-
phine was not unworthy to be the priestess of the shrine.
She had, it is true, attained that period of life “où l'on
n'est plus jolie, mais où l'on est encore belle.” But nature
appeared to have wrought a miracle in favour of the bride
of the miraculous Napoleon.
It has been said that Buonaparte was pre-organised as
the only person capable of repairing the political ravages
of the Revolution, and restoring the limits of social order.
It may be observed, with equal truth, that Joséphine
was equally qualified to create anew those graces and
charms of society, then morally extinguished. For the
first time since the delirious rule of Robespierre, the
gracious address of “Madame” was heard in the cir-
cles of Malmaison ; the altars of religion were first re-
constructed for the exercise of the religious duties of the
wife of the Consul; and every minor embellishment of
the feminine character was cherished under her aus-

pices. The homage by which her influence could be best
propitiated was the gift of some rare exotic; and the
favourite for whom she first attempted to obtain the
favour of the Consul, was the preceptress of her chil.
dren.
While Mainville approached the divan, he perceived that
Joséphine was engaged in conversation with a woman of
advanced age; in whose high-bred self-possession and rich
but unostentatious elegance of attire, he recognised an air
of the vieille-cour which, combined with the deference
attaching the wife of the First Consul so long to her fauteuil,
announced some personage of more distinction than the
generality of the lovely women who graced the saloons
of Neuilly, the Talliens, Recamiers, and Grandts of
the republican era. As he silently contrasted the formal
air of the stranger with the graceful ease of Joséphine,
whose simple robes of white muslin and hair twisted into
a Grecian contour with a single row of pearls, formed
her sole ornament, he was startled by the eloquent thanks
of the wife of the victor of Marengo, for the justice he
had rendered to France and its hero, in his discourse at the
Invalides.
“I am thus prompt in tendering my acknowledgments,"
continued Joséphine, with the captivating smile which won
so many hearts to her cause, “because aware that it is
about to lose its value in the superior approbation of my
friend, Madame Montesson, who requests me to present
you to her acquaintance.”
General Mainville received the introduction which now
took place, with a profound bow; and, after a few casual
compliments on both sides, attempted to repay the flat-
teries with which his Egyptian exploits were recalled by
Joséphine to the remembrance of Madame Montesson, by
an assurance that his future reminiscences of the fête of
the 14th of July would be chiefly embellished by the
loveliness of her youthful protégées.
“ I thank you for my Hortense ! ” replied Joséphine,
with much emotion. May her destinies equal those ex-
cellencies of her character which are beyond the reach of
human vicissitude !”

somewhat embarrassed by this misconception, “ I had oc-

“ The general speaks of your little girls,” observed
Madame Montesson.
“Of Emiline and Stéphanie ? — True! I had obtained
a day's relaxation for them from Madame Campan."
“Of Emiline ? — Pardon me, madam,” cried Mainville,
“ if I presume to ask by what name I must for the future
distinguish my inquiries after your lovely little kins-
woman?”
“ Hush !” said Joséphine, speaking in a lower tone, and
looking carefully round her. “We never designate her
otherwise than as Eniline."
“I am answered !” replied the general, with respect.
“ But my questions, madam, were caused by stronger
motives than ordinary curiosity.”
“ It is not impossible, my dear Madame Buonaparte,"
said Madame Montesson, taking a pinch of snuff with a
most unperturbed countenance, “ that General Mainville
might afford you a clue to the details you have so long
desired, relative to the parentage of Emiline ?”
Joséphine shook her head, mistrustfully. “You, ge-
neral,” said she, in a confidential whisper, can make
allowances for the rigorous caution with which the Consul
is forced to surround his domestic relations. Shunning
like yourself all contact with the regicides who still haunt
our circles like abhorred and ghastly spectres, it becomes
his duty as it is his interest to avoid all show of partiality
towards ancient nobles and returned emigrants. My Emi-
line is the orphan of royalist parents, martyrs to the Revo-
lution. I received her as a sacred deposit in the midst of
its scenes of desolation. Though without express certainty
of her birth, I have every reason to believe her the last sur-
vivor of the families of -

Montesson, with another deliberate pinch.
" And of which General Mainville, if I mistake not,
became the purchaser ?” observed Madame Buonaparte.

evident emotion.

CHAPTER XI.
C'étoit un beau spectacle! Il parcourait la terre,
Avec ses vétérans -- nation militaire
Dont il savait les noms;
Les rois fuyaient, - n'étoient pas de sa taille,
Et vainqueur il allait par les champs de bataille
Glanant tous leurs canons !
VICTOR HUGO.
About ten days after this explanation, an official courier
dismounted at the convent of the Annunziata, at Genoa,
bearing a letter from the hand of Joséphine to the widow
of a French nobleman, resident within its walls.
Madame de St. Florentin had now been five years set-
tled in Italy. Her sojourn in England had not been of
long continuance. In quitting Manoir, she exacted from
Léonie a promise of secrecy relative to the unfortunate
incident which had placed an eternal bar between her-
self and her former benefactor; and by the false position
in which she thus thought proper to place herself, Emiline
was, on her arrival in England, exposed to the addresses
of the Chevalier de Mirepoix who, for many years, had
cherished towards his lovely cousin an attachment which,
if less capable of personal sacrifices than that of the unfor-
tunate Valazy, was scarcely less fervent.
It is impossible to conceive a situation more trying to a
delicate mind, than that in which Emiline found herself
in London. Valazy had realised, in contemplation of their
journey, a considerable fund for their maintenance, and
placed it at the disposal of Blaisel, their guide and pro-
tector. But Emiline was in a position which taught her
the indelicacy of accepting further favours at his hands.
“ Camille is no longer my foster-brother,” she would
exclaim to Mademoiselle de Mirepoix, “ that tie is merged
in a holier union. — He now lives in my heart as a friend
I have injured,
a husband I have insulted.

Fortunately for the self-resenting Emiline, she was not
compelled to either of these desperate alternatives. The
letters she had addressed to her brother, whose feeble
health compelled him to reside in Italy, were answered
with as much promptitude as circumstances would allow ;
and the reply of the Duc de Navelles to his sister's appeal,
was more affectionate and consolatory than his prolonged
estrangement from his farnily led her to expect. Infirm
and slightly deformed in person, Amédée de Navelles
possessed that peculiarity of humour, which, from Scarron
upwards, has been noticed as characteristic of genius
cribbed and cabined in the frame of a cripple. — Noto-
riously disaffected towards the ancient monarchy of France,
the character of his mind was such as to induce him to
look forward to the establishment of a better order of
things in his native country, rather than sit moaning over
outrages avenged by the nation in the retributive execu-
tion of Robespierre and his accomplices.
“ You must come to me, my dear sister," wrote Amédée
de Navelles from his retreat at Genoa, “ if you deign to
accept the shelter of my miserable roof. - For, alas ! the
cul-de-jatte is as little locomotive as when you used to win
the race upon him on the terrace at Navelles ; nor can he
gather breath enough to support his frail and maimed ex-
istence among the fogs of the Thames. An interval of
peace enables you to visit the harbour of this city of
palaces, where we will devise plans for our future estab-
lishment.”
With a species of sullen desperation, the marchioness
achieved the preparations for their departure ; and still
guarded by the paternal care of the good Blaisel, they
traversed the blue waves of the Mediterranean, and an-
chored in safety under the impressive quays of Genoa.
In addition to the affectionate greeting tendered to them
by the Duc de Navelles, satisfactory news awaited them
on their arrival. The duke had received, in bills of ex-
change from a banker of the city, the half-yearly revenue
of the estates of Florincthun; with an unsigned letter,
which stated that they had been recently purchased of the

national commissioners by a friend of the family for the
benefit of the widow and child who, it was understood,
were about to seek his protection.
“With whom are you sufficiently imprudent to main-
tain relations of intercourse in the capital, dearest Emi-
line ? ” inquired the duke, as he placed at her disposal the
sum expedited for her use. “ This mysterious Monsieur
Friport must be tolerably high in your confidence, since all
the intelligence I had been previously enabled to gather of
you, consisted in a statement of yours and Léonie's ex-
tinction on the fatal day of outrage which deprived me of
my father.”
“ I have neither friend nor correspondent in Paris,” re-
plied the marchioness, blushing deeply in the dread of her
brother's further interrogations. “ I am only interested
in recollecting that the death of the villain Max Valazy has
redeemed us from our sole personal enemy, and that the
execution of his colleague Robespierre has secured the
population of France from its common assassin ! Who
more survives in Paris of foes or friends, I ask not. Se-
cure, dear Amédée, in your protection, I have nothing
further to desire."
Yet it soon became evident to her brother, — who had
wisely dropped his title for the modest designation of Mon-
sieur de Navelles,—that Emiline had not only much to de-
sire, but that the events and circumstances with which
these emotions were connected, had been in a great measure
concealed from his knowledge. Finding the desolate gran-
deur of Genoa unpropitious to the restoration of her spirits,
he prevailed upon her to return with him to his previous
residence at Milan; where, though he studiously evaded
the notice of the Austrian court, a social circle of the
highest nobility of Lombardy welcomed his return. To
these, Monsieur de Navelles was endeared by his cheerful
patience under the most dispiriting bodily infirmities, as
well as by the epigrammatic gaiety with which he philoso-
phised on the loss of wealth, title, and personal ease ; while
others of the exiled nobility of France wearied the ears of
their hosts by parading over their vanished glories, and

denouncing vengeance on the usurpers of their rights.
Ignorant of the horrible details of his father's death,
Amédée would reply with an ironical smile, “ Que voulez
vous ?- France has encountered the destiny of nations ;
glory, - prosperity,- luxury, -enervation,-misgovern-
ment, — anarchy,—desolation !- Let us see what sort of
phænix will rise from her funeral pile !”.
At times his friends were apprehensive that the freedom
with which he expressed his political opinions might ex-
pose him to personal mischance. “No, no!” said he
pointing to his crutch, “Æsop is a privileged railer.
The imperial Sauerkrauters know that the cul-de-jatte is
good for nothing but a shreckvogel ; — not strong enough
for the field, not knave enough for the cabinet. — When
these dilettante generals of the French Directory make
their appearance in Milan, with their military and diplomatic
staff of auctioneers and appraisers, — poets and painters,
I can but tender to their love of the fine arts my portfolio
of caricatures ; and then, like his ducal highness at Mo-
dena, offer to redeem the pledge of allegiance with a six-
livre piece.”
Though far advanced in the fatal disorder which
marked him for an early grave, nothing could exceed the
satirical animation with which he hailed the baseness of
the stiff-necked Milanese princes in hastening the flight of
the Archduke Ferdinand, that they might divest themselves
without reproof or suspicion of the cherished paraphernalia
of their haughty state,
their titles, - equipage, and
heraldic bearings, — to welcome the entrance of the di-
rectorial troops.
“By the time Salicetti instals himself in the palace,"
said Amédée, with a sneer rather humorous than bitter,
we shall find that all these princes of the Noah dynasty
have dismissed their flowing perukes for the shaggy un-
trimness of a Brutus-à-la-Condorcet; or - who knows?
— perhaps for a greasy bonnet rouge! — Our financiers
will exchange diamond buckles for shoe-strings, and fancy
themselves transformed into Rowlands and Neckers !”
Both his sister and her friend, notwithstanding these
sarcasms, were not slow to perceive that the wasting frame

of the invalid was deeply agitated by tidings of the ap-
proach and successes of the republican army.
" Pardieu !
they fight like devils !” was his ejaculation on learning
their first victory at Monte Notte ; and when the battle
of Lodi introduced the name of a new Alexander to the
trumpet of Fame, a flush of triumph gleamed upon his
cheek. Even Emiline, though sincerely in his confidence,
and Blaisel the confessor of his opinions, were by no
means certain of the part he would adopt on the occupation
of the city by his countrymen, when they witnessed the
struggle by which he strove to distinguish his sympathy
in the exploits of the veterans of France from his abhor-
rence of the regicides of the Revolution. But, alas ! the
determination of his opinions was diverted by the arrest of
a higher authority than that of king or kaiser. These
agitations fatally accelerated the progress of a disease which
had latently consumed the powers of life, and in order to
append to the facade of his abode the festive tapestries
which the city had commanded to give an air of public
rejoicing to the entry of the French troops, they were
compelled to remove the funeral hangings of Amédée de
Navelles !
On the day previous to his release, the noble emigrant,
whose movements and opinions were always peculiar,
suddenly marked his consciousness of approaching dissolu-
tion, by a proposal of marriage to his beautiful cousin !
"My silence on this delicate topic, dear Léonie,” said
he, extending his hand towards her, “has not proceeded
from any ignorance of the family contract binding us from
our cradles to each other. Had the ancien régime of
Versailles upheld its dilapidated fabric, and compelled me
to take my place among the logs in velvet and embroidery
stationed like automata round the throne, believe me,
dearest cousin, the cul-de-jatte would never have exposed
you to the shame of becoming Duchess of Navelles. I
would have told you, in honest truth, that your choice lay
between a convent and the society of a wretch branded by
the stepmother-reprobation of nature !- that although the
buoyancy of youth sometimes enabled him to chirrup in
the sunshine, increasing infirmities would surely render

his premature age a peevish and louring winter to your
patience ; that the cripple would love you too tenderly
to bear the spectacle of your disgust;—too susceptibly, to
endure the suspicion of your preference for another ;
and then, pointing to the cloister as a happy alternative,
have eagerly counselled your rejection of my hand.”
More distressed by the sight of his increasing feebleness
than by these strange declarations, Léonie implored him to
desist from his wild project.
“ But now, Léonie, now, a dying man, I do not
implore,–I demand the fulfilment of our contract ! You
shall not be defrauded of such rights as the re-organisation
of public affairs may at some future time bestow. Deign
to become my widow, and the sister of our dear Emiline ;
and do not refuse, in return, an occasional tear to the
memory of the cul-de-jatte.”
It was rather to appease the agitation with which he
resented her refusal, than from any inclination towards
the scheme, that Mademoiselle de Mirepoix acceded to the
entreaties of Amédée and Emiline; and the ceremony was
performed by Blaisel at the altar of a neighbouring church,
whither, with some difficulty, the invalid was transported
by the aid of his intimate friend Prince Rezatelli, and his
servant, the faithful Bénoit. Two days afterwards, the
youthful duchess a bride and widow -
- was attempting
to soothe the afflictions of the weeping Emiline on the re-
moval of the last representative of her house, the last friend
of her heart, to his lonely grave ;
while the acclamations
of the populace filling the street,— the blaze of a universal
illumination, and the increasing report of discharges of
fireworks, -proclaimed the triumphal entry of the re-
publican army.
Yet neither at that moment nor any subsequent pe-
riod of the varying fortunes of the army of Italy, could
Emiline be persuaded to evince the smallest interest in the
success of the French troops.
“What is it to me,” she cried, “that the allies of
the exterminators of my family should hold at their
girdle the keys of the Alps ; that the gates of Mantua
should open at their fiat ; - that Lombardy and Tuscany

the Queen of the Adriatic or the Ligurian city of pa-
laces-should bow to the standard of the republic? – I re-
cognise no banner as that of France, but one which bears
for its ensign the lily of the Bourbons !”
Absorbed in the bitterness of retrospection, Emiline de-
voted her time to the education of her little girl ; and while
Madame de Navelles, after the respect of a year's seclusion
paid to the memory of the generous Amédée, permitted
herself to seek the recreations fitting her age in those cir-
cles of Milanese society which had been frequented by the
duke during his lifetime, Emiline occupied herself in acts
of devotion and charity, which every day more and more
estranged her from the conventions of the world.
The formation of the Cisalpine republic insured them a
brief respite from the horrors of war; and Buonaparte
having been rejoined by his bride, established himself for
the summer months at the palace of Montebello, where by
the splendour of his establishment, and the brilliant hos-
pitalities of Joséphine, he satisfied the vanity and frivolity
of the subjugated Lombards with something of the charac-
ter of a court. Between the treaties of Leoben and Campo
Formio, the heroic victors of Lodi and Arcola, indulging
in diversions such as might have beseemed the romantic
career of Tasso's knights, occupied themselves with fes-
tive triumphs, with excursions on the northern lakes, and
picturesque diversions among the enchanted gardens of the
Borromean islands.
Re-assured by the general tranquillity, Léonie succeeded
in persuading her sister to quit the city during the summer
heats, and accept the hospitality of the mother of one of
Amédée's favourite friends, Princess Rezatelli, who pos-
sessed a villeggiatura between Berlasina and Como. But
though the cheek of the invalid grew fresher and her eye
brighter when exposed to the breezes of the mountains,
no smile irradiated the one, or dimpled the other. She was
in fact pining away with that canker of the heart - - a grief
which we dare not communicate, and cannot assuage.
Long hours of self-communing, of recurrence to those
days when the unspoken passion of Camille declared itself
in a thousand hourly and trivial manifestations, a thou-

sand broken words of irrepressible emotion, were the secret
indulgences with which she engraved his image on her heart
in characters of fire.
And he, who thus fervently occupied her thoughts, her
prayers, her conjectures, was her husband ; — her own by
a sacred tie of his eager seeking ; — yet divided from her
by a barrier as repulsive and insurmountable as the icy
mountains within whose withering shadow no living thing
can abide !
Within a few weeks of her residence at the Villa
Rezatelli, an incident occurred destined to augment with
a thousand vague anxieties the sufferings of the penitent
Emiline.
CHAPTER XII.
Che fan qui tante pellegrine spade ?
PETRARCA.
The court of Montebello was luxuriating in one of
those delicious intervals, when the corn-fields are left
untrampled by the fierce hoofs of the cohort; — when
the vineyard fence serves to rebut the intrusion of the
stragglers from some goatherd's flock, rather than afford
a mask for the aim of an enemy;
when the summer's
sky wears an untroubled atmosphere unsullied by the
stifling vapours, - unjarred by the startling voice of the
engines of war !
One evening, as the prince, Léonie, and her cousin,
were sauntering home on horseback, beneath the length-
ening shadows of the chestnut trees, they heard angry
voices contending rather in the sharp thin vociferation of
French bitterness, than in the varying and full-toned ca-
dences of the patois of the Milanese ; and on a bending
of the road, perceived little Aglaë and her attendant
with a few retainers of the prince grouped round the
old mule de ed to her service; while a half frantic wo-
man clung to the crimson pillion on which the child was

seated, and a party of French hussars, whom they recog-
nised as part of the legion quartered at the adjoining vil-
lage of Pietra Ferzi, were attempting to drag her away.
Bénoit, who acted as a species of dragoman between his
countrymen and the people of Prince Rezatelli, ran towards
his lady on the approach of the riding party, to explain
the commotion.
“ Ma’amselle Aglaë was amusing herself with her wait-
ing-maid Maturina, in straying through the enclosure,
when they had been attacked by a strange woman, either
mad or intoxicated, or both, apparently some sutler-follower
of the French camp. But Maturina's screeching soon
brought to her aid some of those ranting dragoons always
maundering about the country; and they have taken the
woman into custody, and are carrying her off to quarters
for justice.--Flogging or hanging will mend her principles.
against a new campaign.”
By this time, they reached the scene of the affray.
But though they could distinctly hear the piercing cries
of the marauder, they could see nothing of her face. The
Madras kerchief which had been knotted round her head
was torn away, and her loose dishevelled tresses hanging
wildly round her person, gave her the air of a fury.
“ Plead for me, child !” said she, extricating one arm
from her fierce guardians, to extend it towards the sobbing
Aglaë. “ Command them to release me, or my blood will
be upon your young head !— I was bred a vassal of your
father's land. - The same air nourished us,
-the same
green hills sheltered our dwelling. Plead for the bonds-
woman of your father's house !”
A thrill of horror curdled the blood of Emiline, as she
recognised that voice. “Flavie, — unfortunate woman,
into what degradation last thou fallen ? ” cried the mar-
chioness, with a shudder.
“ And through whom? ” — cried the struggling prisoner,
throwing back the hair from a face scarred and disfigured
by exposure and hardened with the fierceness of effrontery;
through whom? — Through thee. When thou wert a
poor, despised, proscribed being, thy drivelling lover sued
at the feet of Flavie for aid to thee and thine. Thy kins-

man, Mirepoix, was rescued from the regeneration at La
Force, through my interposition ; and while thou wert fly-
ing from the smoking ruins of Florincthun, Flavie, on her
pedestal of pride, received the worship of all good repub-
licans, who acknowledged the divinity of the Goddess of
Reason —ha! ha! ha! They may scourge me-
- they may
brand me —
they may hang me, but my feet have been
kissed by their grovelling idolatry !”
“ I never injured you, Flavie,” faltered Emiline, horror-
struck by her virulence.
« Not injure me? not hurl me from my eminence ?
—not plunge the iron into
my
soul? I loved him so —
amid all the folly and all the sin of my career, I so
loved Maximilien that I would have perilled body and
soul, —- nay! I did peril body and soul, in the madness
of my tenderness. And what was my reward ? - He bad
me serve thy beck as an hireling, — and I did so ! - He
bad me betray the trust of those whose bread I had
eaten,
and I did so! - And then, while I still cleaved
to him with a fidelity surpassing the faith of a wife, - I
who had shared his time of need, who had slaved for
him, - starved for him, - I, who had deserted the old
age of my parents, and the good-will of the village, to
be the drudge of his adversity, — I was expelled from
beneath his roof in the day of his triumph, — for thee !
He told me, he was about to bring thee home as his wife.
He told me he loved thee with ferocious and revengeful
passion; and bad me seek some other protector,
other refuge for my infamy.”
The distracted woman writhed as she spoke, uttering a
species of howl which chilled the heart of every person
present.
“ But I would not go !- No! I clung to him, - till
he smote me,
- till he drove me forth like an outcast !
But it was all thy doing.”
“ Oh! no, no!” cried Léonie ; my cousin would
have spurned his suit and him!”
« But she would not have done as I did ! She would
not have feasted on such glorious revenge as the betrayed
Flavie !” She drew in her breath with a hissing inspir-

ation, as if recoiling from the sound of the horrible nar-
ration she was impelled to utter. “ I crept stealthily
secretly-unsuspectedly, to the den of Robespierre;-and
told him how the friend of his bosom had plotted against
him.- I gave him written proofs of the treachery of the
proud man who was on his way to Picardy to bring home
his noble bride - his bride! - ha! ha! ha! — And so
the warrant was issued, — and the bloodhounds cheered
upon his track, — and they slaughtered the gallant bride-
groom even in his wooing !-Ha! ha! ha!- And then I
was happy!” Her head sank upon her bosom.
so because I was too happy, and laughed too loudly (for no
one was permitted to laugh in Paris when Robespierre was
pope), they sent me into the convent at the Saltpétrière,
and I had stripes enough to cure any mirth less vehement
than mine."
“ You perceive that this poor woman is in a state of de-
rangement,” said Prince Rezatelli, humanely to the soldiers.
“ Release her, and I will see her placed in the lunatic

« Hospital !
bah! — the black-hole will be cure
enough,” cried the corporal : “ we all know that la Mère
Audy gets into her tantrums after seeing the bottom of the
Rosolio flask. But we will take her to quarters for her
sentence.”
“ Save me !” cried Flavie, clinging to the skirts of
Emiline's dress.
“ Justice, justice !" clamoured the peasants.
Away with her to quarters,” cried the corporal of
we are responsible to our commandant.”
And in spite of the entreaties of Emiline the shrieking
and bewildered criminal was hurried over the fields by her
enraged guides. They saw the uniforms of the French
soldiers glancing among the tender green of the flag-like
leaves of maize, long after the execrations of their struggling
prisoner became indistinct in the distance.
“Let us go round by the Camminata, and meet them
at Pietra Ferzi,” cried Léonie ; “our evidence and inter-
cessions may do something in her favour.”

And without waiting the concurrence of the prince,
they rode towards the village, at the distance of about
a league from Rezatelli. On approaching its first strag-
gling hovels, — before which groups of hussars, with their
arms folded and their pipes in full activity, were listening
to the romances of some more experienced moustache of
the tribe, who had fought with Montcalm and heard the
bittern cry in the marshes of the Massachusetts, - the
prince ventured to point out the unfitness of such a scene
for female intrusion ; more especially when, on reaching
the market-place and its alberghetto, the pipes were re-
moved from the mouths of the politicians crowded round
the table under its protruding trellice, for the utterance of
coarse by-words of wonder at the beauty of the strange
horsewomen. Two sentries planted at the door of a man-
sion somewhat more dignified than the rest, announced the
head-quarters of Colonel Mainville.
Stay!” said the prince, as they prepared to dismount;
“ before you attempt this rash interview, I forewarn you
that I cannot be your companion in presence of an officer
of the French republic. The name of Rezatelli is of too
permanent an inscription in the archives of Lombardy, to
be involved in the acceptance of any concession from such
a quarter."
“ Right, right,” cried Léonie, somewhat vexed by his
lukewarm' inaction in their behalf; our countrymen
unless strangely altered—will be far more accessible to our
representation, than to the preambles of all the descendants
of all the Longobardi."
Again Rezatelli attempted to dissuade them ; but the
cousins disappeared beneath the archway of the Caserina ;
and he could devise no better resource for his mortification,
than to lead their horses to the shade of the lime-trees or-
namenting the centre of the piazza ; graced with a dilapi-
dated fountain, of which the principal triton appeared to
be blowing a post-horn in a mizzling rain.
The sentry having pointed out the corps-de-garde where
application must be made for admittance to the com-
mandant, Emiline and Léonie, soon found themselves
standing in a dirty antechamber, at the central table of

which, an aide-de-camp was employed in busy transcription ;
while the walls, scrawled over in all colours and all pos-
sible caligraphic varieties of German, Italian, and French,
-bore evidence to the fortunes of war,—the declension of
the house of Hapsburg, and the ascendency of its con-
querors. Accepting the bench politely tendered by the
military secretary, Emiline profited by his advice to write
on a slip of paper the object of her mission to Colonel
Mainville, whom he stated to be engaged at dinner in the
adjoining chamber, with one of the aide-de-camps of Ge-
neral Buonaparte, who had just arrived at Pietra Ferzi on
a special mission. As the young officer left the door of
the antechamber ajar, on entering to deliver their petition
for an audience, the marchioness and her companion had
the full advantage of the discussion which ensued.
“ Two French ladies, emigrants,
requesting the
favour of a few minutes' conversation?”.
said a strange
voice. “ Bah! tell them, my dear Canouville, that between
soup and bouilli is not the moment for district business;
and that an emigrant is a parricide,- a felon without the
pale of the law of politeness.”
“Nay, cried another voice, - Mainville must not
refuse us the rare advantage of female society. Bring these
fair petitioners in to pledge us in a glass of Chambertin,
and we will drown their disabilities at the bottom of the
goblet.”
“With your leave, monsieur le general,” said young
Canouville, “ these ladies are of respectable degree.”
“ Bah! so was my grandmother.”
• The hostess of gargote at Amiens !” muttered the
young aide-de-camp. They came hither under the pro-
tection of our neighbour Prince Rezatelli, and are waiting
in the anteroom,” he continued, aloud; and a scuffle of
chairs ensued, as if the officers were rising from table.
“ Not a step, gentlemen ! cried Colonel Mainville.
“As it is not in my power to receive the visit of these
ladies, I must beg you to resume your seats.
Canouville,
inform madame, inform the writer of this note, -that
it is impossible for me to enter into communication with a
French emigrant with such courteousness as I could wish.

Any request addressed to me in writing will be better
attended to."
But on returning to his post, the young officer found,
that the enemy had quitted the field. At the first accent
of that well-known voice, a faint cry had broken from the
lips of Emiline ! Her first impulse was to rush from the
spot into the court-yard, precipitately followed by the as-
tonished Léonie, who had heard nothing in the words of
Mainville, except the hoarse tone and ungracious sen-
timents of some revolutionary captain.
“ Has any thing unpleasant occurred to madame ?” in-
quired Rezatelli, as he lifted her upon her horse to return
to the villa. “ Surely no one has dared-
“ Hush ! hush !” cried Madame de Navelles. " Emi-
line has resolved to address this personage in writing. Let
us hasten home, that no further time may be lost.”
On arriving at the villa, the marchioness, however con-
scious of the urgency of Flavie's position, could not collect
her faculties sufficiently either to effect her purpose or
declare the truth to her sister-in-law ; but Léonie, seizing
the pen, had the presence of mind to make out a clear
statement of the case, and despatch it by an active mes-
senger to Pietra Ferzi. During the interval of his ab-
sence, Madame de St. Florentin neither uttered a
nected sentence nor stirred from the chair into which she
had thrown herself. When the measured trot of their
emissary's horse was heard upon the chaussée, her breath
was suspended by the interest of the moment.
“ Be not thus agitated, dearest,” whispered Léonie.
They cannot refuse you so poor a boon as this wretched
woman's pardon.” Alas! the anxieties of the trembling
expectant were engrossed by any thing rather than the des-
tinies of the luckless Flavie Audicourt! -
The note was now brought in placed in the hands of
Emiline-opened. It was written in a strange hand.
“Read it !” faltered the marchioness, sinking back de-
spondingly in her chair.
“ The colonel commandant of the district of Pietra
Ferzi has the honour to acquaint the guests of Prince Re-

Cisalpine Republic."
“ Victoria !” cried Léonie, dropping the letter.
might have spared ourselves that tiresome journey."
“Very respectful,-very satisfactory !" - rejoined the
stately Lombard magnat. “ This fellow appears conscious of
what is due to the inmates of the Palazzo Rezatelli."
Emiline withdrew from her companions without sharing
the exultation of the one, or the gratified vanity of the
other. Her first movement, after bolting herself in her
chamber, was to fall on her knees and return thanks to
Heaven that Camille still lived lived in the honour and
distinction of successful soldiership; her next, to throw
herself
upon her couch, and weep with that unrestrained
vehemence which is at once the solace and nutriment of
affliction.
She had heard his voice — his very breathing. — She had
been within the compass of a few steps from his presence.
She might have rushed to his arms, and shed on his bosom
those tears which now burst so lavishly from the depths
of her heart! And what had restrained her ? — Shame!
-the dread of well-merited rejection,— the consciousness
of unpardonable injury.--The Soldier of Lyons was now
devoted to his country ; his mind engrossed by the in-
fluence of patriotism, as it had formerly been swayed ex-
clusively by her own. Glory was his mistress — France
his tutelary divinity.— It was clear that he had no longer
a heart or soul for Emiline !
Excusing herself on the plea of indisposition from joining
the supper-table of the princess, she passed the evening-
the night-in retrospections and anticipations equally
painful and perplexing. The weather was calm, the mid-
night atmosphere clear; and as she strained her eyes
in
gazing over the trellices and orangeries of the garden
towards the horizon of the valley, she could perceive the
occasional glancing of lights in direction of Pietra

Ferzi. And there-even there he dwelt!-he-who had
so often occupied her thoughts while she gazed listlessly
upon that very landscape, and fixed her eyes upon that
very spot. So near her, so within the scope of her daily
haunts, that he could not but have known of her vicinity,
or seen her in her evening rides in the woods skirting the
Adda. Camille must have studiously avoided her presence ;
nay, even when apprised of her appearance at Villa Ferzi,
had pointedly refused her an interview. Every pulse in
the frame of Emiline throbbed at this humiliating insti-
gation of her wounded pride !
A more cheering view of the case suggested that Ca-
mille might perhaps have remained as profoundly ignorant
of her residence at Rezatelli, as she had been of his own.
She ran over in her mind the appearance of every stranger
whom, since the occupation of the French army, she had
observed loitering near the villa. -She tried to recollect
the height and bearing of the various officers they had
occasionally met skirmishing or idling about the neigh-
bourhood, and whom they had studiously avoided ;- in
the hope of persuading herself that Mainville, though un-
willing to intrude upon her presence or submit to a public
interview, had clandestinely indulged himself with the
sight of one to whom he had sacrificed so much. But her
most sanguine reminiscences afforded no consolation to her
mortified spirit. She was forced to admit that the only
military straggler she had ever noticed loitering in the
neighbourhood of the villa was Achille de Rohan, whose
admiration was unquestionably devoted to Madame de
Navelles.
As she prepared for rest by closing the casement,
Emiline could not refrain from casting her eyes on the
mirror on her toilet; and as she removed the profusion of
tresses that veiled her countenance, tears started into her
eyes as she detected the difference between the Emiline of
seven-and-twenty, and the Emiline of seventeen !- She
did not perceive the brightened intelligence of countenance
which superseded its girlish roundness of outline. — She
was unconscious of the intensity of sensibility modulating
its smile into the most exquisite perfection of loveliness.-

She only saw that the dew of morning was no longer on
the flower, and turned away and wept the evanescence of
its charm.
This mode of passing the night unquestionably wrought
no amendment in her looks ; for on encountering the
Rezatelli family at breakfast, the marchioness was assailed
on all sides by the most tender inquiries respecting her
health.
“I trust I shall not aggravate the indisposition or pro-
voke the reprehension of madame la marquise," said the
sententious Rezatelli, “ by acknowledging that, profoundly
touched by the sense of deference exhibiteủ by the French
commandant of Pietra Ferzi, I have so far overcome my
prejudices against the banner his services uphold, as to
despatch a messenger to the village, announcing my inten-
tion of waiting upon him in the course of the morning, to
solicit the honour of receiving him and his colleagues
beneath my roof."
“ So much the better !” cried Madame de Navelles.
"We shall have an opportunity of discovering whether the
madcap Major de Rohan be indebted to the partiality of
fame for his reputation as a wit.”
“ And I shall not be sorry for a glimpse of young
Canouville," mumbled the good old princess over her cho-
colate. “I remember his great-grandmother in the circle
at the Hôtel de Boufflers, when the late prince my hus-
band was envoy at Paris, after the treaty of Aix-la-
Chapelle.”
“And madame la marquise ? " persisted the prince.
“You have judged with admirable discretion as regards
the hospitality of the name of Rezatelli, and the duties of
a member of the Cisalpine Republic,” replied Emiline
evasively; satisfying her conscience with a resolution to
plead indisposition as a motive for remaining invisible,
should the visit of the prince be returned by Mainville and
his companions.
During the hours of the prince's absence she could not
sufficiently restrain her emotions to remain in the presence
of her friends; nor did she rejoin them till her anxiety to

possess herself of every word pronounced by the prince on
the subject of his visit recalled her to the saloon.
6. The officers of the republican army, madam, honour
the Villa Rezatelli by dining here to-morrow,” said Re-
zatelli, in answer to the interrogation of Madame de
Navelles. “You will not, however, be molested with the
presence of the commandant; who so harshly refused your
visit yesterday, and granted your petition only on learning
your domestication under my roof. Rapp, the aide-de-
camp of General Buonaparte, (who was his guest at the
moment of your arrival at Pietra Ferzi,) brought the news
of his promotion, and sealed despatches for his care.
- General Mainville set off for Paris at daybreak this
morning."
Till that moment, Emiline had never honestly confessed
to herself how intensely every feeling of her heart was en-
grossed by the hope of being one day re-united to Camille !

Grievous as was this sudden reverse of the prospect on
which she had dwelt, her vexation was magnified a thou-
sand fold by the picture of General Mainville's character
and habits exhibited by his military brethren, who soon
found favourable acceptance at the villa.
“ I should not have dared produce this toy in the pre-
sence of monsieur le commandant,” said Rohan, as he
sat with his guitar and his “ Vaillant troubadour" effu-
sions, beneath the trellices of the villa. “ Mainville is
the strangest creature in nature. He will pass a month
without a smile, - grim as the Schwarzwald, or the pic-
ture of King Agrapant; — then, melt into tears at the
sound of one of my serenades. Whenever I want to

“ No,
cheat him out of a day's leave or some other indulgence, I
sing the savageness out of him through the medium of
some of Dalayrac's sensibleries.”
“ He is an officer, I understand, high in the confidence
of the Directory and of General Buonaparte?” said Léonie.
“ Not a finer fellow fights under the tri-color !” cried
Rohan. “ A soldier of fortune, like the best and bravest
of our army.
But what of that? The hardest sword
has least gold on the hilt.”
“ And will General Mainville prolong his stay at Pa-
ris?”. faltered Emiline, turning over the pages of
Major de Rohan's music-book, while the blood rushed into
her cheeks.
- he has probably already left the city.”
“ We shall therefore secure the advantage of enlarging
our social circle at Rezatelli ?" said the prince, with a stiff
bow intended to be gracious.
“ Again, no !-- Mainville's eventual errand is to Fri-
uli
“ To the Austrian camp,perhaps the Austrian court!"
exclaimed the prince. “ Had I been forewarned of this, I
might have furnished him with an introduction to the
notice of my gracious and illustrious friends the Archduke
Ferdinand and his consort !”
“ I fancy Wurmser, whose sword my friend Mainville
received at the surrender of Mantua, will form a sufficient
master of the ceremonies ! — But the general is well known
to Count Cobentzel ; and his mission is supposed to relate
to the deliverance of La Fayette from the prison of Olmütz,
where somewhat too large a measure of his days has been
consumed.”
They are friends of old, Mainville was formerly
his aide-de-camp," observed Emiline, musing aloud.
“ You are acquainted then with the general ?” — cried
Colonel Canouville, astonished by this assertion.
“ From report only!” replied the marchioness. But
she spoke with so crimson a blush, that Prince Rezatelli felt
particularly well satisfied that the commandant of Pietro
Ferzi should be on his road towards Udine.
Every day, every hour, tended to raise the absent one

in her estimation. Rohan and Canouville seemed, by a pre-
concerted signal, to choose the gestes et faits of the Soldier
of Lyons as their favourite topic. Traits of his romantic
valour, his magnanimity, were for. ever on their lips.
They had but one accusation to make against him.-
" He was très peu François, — très peu sensible !” and
there were
a thousand allusions to a certain Modenese
countess, and a young and noble abbess at Vicenza, whom
he had ungraciously disdained among the conquests of the
Republic.
It may be supposed that this evidence of the insensi.
bility of Mainville, was not recorded by Emiline among
the least of his virtues. Such then was the heart she had
rejected ! - This warrior, whose laurels were already per-
petuated by the hand of history, was the man she had
driven with scorn from her presence ;—this plenipotentiary
between contending nations, was the man she had up-
braided with his obscure and nameless existence! - What
aggravations to the grievous recollection of having injured
the truest and most devoted of friends, of having alien-
ated the affection of the noblest of human beings !
“ Could the Aulic council have seen Mainville charge at
the head of his regiment at Bassano,” said Rohan one
day, during the absence of the prince, “ Rezatelli's gra-
cious and illustrious friend the archduke would have con-
fessed at once that his game was up. Mainville's fine
figure in the field is worth a week's pay to encourage the
men.”
“ And what is all this to me?” murmured Emiline, as
she laid her throbbing head at night upon her pillow.
“ If there exist a human being divided from my approach
and elevated above my sympathy, it is Mainville. — Oh,
Camille, Camille ! how little did I dream it would ever
thus befall between us !”
The marchioness found no difficulty in proving to her
satisfaction that it was her duty to court the repetition of
every fact connected with the destinies, past, present, and
future, of a person so intimately interwoven with her own ;
and when at length the letters despatched from Camille
contained the assurance of permanent peace, not a subject

427
of France exulted more sincerely in the result of the treaty,
than the lovely emigrants of the Villa Rezatelli.
But, alas ! this satisfactory position of public and pri-
vate affairs was not of long duration. Before Emiline had
gathered courage to reveal even to her sister-in-law the
identity of Mainville with their own Camille, the ambition
of the First Consul had pointed out the scene of Cæsar's
triumphs and Alexander's victories as an arena worthy his
exploits. . The Egyptian expedition was announced, and
Mainville, a general of brigade, was soon heard of beneath
the walls of Alexandria !
It was
some comfort to poor Emiline that he was
heard of; for whenever despatches from the East dispersed
tidings of the French army over Europe, she was preserved
from the wretchedness of suspense by the distinctions
sought and found by the brave Mainville in this new
avenue to the temple of Fame. Scarcely an action occurred
in which his brigade was not pointed out to the gratitude
of the Republic. But glory is a miserable balm for the
wounds and anxieties of affection ; and willingly would
Emiline have exchanged all the laurels of ancient and mo-
dern history for the certainty that Mainville would bring
back his veterans in person to the shores of Europe. Even
when the agitations of war again disturbed the plains of
the Milanese, and General Joubert, in command of the
army of the Danube, resumed an offensive attitude, her
attention was more feebly directed towards its operations,
than towards those which pushed the triumphs of the Eu-
ropean hosts across the wilds of Syria. The congress of
Radstadt was broken up by a political rupture, perpetuating
the struggle between the Republic and the Germanic em-
pire. But Emiline appeared unconscious of the frightful
prospects emanating from the new coalition formed against
her native country. Mainville was lying wounded in a
miserable fortress, which Murat had succeeded in wresting
from the enemy, between the banks of the Jordan and
Mount Thabor !-- Camille was expiring in a distant land !
On every side, the armies of the Directory appeared
abandoned by the favour of fortune which marked their
opening career. Kray and Bellegarde, Suwarrow and Me-

las, afforded a combination too powerful for the resistance
of Victor, Massena, and Championnet; nor, till the dis-
asters of the Syrian campaign determined Napoleon to hasten
back to Paris, to disconcert the political intrigues created
by his absence, did the French eagle resume the impetuosity
of its earlier flight. The revolution of the 18th Brumaire
placed a corner-stone to the pedestal of his ambition; and
on the ruins of the directorial government arose a consulate,
composed of Sièyes, Ducos, and Napoleon Buonaparte.
Madame de Navelles, meanwhile, and her sister, re-
moved to Genoa ; hoping for some occasion to embark for
England. Scarcely, however, had they installed themselves,
when Melas advanced to invest, and Massena to defend it
against the Austrian troops. The unfortunate sisters found
themselves exposed to the horrors of a siege, augmented
by the blockade enforced by a British fleet under the com-
mand of Lord Keith.
During those weeks of horror, when the cry of the people was
great in the city, when eight thousand Austrian prisoners
were perishing for lack of food, and when even the palaces
of the nobility were provisioned with the flesh of dogs and
horses, the welfare of the helpless sisters, who had taken
shelter in the convent of the Annunziata, was unremittingly
watched by some mysterious protector. Although the
whole city suffered the bitterest privations of want, whole-
some food was daily supplied to the convent for their use.
The abbess and her simple nuns began to regard their
French guests as angels vouchsafed by the Virgin as guar-
dians of her flock, while vainly attempting to detect the
mysterious source which shed manna on the wilderness for
their preservation.
But a new subject of interest was about to engross the
mind and heart of Emiline. Scarcely had she recovered her
terror and grief sufficiently to form plans of removal, when
the event to which allusion has been already made, — the
arrival of a courier bearing her a letter from the wife of the
First Consul, to announce the miraculous preservation of
her child,
transported her into a delirium of joy !--
There was less need of the recommendation contained in
Joséphine's epistle that she should set off for Paris without

delay, than for the provident care which had appointed an
official and confidential messenger for her protection, with
orders to defray the expenses of the journey; for Emiline
and Léonie were scarcely more eager for departure than
incapable of surmounting, unassisted, the difficulties of the
route. By some friendly interposition, these were wholly
obliterated. Their progress was marked by that magical ve-
locity which awaits the influence of money and authority ;
and while Madame de St. Florentin was oppressed by emo-
tions too profound to notice the rapturous exclamations of
the elated Léonie, they traversed France in the wonder of
a dream, and were conducted by their courier to the court.
yard of a handsome hotel in the vicinity of the Tuileries.
The agitation of the excited mother had now reached too
agonising a pitch to notice whither they were going, or
utter a single inquiry. She dared not even mention the
name of her child, when she found Monsieur de Rohan
waiting at the foot of the stairs to conduct them into a
suite of spacious but simple apartments. Insensible to all
that was passing round her, she tottered forwards, supported
by his arm and encouraging exhortations, till from the
door of an inner saloon a tall graceful girl, whom she could
scarcely recognise as her infant treasure, rushed to her feet,
- hung round her knees,—and blessed her with the en-
dearing name of “mother !"
In such moments, there stirs in the human heart a sen.
sation too acute for joy. Emiline was conscious only of
suffocation and agony; and it was some time before she
sufficiently resumed her self-possession to fold her two chil-
dren together to her bosom, with a prayer of thanksgiving
to the Almighty hand which had preserved them to its
affections; or to perceive that the scene had other wit.
nesses than Léonie and Achille de Rohan, who were too
much engrossed with each other to be curiously observant.
To one of the females whom she now perceived standing
near her, demonstrating the sincerity of their sympathy
with tears of joy, Emiline needed no introduction. The
simple guise, — the warm motherly smile, — the grey locks
surrounding her reverend face, were those of her own Ma-
delon; - and towards the other, even before little Emiline

whispered the beloved name of Joséphine, the heart of
Madame de St. Florentin beat with an unaccountable in-
terest.
“ Forgive me," whispered the graceful wife of the First
Consul, - forgive me for being selfishly unwilling to de-
prive myself of the gratifying spectacle of your first meet-
ing with our child. No, no!” she continued, turning

But I must have you

happiness of proving to the First Consul how readily they

proscription, to return to France.
Affectionately embracing her little charge, Madame Buo-
naparte hastened to free both child and mother from the
restraint of her presence; and Madelon was also about to
quit the chamber, when Emiline, throwing her arms round
her neck, drew her back to the sofa.
“ Can you forgive me?”-she whispered, tenderly em-
bracing her.
" I once thought not, my own dear child,” faltered
Madame Valazy through her tears. “ But I had not then
heard your voice. — I had not looked on your beloved face,
my more than daughter !”
“ And Camille ?” — hesitated Emiline, as her heart
thrilled with joy on seeing her two dear girls entwined in
each other's arms in sisterly fondness, mingled with the
shy coyness of long estrangement.
“ Ah !” replied Madame Valazy, mournfully waving her
head, and pressing the hands of her foster-child between

CHAPTER XIV.
What wants this knave
That a king should have?
Johnny Armstrong.
MADAME DE St. FLORENTIN had been too intimately
habituated to the purlieus of the courts of kings, to en-
tertain any feeling of awe at the prospect of presentation
in the circle of the Tuileries; and her heart was so filled
with the measureless content of finding in her Emiline
the promise of gifts and endowments beyond even the
sanguine anticipation of a mother's partiality, that she
saw the evening approach without apprehension. With
her eyes fixed on her rescued treasure, - her first-born
restored as from the grave,
she suffered Léonie to arrange
the preparations of her toilet without interference ; and
on, the conclusion of its weighty labours, scarcely per-
mitted herself to cast a glance of gratified' vanity on those
profuse and glossy tresses which had been officiously braided
into the Grecian fashion of the hour.
But her indifference was amply compensated by the en-
thusiasm of Madame de Navelles, who was almost as vain
of her sister as of herself; and quite as vain of herself,
as the infatuated adoration of Rohan could render her.
“ Are we not charming ? ” cried Léonie, as her now
privileged admirer presented himself, to accompany them to
the antechamber of the consular palace.
- Emiline's eyes
are too full of tears to perceive that she is metamorphosed
into an Athenian as fair as Aspasia.”
But Emiline's heart was fuller than her eyes. She did
not even hear the giddy apostrophe of Léonie.
The mere
sound of “ Aux Tuileries !” given as an order to the
coachman, saddened her spirit. The dear ones of her youth
— the loved — the dead — were painfully connected with
that memorable name!

“ Let me dwell only on the mercy of Heaven in pre-
serving my children to my affection,” said she, as the car-
riage entered the fatal court-yard of the château.
She heard not the explanations of consular etiquette
whispered by Rohan. She observed not, on ascending the
grand staircase, how much of regal ceremonial had been
renewed in the household of Buonaparte.
In another minute, Emiline and Léonie were ushered
through the brilliant antechamber, glittering with uniforms
and a splendour of pageantry little accordant with the
simplicity of a republican government, into a saloon, of
which the circle was formed of the wives of the mi.
nisters, — the diplomatic foreign residents, -the imme.
diate family of Napoleon, - and a large assemblage of the
literary luminaries of the day. A place was made for them
by the side of Hortense ; and their attention directed
towards Madame Buonaparte, who was making the tour of
the circle, with a smile and a word of graciousness for every
individual whom the policy of the First Consul rendered
it necessary to conciliate, and a still sweeter glance of in-
telligence for those endeared to her by the tenderness of
private friendship. A general murmur of admiration fol-
lowed the tranquil elegance of her movements; and when,
in the course of her complimentary attentions, she paused
before Madame de St. Florentin and her sister-in-law, and
in terms of formal condescension expressed her satisfaction
in welcoming them to the palace of the consulate, a hun-
dred hearts beat enviously at the distinction.
“ The First Consul is too much fatigued to make his
appearance in this crowd to-night,” whispered Mademoiselle
Beauharnois, addressing Emiline and Léonie, by command
of her mother; “ but I am desired to inform you that he
will have the honour of receiving your presentation in the
private apartments."
This arrangement was welcomed by Madame de St.
Florentin as a happy amendment on the necessity of re-
ceiving the abrupt and perplexing notice of the conqueror
of Italy, under the scrutiny of so extensive an assembly ;
and while following the guidance of Rohan through a
suite of brilliantly, illuminated but unfrequented apart-

ments, she received his congratulations on this mark of
signal favour on the part of the Consul.
The battans of ceremony flew open on the approach of
the two beautiful women ushered by a person so high in
consular favour as Achille de Rohan; and having passed
the anteroom and saloon, they found themselves in the
exquisite retreat of regal luxury, recently restored and
embellished by the elegant taste of Joséphine.
Some half-dozen privileged persons were already as-
sembled to wait the arrival of its tutelary deity; gathered
into a knot, in eager discussion of the scandal of the hour,
in criticism of the costumes which had graced the even-
ing circle, — in recapitulation of the smiles bestowed by
Madame Buonaparte, — and all the thousand less than
nothingnesses which engage the interest and suggest the
manoeuvres and cabals of the little great.
The first person who attracted their attention was the
beautiful Pauline, in conversation with an officer in a
brilliant military uniform, whose back was turned towards
the door.
“Who are these?” inquired Pauline, in a tone of
brusque ill-breeding, better becoming the wife of the re-
publican Leclercq, than the palace of the Tuileries. “ New
favourites from the Caribbean latitudes ?”
“ The daughter and widow of the two last Dukes of
Navelles," replied a voice that penetrated to the inmost
heart of Emiline; and her emotions did not diminish,
when the officer with whom Madame Leclercq had been
conversing, turned towards her with a bow of the most
chilling and deferential reserve, and displayed the coun-
tenance of General Mainville.
“ Navelles, - and emigrants ?” cried Pauline with a
scornful smile. " What are such people doing here?”
Obeying the invitation of General Buonaparte,"
replied Mainville, with a driness of manner which re-
pressed the flippancy of the fair querist ; and he instantly
quitted the room, while Pauline, with the coarseness of
upstart pride, retired into a group of her intimate asso-
ciates to criticise the beauty, and challenge the pretensions

of these unexpected rivals. Emiline found herself en-
during all the humiliation of supercilious feminine scru.
tiny, in a spot where her smile had once been omnipotent,
and her conventional rank a panoply of impunity. She
noticed nothing, however, with so grievous a pang as the
abrupt disappearance of Mainville. He had not even
deigned to remain in the same apartment with one so
abhorrent to his feelings.
No sooner did Madame Buonaparte enter the apartment,
than its petty cabal and their malicious whisperings were
silenced. Lucien and his sisters crowded to tender their
hollow assiduities to a sister-in-law whose wedded life
they embittered with unceasing jealousies ; and when
they perceived the air of cordiality with which Joséphine
advanced towards Madame St. Florentin and Léonie, and
invited them to seats by her side, the sycophants of the
incipient court were as eager to extend their notice to the
new comers, as they had been forward to molest them by
impertinence and hauteur.
After a few minutes, the folding-doors were again thrown
open; and the First Consul was announced in a loud voice
by the page in waiting. But though the female groups
scattered through the apartments distinctly perceived his
entrance, Caroline and Pauline were too intimately ac-
quainted with the habits of their brother, to intrude one
step beyond the limits of familiarity he had traced for the
routine of his daily life at the Tuileries. Napoleon must
be permitted to exhaust all the topics of communication he
might wish to address to Joséphine, before his attention
was claimed by the members of his own family.
On the present occasion, these topics chanced to be of a
very comprehensive character. Napoleon had entered the
room conversing with Bourrienne and Fouché, on the sub-
ject of the sailing of the discovery ships commanded by
Freycinet, which was on the point of taking place; and
with the signal disregard to the courtesies of life he was
apt to display towards women whom he honoured neither
with personal passion nor personal hatred, he compelled
Joséphine to bestow her attention on his diffuse anti-

:
cipations of the wonders to arise from a philosophical
expedition projected under the auspices of the Republic,
before he granted her an opportunity of presenting her
two female companions, who were standing to wait his
pleasure.
Even when he consented to abstract his consideration
from the charts to be submitted to the Capitaine Baudin
and his convoy, he fixed his stern and full-orbed glance on
the graceful and beautiful woman designated by his wife as
“ the mother of our Emiline,” in a manner any thing but
conciliatory or re-assuring. Something between curiosity
and scorn tempered the expression of his countenance.
So long as Buonaparte had limited his attention and dis-
course to the route of Le Géographe, and La Cazuarina,
Emiline regarded him in her turn with a species of
trembling deference, as the man who had dictated terms
to the Vatican, and issued his mandates beneath the shadow
of the Pyramids ! But when, crossing his hands behind
his back, he bent on her countenance that species of over-
bearing scrutiny so graceless when exercised for the inti-
midation of a woman, the spirit of her ancient line invi-
gorated her courage. Elevating her noble figure to its
utmost height, she prepared herself to answer with self-
possession the interrogations of the First Consul.
“ Your name, I understand, has been recently erased
from the list of emigrants, at the request of my wife. Is
it your intention, madam, to reside for the future in the
metropolis of the Republic?” said Buonaparte, scanning
the figure of the marchioness from head to foot.
My little girl, Citoyen Consul, replied Emiline, in a
low, but steady voice, “ would find it a painful trial to
separate herself from her mother by the ties of nature, or
her mother by the ties of gratitude."
“ You were at Milan, I think, when Madame Buona-
parte was resident at Montebello. Had you profited by
the occasion to seek re-instalment in your rights as a ci-
tizen of the French republic, those double ties of maternal
affection would not have remained so long disunited,” was
his stern rejoinder.

“I have to regret my ignorance," said the gracious Jo-
séphine, eager to heal the wounds inflicted by the harsh
abruptness of the First Consul, “ that I had countrywomen
resident at Rezatelli, whom it was so much my interest to
attract to Montebello, by making the first advances to their
friendship. When next we visit Milan," continued Jo-
séphine, in a lower tone, as if apprehensive of being over-
heard by the circle in the adjoining room, “I conclude
that Princess Rezatelli will not refuse us the hospitalities
of her villa, when we perform a pilgrimage to Como ?”
“ Princess Rezatelli, madam, expired a few days. pre-
vious to the contest at Marengo," observed Emiline in
some surprise.
Nay! I alluded to the future bride of the new go-
vernor of the capital of the Cisalpine Republic,” retorted
Joséphine with a smile.
“ To yourself !” said Napoleon, sternly, who had no
leisure to waste on the circumlocution of superfluous de-
licacy.
“ The hospitalities of Villa Rezatelli will doubtless be
humbly devoted to the acceptance of the First Consul and
his representatives," replied Emiline, mildly. < But for
- I have not — I can never have, either interest or
authority in their distribution. Since you deign, madam,
to interest your attention in the fortunes of so obscure an
individual, suffer me to declare that I have no longer a
heart or hand with which to requite the friendly protec-
tion of a man so respectable, but so perfectly indifferent
to my feelings, as Prince Rezatelli.”
The blood rushed to the face, neck, and arms of Madame
de St. Florentin as this painful avowal was forced from
her; and so absorbing was her emotion that she did not
perceive Joséphine gliding away from the ottoman by
which they were standing, and beckoning some person
from the group in the adjoining chamber.
“ I must address myself to this lady for an explanation
of the enigma,” said the Consul, turning towards Madame
de Navelles, whose simplicity of air and feature captivated
his attention.
“ Permit me to beg that you will require it from my-
me

self,” said Emiline, striving to resume her composure.
“ However humiliating the confession, I am bound to
acknowledge myself the rejected and offending wife of
one whose name I trust to your courtesy to pass over with-
out inquiry."
“No, madam," said the First Consul, softening in his
manner towards her, on perceiving her changeful colour
and tremulous voice, “ I cannot pass over a fact mo-
mentous to the happiness of a justly-valued friend. If

Spare me this trial!” cried Emiline, with streaming
eyes and clasped hands. “ I beseech you spare me the humi-
liation of claiming a connexion disavowed by his just re-
sentment !"
“ Emiline,
my own, - my wife !” cried Mainville,
who was already at her feet. And he seized her unre-
sisting hands, while the First Consul took a protracted
pinch of snuff, and Emiline replied by bending over him
and concealing her tears upon his shoulder.
“ Rise, Mainville !” said Buonaparte, who was not
particularly indulgent to exhibitions of sensibility. “As the
oldest of your friends, I claim a priority for my congratu-
lations. Make haste, madam," said he, taking the hand
of Emiline and placing it in that of her lover,
"s make
haste to celebrate your second nuptials, for the Republic
cannot long spare the services of one of the best and bravest
of her sons.
Gentlemen !” he exclaimed to Victor, Ber-
thier, Murat, Fouché, and Bourrienne, who now, at the
summons of Joséphine, displayed their group of brilliant
uniforms in the back ground. “ Caroline, Pauline !--I
claim your friendship and congratulations for the distin-
guished bride of my friend, General Mainville, -relying
upon you to assist Madame Buonaparte in rendering the
circle of the Tuileries attractive to them both."
Fortunately for the embarrassment of Emiline, the
announcement of the evening collation withdrew the general
attention from her tears, as well as from the triumphant
delight with which they were pointed out by Léonie to
Achille de Rohan.
History records, however, that they were the last she

had occasion to shed on Camille's account; for throughout
the annals of the imperial court of the Tuileries we find
no brighter example of conjugal happiness than that afforded
by Field Marshal and the Princesse de or as they
were known in less auspicious times, by Emiline and the
