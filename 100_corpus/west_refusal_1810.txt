CHAPTER I. 
 
 His virtues walk'd their narrow round, 
 Obscurely wise and coarsely kind. 
 
 Johnson. 
 
 Emily Mandeville was nineteen years of age 
 when, in the spring of 1778, she exchanged the 
 gloomv solitude of Lime Grove for the magnificent 
 abode of her ancestors, situated in a romantic part of 
 Devonshire. It was at this time the residence of her 
 uncle, Sir Walter Mandeville, the last male heir of an 
 ancient family, in whose person the entail expired. 
 Sir Walter had entered the army in early life, this 
 being one of the common destinations of a younger 
 brother, and had soon become so attached to his pro- 
 fession as to form no wish for such a permanent con- 
 nection with the fair sex as would detach his thoughts 
 from the duties of a soldier* Possibly the scanty pro- 
 vision of a younger brother, and the circumstance that 
 Sir James was married, and had a family, might tend 
 to preserve him from those violent attacks of wealth and 
 beauty which are so generally irresistible. Certain tt is, 
 Colonel Mandeville was suffered to acquire a sort of a 
 misanthropic opinion of the ladies, till, on the death of 
 his nephew, a promising youth of sixteen, he became 
 Sir Walter.' He now, for the first time in his life, re- 
 gretted that his days had been spent in celibacy, since 
 it consigned the name of Mandeville to oblivion, and 
 left himself and a young female orphan the sole inhe- 
 ritors of the blood of that illustrious family. He re- 
 collected that his brother, Sir James, on his deathbed, 
 had appointed him guardian to both his children; but 
 whilst young Sir George lived, Emily was too insignifi- 
 cant to attract so much of his attention as to induce 
 him to remove her from the care of her maternal aunt.

 Lady Selina Delamore, though he believed that lady 
 to be a most odious character, and was convinced she 
 would quite pervert her niece's disposition. 
 
 Sir Walter Mandeville was turned of sixty, when 
 the demise of the young baronet first introduced him 
 to the possession of uncontrolled power, and superflu- 
 ous wealth, for the disposal of which no human tribunal 
 could call him to account. He had lived neglected 
 and dependent till the heyday of life was passed. The 
 treatment he had endured gave him a dislike for his 
 species, and it was not removed by observing that, 
 though the poor soldier had been overlooked and de- 
 spised, the wealthy baronet was courted and flattered. 
 He could not believe himself suddenly transformed 
 from something below mediocrity in talent to a gen- 
 tleman of most respectable understanding ; and though 
 the stories which he had told when ensign, without 
 discomposing one countenance, now excited thunders 
 of applause, he had the discernment to perceive, and 
 the humility to acknowledge, that this tribute was paid 
 to his rank, not to himself; and that he certainly was 
 a worse jester now than he had been forty years be- 
 fore. Fortune, therefore; had a very different effect 
 upon his sincere, blunt character, to what she usually 
 exerts, by making him more out of humour with the 
 world, and dissatisfied with himself; and but for his 
 strong attachment to that best part of his species, the 
 lire of Mandeville, his contempt of sycophants^ and 
 his pity of stupid old fellows who are placed in situa- 
 tions where they do nothing but expose themselves, 
 would have induced him to surrender his patrimony 
 to his sovereign, with a request that it might be placed 
 in better hands. 
 
 Actuated by family pride, without one iota of what 
 was personal, Sir Walter felt it his duty to keep up the 
 Mandeville dignity. He had public days, and presided 
 at his table, sullen through pique, and awkward from 
 a consciousness of inferiority. He distributed charity 
 with a sort of snarling benevolence, and joined in 
 those rural sports for which he had an aversion, and

 found inconvenient to his personal infirmities, because 
 the Mandevilles were all very bountiful, and kept fox- 
 hounds. With a strong, and sometimes acknowledg- 
 ed, regret for those happy days, when, as an old half- 
 pay officer, he could stroll about master of his own 
 actions, or sun himself upon a bench in martial conver- 
 sation with some other veterans, as Homer describes 
 his Trojan counsellors, he consented to be steward of 
 the assemblies ; and with a persuasion that women 
 were a greater plague than any Pandora carried in her 
 box, he sought out partners for the tittering misses, 
 who suppressed their ridicule of the old beau in his 
 presence only from the hope that he would make them 
 an offer. Indeed, Sir Walter's attachment to his fa- 
 mily soon made all the prudent matrons in the neigh- 
 bourhood point him out as a marrying man; and he 
 often pondered in secret on the eligibility of resigning 
 the comforts of singleness for the chance of giving a 
 legal heir to an ancient and expiring race of worthies. 
 Whoever considers, that though Sir Walter's temper 
 was in a continual state of irritation, he comprized 
 every earthly blessing in the term bachelor, will truly 
 estimate the nobleness of mind which could induce 
 one of the most inveterate of the Benedict order to 
 meditate such a sacrifice. Certainly, his person did 
 not announce a very eligible votary of Hymen. H's 
 features, naturally hard, were bronzed by many a cam- 
 paign in tropical regions ; he had lost one eye at the 
 taking of the Havannah ; and a musket ball had lodged 
 in his shoulder, which brought on infirmities that com- 
 pelled him to quit the service, ^e had too much of 
 the veteran in his character to ascribe to himself ima- 
 ginary graces, and he never contemplated his figure 
 without lamenting the fallen state of his family. 
 
 I have hinted, that his opinion of the fair sex did 
 
 i not tend to expedite the design of devoting his future 
 
 days to their society. In common with men who have 
 
 been more accustomed to coarse and depraved, than to 
 
 ! refined and amiable women, he viewed them as har- 
 
 ^pies, who spoiled every social comfort, rather than

 Halcyones brooding over the nest of domestic felicity ; 
 and he more especially dressed marriage in those hues 
 v.'hen uxorious infirmity was unequally yoked to reluc- 
 tant levity. He shuddered at the idea of being what 
 he called dandled about by some disguised shrew, or 
 cozening demirep, who submitted to his ill humours 
 for the sake of spending his fortune, of being called 
 Lady Mandeville, and of the reversionary hope of a 
 large jointure. Some few, indeed, of his old compa- 
 nions had bound their grey and scattered locks with 
 Hymen's roses, and were become in their own opinions 
 happy husbands ; but then Sir Walter thought very 
 meanly of their understandings, and cordially sub- 
 scribed to the opinion of those who traced every evil 
 under the sun to female origin. So rigidly did he ad- 
 here to this school of metaphysics, that, exclusively of 
 the glorious scars of honour which he deemed orna- 
 mental, there was not a defect in his frame, or a mis- 
 fortune in his life, that he did not derive from women. 
 He traced his asthmatic attacks to his great-grandmo- 
 ther who died of that disease ; his mother's family be- 
 queathed him the gout ; an aunt humoured him in his 
 indolence till he became'an invincible blockhead ; his 
 sister-in-law made a mere Jerry of her husband, in- 
 jured his fortune, and spoiled Mandeville castle by 
 putting in new furniture, and making what she called 
 improvements ; and lastly, his nephew lost his life by 
 overheating himself with dancing at Exeter races, with 
 a girl who wanted to entrap the poor boy for her hus- 
 band. These reflections were concluded with a lamen- 
 tation, that though women were jilts the world could 
 not go on without them. 
 
 Whilst balancing the miseries of his intended mar- 
 riage against the supposed duty of contracting such an 
 engagement, he suddenly recollected, that he might 
 sacrifice his peace of mind and freedom without se- 
 curing the perpetuity of his family : he might have no 
 children, or only daughters. In the latter case, how- 
 ever, it would be possible, as he had great parliamen- 
 tary influence, to have the name and title restored in

 the son of one of these unborn heiresses. Sir Walter 
 was not accustomed to make any very bright discove- 
 ries, but while pursuing this train of thought, he found 
 it to be somewhat improbable that he should live to see 
 his grandsons, and a little while after it struck him, 
 that since the estate was now entirely at his own dis- 
 posal he might as well give it to his brother's daugh- 
 ter as to his own; and as Emily was now marriageable 
 he had a chance of seeing half Mandevilles spring 
 from net stock. Every time he pondered on this 
 scheme it appeared more eligible, and he began to 
 wish to get acquainted with one who was even now his 
 presumptive heiress. If he invited her to come to see 
 him, he could send her away when he found her 
 troublesome, an advantage a wife would not bring with 
 her. Besides, he should not be bound to her for life, 
 for the heiress of the Delamores and Mandevilles would 
 be sure to find a husband enterprising enough to re- 
 lieve him from the arduous task of trying to keep a 
 great fortune out of mischief. 
 
 But Sir Walter was doomed by fate to be involved in 
 difficulties, especially in his dealings with ladies. 
 Common civility required that he should extend his 
 invitation to the maiden aunt with whom she had re- 
 sided since the death of both her parents. The senti- 
 ments which resolute bachelors entertain toward our 
 sisterhood, resemble the amity of cats and dogs, and 
 I am afraid that the aversion is quite as reciprocal, 
 though every one must allow the provocation is on our 
 side. Sir Walter felt more than the common animosity 
 of a belligerent to Lady Selina. All his little world 
 spoke ill of her. He knew that she had behaved very 
 badly in early life, and she was sister to Lady Hono- 
 ria Mandeville, for whom he had a violent antipathy, 
 though he had never seen her but once. His reasons 
 for this hatred were, that she governed her husband, 
 shewed some contempt for the family heir-looms, in- 
 jured the estate, and produced but one son. How was 
 he to endure, even for a few months, the torment of be- 
 ing circumscribed in his own castle by an old maid, who

 according to the nature of things, must be whimsical 
 and contradictious. He loved early hours, he detest- 
 ed books, except the Memoirs of Marshal Saxe, and 
 the Campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough ; his in- 
 firmities required hot rooms, and his chief delight was 
 backgammon. Now, he was pre-assm*ed, Lady Seli- 
 na would not touch her dinner till he wanted to go to 
 bed, that she required as constant a supply of air as a 
 windmill, walked about with a Greek Lexicon in her 
 hand, and fell into hysterics at the sound of the dice 
 box. There would be one way of escaping her ; he 
 could let the castle, take lodgings at Bath, put up a 
 tent bed in a closet for Emily, (if he found the aunt 
 had not spoiled her) and then apologize to Lady Seli- 
 na for want of room and ill health, which prevented 
 him from any longer enjoying her company. After 
 various determinations, he at last dispatched the follow- 
 ing letter to Lime Grove. 
 
 " Dear niece, 
 
 I condole with you very heartily on poor George's 
 death. He was a fine young man, and would have 
 been a credit to the family, which is very poorly re- 
 presented now. Had he lived, I should not have been 
 so much concerned about you, for managing this estate 
 is quite affliction enough for me, and more than I can 
 well bear, never having been used to business. Be- 
 sides, I am old and infirm, .and that makes me peevish. 
 But if you think a visit to me will be any treat to you, 
 I shall be glad of your company for a few months, 
 though I have never seen you since you were christen- 
 ed, when I stood god-father. I had promised to do 
 so, expecting you would have been a boy, so I could 
 not well get off. 
 
 Give my best respects to Lady Selina Delamore, and 
 thank her for all the trouble she has had with you ; I dare 
 say it has been a great deal. I hope she has not per- 
 mitted you to get any odd ways, or taught you to be 
 disagreeable. I should have been glad to see her la- 
 dyship with you, but my old castle is so much out of re-

 pair, I have but one comfortable room to live in, and 
 we have no card assemblies in the neighbourhood. Be- 
 sides, it always disagreed with vour mother, who said 
 she caught her death here. Had poor George lived, 
 most likely he would have rebuilt it, but it will do well 
 enough tor me, as I am the last of the Mandevilles. 
 So we shall all go to ruin together. I suppose you will 
 soon pick up a husband, as your fortune is too large 
 for any woman, even if I don't leave you mine ; the 
 more is the pitv. However, it is our duty to submit, 
 and make the best defence we can, when the campaign 
 goes against us. 
 
 I remain 
 
 Your affectionate uncle, 
 
 Walter Mandeville." 
 
 Among the few comforts which Lady Selina enjoy- 
 ed, the society of young Emily held a distinguished 
 pre-eminence. It reconciled her to life, at a time 
 when the world appeared a disgusting void, and the 
 task of informing her niece's mind and modelling her 
 manners, greatly tended to dissipate a melancholy, 
 which, as no one could clearly explain its cause, was 
 charitably ascribed to a splenetic disposition. But 
 though an old maid, and confessedly an unhappy one, 
 Lady Selina was not so entirely self-devoted as to re- 
 strain Emily from accepting her guardian's invitation. 
 On the contrary, she rejoiced that he seemed at length 
 inclined to execute the duties of his office ; and though 
 from having once lived in the World, she well knew 
 that happiness does not always ride about in a vis-a-vis 
 with affluence, she was not displeased to find Sir Wal- 
 ter least thought it possible that Emily might eventual- 
 ly prove the heiress of the Mandeville, as she already 
 was of the Delamore family. She had long foreseen 
 her separation from her amiable charge. Lime Grove, 
 although well adapted for the purposes of a nursery 
 and a school, was an improper residence for a young- 
 lady of high expectations; and she was endeavouring 
 to subdue her own reluctance to appear again in the

 world, which the sudden death of Sir George Mande- 
 ville opened such vast views to her niece, that she felt 
 bewildered in what manner to act, or how to secure 
 her from those disadvantages which might result from 
 an introduction under her own immediate auspices. 
 While she was thus perplexed as to the mode of pro- 
 ceeding she should adopt, Emily's age convincing her 
 that no more time must be lost, they received Sir Wal- 
 ter's letter. The propriety of restoring the young la- 
 dy to her father's family, was indisputable. 'Tis true, 
 he only invited her for a short time, and she had heard 
 too much of his singularities, to suppose that the un- 
 cle and niece would become so much attached as to 
 deprive her forever of the society of her adopted 
 daughter; but there were great advantages annexed 
 to this transitory emigration from Lime Grove, as it 
 would be the means of introducing her to society, to 
 which in every form she was yet a stranger. As to 
 herself, the summer was approaching, the severe in- 
 firmities from which she had so long suffered, general- 
 ly relaxed their fury at that season, when, though she 
 could not be said to enjoy health, pain yielded to the 
 softer term indisposition. Her garden afforded her 
 great amusement, and a few charitable institutions 
 which she had formed in the village, satisfactorily 
 employed her time and thoughts. She fancied she 
 could live without Emily, at least she knew it to be a 
 duty to endeavour to do so : and after giving her let- 
 ters of introduction to the few ladies whom she knew 
 in the vicinity of Mandeville Castle, the fair Emily 
 was dismissed with many a blessing, and a few ill- 
 concealed tears, on what proved an eventful expedi- 
 tion. 
 
 Certainly there appeared nothing very reprehensible 
 in this part of Lady Selina's conduct ; but as morose 
 ill-principled people will occasionally act in a credita- 
 ble manner, and as one part of the moral which I 
 mean to enforce is, the folly and danger of drawing- 
 hasty conclusions, I still intreat my readers to suspend 
 .their opinions of this mysterious recluse. I have ac-

 knowleclged that melancholy threw a pensive shade 
 over her character, and does not this circumstance 
 alone, of her being unhappy, intimate that she had 
 been criminal ? I leave this question to be discussed 
 by those writers, who, in describing the lot of inno- 
 cence, seem to consider calamity as no longer one of 
 , the trials that virtue is doomed to undergo in this pro- 
 bationary state. Among the oblations which we daily 
 offer to the god Prosperity, we now sacrifice the repu- 
 tations of the miserable, and we not only say with 
 Young, 
 
 " Look into those we call unfortunate, 
 
 And closer view'd, we find they were unwise," 
 
 — but with Pope's dealer in judgments, we often so 
 far misapply the doctrine of a particular Providence, 
 as to believe " the nodding temple is suspended, to 
 crush the head of Chartres." 
 
 When youth is uncontaminated by affectation or 
 duplicity, its feelings are always acute. Emily thought, 
 as the carriage drove from Lime Grove, that she and 
 happiness had bidden adieu till they should be again 
 restored to each other in the society of her dear aunt, 
 in the little cedar parlour. At this moment, she for- 
 got that she had ever felt the sameness of their unva- 
 ried days ; that she had wished to see a little more of 
 life than their neighbouring market-town afforded, or 
 was supplied by the rector and apothecary, and two 
 Dr three quiet country neighbours, to modernize her 
 vunt's antiquated description of her own times. Like 
 Dther girls of her age, she next wished, that as she was 
 separated from her dear and only friend, the horses 
 lad taken the road to London ; but her sorrow in leav- 
 ng Lady Selina, was at last absorbed by painful con- 
 ectures respecting the manner in which she should 
 ■pend her time among strangers, and in a sumptuous 
 tyle of living to which she was quite unaccustomed. 
 She had gained a few particulars of her guardian's 
 paracter from her brother ; his own letter confirmed

 the impression of singularity ; and Lady Selina's part- 
 ing precepts, conjuring her to be assiduously attentive, 
 seemed to intimate that the task was difficult. She had 
 hitherto pleased every body, but it was without any 
 studied effort, and she greatly feared that her powers 
 of fascination were not so inherent as to exempt her 
 from the awkwardness of forced exertion. Again she 
 wished the summer over, and as her aunt had hinted 
 that her introduction to the great world must take 
 place the ensuing winter, her anticipation of the un- 
 known delights of London made her still more indif- 
 ferent to catch the first glance of the turrets of Man- 
 deville castle.

 High rising- in baronial pride, 
 
 Near a swift river deep and wide, 
 
 With battlements and turrets crown'd,

 Grey were its mossy walls, jet time

 And the arch'd gate and stately tower,

 WHEN Emily's carriage had passed the avenue 
 
 leading to the castle, the decriped owner, dressed in 
 
 his Kevenhuller hat and scarlet roquelaure, advanced 
 
 to the porter's ward to meet his trembling visitor. He

 was too delicate to permit her to undertake a long 
 journey, he pressed Emily's hand affectionately, told 
 her she was a good girl to come by herself, and led 
 her through a double line of servants dressed in state 
 liveries, to a spacious, but ill-furnished saloon. Here 
 he presented her to a lady clad in the deepest sables, 
 whom he announced by the name of Lady Mackin- 
 tosh, of Dunswood, by whose discreet conduct and 
 amiable manners, he wished Emily to form her own 
 behaviour. Though the young lady did not remem- 
 ber this name among the number of those with whom 
 her aunt wished her to be intimate ; the presence of a 
 female companion was a wonderful relief to her mind, 
 and she returned her ladyship's embrace with a warmth 
 almost equally affectionate j but she found herself very 
 deficient in volubility when she attempted to express, 
 with the same rapture as Lady Mackintosh had evinc- 
 ed, the ecstacy she felt at this interview, and her con- 
 viction that it was the commencement of a permanent 
 friendship. 
 
 When- dinner was announced, Sir Walter, with a 
 ceremonious bow, led his niece to the head of the ta- 
 ble, and desired her to consider herself as mistress of 
 the mansion, while she honoured it with her residence. 
 A transient cloud passed over Lady Mackintosh's face 
 during this address, and on their return to the saloon, 
 she redoubled her efforts to conciliate Emily's esteem. 
 She at first made a slight inquiry after Lady Selina, 
 but finding it answered in a tone of the warmest affec- 
 tion and gratitude, she grew lavish in her praises. — 
 " I was but a child," said she, " when I saw her at 
 Mandeville castle. Beauty and grace were blended 
 in her person, and her manners were so very captivat- 
 ing, that I protest I never saw her equal. She had 
 the goodness to shew me her wadding clothes ; such 
 taste and magnificence ! How often did I wish that 
 I had been Lady Selina Delamore! Poor soul, and 
 to think how it all ended ! I suppose you know the 
 full particulars ?"

 Emily protested that she was utterly ignorant of her 
 aunt's early history. " Astonishing !" returned Lady 
 Mackintosh, " but she really is the most singular wo- 
 man I know, singularly discreet I mean ; and indeed, 
 my dear little Emily, you are very like her. Such 
 prudence at your age is wonderful. But I hope you 
 will repay your uncle's kindness by fixing at Mande- 
 ville castle. How I shall exult in acting as chaperon 
 to so much beauty and virtue." 
 
 She then proceeded to exculpate herself from what 
 Emily's unsuspicious mind had not discovered to be an 
 impropriety, I mean her own intimacy with Sir Wal- 
 ter. Rivers of tears ran down her cheeks while she 
 described the warm friendship that had subsisted be- 
 tween Sir Walter and her ever-beloved, her ever-la- 
 mented husband. " Sir Jeremiah," said she in plain- 
 tive accents, " bequeathed me to the care of his se- 
 cond self, and since that event which I cannot name, 
 Sir Walter Mandeville is the only gentleman whose 
 society I can support. My heart is wedded to the 
 ; ashes of my lamented partner ; and if the sweet at- 
 tractions of your ingenuous manners should draw mc 
 frequently to Mandeville castle, let not your prudence 
 suspect that any sinister design harbours in this sad 
 bosom. But I forget, you know not my historv and 
 the noble frankness of your countenance invites my 
 confidence." 
 
 The history of Lady Mackintosh would have con- 
 tained nothing extraordinary, had it not been for the 
 style in which she adorned it. She was born a beauty, 
 with small fortune, attracted more lovers than offers of 
 i marriage, and, when the roses of youth had faded, se- 
 cured herself a small jointure by becoming the filth 
 wife of Sir Jeremiah Mackintosh, and mother-in-law 
 i to four sets of children. To the happiness of this con- 
 nection, her flowing crape and streaming tears now 
 bore witness ; and she protested her frequent visits to 
 Mandeville castle had no other motive than to con- 
 verse about the dear man with one who knew all his 
 fA-irtues, or to implore the counsel and protection of Sir

 Walter for a poor woman who had now lost her only 
 friend. 
 
 Though Emily had seen nothing of the world, all 
 the ingenuousness of innocents could not prevent her 
 from perceiving that her uncle's attentions were pecu- 
 liarly grateful to this lady, and that, on his side, they 
 much exceeded the strained politeness which the habits 
 of military gallantry usually extorted from this pro- 
 iessed woman hater. In truth, Sir Walter had hitherto 
 considered the fair widow as the only exception to fe- 
 male craft and female folly, which the experience of 
 sixty years, and a residence in many different countries, 
 had supplied ; and when he pondered on the dire ne- 
 cessity of contracting a matrimonial alliance, he some- 
 times regretted that Lady Mackintosh was too incon- 
 solable to allow him a hope of success, and too old to 
 produce him a son. Indeed, he could scarcely think it 
 right to attempt the subversion of the virtue he re- 
 vered, for his admiration of her was founded on the 
 deep affliction with which the loss of her husband ap- 
 peared to overwhelm her. This regret he considered 
 the more generous, from" having been often called upon 
 to arbitrate between them, when their disputes ex- 
 ceeded that sort of quiet bickering and well-bred sar- 
 casm, which is thought very wholesome in the married 
 state. Here, however, the case was different to what 
 he found it in other families, the lady was always 
 right; and after proving herself to be so, by her sub- 
 mission to the domination of an obstinate wayward 
 husband, she made even Sir Walter regret, that the 
 only woman who knew how to govern a family was 
 pushed into the back ground by a surly Petruchio 
 ir.i.ch below her in talents. I do not mean to refer 
 this whimsical decision to the god of love. When Cu- 
 pid is fast asleep Caprice often steals his arrows, and 
 c xeroises pertinacious veterans, and designing adven- 
 turers, in a ridiculous game of archery. If the reader 
 will not believe that a desire of talking of dead Sir Je- 
 remiah, or a love for the living Emily, occasioned 
 Lady Mackintosh to be a constant guest at the castle

 of Sir Walter, they must try to account for her con- 
 duct from the circumstance of her having a small 
 jointure and a great soul. Like many other ladies, 
 she discovered that she was fit to move in an exalted 
 sphere, and knowing she was capable of spending eight 
 thousand a year, who could condemn her for wishing 
 to obtain the means ? Scheming ladies, like skilfull ge- 
 1 nerals, are anxious to carry on their operations remote 
 from the observation of the hostile party. Lady 
 Mackintosh had opposed the introduction of Miss 
 Mandeville to the castle, with a steadiness that almost 
 shook Sir Walter's opinion of her extreme pliability, 
 but no sooner was the young lady arrived than, with 
 the most graceful versatility, she veered into a positive 
 conviction of the propriety of her residing with her 
 uncle, and was all gratitude and transport at the ac- 
 quisition of such a companion. One reason for this 
 alteration was her perceiving, that suspicion was not a 
 •predominant feature in the character of her young 
 1 friend ; who was so little inclined to draw uncandid 
 conclusions that the blooming widow often carried on 
 her lines of circumvallation in the presence of the ex- 
 pectant niece, without stimulating her to undertake 
 the relief of the beleagured fort. Indeed, Emily had 
 all that sovereign contempt of wealth, arid that abhor- 
 rence of mercenary motives, which exist in those who 
 have never found their enjoyments circumscribed by 
 the want of means to procure them. She was the in- 
 heritrix of all her grandfather Lord Montolieu's for- 
 tune, except a small annuity settled upon her aunt Seli- 
 na ; yet, with that perfect ignorance of the value of 
 money, and disregard of self, which, when annexed to 
 a good heart and a sound judgment, often ripen into 
 true liberality, she never troubled herself to inquire 
 how many thousands were inscribed upon her rent- 
 -oll. She was only anxious to_ be of age, that she 
 might make a splendid addition to the scanty incomev 
 of her dearest friend. She however once ranked the 
 possibility of being Sir Walter's heiress among the 
 ^.igreeable contingencies of her future life, nor, while

 she felt the inconveniences attached to the immense 
 damp rooms and stone galleries in the castle, did she 
 lay any plan for its future improvement. Had she 
 even been assured that all the widows and spinsters in 
 the kingdom were assembled in full council, to debate 
 on the expediency of attacking this same redoubtable 
 fortress, and had actually named formidable generals 
 to head the design, such was her opinion of the imprac- 
 ticability and folly of the attempt that she would have 
 remained quiet ; careless of the event, except as it 
 might affect the happiness of her guardian. 
 
 But though Miss Mandeville was thus, may I not 
 say nobly, indifferent to the artifices of others, and in- 
 capable of practising any herself, there was an engag- 
 ing frankness and gentle tenderness in her manners 
 and temper which soon insinuated into Sir Walter's 
 good graces, maugre all the resistance of spleen ,and 
 prejudice, or even the more dangerous commendations 
 of Lady Mackintosh, could oppose. Emily sincerely 
 valued her uncle's good qualities, and she pitied with 
 equal sincerity the disadvantages and infirmities which 
 fostered his caprices. Thus an internal feeling go- 
 verning her expressions and looks, the former were 
 always affectionate and the latter attentive. True, she 
 never reached the hyperbolical praise which Lady 
 Mackintosh liberally bestowed : but if she never was 
 officiously solicitous, she never was negligent ; and so 
 powerful is the charm of calm, uniform, patient ten- 
 derness, to those who have never experienced any thing 
 but the cold servility of mercenary attendance, or the 
 wily cant of flattery, that Sir Walter very soon laid all 
 his matrimonial schemes aside, and declared his gentle 
 r.iece the heiress of his fortunes. In a few months, he 
 found her accommodating temper, and anticipating at- 
 tentions, so necessary to his infirm frame, that instead 
 of being anxious to' rid himself of so troublesome a 
 tharge as he had imagined a girl in the bloom of 
 youth must prove to a worn out soldier, totally igno- 
 rant of female wiles, his wish was to die in her arms. 
 And he determined, that residence in Mandeville Cas*

 tie should be the first condition he would require of the 
 man whom he entrusted with so great a treasure as he 
 unexpectedly discovered his dear little niece really 
 was. Tis true, he still thought female mischievous- 
 ness should not only be circumscribed within the pale 
 of wedlock, but be absolutely submitted to the rule of 
 man. But general rules bend to particular occasions, 
 and with such bright examples as Emily and Lady 
 Mackintosh to enlighten his understanding, it is no 
 wonder that he wished his niece's future consort would 
 sometimes allow her to have her own way, as in that 
 case he was sure she would be good to him. 
 
 Thus, without any extraordinary endowments of na- 
 ture, or any borrowed aids from art, the simplicity 
 and affectionate sweetness of Miss Mandeville re- 
 stored her uncle to his natural self, and from a peevish 
 misanthrope, whose very benevolence and mean opi- 
 nion of himself made him unhappy, and prepossessed 
 him with the idea that he was a useless blank in the 
 creation, the jest of wise men and the prey of knaves, 
 the single circumstance of his having excited an inte- 
 rest in one grateful heart reconciled him to himself 
 and the world. " I only did my duty," said he, " in 
 sending for my brother's orphan girl, and see what a 
 blessing she is to me. My fortune was her's by right, 
 and she is as thankful to me for saving she shall have 
 it as if she were a charity girl. No, no, Emily is no 
 cheat ; in my last fit of the asthma, when they thought 
 me insensible and dying, I heard all that passed. Lady 
 Mackintosh asked if I had made a will, and to be sure 
 that was very considerate and good in her ladyship ; 
 but I never shall forget how Emily sobbed over me, 
 and said her dear, dear uncle was gone for ever." 
 
 The few months for which Emily was invited to 
 Castle Mandeville were passed, and Lady Selina be- 
 gan to remind her niece that she ought not to press 
 upon her uncle's hospitality. But Sir Walter's reluct- 
 ance to part with his young companion had increased to 
 such a height, that he privately sent that lady word that 
 he would not give up his fair ward. When he had the

 gout no one placed his footstool in so happy a position, 
 or roasted the orange for his night potion with such 
 adroitness. . Her simple plaintive songs often charmed 
 away both pain and peevishness, and he discovered 
 that since she had presided at his table the conversa- 
 tion improved, and the guests seemed happier, though 
 he displayed less state, and they drank less wine. In, 
 some few instances, he had not his own way so much 
 as before Emily's arrival, but he almost thought the 
 alterations she had imperceptibly introduced were im- 
 provements, and so happy did he find himself with 
 his lovely niece in the reciprocal exercise of acquies- 
 cence and indulgence, that he began to suspect nature 
 had really designed him for the fond husband and the 
 tender father, and that his apparent moroseness was 
 but the accidental incrustation of a benevolent heart, 
 petrified at not having its own susceptibility met with 
 equal warmth and frankness. But while he solaced 
 himself with the thought, that without doing any ridi- 
 culous action in his old age, or compromising his liber- 
 ty or his < reputation, he had secured the society and 
 affection of a sweet young woman, he never allowed 
 himself to think of the deprivation Lady Selina must 
 endure, who had reared the rose he now cherished on 
 his bosom, and was compelled to surrender it when it 
 became most valuable. His aversion to this lady still 
 continued, and he considered Emily's virtues and 
 graces as inherent qualities derived from the Mande- 
 ville blood, which her bad example could not annihi- 
 late. He onlv allowed this affectionate aunt the nega- 
 tive praise of having made Emily's temper so sweet 
 and compliant by the early trials to which she subjected 
 it. Gratitude to her uncle for his affection and libera- 
 lity induced Emily, with some reluctance, to inform 
 her aunt, that she could not resist his wish to stay with 
 him a little longer, that she really felt contented, and 
 should be quite happy if she could hear her dear ma- 
 ternal guardian had found some substitute for her so- 
 ciety during the long dull evenings which were now 
 approaching. If she could spend this one winter with-

 out her, she hoped in spring to find a little cottage 
 near them, and that her aunt would permit herself to 
 be removed from her cold gloomy habitation to the 
 warm air and pleasant society of Devonshire. She 
 also pledged her own reputation for veracity, that 
 (whatever odd tales they had mutually heard of each 
 other) she and Sir Walter would be the best of friends 
 in a fortnight after they should become personally ac- 
 quainted. 
 
 Anxious to acquit my sisterhood of the charge of 
 selfishness, so strongly urged against them by bashaw 
 Benedicts, I must observe, that Lady Selina in her an- 
 swer spoke largely of her o"-vn comforts and improved 
 health. She rejoiced in the partiality of Sir Walter 
 for Emily, and in her own satisfaction in his protec- 
 tion ; and reminded her that she was now residing with 
 her natural guardian, to whom her father had trans- 
 
 I ferred his claim of duty. Without absolutely rejecting 
 the plan of her own removal, she spoke of it as pro- 
 blematical, and concluded with saying, that instead of 
 
 i regarding him with prejudice, she felt warm admira- 
 tion for Sir Walter. 
 
 This business being adjusted, the winter amuse- 
 ments of Mandeville Castle commenced, and as the 
 state of the roads, and the migrations of the inhabi- 
 tants to London, allowed a less frequent routine of vi- 
 sits, back-gammon and reading took a larger share. 
 The latter (except when Sir Walter was absent) was 
 entirely limited to military studies; and as every re- 
 corded siege or battle brought to the baronet's mind 
 some similar incident in his own campaigns, and en- 
 gaged him in a long detail of the corresponding cir- 
 cumstances under which he had seen fields lust or won, 
 Emily perceived that there was little prospect of finish- 
 ing the thick folio which contained the triumphs of the 
 great Duke of Marlborough, and lamented her want of 
 relish for what was likely to prove a lasting entertain- 
 ment. She had made herself complete mistress of back- 
 
 i gammon, but Lady Mackintosh was infinitely the better 
 
 ^commander, and could talk about ravelins, bastions.

 and counterscarps, and the method of drawing an ene- 
 my into an enfilade, marshalling an army, storming a 
 fort, and covering a retreat, with a precision which in- 
 creased Sir Walter's admiration of her vast abilities. 
 To say the truth, Lady Mackintosh was inclined to 
 exercise her generalship upon poor Emily, who feeling 
 a desire not to appear ignorant of what her uncle 
 thought essential knowledge, sometimes attempted to 
 quote Marshal Saxe, or to describe the battles of Cae- 
 sar and Xenophon, but she knew so little about draw- 
 ing up her forces that she fell into the first ambuscade 
 her antagonist prepared for her, and lost the battle, at 
 the instant she was describing how it was won. The 
 good natured Sir Walter, often endeavoured to check 
 her ladyship's laugh of triumph, with a " Pho, pho, 
 well the child was mistaken ;" but her unaptness to 
 comprehend a science in which he condescended to be 
 her instructor, would soon have lowered his opinion of 
 his young pupil's understanding, had it not been for 
 one circumstance which is of importance to my narra- 
 tive. 
 
 I have premised, that "these military studies were il. 
 lustrated by anecdotes, chiefly drawn from Sir Wal- 
 ter's own observation ; and as in talking over the fields 
 he had fought, the recollection of a strong attachment 
 he then formed, forcibly rushed on his mind, and gave 
 energy to his language, he soon fixed his niece's atten- 
 tion, which, ever wandering from Churchill's anteda- 
 ted wars, turned with so ardent a gaze on his counte- 
 nance while he recited the engagements he had wit- 
 nessed on the banks of the Elbe, and Scheldt, that she 
 would next day give a clear account of the whole 
 transactions. It never occurred to him that, in those 
 martial representations, he generally introduced one 
 portrait, Sydney earl of Avondel, whose then youth- 
 ful arm rescued him at the battle of Minden from the 
 sword of a Bavarian officer. He was under, lying, his 
 feet unhorsed and wounded, in the momentary expec- 
 tation of the exterminating blow, when the gallant 
 Avondel, who acted as a volunteer in his companv,

 rushed upon the enemy, and preserved the life of his 
 officer at the imminent peril of his own. 
 
 Nor was this the only action in which the young 
 earl had evinced his prowess and magnanimity. At 
 least the gratitude and affection of Sir Walter trans- 
 formed him into a hero equal to that of an heroic 
 poem, who performs every important action in his own 
 proper person. Was a redoubt carried with peculiar 
 circumstances of gallantry, Lord Avondel command- 
 ed the detachment. Were the intended measures of 
 the enemy so clearly pointed out to the general that he 
 was able to post his advanced guard so as to counter- 
 act their designs j this only happened when Lord 
 Avondel went on the reconnoitering party. He also 
 uniformly took the standards, and led the pursuit. — 
 The most distinguished prisoners that were taken had 
 submitted to him, and his urbanity to the vanquished 
 was always equal to his skill in gaining the victory. — 
 Even when misfortune clouded the lustre of the Bri- 
 tish arms, the name of Avondel continued to shine 
 pure and resplendent, for Sir Walter described him as 
 diminishing the horrors of a retreat, parting with every 
 personal convenience to relieve the anguish of his sick 
 and wounded soldiers, comforting the indigent widow, 
 and protecting the destitute orphan. To these enco- 
 miums the baronet added the praise of every gentle- 
 manlike accomplishment and civic virtue. " I always 
 was a blockhead," he would say ; " my aunt Dorothy 
 never suffered me to be whipt when I was an idle lub- 
 ber and tore my Accidence. Take me out of a camp 
 and I know nothing, but Avondel is learned enough 
 to be archbishop of Canterbury. He had too much 
 sense to be a courtier, or no finical fop among them 
 could match him for fine breeding. He has shone 
 in the House of Lords, and when he was sent as am- 
 bassador to any court he always did his errand. He 
 had no business to turn soldier to hack and hew his 
 way to a scanty maintenance, for he was the only son 
 |of a noble family and I still hope, after all he has 
 suffered these twenty years, he will, if he lives to

 come back to England, marry some worthy woman, 
 and bring up heroes like himself." Miss Mandeville 
 once asked her uncle to explain what sufferings Lord 
 Avondel had undergone, but after expressing some 
 surprise that she had never heard of his base usage, 
 declared himself unable to tell the particulars, but 
 added that it was a very infamous affair. 
 
 An incident happened at Lime Grove the day be- 
 fore Miss Mandeville left it which strongly impressed 
 her youthful imagination. Anxious to present her 
 niece with some token of remembrance before they 
 separated, Lady Selina unlocked her casket of jewels, 
 which were remarkably magnificent, in her presence, 
 and the young lady's eye was instantly attracted by the 
 portrait of a gentleman richly set with cliamonds. — 
 The features beamed with the noble expression of dig- 
 nity and beauty, and the costly enchasing intimated 
 that it was the gift of peculiar attachment. Turning 
 her eyes on her aunt, Emily discovered that the faint 
 tinge of carmine which ill health had left in her coun- 
 tenance was faded to the most deathlike paleness, while 
 her lips quivered with concealed emotion. The only 
 answer which she could articulate to her niece's ques- 
 tion, as to the name of the gentleman, was, u that he 
 was the first and best of men." " Is he dead," in- 
 quired Miss Mandeville. " Perhaps he is," was 
 Lady Selina's reply, while, with a trembling hand and 
 averted eyes, as if she feared to indulge herself with 
 a look, she restored the picture to its envelope, and 
 adding, that he had been long absent from England, 
 locked the casket and left the room. At their next 
 meeting, Emily perceived her aunt's eyes were in- 
 flamed with weeping, and she resolved never more to 
 revive the painful subject. 
 
 It so happened that Sir Walter Mandeville, in one 
 of his .warm eulogiums on Lord Avondel, used the 
 same exclamation of admiration that had burst Irom 
 Lady Selina on Emily's discovering the mysterious 
 picture, and with all that warmth of imagination which 
 teaches young people to believe that to be true which

 is only possible, and also, that the object which occu- 
 pies their own thoughts is the only one in the world 
 worth contemplating, the amiable girl persuaded her- 
 self, that this most distinguished of human beings, 
 the celebrated Lord Avondel, was equally esteemed 
 and loved by her two nearest relations, and was some- 
 how connected with the melancholy of her dearest 
 aunt. His eminent success in the East Indies had 
 long filled the pages of the Gazette, and cheered the 
 drooping spirits of the nation, depressed by the ad- 
 verse and afflicting circumstances which attended the 
 American war. One circumstance militated against 
 the conclusion she had formed, the portrait was not 
 dressed as an officer ; and surely a hero of such emi- 
 nence would choose to have his likeness taken in the 
 costume which he wore so honourably to himself and 
 advantageously to his country ? If her uncle would 
 but tell her all he knew respecting the -early history of 
 his friend, the point of identity might soon be deter- 
 i mined. 
 
 Her utmost address, however, could discover no 
 more than that Lord Avondel embarked in the pursuit 
 of military fame in consequence of a severe disap- 
 pointment, and most scandalous usage from a woman 
 .to whom he was much attached. His debut in arms 
 was marked with circumstances of peculiar splendour, 
 and he rose rapidly to the highest honours. After the 
 peace of Aix la Chapelle, he was entrusted with a 
 special commission to a foreign state, and concluded 
 a treaty highly beneficial to his country. He resided 
 many years in Florence as ambassador at the court of 
 the Grand Duke, and from thence went to one of our 
 principal Indian settlements in the capacity of gover- 
 nor, where his skill and courage in war, his justice 
 and wisdom in the civil departments, and his univer- 
 sal benignity and amiable manners, conciliated the na- 
 tives, appalled the enemy, and raised the glory of his 
 country to such a height as consoled her well-wishers, 
 , and silenced the murmurs of faction, ever prone to 
 If'mk heroic actions, while it loves to dwell on the mis-

 deeds of those who scandalize the British name by in- 
 justice and treachery. All this corresponded with Lady 
 Selina's confession, that he had been long absent; but 
 who could the lady be to whose baseness England 
 might be said to owe her hero ? Certainly it was not 
 her beloved aunt ; she was all honour and fidelity. It 
 was impossible for her to behave scandalously to any 
 one, and as she admitted Lord Avondel's excellence 
 it was evident there could be no mistake on this occa- 
 sion. 
 
 Probably then (for when complete information was 
 denied, Emily could only reason upon probabilities) 
 Lady Selina was the chosen friend of Lord Avondel, 
 and as such treasured his memory, and lamented his 
 wrongs, though her own resignation of the world pro- 
 ceeded from some other cause. True, it was singular, 
 that among the many anecdotes of distinguished peo- 
 ple with which she enlivened their evening tete-a-tetes 
 she had never told her the history of this injured wor- 
 thy ; especially as it was of such publicity that her 
 uncle seemed to wonder she had never heard it. — 
 Doubtless her dear aunt .had excellent reasons for her 
 silence, yet, whatever they were, Emily felt all know- 
 ledge was vain and unattractive compared to the nar- 
 rative of the wrongs which " this first and best of 
 men" had suffered from a woman.

 THOUGH Miss Mandeville had by this time dis- 
 covered, that, either owing to forgetfulness, or, as 
 some would say, to great poetical powers, (for a cer- 
 tain coarse word must never be applied to the commu- 
 nications of a lady) the narratives of Lady Mackin- 
 tosh were not strictly correct, not always so much alike 
 as to enable one to discover she was talking of the 
 same people whose adventures she had painted a week 
 before in different colours, she could not help apply- 
 ing to her, as an historian would to old Geoffry Mon- 
 mouth when every other author was silent. But here 
 her ladyship also was dumb, though she pleaded igno- 
 rance in such a manner as convinced Emily " she could 
 a tale unfold." Her ladvship was one of those won- 
 der-makers who are so often met with in society, and 
 who seem to consider conversation, " not as the feast 
 of reason or the flow of soul," but as the celebration 
 ot an ancient game, where every one contends who 
 shall shoot his arrows and hurl his quoits farthest. — 
 Like the giants of old, they consider truth as a Jupi- 
 ter, and pile Pelion on Ossa, and Ossa on Olympus 
 till they erect a pile to defy its omnipotence. If, to 
 avoid sinking into total insignificance in such companv, 
 you venture to sport what you think a Patagonian 
 bouncer, they instantly create a full grown Brobdig- 
 nag monster to oppose it, and your pigmy marvel at 
 last looks only like Gulliver on the lap of Glumdal- 
 clitch. With the propensity to deal in prodigies, and

 what influence ' more potent than the rod of Hermes 
 could chain the voluble tongue of Lady Mackintosh ? 
 
 They know little of the disposition of youth who 
 suppose its imagination is circumscribed by meeting 
 with difficulty and opposition. Sir Walter h;;d begun 
 to expatiate in praise oi his friend .dining the first 
 week of his niece's residence with him, but it was not 
 till the inundation of company had subsided, and 
 Emily discovered that there was something in the story 
 which she could not know, that she gave up her whole 
 thoughts to muse on Lord Avondel. The interest she 
 took in his glory was highly grateful to her guardian, 
 who, by applying to her, received correct intelligence 
 when the overland despatches were expected. It had 
 had lately been whispered, that in consequence of a 
 change in administration, letters of recal had been 
 sent to India, and Sir Walter consoled the feelings of 
 the patriot by indulging those of the friend. "lie 
 will certainly visit me," said the veteran, " if he Uvea 
 to come home, and these old walls shall ring with joy 
 when he enters my gate. I'll have an ox roasted, and 
 we will tap the pipes of cyder saved for poor George's 
 coming of age. All the country shall be called in, 
 and we will go out to meet him with such a cavalcade 
 as has never been seen since my grandfather met and 
 feasted the king's army after it had beaten the duke of 
 Monmouth at Sedgemoor. Girl, you shall see such 
 bonfires and hear such rejoicing's ! That's the way we 
 old soldiers welcome our brave comrades. We shall 
 talk over our campaigns, but pray don't you put in 
 with foolish speeches, for I can tell you my lord has an 
 utter aversion to ignorant people." 
 
 Roasting an ox, broaching pipes of cyder, calling in 
 the tenants, and talking over campaigns, do not sound 
 like amusements which a girl would prefer to Rane- 
 lagh and the Opera : but Emily's education had given 
 her somewhat of a romantic turn, and it is certain the 
 chance of seeing Lord Avondel was one unacknow- 
 ledged motive for her continuing so perfectly satisfied 
 with her present residence. The probability- of that

 desired pleasure was regularly discussed in the family- 
 party after the arrival of the newspapers, but these 
 faithful registers, or rather let me say predictors, of 
 events, never suffered hope and fear to hang long in 
 equipoize. One day Miss Mandeville read with ex- 
 ulting hope, " The cabinet council sat yesterday till a 
 very late hour. The subject in deliberation is kept a 
 profound secret, yet we have learnt from high authority 
 that the Earl of Avondel is recalled, in consequence of 
 an arrangement which the premier has made with 
 Lord Lurcher Rackrent. A frigate is prepared to 
 take his lordship to the settlement, and the ministerial 
 influence in the lower house will be strengthened by 
 the addition of six boroughs. The displaced noble- 
 man is to have the vacant blue ribband to bind up the 
 wounds of honour." 
 
 The next day's post brought the following intelli- 
 gence. 
 
 " We hear the arrangements respecting Lord Avon- 
 del's removal from his viceroyalty are suspended in 
 consequence of strong representations having been 
 sent over by the principal inhabitants, intreating the 
 continuance of a nobleman whose conduct has reflected 
 the highest honour on his country and himself, and in- 
 creased the resources of that important colony to au 
 incredible degree. We must enter our protest against 
 bartering the safety of the empire for ministerial pre- 
 ponderance, and the infamous system of close bo- 
 roughs. If the events of the Savoir vivre are unpror 
 pitious, Lord Lurcher has still some unfelled woods, 
 and timber sells well." 
 
 The next week's intelligence took a shorter form, 
 " Lord Avondel's recall has long been determined 
 upon. A magnificent house has been taken for his 
 lordship in Grosvenor square, which is preparing for 
 his immediate reception." 
 
 In a few more posts appeared an alarming article : 
 " Great fears are entertained for the safety of the St. 
 ' George East Indiaman, on board of which the Earl of 
 $ F 2

 Avondel and suite are known to have taken their pas- 
 sage for England." 
 
 The terrors of the Mandevilles only lasted till the 
 next day, when fear subsided into disappointment on 
 reading, " We are anxious to relieve the apprehensions 
 of those whose friends or relations embarked on board 
 the St. George, by announcing the safe arrival of that 
 ship in the Downs, after an expeditious and prosper- 
 ous voyage. She brings no intelligence of Lord 
 Avondel." 
 
 It was on the 11th of January, 1779, that Miss Man- 
 deville read with indescribable rapture the following 
 imposing paragraph : 
 
 " Yesterday, at a late hour, Sydney Earl of Avon- 
 del arrived at *the Hummums, after an absence of 
 twenty years from his native country. A vast con- 
 course of people assembled to testily their admiration 
 of his eminent services, and to gratify their curiosity 
 by gazing on so distinguished a personage. But with 
 that elevated modestv which always accompanies su- 
 perior merit, his lordship eluded observation, and after 
 gracefully bowing to the -populace, who greeted him 
 with three cheers, he retired to an inner apartment. 
 The hotel was watched till a late hour, but his lordship 
 was not visible, and it is suspected he is gone into the 
 country to avoid those distinctions which his deserved 
 popularity must acquire in an age so destitute of really 
 great men. We were fortunately near the carriage 
 when his lordship alighted, and are happy to report 
 that the fatigues and dangers he has undergone have 
 not injured his personal appearance. His fine figure 
 and elegant deportment enabled us tb recognize him at 
 the first glmce. Without meaning to reflect upon our 
 contemporaries we must do ourselves the justice to 
 say, that disregarding all floating surmises and vague 
 reports we have given the earliest and most correct 
 information concerning the course which ministers in- 
 tended to pursue with this celebrated nobleman." 
 
 As Emily was hastening to announce, that at last 
 the truth was known, she met her uncle, whose couu-

 tenance was illuminated with a flush of extraordinary 
 ijoy which he had great difficulty in restraining, while 
 
 Emily read the above paragraph. Before she had con- 
 i eluded, he snatched the paper out of her hand, and 
 
 with a hearty curse on the lying dog of a printer who 
 :flew from India to England backwards and forwards 
 i faster than a cannon ball, vowed such trumpery should 
 i never enter his doors again. He then gave his niece 
 ; a letter with this exclamation, " See girl, this from 
 
 himself, 'tis the very writing of the real Avondel." 
 
 u Falmouth, January 9th, 1779. 
 " Dear Mandeville, 
 " The inquiries of an alienated exile on revisiting 
 I his native country, generally suggest the most painful 
 | sensations. The wandering life I have long led has of 
 Hate years prevented me from forming strong attach- 
 ments and I now find most of my early friends either 
 i dead, or changed in situation and character in a degree 
 that must prevent me from renewing those dear con- 
 nections the image of which has so often solaced mv 
 'wounded mind. Amid the melancholv or disgraceful 
 details which I have heard since my arrival of those I 
 
 I once loved, it has given me infinite satisfaction to find

 Mandeville, now sees his well-earned laurels flourish

 treachery, or shall I say that some malignant fatality 
 has ever haunted my steps, and taught me to seek for 
 my reward in the feelings of conscious rectitude, ra- 
 ther than in the attainment of those objects on which I 
 had fixed my ardent wishes ? 
 
 " Do not, Mandeville, call this frank avowal of my 
 present sentiments, a muffled drum sounding a dead 
 march over defunct ambition. The greatest favour 
 administration could confer upon me was my recall. I 
 love retirement, my health requires serious attention to 
 recover the injuries it has suffered from unwholesome 
 climates. I have been overwhelmed with ceremony, 
 deafened with adulation ; henceforth I shall live to 
 myself. I trust I shall be excused from personal at- 
 tendance in London. My secretary can tell ail I have 
 done, if the state in which I have left the settlement I 
 governed requires any comment. He also can deve- 
 lope my future plans, should my successor deign to 
 inquire what they were. The formality of a court 
 life is insupportable, and I scorn to accept any reward. 
 You, honest, noble-minded Walter, will not blame me 
 if I own, that though my patrimonial estate was very 
 inadequate to my rank, I close my active career in the 
 sinie honourable poverty in which it was commenced. 
 I have not despoiled the golden musnuds of India, the 
 mines of Golconda have not soiled my hands, nor will 
 I now barter the riches of an independent soul for 
 wealth purchased by unprincipled submission to the 
 transient pageants of power, or by a similar opposition 
 to the measures of those who direct the helm of state. 
 That steady integrity which has hitherto directed my 
 course, shall ever be my leading star. I have enough 
 for honourable privacy, for philosophical ease, for cir- 
 cumspect benevolence. An unconnected man must be 
 avaricious if he desires more. 
 
 " I find, Mandeville, you still continue one of that 
 free and happy fraternity, who, being accountable to 
 no tribunal but the laws of their country and the re- 
 bukes of conscience, laugh at the long stories of hopes 
 and fears, promises and rebukes, doubts and disap-

 pointments, which compel married men to be fortune- 
 i hunters and levee-hunters, blind idolaters of insolent 
 .importance, or dumb slaves to female caprice, vanity, 
 and folly. The subject animates me, for it recalls to 
 imy mind the evening previous to the glorious day of 
 JVIinden, when we mounted guard together, and when 
 vou relieved the anxious tediousness of that night by 
 i« lively euiogium on the superior advantages of our 
 idestiny compared with those who felt the immortal 
 ! longings of the hero repressed by apprehensive terrors 
 (for indigent widows and destitute orphans. If, while 
 preparing our minds for a speedy termination of our 
 mortal career in the field of honour, we felt it as an 
 alleviation of our lot to consider, that we had no near 
 i connections to suffer for us, should we turn cowards 
 inow and shrink from the idea of a life passed in soli- 
 Itude, without one being to stimulate our exertions, ex- 
 cite our hopes, or mitigate our woes ? Have we de- 
 voted our youth, strength, health, and talents, to be- 
 come insulated creatures, of whom fame talks largely, 
 but affection is silent ? If there was error in the choice, 
 rrepentance comes too late. We will preserve ourselves 
 from ridicule by never believing that we can excite af- 
 fection, and if we are not happy we will assume the 
 decency of content. 
 
 ** I know not, Mundeville, whether the vacant life 
 of a country gentleman have made you as much a 
 philosopher, as confinement on ship-board, and six 
 months of inaction, have made me a misanthrope, or 
 whether you still continue the cheerful blunt fellow you 
 were when I visited vou in the hospital at Ravensburg ? 
 Without allowing me to mention your own sufferings, 
 ■you then only asked me the fate of your comrades, 
 and the movements of the enemy after that successful 
 effort of British courage. If time has done much to 
 chill the noble ardour of your heart, fortune has been 
 equally busy in deepening the susceptibilities of mine. I 
 shall winter at Bath, having been advised to try the 
 teffect of those salutary waters. I trust you will soon 
 fjoin me there. We shall meet as fellow soldiers used-

 There are young ladies, pretenders, too, to preci- 
 sion, enthusiasm, and tenderness, who would have 
 found all their admiration of a returning hero subside 
 on perusing such an indubitable testimony of his being 
 poor, neglected, ill, and unhappy. But Miss Mande- 
 ville was not one of those who require the nodding 
 plumes and velvet train of prosperity to designate me- 
 rit. Her compassionate tears fell over those bursts of 
 wounded feeling which reluctantly spoke a dejected 
 heart. And grasping Sir Walter's hand, she exclaim- 
 ed, " dear uncle, what can be done to reconcile Lord 
 Avondel to the world?"" 
 
 "i^h," exclaimed the sympathizing veteran, drawing 
 his hand over his moistened eyes, " you cannot make 
 the world good enough to satisfy such a mind as his. I 
 wish you had seen him, Emily, when he rode up to 
 Lord Granby's quarters, and asked leave to use his 
 sword in the allied army. He was the finest looking 
 gentleman I ever beheld ; but there was much of deep 
 thought and melancholy in his countenance. He sup- 
 ped with Prince Ferdinand that night; we had him af- 
 terwards at our mess. Sometimes he would sit quite 
 silent, and the'n burst out in such a manner! No man 
 ever had so much wit, and when h<e has kept the table 
 on a roar for several hours, I have whispered him, 
 1 Avondel, my dear boy, I think you must have felt 
 happy this evening.' " No, Captain Mandeville,' he 
 would say, ' gaiety is a loose domino, and I play the 
 fool in it, but misery is my every day garb, and I can- 
 not throw it off.' "

 Emily sobbed with pity, and at last observed, that 
 ; as she had heard her uncle praise the unbounded bene- 
 1 volence of his friend, surely his own melancholy must 
 lhav« been relieved by dispensing comfort to the afflict- 
 ied. 
 
 " I have seen him," said Sir Walter, " start from 
 
 the straw on which he has lain, supporting an expiring 
 
 soldier, and heard him declare he envied the brave 
 
 1 fellow. ' Death, 1 said he, ' in its most dismal shape, 
 
 lis not so terrible as a life of disappointment." 
 
 " Surely," replied Emily, "he has never yet met 
 with any one who has felt sufficient veneration of his 
 exalted character to attempt the removal of the thorn 
 which thus corrodes his peace. I cannot form so in- 
 I consistent an opinion of the possessor of such superior 
 (talents, such refined sensibility, such active generosity, 
 as all ascribe to Lord Avondel, as to suppose that he 
 would continue brooding over his secret disgusts if he 
 had at hand some one whose tenderness, sympathy, and 
 solicitude would shew him his own value, and, by 
 grieving at his dejection, stimulate him to forget past 
 wrongs and look forward to future hopes. How I 
 wish he had early married such a woman as my aunt 
 Selina. She would certainly have made him as happy 
 as he is illustrious. " 
 
 " True," said Sir Walter, " he would not then have 
 envied the dying soldier." " My love," whispered 
 Lady Mackintosh, "you don't know every particular 
 of your aunt's character." 
 
 A profound silence ensued, which was broken by Sir 
 Walter's declaring that Avondel should not die of a 
 broken heart at Bath. " I'll go myself," added he, 
 " and fetch him to the castle. The doctors say the 
 spring in Marlton-moor is quite as good as that at the 
 pump-room. We will all turn m rses, and, Emily, 
 you shall try to make him forget — Pshaw, I know not 
 what I am talking of. Onlv never mention that per- 
 verse fantastical aunt of your's to anv of us. I never 
 heard a soul but yourself speak well of her."

 fierce look of her uncle was too intimidating to allow 
 her to vindicate the character she most esteemed. She 
 now felt convinced, that there had been some violent 
 discord between her two nearest surviving relations, 
 which, though her placid aunt had entirely renounced 
 it, still rankled in the move obdurate heart of her un- 
 cle, and was too tenaciously supported by old preju- 
 dice to yield to any think but actual observation. She 
 knew if he would but become acquainted with Lady 
 Selinahe must either confess, that he was mistaken in 
 her character, or that she had undergone a complete 
 change since he first believed her to be perverse or 
 fantastical. 
 
 Lady Mackintosh now busied herself in endeavour- 
 ing to prevent Sir Walter's intended invitation. This 
 lady was one of those rare characters who, upon being 
 admitted to an intimacy with a family, never rest till 
 insinuation, contrivance, pretty starts of caprice, 
 whispers, and other instances of adroit management, 
 they obtain its whole direction; and reduce the osten- 
 sible agents to mere puppets, twisted into the desired 
 attitude by the management of secret strings. Now, 
 though Sir Walter Mandeville believed himself to be 
 made of the same immoveable stuff as Atlas, 'tis cer- 
 tain he seldom ordered a dinner, or asked a party, but 
 in exact conformity to the taste and pleasure of his ex- 
 pert governess, in whose hands he was little more than 
 a living automaton. On two points, however, he pre- 
 served his original tenacity. One was his attachment 
 to Emily, and the other his resolution to console his 
 old ft iend. In vain did her ladyship hint the strange 
 conclusions which the world would form from his 
 bringing a soldier of broken fortunes to his house, 
 while it was the residence of his declared heiress. In 
 vain did she enlarge on the respect due to received 
 opinions, in vain urge that tenderness to the unhappy 
 should never teach us to forget prudence to ourselves, 
 or, as a last resource, intimate that chariness for her 
 own character wpuld necessitate her to be a less fre- 
 quent visitor at the castle, while Lord Avondel was

 there, who, for aught she knew, might be quite a man 
 of gallantry. Sir Walter stood firm, or rather conti- 
 nued faithful, to the first impulse which he had re- 
 ceived from his supreme directress ; for sorry am I to 
 observe, that her ladyship's opinions were apt to vary. 
 Since the perusal of Lord Avondel's letter she had 
 conceived an incurable prejudice against the conqueror 
 of the Mahrattas, whose return she once proposed to 
 celebrate with a fete champetre. She ever held the 
 plain robe of honourable poverty unbecoming, and she 
 thought the man poor indeed in mind as well as in purse, 
 who could neither find gold nor diamonds in India, 
 nor take the rational way of procuring places and pen- 
 sions in England. And she supposed die best thing a 
 person so unfit for society couid do, would be to die at 
 Bath of the melancholy regret which he ought to feel 
 at having lost such fine opportunities. 
 
 Finding Sir Walter's hospitable intentions were not 
 I to be shaken, her ladyship's anxiety tor her dear Emi- 
 I ly induced her to conquer her abhorrence of red-coats, 
 which had almost led her to behave like Gay's country 
 maiden in his moral to the fable of the tame stag. She 
 told Sir Walter, that if he would introduce so danger- 
 ous an acquaintance to his niece, the only way of pro- 
 tecting her reputation from the sarcasms of the censo- 
 rious, would be to have some discreet lady who knew 
 the world, and was not very young always with her. 
 Every quality she described suited herself so exactly, 
 that Sir Walter instantly guessed her meaning, and ex- 
 pressing his hope that she would have the goodness to 
 undertake the office. Lady Mackintosh paused a mo- 
 ment, recollected the four families of which her dear Sir 
 Jeremiah had made her step-dame, and at last consi- 
 dering that their feuds were too inveterate, and their 
 dispositions too untractable for her to comroul with 
 success, she determined to leave them to p< ck at each 
 other like a brood of game chickens, and to forsake 
 Dunswood, that scene of all her former h ppiness, and 
 even the mausoleum of Sir Jeremiah, where she had 
 'just planted clematis and eglantine. Every thing was

 thus happily adjusted. Sir Walter set off to fetch Lord 
 Avondel, and Lady Mackintosh was established at 
 Mandeville Castle in the capacity of chancellor of the 
 court of decorum. 
 
 Sir Walter was absent but a few days. He return- 
 ed to announce that he had with much difficulty pre- 
 vailed on his friend to accept the invitation. Emily 
 now began to doubt the rectitude and delicacy of those 
 sentiments which had induced her to take so warm an 
 interest in the fate of a stranger. She had no respect 
 for Lady Mackintosh, yet, if she could judge of the 
 world by report, it contained many people of her 
 stamp, who would, like her, discover sinister views in 
 the most disinterested designs, and subject that con- 
 duct which resulted from pure admiration and generous 
 pity to such opprobrium as would stamp indelible dis- 
 grace on her character. Was it indeed necessary that 
 she should have a perpetual companion to act as the 
 guardian of her fame ? Good Heaven ! what could 
 have made her affect or avow sympathy, solicitude, and 
 tenderness, for a hero ? 
 
 She now reconsidered every point of view in 
 which Sir Walter had placed his friend's character. 
 Was he not more terrifying than amiable ? keenly sus- 
 ceptible of injuries, fully conscious of desert, pene- 
 trating and inflexible, gloomy from indulged habit, and 
 gay by an occasional self-derogating constraint, avow- 
 edly prejudiced against the fair sex, yet treating them 
 with that condescending politeness which indicated his 
 respect for his own reputation ? Such errors or mis- 
 fortunes, call them by which name you please, must 
 render the great, the glorious Avondel a less desirable 
 companion than those inferior people who are destitute 
 of his talents and virtues, but more regardful of the 
 just claims of others. 
 
 Yet still he was great and glorious. Curiosity is a 
 potent motive ; and admitting that the phcenix was a 
 phenomenon, there was a vast pleasure in looking at 
 what all the world was talking of. She only wished she 
 could see him and hear him talk, without being exposed

 to his penetrating, and too probably uncandid, observa- 
 tion. She regretted the embarrassing mystery which 
 •seemed to subsist about her aunt, as it prevented her 
 from mentioning their expected visitor in her letters, 
 or asking for the benefit of Lady Selina's prudent 
 , counsels. It was not from any doubt of the rectitude 
 and honour which she had so long experienced that 
 1 Emily practised this forbearance, but it was a recollec- 
 ition of the distress which the discovery of the picture 
 had excited, that determined her to avoid awakening- 
 similar emotions. Time would discover whether there 
 was any affinity between the sorrows of these elevated 
 characters, and she resolved to behave with the most 
 guarded caution, not only to the earl, but also to her 
 I fair guardian, of whose friendship and prudence she 
 entertained a very low opinion.

 THE morning at length arrived which was to intro" 
 duce the long-talked-of visitor, and Sir Walter ushered 
 in breakfast by observing, " Now, Emily, you will see 
 a real hero : but mind, I have promised my lord you 
 shall not be troublesome." 
 
 "Sir?" 
 
 " Mind what I say, I told Avondale I would not 
 deceive him. Two ladies lived with me, but they were 
 not every-day people. I said you were a good girl, 
 and respected and admired him very much ; but that 
 you were not one of that sort who would want him to 
 trot about the plantations with you, or to parade him 
 round the neighbourhood. I told him you talked lit- 
 tle, did not laugh loud, and gave yourself no flighty 
 airs to catch those coxcombs who teach women to think 
 us made to be monkey -keepers ; but that I had found 
 you a good nurse, and had taught you to play back-

 " I trust," said Lady Mackintosh, " you did equal 
 justice to mv character." 
 
 " I told him," replied Sir Walter, with a significant 
 bow, " that I wished I had known you twenty years 
 ago, when you were a very fine woman." 
 
 " I admire your frankness," answered the lady. — 
 " It was kind to apprize his lordship that no attack 
 was intended, for as the poet sings, * Cupid flies from 
 tresses hoar.' "

 The baronet was too much engrossed with the 
 scheme of his own preparations to reply. " I shall 
 receive him in great state," said he ; " the tenants 
 have set out to meet him, and dinner shall be served 
 in the banqueting room, with a band of music playing 
 in the stone gallery. You, Emily, must be full dres- 
 sed, with all your jewels on ; and remember, my lord 
 is a very fine gentleman ; nothing forward or finical 
 will do, you must do the honours of the house quite 
 easily and gracefully, without colouring and trembling 
 as if you had never seen any body but your nurse. — 
 He has been used to the first courts in Europe, and 
 all the grandeur and magnificence of the East. Pie is the 
 king of courtesy, and I want you to look like the 
 queen." 
 
 " What a task have I undertaken," thought Emily, 
 as she prepared for this formidable reception. " I 
 protest I will never more pity a hero, or long to gaze 
 on a blazing star." Her trepidation was not diminish- 
 ed by Lady Mackintosh observing,, that she was attir- 
 ed for conquest. " 'Tis well," added she, " that I 
 had no designs. My simple vestments could not at- 
 tract one look when eclipsed by such a blaze of splen- 
 dour and beauty. Dear creature, what a tremor you 
 are in. I own your uncle is very alarming, but I will 
 support you. As I live, the cavalcade is coming 
 down the avenue. When it enters the porter's ward 
 the band is to strike up, 4 See the conquering hero 
 comes,' and you are to walk out of the saloon, follow- 
 ed by all the ladies, and the earl is to wait at the fold- 
 ing doors opposite the grand entrance to be introduced 
 in form, — quick, quick, you wont be in time." 
 
 Emily had three times arranged and displaced her 
 feathers, and at last fixed them in the most unbecom- 
 ing position. She broke the clasp of her bracelet, 
 forgot one of her sleeve-knots, and entered the saloon 
 in a tremor just as the trumpets and clarionets began 
 to play. She had scarcely time to take her prescribed 
 station when Sir Walter advanced with an air of inex- 
 pressible satisfaction, and introduced a gentleman in.

 the uniform of a general, adorned with several milita>- 
 ry and diplomatic orders. An air nobly majestic, a 
 manner peculiarly graceful, and a countenance which, 
 notwithstanding the cadaverous hue of sickness, spoke 
 ■with sublime expression a feeling and exalted soul, 
 announced that this was the earl of Avondel. 
 
 His introductory address to Emily was equally flat- 
 tering and refined. He spoke of his impatience to 
 thank her for her goodness to his most valued friend: 
 nor did he then hurry from her with the air of one 
 who has said a fine thing. He seemed to wait her re- 
 ply, and it was not till he perceived she was incapable 
 of making one, that he left her to recall her scattered 
 thoughts, and moved round the circle shewing himself 
 to be as expert in versatile politeness as in the more 
 energetic language of peculiar esteem. He then plac- 
 ed Ills chair near Emily, and conversed with that res- 
 pectful ease and general attention which soonest van- 
 quish too timid delicacy. Sir Walter rubbed his hands 
 in ecstacy, nodded significantly to his old neighbours, 
 and smiled at their wives and daughters with a sort of 
 silent bustle which indicated the difficulty he had to 
 restrain his own raptures,- and his unwillingness to di~ 
 \ crt the attention of the company from the wonder he 
 had introduced. Admiration soon succeeded to terror 
 in the mind of Emily, while she considered how dif- 
 ferent Lord Avondel's manner was from any she had 
 ever been accustomed to. " Other men," thought 
 she, "by officious gallantry, study to display their 
 <;wn attainments, but the compliments of Lord Avon- 
 del inspire* me with self-respect. Certainly he is the 
 first and best of men. O shame upon an unthankful 
 world that he is not the happiest." 
 
 The ease of general conversation which this " king 
 of courtesy" contrived to substitute for that apprehen- 
 sive reserve, which thirty years ago predominated in 
 country parties, gave Miss Mandeville new opportuni- 
 ties of" admiration. As his attentions were every thing 
 but oppressive or presumptuous, she had ventured to 
 observe his features, as well as his words. Time had

 given his appearance all the grandeur of manly digni- 
 ty, but slightly marked with symptoms of approaching 
 decay. His eyes beamed with the keenest intelligence, 
 and they seemed to derive additional lustre from the 
 furrows of reflection deeply engraven on his brow.— 
 The general expression of his countenance was thought- 
 ful majesty, but a smile lighted it up into ineffable be- 
 nignity. She fancied he often suppressed a sigh from 
 a kind determination not to check the hilarity his pre- 
 sence inspired, or abate the delight of his host, whose 
 looks continually repeated with exultation, " This is 
 the man who saved my life." 
 
 " I wonder," thought Emily, " how with so much 
 innate grandeur he has contrived to infuse so much 
 frankness and vivacity into our party. We were all 
 trembling with awe before he entered, and now all but 
 myself are quite comfortable. I wish I durst speak 
 to him, he will think me an absolute fool. Surely he 
 cannot be uncandid, he cannot put such harsh con- 
 structions on the effect of true simplicity as my uncle 
 intimates." 
 
 The day closed, and Emily still continued wishing 
 but unable to remove the unfavourable impressions 
 which she felt assured her reserve must make on her 
 noble guest. Indeed, if she could have subdued her 
 own terrors, the fixed attention of Lady Mackintosh 
 would have chilled her presumption. Even when she 
 retired to her own apartment, hoping to ruminate at 
 leisure, that mirror of propriety, faithful to her duty 
 of duenna, glided after her to develope her sentiments 
 concerning the stranger, " This is extremely imperti- 
 nent," thought Emily, " but I will be guarded." 
 
 " I hope, my love," inquired her ladyship, " your 
 expectations concerning our noble inmate are quite an- 
 swered ?" 
 
 " Perfectly so," returned the young lady, with an 
 air of nonchalance to mislead sagacity. 
 
 " And you do think him the most wonderful won- 
 der of wonders that ever was wondered at ?" 
 
 " Yes, the very greatest."

 " What a discerning young creature," said her la- 
 dyship laughing. " But Sir Walter has seen very little 
 of the world, and is so fond of the extraordinary." 
 
 " I quite agree with your ladyship." 
 
 " The earl is very high, but a phoenix you know is 
 allowed to be proud. Do you think him so very, that 
 is, superlatively handsome ?" 
 
 " Proud, handsome ! I did not much observe him, 
 madam." 
 
 " O, Miss Mandeville, is this candour and since- 
 rity ?" 
 
 A bright thought shot into Emily's mind to turn 
 the tables on her persecutor. " If I did look at him 
 often," said she, " you must abide the result of a 
 severer scrutinizer than I am, for I protest he was 
 always gazing on your ladyship." 
 
 " Piqued, by all that is fretful," thought the fair 
 widow, not much displeased at having the observation 
 she had already made thus confirmed by the jealousy 
 of a rival. " My love," said she, pressing Emily's 
 hand, " you know he might as well be gazing on the 
 cold splendour of the watery moon. Come, you only 
 rally ; I heard the elegant compliments he addressed 
 to you." 
 
 " As the relation of his fellow soldier, madam ; I 
 am not the vain self-important girl to suppose, that so 
 awkward a novice as I know I appeared to day could 
 have any independent claim to the compliments of a 
 man like Lord Avondel. He saw me the niece of Sir 
 Walter Mandeville, and every mark of respect he 
 paid me was a delicate tribute to friendship." 
 
 u Delicate tribute to friendship ! Such a man as 
 Lord Avondel ! This young creature's heart is in a 
 fine way," thought Lady Mackintosh ; " ladies of her 
 stamp of character always grow more kind in their 
 expressions as they intend to be more provoking." 
 " Why, I confess my dearest love," said she, " I nev- 
 er saw you appear to so little advantage, nor so ill 
 dressed, as to day. You coloured, and stammered, 
 and fluttered your fan, instead of carelessly playing

 with it, thus. And, as the poet said, the feast was sold 
 not given, for instead of twice pressing the guests to 
 eat, had it not been for me every body would have sat 
 with empty plates. I don't mean to distress you, but 
 indeed you never answered Mr. Cheerly when he 
 asked you to take wine, and you sent turtle to Sir 
 Humphrey Cramwell without one morsel of green fat. 
 I was very sorry for the poor girls, knowing he would 
 go home out of humour, and one of them said she was 
 sure you were not well. But I will go there with you 
 to-morrow and make an apology. 
 
 " It will save him one oath," returned Emily, 
 " when the gout pays him its next visit. But indeed 
 you must bear the blame. Your manner and appear- 
 ance so struck Lord Avondel, that he was continually 
 taking up my attention with questions about you, and, 
 to frustrate any hope he might have formed. I at last 
 told him, that though in compliment to the day you 
 had cast off your weeds of woe, and appeared all ease 
 and gaiety, you were absolutely inflexible on the point 
 / of a second attachment." 
 
 11 Oh," said Lady Mackintosh, relapsing into the do- 
 lorous, " I could not help thinking as I sat at table, 
 how different Sir Walter's present idol is from that 
 friend I shall ever deplore. Sir Jeremiah's was true 
 humility, true good nature. He had no artifice, no 
 stately hauteur. He never strove to seem above every 
 body else. Good night, sweet Emilv, peaceful be thy 
 slumbers. Alas ! my thoughts will be in the mauso- 
 leum." 
 
 Miss Mandeville almost wished her person there 
 also, as she secured her door against any further intru- 
 sion than the very unpleasant reflections her faithful 
 friend had introduced respecting her embarrassment. 
 It grieved her that it had actually been observed by 
 the company. Yet none but very illiberal people could 
 think it extraordinary, that a young lady bred in re- 
 tirement should feel distressed at playing the hostess 
 on so public an occasion, and for the avowed purpose 
 ft of doing honour to a man of Lord Avondel's celebrity

 and nice discernment. If the hero of the day still pos- 
 sessed great personal attractions, he was at least old 
 enough to be her father ; and is a man of forty-two, 
 neither gay nor fortunate, so very irresistible, or was 
 she so prompt to love, that no cause but a wish for 
 conquest could be assigned for the confusion of a girl 
 of twenty, heiress to many thousands ? For the first 
 time in her life she wished to know how many, and 
 whether they were equal to the support of a very 
 splendid establishment ? 
 
 She then veverted to the remainder of Lady Mack- 
 intosh's observations. , Were pride and craft so con- 
 spicuous in Lord Avondel as to be discerned by a shal- 
 low observer, and yet appear to her in the commenda- 
 ble form of dignity and wisdom ? His superiority was 
 so indisputable that it seemed not even to require the 
 support of defensive warfare. It was evident he could 
 not receive information from any of the company, yet 
 occasionally he played the listner's part with a grace 
 which proved he saw no danger in condescension. He 
 introduced no topic with a view to self aggrandizement 
 or display, and highly grateful as his attentions were 
 to those who received them he seemed more anxious 
 that no one should be pained by his disregard. Proud 
 men are fond of flattery. If Lord Avondel were 
 proud how abundant was his caution and self com- 
 mand, for he received every compliment with such 
 noble negligence, that neither his words, look, nor 
 manner showed he regarded praise. Emily however 
 remarked, that whoever had been very particular or 
 happy in their eulogiums received from him in the 
 course of the evening some appropriate and elegant re- 
 turn, or was allowed an opportunity of appearing in a 
 favourable point of view. What discrimination and 
 discernment did such behaviour evince ? Compare him 
 to Sir Jeremiah Mackintosh, absurd ! 'Twas plain such 
 a woman's remarks were not worth regarding. 
 
 " And yet," said Emily, " he is not happy, 'lis 
 rankling grief, not time, that has engraven those deep 
 furious on his awful brow. With every amiable.

 every exalted quality he is wretched. What must the 
 ■world be, if even an Avondel could not pass through 
 it without enduring the shipwreck of his peace ? My 
 dear aunt Selina, too, with all her virtue and goodness, 
 is unhappy. Is sorrow the unavoidable lot of great 
 talents and strong feeling? O that I could shelter my 
 orphan head in safe obscurity ! What wretched com- 
 panions shall I find ignorance and susceptibility." 
 
 She now recollected the picture she had seen at Lime 
 Grove, her view of it was very transient ; it represent- 
 ed a man in the bloom of youth, ruddy with health, 
 and animated with joy and hope. Time and change of 
 circumstances, added to indisposition, must have made 
 such an alteration that the picture could no longer re- 
 semble the original. The expression in the eyes, 
 however, was similar, and so peculiar, that she more 
 than ever wished to know her aunt's early history. 
 
 Sir Walter's exuberant joy was as troublesome to 
 him as her perplexity was to Emily, and alike indis- 
 posed him for sleep. They met early in the breakfast 
 room. The enthusiasm of the baronet acted as a pow- 
 erful panacea to cure all his maladies, and he fought 
 over his old battles with unusual vivacity. He soon 
 came to the never wearying tale of his own preserva- 
 tion, and had just lifted the sword of the Bavarian of- 
 ficer when his champion entered. Emily's eyes were 
 filled with tears, and her uncle was not sufficiently at- 
 tentive to the scruples of delicacy to avoid explaining 
 their source. But the polished earl spared her blushes, 
 by not perceiving anv compliment to himself, while he 
 warmly commended the piety which made her thus af- 
 fected at recollecting the danger of her guardian. He 
 intreated Sir Walter to avoid a subject which her ten- 
 derness could not bear. To overcome the cry of 
 " No, no, 'tis not so," which the good baronet loudly 
 vociferated, he entered into military details which soon 
 engrossed the attention of his old companion in arms. 
 The Havannah was taken, and the heights of Quebec 
 scaled, in description, till the war-worn soldiers forgot

 intosh, provoked that the battery of a new morning 
 dress, mounted for the occasion, had done no execu- 
 tion, whispered Emily, that it would look improper if 
 they staid too long with the gentlemen. But Sir Wal- 
 ter had no mind that they should retire. A project 
 had taken possession of his imagination, and with him, 
 the very "firstlings of his thoughts always became the 
 firstlings of his hand." 
 
 " Why, my lady, why, Emily, you are not going to 
 run away from us, so pleased as you are to hear about 
 battles and sieges ? I assure you, Avondel, that girl is 
 in her heart a soldier. She has listened for hours to 
 my account of the campaign of 59, when you had a 
 command in the second brigade, and she can repeat by 
 heart the despatch you sent to England at the conclu- 
 sion of the Mahratta war." 
 
 " I highly respect the patriotic spirit of the ladies," 
 returned Avondel, " but if they honour our pursuits 
 with their attention, justice requires we should not be 
 so self-engrossed as to trespass on their social claims. 
 May I have the happiness, Miss Mandeville, of at- 
 tending you on your morning excursion." 
 
 Emily, recollecting her uncle's interdiction against 
 trotting a hero round the plantations, or parading him 
 among the neighbours, was silent. 
 
 "My sweet friend," said Lady Mackintosh, "suf- 
 fers from the recollection of some minute oversight 
 yesterday, and proposes calling on the friends she has 
 displeased by way of concession." She then, in the 
 kindest manner imaginable, informed Sir Walter of 
 his niece's mistakes and negligencies. Unquestionably 
 she had no intention to check his exuberant good hu- 
 mour, and she owned it was conjectured that her dear 
 love was dying with the head-ach. But the hospitable 
 Baronet was peculiarly irritable on this subject ; for as 
 one of his grand objections to the society of ladies 
 was, that they limited good cheer and circumscribed 
 conversation, by expecting it to be addressed to them- 
 selves, so he tolerated their company when they were 
 frank and unassuming, and not only covered the board

 with plenty, but pressed "the mantling goblet and the 
 rich repast" on the diffident. 
 
 " And has Emily affronted any of my friends ?" in- 
 quired Sir Walter. 
 
 " Not absolutely affronted. Come, you must not 
 be so warm ; the dear timid creature is sufficiently 
 pained by her own feelings." 
 
 Lord Avondel observed, that in an affair so truly 
 arbitrary, it was much to be lamented an ingenuous 
 mind should abandon itself to the impression 'of pain- 
 ful feelings. ** The conclusion I drew from Miss Man- 
 dev die's behaviour," said he, " was, that the style of 
 hospitality I so much admired at the European courts 
 I have visited had happily been imported into England 
 during my absence, and banished that ostentatious im- 
 portunity which for ever reminds us that we are visi- 
 tors. In the first circles on the continent you sit with 
 the same ease as by your own fire-side. The only dan- 
 ger is, that as you enjoy all the comforts of home, it 
 is possible you may omit some of those expressions of 
 gratitude to your entertainer which the ceremonious 
 intreaties of some English ladies continually remind 
 you are expected by way of payment." 
 
 Sir Walter looked at Lady Mackintosh, and observ- 
 ed there was good sense in my lord's observation. Her 
 ladyship answered, that she could not assent to a sys- 
 tem which condemned the mistress of the house to act 
 the part of nobody in her own family. 
 
 " Much depends en the manner in which a case is 
 stated," said Lord Avondel." Suppose we sav she 
 sits with the benignant serenity of. a goddess, and re- 
 ceives the voluntary homage of those who enjoy her 
 bounty." 
 
 " Is it an unfair inference," inquired the lady, " to 
 ask, if your lordship means to represent Miss Man- 
 deville as the Goddess of Devonshire r" 
 
 •* My creed," rejoined the earl, " rejects all local 
 
 divinities, it equally abhors all undue humiliations and 
 
 painful penances; and I deny the necessity of Miss

 scension. I flatter myself that such friendship and 
 sensibility as you possess must be gratified by hearing, 
 that what your fears deemed an omission really was a 
 happy refinement." 
 
 Lady Mackintosh doubted whether the earl was 
 a man of superior discernment, or only ironical; 
 while Emily thought she should in time be quite at ease 
 in his company. " He is all benignity, all goodness 
 to me," was the remark which she made on this con- 
 versation. " He takes care that I shall not be oppress- 
 ed, either by his own commendations or the unkind- 
 ness of others. Would I had such a protector ! how 
 safe should I be under the guidance of so much wis- 
 dom and goodness." 
 
 Sir Walter took an early opportunity of sounding his 
 friend on the project to which I have already alluded. 
 He determined to lead the conversation to Emily in 
 rather an oblique way, and expressed his gratitude for 
 the verv great care and affection which Lady Mackin- 
 tosh shewed her. Lord Avpndel answered dryly, 
 that their attachment did indeed seem very extraordi- 
 nary. 
 
 "• But Emily is a very extraordinary girl," was Sir 
 Walter's reply. " Considering how few opportunities 
 she has had of improving herself, I assure you she is 
 very clever. She knows nothing but what she has 
 learned from me and her ladyship. Her fortune is now 
 four thousand a year: besides, I have declared her 
 my heiress." 
 
 Lord Avondel continued silent. 
 
 " We think her tolerably handsome," said Sir Walter. 
 The earl only said he did not consider himself a good 
 judge of beauty. 
 
 The baronet resumed. u She has however the beau- 
 tics of the mind, and I am certain she will make a ve- 
 rv valuable wife ; for I must own I am an altered man 
 since she has lived with me, and a happier too, though 
 she limits me to a pint of wine, and has the ragouts 
 spoiled that I may not eat of them. She has almost 
 broken me too of being in a passion, for I cannot bear

 to see her look miserable. I begin to think you and I 
 were too harsh when we gave up women to the devil 
 without any exceptions." 
 
 " Don't make me a party in your imprecations, Man- 
 devilie." 
 
 " Well, well, you looked what I spoke. But I was 
 thinking as you now mean to fix in England I should 
 advise you to marry." 
 
 " Nothing would so much enforce your advice as 
 your setting me the example." 
 
 " Pshaw, I am not in jest, you are twenty years 
 vounger than I am, and neither maimed nor crip- 
 pled." 
 
 " Except in my mind and fortune." 
 
 " Well, a good-tempered wife with an ample dower 
 would repair those maladies. I tell you again I am 
 serious, and I wonder a man of your good sense and 
 courage should never have sufficient resolution 
 to" 
 
 "What?" 
 
 4< Tear a worthless woman from your heart." 
 
 Avondel started; he struggled for self-command, 
 yet could only say, " Avoid that subject." A pause 
 ensued ; the well meaning Mandeviile blamed his own 
 temerity, and pressing the eari's hand, begged his 
 pardon. 
 
 " You have taken me by surprise," said the earl. 
 " It is not my heart but my memory which prevents 
 me from enjoying peace. I am not the puling, slave oi 
 love, but keenly sensible of my early wrongs. As a 
 proof, I have forborne to make any inquiries after the 
 person to whom you allude. I know not whether she 
 exist. I hope never more to hear her name ; yet I 
 owe her an obligation. She shewed me her fickle sex 
 in its most consummate duplicity, and thus taught me 
 to avoid their snares; I have never been deceived 
 since." 
 
 ** She was the only woman in the world who could 
 have used vou basely." 
 
 " And also the onlv one whose conduct could rive

 me pain. But she had many advantages to second her 
 innate power of tormenting. I was young, sanguine, 
 credulous. It was a first attachment; I had a thou- 
 sand romantic ideas of paradisaical bliss. Mercenary 
 match-makers would have said I conferred an obliga- 
 tion. There was a simplicity, a purity, an aln'iost su- 
 pernatural sweetness — Walter, I cannot bear to think — 
 I am not always thus puerile. My return to England 
 has suggested ideas of happiness, of domestic bliss"— 
 
 41 Which might still be yours r" 
 
 " Say how ? you think my fortunes desperate, but I 
 never can consent to espouse 'One of those archetypes 
 of idiotism or deformity, whom fortune perches on a 
 golden pedestal, to attract the mercenary devotees, 
 who call avarice love, and then wonder that they are 
 wretched.. My wife must have many recommenda- 
 tions besides possessing sufficient acres ior my mainte- 
 nance. She must have generosity to approve my 
 frankness, for if ever I form an honourable connec- 
 tion, the basis on my side must be the most unreserv- 
 ed and unqualified confidence." 
 
 " Weil, blow yourself up if you please, only suppose 
 yourself a lover." 
 
 u You must first find me a woman with such wealth 
 as mv wants require, and sufficient merit to engage me 
 in the task of wooing her with some wish of being 
 successful." 
 
 " I think all this very possible." 
 
 " Suppose me then giving a decent air to my bank- 
 rupt fortunes and shattered figure, the shadow of my 
 former self. Conceive me studying to be agreeable, 
 and courting her society till we were sufficiently ac- 
 quainted for me to hazard my proposals, without ap- 
 pearing impertinent." 
 
 Sir Walter rubbed his hands. " All- very well, my 
 dear Lord, now for your proposal." 
 
 "■ It requires some effrontery to state the prelimina- 
 ries even to you. The lady must possess youth, 
 wealth, personal agreeableness, elegant manners, a 
 placid temper, a superior understanding, (rated on the

 female scale) an improved taste, and a liberal heart. 
 She must also have a decided preference for me. I 
 will then tell her, that I have encumbered mv patrimo- 
 nial estate by heedless acts of private partiality and 
 public munificence, by which I have made myself 
 many implacable enemies, who hate the giver and deny 
 the gift. I will tell her loo, that as nature has unfitted 
 me for the tool of a minister, or the herald of faction, 
 my fortunes are, as respects myself, irremediable. I 
 will tell her the fatigues I have undergone and the in- 
 salubrious climes I have inhabited ; that I have engen- 
 dered many diseases which, though thty do not indi- 
 cate early death, presage a more insupportable evil, a 
 joyless, unthankful, unvalued life. And I will finish 
 my recommendatory address with saying, that the soul 
 to which this fabric is attached is fretted by a long un- 
 availing contest with injury and neglect, that I am dis- 
 gusted with the world and dissatisfied with myself. I 
 shall doubtless succeed in persuading this young, amia- 
 ble, affectionate imaginary to pass a life of solitude, 
 chagrin, and solicitude with such a misanthrope. The 
 scheme is feasible, Mandeville. Find me the woman 
 who will be proof to this, and I will make her the 
 faithful partner of all mv cares." 
 
 The blank look of disappointment which Lord 
 Avondel gradually introduced into Sir Walter's coun- 
 tenance deepened into despair before he finished his 
 description, and with a peevish " pshaw" the baronet 
 added, that he would reconcile any old maid in the 
 kingdom to celibacy by such a style of courtship. 
 u But," said he, 4< Avondel, you never shall persuade 
 me that this is your right and true self. Who that saw 
 you the other day all life and spirits, when the room 
 rang with your praises, and the heads of all you spoke 
 
 I to were turned, would suppose you to be a bankrupt 
 bashaw, a melancholy humourist, a crustv invalid." 
 Lord Avondel assured his friend that this was really 
 
 1 his every-day garb, and that whenever he w r as pleasant 
 he had a masquerade suit on.

 " The disguise," added he, " is painful, and I rejoice, 
 my good old friend, that you promise we shall live in a 
 quiet domestic way. I shall lounge over your grounds., 
 look at your pictures, study the architecture of your 
 castle, and enjoy that indolent delight which I have 
 long sacrificed to the vain hopes of doing good to 
 others." 
 
 The office of Cicerone was allotted to Emily, who 
 now resolved to summon sufficient courage to convince 
 her illustrious guest that she was not that rara avis, a 
 lady dumb from choice. But she soon found herself 
 in a most polite manner sent back to her original mo- 
 nosyllables. Her slender knowledge of the fine arts 
 was lost in the superior intelligence which she address- 
 ed, and while his lordship seemed to acquiesce in her 
 criticisms, he introduced opinions which corrected her 
 mistakes. 
 
 In compliance with her uncle's commands, she one 
 day seated herself at her harpsichord and attempted a 
 canzonet, but the conviction that she was a very indif- 
 ferent performer, exhibiting her talents to a connois- 
 seur, made her fingers weaker and her voice more tre- 
 mulous. Yet Lord Avondel appeared to listen, leaned 
 on her chair, turned over the pages of the music, prais- 
 ed her taste in selecting from the most approved mas- 
 ters, and asserted that when she had acquired more 
 self-confidence she would be a very pleasing periormer. 
 How kindly encouraging, and yet how nobiy sincere. 
 She rose with exultation to oiler her seat to Lady 
 Mackintosh, who, with coy reluctance, and all that 
 prettv affectation which attends superior skill, suffered 
 herself to be overcome by the intreaty of the company* 
 and attempted " Love's a gentle generous passion.'' 
 But die difference between real and pretended timi- 
 dity is, that as the former always supposes itself capa- 
 ble of exercising more self command than at on emer- 
 gency it finds possible, so the latter is apt to forget its 
 disguise from the eagerness with which it listens to 
 commendation. Lady Mackintosh warbled, quavered, 
 mounted, sunk, flourished, and introduced every grace,

 till she was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing 
 which unfortunately seized Lord Avondel. Water 
 was called for, but the best specific was the silence of 
 the syren. Every attempt to speak renewed his Lord- 
 ship's danger, and to avoid suffocation he was obliged 
 to change his intended compliment into a most courtly 
 bow. But the paroxysm had been so oppressive, that 
 it was not till the conversation turned to something very 
 different from music that Lord Avondel recovered his 
 powers of utterance ; and I presume a man of his high 
 breeding would have thought it indecorous to revive a 
 subject that had been so fully discussed. 
 
 Time only served to confirm Miss Maude ville's ve- 
 neration for their guest. She saw elegance in all his 
 actions ; honour, dignity, and profound wisdom, in his 
 sentiments. With equal wonder and delight she per- 
 ceived a hero condescend to trifle, and adopt that style 
 of small talk which is very unjustly called lady's con- 
 versation. But though Hercules held the distaff at 
 the court of Omphale, the lion's skin lay ready to be 
 put on, while the demi-god gracefully reclined on the 
 sofa, discussing the propriety of female ornaments or 
 criticising the exercise of female ingenuity. She ob- 
 served with pleasure, that though every common-place 
 civility and trite compliment was addressed to Lady 
 Mackintosh, his more refined attentions were paid to 
 herself. Master of every modification of polite de- 
 portment, he was never reduced to the degrading ne- 
 cessity of being unpolite to avoid being insincere. She 
 was convinced he saw her duenna's foibles : she was 
 persuaded he must dislike a character so opposite to his 
 own ; but he made no insidious attempts to betray her 
 to behave ridiculously, a popular species of wit since 
 known by the name of quizzing. The effulgence of 
 his own social talents needed no foil to increase their 
 lustre. He looked on envy and affectation with the 
 pity of a superior mind, and he scorned to extort that 
 preponderance to which he deemed himself entitled, 
 by proving the bankrupt state of mental poverty. 
 Emily believed herself a more important being from

 having spent a fortnight under the same roof with 
 Lord Avondel ; yet she could not recollect any proof 
 of his attention which age, dependence^ or deformity, 
 would not have received from so complete a gentle- 
 man, if placed in her situation. 
 
 " And what," said she to herself, " should I wish 
 for more. Weak, vain, confident girl ; did I suppose 
 Lord Avondel likely to be susceptible of my faint at- 
 tractions ! He who his travelled from court to court, 
 and seen whatever is great and fascinating in every 
 climate, was he to preserve his heart from the charm 
 of elegance and the lure of beauty to surrender it to a 
 poor ignorant country girl, awkward and unformed in 
 mind and person ; one who blunders whenever she 
 tries to be grateful, and even renders herself more 
 disgusting when (actuated by that preference which 
 would else do honour to her judgment) she attempts 
 to be very agreeable ? True, Lord Avondel never 
 laughs at me, but then he is too well-bred to laugh at 
 any one. If he thinks me more to be tolerated than 
 Lady Mackintosh it is because he prefers natural ab- 
 surdity to artificial." 
 
 Sir Walter's conclusions were very different. He 
 narrowly observed Lord Avondei's behaviour to his 
 niece, and to his own mind determined it to be so very 
 lover-like as to promise success to his project of -uniting 
 the preserver of his life with the heiress of his for- 
 tune. I must admit, the respectable veteran was so 
 much of a novice in the laws of gallantry, that the 
 common decorums which the habifs of polite life then 
 required from polite gentlemen to ladies, seemed to 
 him quite courtship enough to win the Empress Queen* 
 TIk reader will also renumber, that I am speaking of 
 those obsolete times when beauty had not been so well 
 trained and disciplined by male nonchalance as to start 
 up at the beckon of a distant partner, who dumbly 
 signified that he condescended to endure the fatigue of 
 lounging by her side down twenty couple, without dis- 
 concerting the fixed stupor of his high-bred melancholy 
 by one speech or smile. Thirty years ago it was not

 expected that the leading men of fashion should loll 
 on the ottomans with the self-contemplating quiescence 
 of an eastern sovereign, while ladies of the first dis- 
 tinction declared they were dying to sit down ; nor did 
 women of real character allow these bashaws, when 
 they broke silence, to accost them with language fit 
 only for the haram. It did not forward the success of 
 a virtuous amoroso to talk of former scrapes and de- 
 bauches, and a wife would not send compliments to 
 her husband's chere amie without being thought sple- 
 netic instead of pleasant and obliging. And though 
 Lord Avondel did not adopt the then country fashion 
 of flying alter the lady with a chair for fear she should 
 not be able to see one, or overturning the mandarins, 
 and maiming the lap-dogs, through extreme eagerness 
 to prevent a beauty from deranging the architecture of 
 her tete by stooping to pick up her fan, he certainly 
 shewed as many attentions to Emily as would furnish 
 enough of the tender for a dozen modern marriages, 
 and to convince her uncle that the sly girl had capti- 
 vated the noble soldier. 
 
 As Sir Walter had not formed his military tactics 
 by the system of Fabius, it is not surprizing that his 
 domestic arrangements always marched in quick time. 
 No sooner had he persuaded himself that Lord Avon- 
 del was as much in love as became a man of his under- 
 standing, than he resolved to try if his niece meant to 
 play the very woman by starting a few whims. He 
 might indeed have trusted to his own penetration, for 
 he read enough of her heart to discover her preference, 
 without extorting from her the confession of a predi- 
 lection, which (however commendable) is always 
 cruelly distressing to female delicacy to acknowledge. 
 Miss Mandeville's character was frank and ingenuous, 
 equally ardent and steady in her attachments, and ti- 
 unicl from inexperience and want of self-confidence. 
 ' Little address was necessary to extort its bosom secret 
 jfrotn a heart thus fashioned, especially when the in- 
 Lquirer, her respected guardian, told her he knew

 favourite wish of his heart. Sinking on her uncle's 
 shoulder, she welcomed the intelligence with tears of 
 surprise and joy, and after expressing some fears that 
 she never should deserve such good fortune, confessed 
 the whole happiness of her life depended on Lord 
 Avondel. Then recollecting herself, she shrunk with 
 terror from the discovery she had made, and extorted 
 a solemn promise from her uncle not to inflict an incu- 
 rable wound on her delicacy by a premature discovery 
 of her affection to its revered object ; a promise which 
 he readily gave, and they parted mutually satisfied 
 with each other.

 THOUGH Sir Walter was resolved to abide by the 
 promise which he had given to Emily, he thought 
 there would be no harm in just sounding Lord Avon- 
 del, to know how he stood affected. A cautious lover 
 might want a little stimulus, but as to his niece's se- 
 cret he knew women always made a parade about 
 those things, and therefore he would be very guar- 
 ded. 
 
 He soon found a good opportunity for making his 
 attack, as they enjoyed the sunshine of a fine frosty 
 morning in one of the southern apartments. " I don't 
 mean, my lord," said he, u to ask for compliments, 
 but I must say you are grown at least twenty years 
 younger since you have been with us." u My health," 
 replied the earl, " is wonderfully improved, thanks to 
 your early hours, salutary springs, relaxation from bu- 
 siness, the absence of physicians, and those tempe- 
 rate habits which you sav your Emily has intro- 
 duced." 
 
 " Your Emily has introduced !" Very good, indeed, 
 thought Sir Walter. " And I hope" said he, contin- 
 uing his attack, " that our society has done you no 
 harm ; you seem to enjoy it. This you know is li- 
 berty castle, but I observe that instead of sta\ ing in the

 why you are more cut out for a family-man than any 
 one I ever saw. I always told you, though I was an 
 ass in company, you were born for society." 
 
 " Will you always insure me such society as I find 
 in Mandeville castle V? " Yes," replied the abrupt 
 baronet, " if that would make you happy." 
 
 Lord Avondel sighed, and was silent. 
 
 " On my soul, my lord," continued his warm-heart- 
 ed friend, u I wish the castle were yours. I never 
 should have lived to possess it but for you. You have 
 won it by your sword, and by heaven it shall be

 " Sir Walter, how rash and unjust !" 
 
 " No, not unjust, I tack a little incumbrance to it." 
 
 " My generous friend, I will not affect to miscon- 
 ceive your purpose ; but as you are a man of sense 
 and principle, subdue this extravagant impulse of gra- 
 titude. It is unworthy of you in every point of view. 
 Any common trooper would have rendered you the 
 same service which my situation enabled me to per- 
 form, and you put an undue value upon a chance ben- 
 efit to require a young lady to reward it with such a 
 sacrifice." 
 
 " A sacrifice, Avondel ?" 
 
 " Yes ; recollect what I have before told you of my 
 circumstances and temper." 
 
 u But if the girl thinks differently r" 
 
 " I will not hear such a suggestion. If I were such 
 a coxcomb as to believe it possible that the young lady 
 was interested in my favour, I would quit the castle 
 immediately. I equally .abhor taking advantage of 
 your romantic generosity, and of the inexperience of 
 an amiable heiress. My enemies shall never have the 
 opportunity of saying, that having vainly tried the 
 path of ambition, I found female susceptibility a surer 
 guide to opulence, especially when a sybil of twenty 
 held the golden bough." 
 
 " Fine talking," said Sir Walter, swinging his foot 
 with a discontented air, " who is romantic now t —

 very fond of you ! I want to know, sir, what objec- 
 tions you have to my Emily l n 
 
 " None. The point between us is, she ought to 
 make strong objections to me." 
 
 " Pshaw ! What if I were to say — Well suppose 
 she makes no objections ?" 
 
 " Again I must peremptorily forbid you to use such 
 language. The delicacy of her manners convinces me 
 that she would never volunteer her affections, and the 
 disparity of our years and habits makes it impossible 
 I should be her choice if she had the liberty and the 
 power of selection. I perceive your drift, my friend : 
 the whole proposal springs from your partiality, with 
 which Miss Mandeville esteems it her duty to com- 
 ply. She is a prize to which most men, circumstanc- 
 ed as I am, would direct their attention ; but by the 
 untarnished honour of a soldier I swear, I have be- 
 haved to her with the same sacred chariness of affec- 
 tion as if she had been my daughter. I have attempted 
 neither to inflame her fancy, nor to warp her judg- 
 ment. I have neither disguised my own faults, nor 
 magnified her attractions. I have never asked myself 
 if her fortunes would repair the waste of mine, and 
 her sympathy heal the wounds of my excoriated heart. 
 I have beheld her as an insulated being, fenced round 
 by every bond of hospitality, honour, and regard for 
 her future good ; — as one with whom I could never 
 form any tie but that of friendship ; and my wishes 
 for her happiness are as pure from any intermixture of 
 self as your own. I again repeat, if the riches of 
 her ancestors were trebled in her portion, I would 
 not renounce the gratifying integrity of my present 
 feelings, for the degrading consciousness that I had 
 taken advantage of your attachment to me to make 
 those riches mine." 
 
 Sir Walter, who felt very indignant at what he con- 
 strued into a contempt for his niece, was softened by 
 1 this explanation ; and holding out his hand as a sign

 of reconciliation exclaimed, " you are a noble fellow 
 Avondel j I don't know what to make of you." 
 
 " You shall make any thing of me," replied the earl, 
 " but an avaricious doating coxcomb, who persuades 
 himself that a lovely girl is grown enamoured of his 
 sallow visage and formal figure. If I have now con- 
 vinced you, that it is not the variable opinion of the 
 million but the lasting reproaches of my own heart, 
 that I fear, I will not order my chariot, which I was 
 on the point of doing a few minutes ago." 
 
 The gentleman separated, Sir Walter, much dis- 
 concerted, at perceiving his favourite plan suspended 
 by an objection which, had it been started by any one 
 else, he would have called an artifice ; and Lord Avon- 
 del, fully resolved upon taking an early opportunity to 
 leave Castle Mandeville. 
 
 The alteration in the behaviour of the gentlemen 
 soon became apparent to Emily. Sir Walter had lost 
 his exuberant good humour and hilarity ; the dinner 
 became ill-dressed, the claret tasted of the cork, he 
 rated his" butler, and kicked his old spaniel from the 
 hearth-stone. Avondel" was silent, and absent, or 
 talked to Lady Mackintosh. 
 
 " I am betrayed," thought Emily, " and rejected; 
 I never can survive this degradation." She took the 
 earliest opportunity to ask her uncle, if any thing had 
 passed between him and Lord Avondel ? Sir Walter 
 at first answered, " nothing to the purpose ;" and then 
 owned that he had sounded him, but could make no- 
 thing out of him. 
 
 " How cruel," said Emily, " has been your kind- 
 ness, but I will shut myself from the world forever. 
 You have taught Lord Avondel to despise me." 
 
 Moved at this unusual emotion in the gentle Emily, 
 Sir W T alter intreated her to be patient, and assured her 
 Lord Avondel had a high respect for her. 
 
 " No, Sir," continued she, " I will not be beholden 
 to his pity. Proud and magnanimous as he is, I will 
 not have him persuaded to accept me."

 " No fear of that," said Sir Walter, " the man is 
 as stubborn as a mule. He will not be persuaded." 
 
 " And have you stooped to intreat him ?" said Emi- 
 ly, " have you offered me, sir? have you acknowledg- 
 ed my folly ?" 
 
 The baronet grew warm, " a pretty scrape have I 
 got into here to be rated on both sides ! Plague on 
 your fine feelings and nice notions, say I. What had 
 I to do with them ; I did not want to marry myself ; 
 and here one raves because I want to force your in- 
 clinations, and the other because I cannot manage 
 him. I tell you, girl, Lord Avondel likes you well 
 enough, I can see that, but he wont marry you." 
 
 " Dear sir, but you have not discovered my attach- 
 ment?" 
 
 " If I had, I tell you it would have done no good. 
 The world would say he married you for your fortune, 
 and you would see somebody you liked better, and a 
 vast deal of high-flown trumpery, and no sound rea- 
 sons." 
 
 Sir Walter p?.l*sed, and at last exclaimed, " 'tis a 
 noble fellow after all." Emily, 'vh°se indignation had 
 hitherto suppressed her tenderness, now burst h?*» 
 tears. Her uncle felt for her distress, but like manv 
 impetuous people, his way of shewing compassion 
 -was by being out of humour. To comfort her, he 
 assured her that she had acted very imprudently ; that 
 women ought to wait till men declared their intentions ; 
 and he concluded with lamenting the dilemma in which 
 he was placed, adding such an encomium on his friend 
 as almost justified Emily for indulging a premature 
 attachment. 
 
 " If," said she to herself, " my passion be but con- 
 cealed from the object of it, or if he have but great- 
 ness of soul enough not to despise me for mv venera- 
 tion of whatever is noble and good, I will' not only 
 submit to his rejection with patience, but I will feel a 
 sort of elevation on account of that preference, which 
 ' I will ever cherish. My dear aunt's fears for me on 
 ''my introduction into the world are now obviated

 She need not dread the mazes and allurements of the 
 rake or the worldling. The heart that is devoted to 
 an Avondel'is guarded against every wile, and proof 
 to every temptation. From principles of exalted ho- 
 nour, he may refuse to partake my fortunes, but in 
 wish, in purpose, in entire devotedness of affection, I 
 will ever be united to his." 
 
 She now considered what would be the best method 
 of confirming his delicate: generosity, and at first re- 
 solved to assume a more cold and distant manner, but 
 though she was unread in tales of love, her heart told 
 her this was the behaviour which strong affection fell 
 into so naturally that it could not be called a disguise. 
 She then determined to be very gay, and to flirt with 
 all the male visitors ; but recollecting that she 'was ill 
 at deceit, she feared her laughs would become hysteri- 
 cal, and her flirtations end in tears. Besides, was it 
 possible to impose upon a man of the earl's penetra- 
 tion ? Could she bear to degrade herself in his eyes, 
 or to lose the good opinion he professed to entertain of 
 her sense -and delicacy, by levitv. f^ 11 r-^uetrv ?

 Affairs continued in this state a few days, which 
 happhy being devoted to company, relieved the irk- 
 someness of Emily's situation. It gave her, too, an 
 opportunity of observing Lord Avondel's behaviour 
 when he mixed in society, which presented the same 
 bold but correct outline. Whether the learned, the 
 polished, the upright, or the worthy came in contact 
 with him, he still appeared better informed, more ele- 
 gant, more disinterested, more benevolent. He has 
 lefused me," said Emily, * yet still he is the first and 
 
 best of men." . . c 
 
 The family-party, were standing round the fire one 
 evening, discussing the events of a visit from which 
 they had just returned, when Lady Mackintosh blunt- 
 ly asked Lord Avondel's opinion of the master of the 
 house ; and not satisfied with a general answer, inquir- 
 ed if he considered him to be a man of penetration.

 " Certainly," replied the earl, " he is shrewd and 
 sagacious." 
 
 " And did your lordship remark what he said was 
 the best way of supporting falling fortunes?" 
 
 " It was unlucky," replied the earl, " that I should 
 be inattentive to what I might have found useful infor- 
 mation." 
 
 " O, I can repeat it. He said, when a gentleman 
 was quite worn out by disappointments with one sex, 
 it was right to direct his attention to the other. No- 
 thing is in general so easy as a matrimonial specula- 
 tion." The remark was sufficiently easy to be under- 
 stood, but she pointed it by a significant glance at 
 Emily. 
 
 For the first time since he had resided at the castle, 
 Lord Avondel was embarrassed. He had long dis- 
 covered Lady Mackintosh's latent maliciousness, but 
 the superior effrontery of this attack roused his resent- 
 ment, and excited his surprize. He was too generous 
 to look at the blushing and almost fainting Emily ; re- 
 collecting his wonted self-command he turned a firm 
 and indignant eye on her tormentor. 
 
 M And did he not proceed to name the star that 
 would guide a diffident wooer to certain success ?" 
 
 " He left that to the penetration of the person for 
 whom his advice was designed." 
 
 " Trusting, I presume, that he was acquainted with 
 the story of the Ephesian matron. I will trouble you, 
 madam, to return my compliments with many thanks." 
 
 " My dear Emily," said Lady Mackintosh, recover- 
 ing from that sort of hysterical laugh with which she 
 always affected to conceal boiling anger, " you don't 
 seem to relish raillery." 
 
 " 'Tis because, said his lordship, still avoiding to 
 look on the trembling girl, " Miss Mandeville fasti- 
 diously requires some requisites in humour with which 
 your ladyship dispenses. But I recollect why you are 
 thus severe upon me. I promised you a song this 
 morning, and I hope discharging my debt will restore 
 to you your wonted attribute of mercy." Emily's harp

 stood in the room ; he flung his hand over the chords 
 with a minstrel's fire, which he accompanied with the 
 following stanzas. 
 
 Woman, dost thou seek to gain 
 
 A captive worthy of thy sway, 
 List the minstrel's holy strain, 
 It breathe's not flattery's preans vain, 
 
 But truth's severer lay. 
 
 Warp not beauty's angel form 
 
 By affectation's vile grimace, 
 A temper free from passion's storm, 
 A heart with gentler virtues warm, 
 
 Must fix the triumphs of thy face. 
 
 Tho' that face like Hebe's glow, 
 
 Tho' in each act the grace's beam, 
 Tho' o'er thy lands Pac'tolus flow, 
 Tho' India's di'monds gem thy brow ; 
 
 Nor wealth nor beauty wakes esteem. 
 
 She asserts her sex's power 
 
 Who scorns by borrowed aids to shine, 
 
 The woodland lily's pensile flower 
 
 Transported from its native bower. 
 Shall round the crest of glory twine. 
 
 Lord Avondel bowed to Emily, and contriving 
 that the same obeisance should civilly glide to Lady 
 Mackintosh, retired the moment he had finished his 
 song. Emilv was incapable of conversation, and Lady 
 Mackintosh too much mortified to sanction Sir Wal- 
 ter's encomium on his friend's vocal powers.- He had 
 been engrossed by the old bachelor privilege of knock- 
 ing out the fire by way of improving it, and did not 
 attend to the previous altercation, therefore he did not 
 discover any peculiar meaning in the song. 
 
 Miss Mandeville's reflections this night were pecu- 
 liarly soothing. The earl's manner of supporting her 
 from Lady Mackintosh's coarse raillery was as delicate 
 as prudery could exact, as warm and generous as love 
 could require. " Surely," she began to think, " he 
 cannot be quite indifferent to me. If compassion to

 me, or a keen sense of indecorum, prompted his se- 
 vere rebuke to Lady Mackintosh, he need not to have 
 obliquely complimented me as the drooping lily. He 
 is superior to the pitiful arts of male coquetry. I 
 think he does not dislike what he has seen of my cha- 
 racter, but wishes to investigate it more clearly before 
 he commits his honour and happiness to my trust. 
 'Tis mine to shew him that I can be as firm as I have 
 been precipitate, and that I silently model my manners 
 according to his ideas of excellence, in time he must 
 love me as the reflection of himself, at least he will if 
 he resembles other men. But how difficult is it to win 
 a heart which is proof to all the snares of selfishness, 
 whether they assume the shape of avarice or vanity ?" 
 
 Emily met Lord Avondel with unusual familiarity 
 in the morning, but found him stiffened into more in- 
 vincible reserve. Lady Mackintosh recollected that 
 she had been defeated, and resolved to attack her ene- 
 my now he seemed less able to dispute the victory. 
 
 " I hope, my lord," said she, handing him the cho- 
 colate, w you did not suffer from your extraordinary 
 exertions last night. I fancy you combined the old 
 characteristic of the minstrel ; poet and musician, I 
 mean." 
 
 " I only sung a translation of one of Lady Paulina 
 Monthermer's canzonets, madam." 
 
 " Indeed, but you gave it a most superior effect by 
 your expression and look." 
 
 " Again I must be just to the author, and affirm, 
 that I am not able to give even a faint idea of the 
 commanding influence this [composition received from 
 that lady's voice, manner, and person, when she spoke 
 it as an impromptu at the Marchesa Cagliani's conver- 
 zatione." 
 
 " And pray who is this extraordinary lady ?" 
 
 M An Italian improvvisatrice, madam, but not a 
 professed one. 'Tis a talent she occasionally exercise* 
 to delight her friends. Her father was a noble Flo- 
 rentine, and she is now the wife of general Monther- 
 mer, head of the military department, and member of

 the supreme council, at the settlement of which I was 
 governor." 
 
 " Young and handsome, I suppose ?"- 
 
 " Her appearance is still very youthful. Her mother 
 was a Greek lady, and Paulina's features and person 
 exhibit that symmetry and commanding beauty which 
 one may suppose inspired a Phidias and an Apelles." 
 
 if Bless me, my lord, and accomplished too?" 
 
 " In the highest degree ; upon the whole, complete 
 mistress of every art of fascination." 
 
 " I am afraid," said Lady Mackintosh, " we must 
 say, poor General Monthermer ; such a wonderful 
 wife must be hard to manage, and I think we English 
 ladies ought to feel piqued at this decided superiority 
 being given to a foreigner." 
 
 The earl declared he was ready to be judged by 
 Emily, whether he had said any thing to pique a truly 
 English lady. 
 
 Emily replied, that they ought to respect his lordship 
 for being just to merit of every description. " If," 
 said she, "we may judge of Lady Paulina by the 
 specimen you have given us of her sentiments, she 
 claims even higher commendations than those you 
 have afforded her." 
 
 Breakfast being over Emily rose to retire. Avondel 
 pressed her hand to his lips, and with an air of grave 
 respect thanked her for all her goodness to him. How 
 unusual was this address. Confused and silent, she 
 followed Lady Mackintosh, who had already left the 
 room. 
 
 " I have a pu'-nful part to perform, my good friend," 
 said the earl to Sir Walter. " It is to thank you for 
 your noble hospitality, and to bid you farewel." 
 
 " Impos " returned the baronet, "you shall 
 
 not stir." 
 
 " My carriage waits at the gates. I durst not trust 
 myself to your importunities, till I had arranged every 
 thing for my departure. When I tell you that impe- 
 rious duty calls me hence, and whm I most truly assure 
 you that the weeks I have spent here have been the

 happiest I have long known, you will only say, go and 
 do what you ought." 
 
 M Is it public or private business that calls you from 
 us?" 
 
 " A mixture of both. I received a despatch la?t 
 night. You must not urge me." 
 
 " But when will you return ?" 
 
 " That depends upon circumstances I cannot com- 
 mand. My affairs at Avon park call for immediate 
 inspection, and I fear they will long require my pre- 
 sence." 
 
 Sir Walter paused, and then exclaimed, " what shall 
 I do with my poor little Emily." Though he uttered 
 this rather as an ejaculation than by way of asking ad- 
 vice, Lord Avondel took occasion to point out an error 
 in his treatment of that young lady. " She will be 
 one of the first fortunes in the kingdom," said he, 
 " and she is now arrived at an age when it is proper to 
 form a suitable establishment. Do not therefore con- 
 fine her from the society in which she ought to mix." 
 
 " Whv, don't I take her every where ?" resumed 
 the baronet. " The Mandevilles 'always lived splen- 
 didly, and I keep open house. I give dinners to the 
 hunt, and invite all the officers. We visit every body 
 within twenty miles, and she goes to all the concerts, 
 races, and balls, my four horses can drag her to. And 
 to jell you the truth, one reason why I have my Lady 
 Mackintosh here is to go out with her, for she has very 
 good health, and is not afraid of having her neck brok- 
 en over our hills by moonlight." 
 
 Lord Avondel smiled. "Transplant your fair 
 charge," said he, " to London : that is the sphere in 
 which the heiress of two illustrious families must in 
 future move. Let me add, suffer her to shine without 
 her attending satellite." 
 
 " Why Lady Mackintosh knows the world." 
 
 " The' world is a vague phrase, my good friend, and 
 often intimates a narrow limit. Of this I am persuad- 
 ed, Lady Mackintosh's world affords no attractions for 
 f your good little Emily."

 " I observe," Said Sir Walter with a sigh, " you and 
 her ladyship seldom agree in your opinions." 
 
 " We have moved in different circles," replied the 
 earl coldly, " but let us confine ourselves to a subject 
 infinitely more interesting, the happiness of Miss Man- 
 deville." 
 
 " Pshaw ! Avondel, that cannot be interesting to 
 you, or you would not behave as you have done." 
 
 " Sir Walter," returned the earl, would you not think 
 it unjust to persuade your niece to sign a deed which 
 transferred her estate to a stranger, without fully ap- 
 prizing her of the legal consequences ? It would be 
 still more unjust to entrammel her person by an indis- 
 soluble connection, before she had ascertained the ex- 
 tent of her pretensions, or exercised the powers of 
 discriminating between various pretenders. A fox- 
 hunting debauchee, or an adventurer in a red coat, wil- 
 ling as they might be to wed your acres, cannot offer 
 your niece a heart worthy her acceptance. Even such 
 such a one as myself may deserve her preference, op- 
 posed to such rivals. Shew her men of rank and fa- 
 shion, of years, tempers, and fortunes suitable to her 
 own, and suffer her unbiased judgment to decide. 
 When a chaperon is wanted choose one who has dis- 
 cretion and address, not an incumbrance in the shape 
 of a protectress. The dowager of our iate general, 
 the Marquis of Glenvorne, strikes me as one who 
 would be a real friend and able adviser. I knew her 
 and her son at Florence ; you can need no introduc- 
 tion to her, and Miss Mandeville will soon gain her 
 favour." 
 
 " Why our estates join," exclaimed the baronet. 
 
 " Indeed," replied Avondel, and suppressing a sigh 
 added, " that is fortunate, the young man is worthy 
 and amiable." 
 
 Sir Walter now silently contemplated the figure he 
 should make in London parties, and wishing for some 
 further inducements to reconcile him to his own outre 
 appearance, asked if he should see Lord Avondel in 
 town r

 " Nothing can be more uncertain than my destina- 
 tion,' 1 replied the earl. " But cheer up, my brave ve- 
 teran. No one is ridiculous who walks uprightly in 
 the path of duty. You have not feared balls and bul- 
 lets, you have stormed camps and castles, and are you 
 appalled at the shafts of ridicule, or afraid of the mis- 
 sile deaths which lurk in the frowns of an incensed 
 dowager at a card-table when you have lost the odd 
 trick ? 
 
 " I remember the time," said sir Walter brightening 
 at his friend's raillery, " that this very Marchioness 
 told her friends, I might if I chose be a very fine gen- 
 tleman." 
 
 " I fear," said the earl, rising, " 'tis too late in life 
 for either of us to change our characters, let us then 
 endeavour to preserve them untainted." He sighed 
 deeply as he spoke, and wringing his friend's hand em- 
 phatically exclaimed ; " Fareweli may Miss Mande- 
 ville's sun rise auspiciously and your's set with tran- 
 quillity." 
 
 " You will lenve us, then ?" said Sir Walter.— 
 " Stay till I call Emily." 
 
 " I have taken leave of her," replied Avondel, and 
 hastily threw himself into the chariot. 
 
 This sudden departure produced universal dismay ; 
 but if Miss Mandeville read in it the destruction of 
 her newly excited hopes, she also received from it a 
 confirmation of her long-cherished passion. His part- 
 ing advice, which, with his wonted frankness, the 
 baronet communicated to her, exalted his character to 
 an eminence which almost seemed fabulous. She 
 could no longer hope, and scarcely wished her attach- 
 ment to be concealed from its object, for she felt that 
 her delicacy was safe in his guardianship. The adroit- 
 ness with which he had avoided a formal adieu, which 
 must have made her partiality more conspicuous, the 
 concern he expressed for her welfare, the care he had 
 taken to preserve her from those improprieties which 
 i attend inexperience at its first introduction into the 
 // world, by recommending her to an adviser of such

 untainted reputation and fashionable celebrity as the 
 Marchioness of Glenvorne, all argued such disinte- 
 restedness and magnanimity, that she almost wished 
 every sentiment of her heart were entrusted to his 
 consummate generosity. " Surely," said she, " he 
 is an exception to the proverb, that men always des- 
 pise an easy conquest." 
 
 Though her former expectations of the pleasures a 
 London winter affords, had changed to indifference, not 
 to say disgust, for any scene in which Lord Avondel did 
 not appear, she determined to urge her uncle to exe- 
 cute the plan he had advised, with a secret hope that 
 this compliance with her hero's advice would intimate 
 her entire devotion to his will. She sometimes thought 
 this excursion was proposed merely as a trial of her 
 constancy, and she was willing to stake the future hap- 
 piness of her life on the durability of her attachment. 
 
 If any thing agreeable was connected with the idea 
 of her journey, it was being delivered from the so- 
 ciety of Lady Mackintosh, who had been more desi- 
 rous to secure herself a future establishment and pre- 
 sent accommodation than to prevent Emily from 
 forming improper connections. Her zeal to prevent 
 the young lady's introduction to her uncle had, indeed, 
 apparently changed to violent professions of attach- 
 ment, but she always saw in the acknowledged heiress 
 a Hushai come to defeat the counsels of Achitophel. 
 The attractions of real gentleness and sincere tender- 
 ness are never so strongly felt, as when they are con- 
 trasted with plausibility and over-strained suavity. — 
 Sir Walter soon shewed a preference for his good lit- 
 tle girl, and the former favourite, discovering that the 
 present could only be displaced by a permanent con- 
 nection, craftily endeavoured to betray her into one 
 which would eventually degrade her in her uncle's 
 eyes. The characters which Lord Avondel alluded to 
 in his speech to Sir Walter, were therefore encouraged 
 to become bold pretenders to the heiress of Castle 
 JMandeville, though their manners were too common- 
 place, and their mode of attack too mean, to deserve

 being recorded in this narrative. Suffice it to observe, 
 that even diffidence possesses some degree of con- 
 scious dignity, and simplicity is not quite destitute of 
 discernment. The manner in which Emily treated 
 Lady Mackintosh's worthy friends was not unnoticed 
 by Lord Avondel, than whom no one better under- 
 stood, or more strictly enforced the laws of female de- 
 corum. 
 
 Disappointed in her own views of matching her 
 friend to some worthless fortune-hunter, who would 
 reward her for the introduction, Lady Mackintosh next 
 considered if she could turn the young lady's visible 
 predilection for Lord Avondel, and Sir Walter's anxie- 
 ; ty to accomplish a union between his niece and friend, 
 ( to her own advantage. This event, she knew, must 
 considerably diminish the golden harvest of which she 
 had once entertained such sanguine hopes, but she 
 thought that by narrowly watching the marriage writ- 
 ings she might secure to Sir Walter the power of 
 making a good settlement. To this purpose, in all her 
 tete-a-tetes with him, she pathetically lamented the 
 evil consequences of present possessors fettering them- 
 selves with such legal ties as prevented them from im- 
 proving future contingencies. No one, she said, knew 
 how a match would turn out. Manv people were not 
 what they seemed to be. There was no tolling what 
 at some future time we might want ourselves ; and 
 lastly, uncles and fathers were never so respected as 
 when they kept the staff in their own hands. 
 
 The uncommon turn of Lord Avondel's character 
 prevented Sir Walter from profiting by these sige con- 
 clusions. He had absolutely declined opening his 
 arms to receive a charming girl who adored him. 
 Emily then was doomed to singleness, ot course would 
 never quit her uncle : and Lady Mackintosh must di- 
 rect her artillery to some less-guarded citadel, as she

 her son, who, having long possessed a lucrative appoint- 
 ment in India, was desirous of enjoying the fortune 
 he had acquired by taking a wife and forming a splen- 
 did establishment. It is well known that a dowager can- 
 didate for hymenial advancement, who, like Addison's 
 widow, means to have a settlement in every county in 
 England, somewhat resembles an universal philanthro- 
 pist. " Rutilians, Trojans, are the same to her," and 
 her heart can vibrate from soldier to sailor, from the 
 landed to the mercantile interest. She had heard that 
 Mr. Caddy intended to marry as soon as he got to Eng- 
 land, and she resolved she would no longer waste her 
 Circassian bloom, or frizzle her auburn caxon, among 
 the insensibles. 
 
 The day after Lord Avondel's departure, she in- 
 formed Sir Walter how much she regretted, that she 
 was not able any longer to deny Mrs. Caddy's request 
 of meeting her long absent son. The baronet, thus 
 happily relieved from the difficulty of intimating to a 
 lady, that she must shift her quarters, declared. his vex- 
 ation at finding he must remove too, as business had 
 called him and Emily to London. Lady Mackintosh 
 now offered to defer her visit till his return, as her 
 physican had prescribed London to her this spring to 
 restore the elasticity of her nerves, which had been un- 
 braced by sorrow and confinement. No hint was given 
 that a trio would be acceptable to the Mandevilles ; 
 and though she also recollected, that the world might 
 think it indecorous in her to throw herself in the Na- 
 bob's way, Emily never assisted her delicacy with one 
 request that she would continue to act as her guardian. 
 The friends therefore separated, but I must record 
 Lady Mackintosh's parting benediction : " Conquest 
 attend you, my dear love, and may you find the jessa- 
 mines less impenetrable than the greybeards."''

 " I blush to think what I have said. 
 " But fate has wrested this confession from me ; 
 " Go on and prosper in the paths of honour, 
 " Thy virtue will excuse my passion for thee." 
 
 Addison. 
 
 MISS Mandeville recollected that her correspond- 
 ence with her aunt had been suspended during Lord 
 Avondel's residence at the castle, and she resolved to 
 renew it previous to her departure on her London ex- 
 pedition ; she accordingly addressed to her the follow- 
 ing letter. 
 
 " To Lady Selina Delamore. 
 
 " Castle Mandeville, February 
 18th, 1779. 
 " Our plans are again altered, my dearest aunt. Sir 
 Walter is determined to shew me London. He has 
 taken a house in Berkky square, where we are to con- 
 tinue till the end of May. I must not think of leav- 
 ing him, but I hope to be allowed to spend part of next 
 summer at Lime Grove. 
 
 " We have had a most interesting visitor at the cas- 
 tle, of whom, when we meet, I shall have much to say. 
 If the world resembled him, it would not be that intri- 
 cate and dangerous labyrinth which all who have trod- 
 den its mazes describe. For myself, the first wish of 
 my soul is retirement. I know I am unequal to the 
 busy conflict of public life ; the envious and malicious 
 will wound my heart, the confident will oppress me. I 
 know not which I shall most feel, the sarcasms of 
 others, or the self-reproach which my errors and inad- 
 vertencies will perpetually excite. I wish this Lon- 
 ' y don introduction were over, and that I were again un-

 der your kind protection. Of one thing, however, be 
 assured, my. heart is perfectly safe from- the assaults of 
 fops and libertines. It has aimed highly, my dearest 
 aunt, and now it is invulnerable ; and who that has had 
 an opportunity of observing you can attach ridicule 
 and discontent to the single state, or uselessness to re- 
 tirement? True, you are dejected, but I will never be- 
 lieve your sorrows are the result of folly or miscon- 
 duct. I will not press you upon a point on which I 
 have often heard you say you could not be communica- 
 tive, but the hard treatment which you and other wor- 
 thy people meet with, is one reason why I hate the 
 world. 
 
 " But I shall forget one principal reason for writing 
 to you. It is to ar,'c if you know the Marchioness of 
 Glenvornc ? I am to solicit her protection. I have 
 lately taken a dislike to chaperons and female friends : 
 I mean such as one generally meets with, not to siu h a 
 friend as she who took me into her care, a wayward, 
 sickly, neglected orphan, who cherished me with in- 
 cessant attention, and to whose wisdom and goodness 
 I owe the few commendable qualities I possess. 
 
 " My uncle lives in too hospitable a style to allow 
 me to cultivate accomplishments. I send you the only 
 drawing I have been able to finish, but I must explain 
 its history. A gentleman was praising the lily of the 
 valley, and said it was worthy to twine round the crest 
 of glory. It was only in a song, my dear aunt, so 
 there was nothing in it ; but I thought the idea was 
 elegant, and I wished to embody it. But pray don't 
 suppose the figure of glory like this gentleman ; in- 
 deed it has not the most distant resemblance. The 
 performance is wretched, but you will value it as mine. 
 
 « Write to me, my dearest aunt, and inform me 
 most particularly of yout own health and spirits. Re- 
 member me to the two doctors, to Wilson, and all your 
 little suite. I am afraid they would not now call me 
 the sprightly columbine. It is this excursion which so 
 depresses my spirits ; yet I must go. My uncle's af- 
 fection for me increases every hour, and I revere his

 integrity and untutored worth. Yet, my best friend, I 
 now more particularly need the soothing tenderness 
 with which you always treated your ever gi-ateful and 
 affectionate 
 
 " Emily Mandeville." 
 
 There needed no ghost to tell Lady Selina, that the 
 medium through which her niece now looked at the 
 world was a mist raised by that knave Cupid ; or to 
 connect the interesting visitor with the figure of glory, 
 which, though laboured with all Emily's little skill, was 
 not sufficiently like Lord Avondel to be recognised by 
 an old acquaintance. Lady Selina's anxiety for her 
 beloved girl was, however, much relieved by hearing 
 that she had aimed highly, and she trusted there was 
 so much meaning in the allusion to the lily, that her dear 
 Emily would soon find she lived in a very tolerable sort 
 of a world. She was convinced of her rectitude, pru- 
 dence, and delicacy, and highly approved the wisdom, 
 as well as the kindness, of Sir Waiter's intention of 
 introducing her to the circles in which she was born to 
 move. It was a scheme which she had long meditat- 
 ed, nor were ill health and broken spirits the only ob- 
 stacles to its execution. Years of seclusion had robbed 
 her of almost all her early connections, and from the 
 few by whom she was remembered Emily would reap 
 no advantage by appearing under her auspices. 
 
 Knowing that there is no surer method of confirm- 
 ing an attachment than to argue against it, Lady Selina 
 took no farther notice of her niece's chagrin than to 
 ascribe it to some little perplexity arising from Lady 
 Mackintosh, ol whose impertinence Emily had for- 
 merly complained. " London air, my love," said she, 
 " is an excellent specific for the spleen, which is en- 
 gendered by associating with country gossips, and I 
 am convinced Lady Glenvorne will soon remove your 
 disgust to chaperons. You will find her the true wo- 
 man of fashion ; polite, liberal, correct in her princi- 
 ples, av.d engaging in her b« haviour. I will not depre 
 \ ciate the advantages, disguise the inconveniencies, or

 deny the duties of celibacy, or retirement, but the 
 very circumstances of our existence tells us, that few 
 people can live entirely lor themselves. At your age, 
 Emily, I little thought I should have passed through 
 life unconnected. With gratitude to Providence, I 
 acknowledge the many comforts I have experienced, 
 but, as far as temporal felicity is considered, my lot 
 has been much less enviable than lady Glenvorne's, 
 who was once my intimate companion. Nor can I, in 
 the fulness of my affection, wish }'ou better fortune, 
 than to be united to a man who resembles the deceased 
 Marquis in every thing but his early death. 
 
 " You are not wrong, Emily, to aim highly, in 
 every sense of the word ; for though rank and fortune 
 are not synonymous with happiness, if we are. born in 
 an elevated station we cannot innocently submit to 
 self-degradation without some most urgent reasons. 
 We ought not, then, to indulge ourselves in using 
 common-place invectives against the infelicities which 
 we discover in our lot. It has been chosen for us by 
 a Being Infinitely good and wise, who does not expect 
 from the prince the mechanical industry of the manu- 
 facturer, or from the children of rank and affluence 
 the contemplative exercises of a recluse. The fortune 
 of your ancestors has devolved to you to call you to a 
 life of benevolence, generosity, and exertion, and in 
 choosing your future partner you are bound, not mere- 
 ly to consider, whether he be pleasing to yourself, but 
 also, whether he be disposed, to act as a righteous 
 steward of those valuable talents which you will trans- 
 mit to his trust? We are not, I conceive, at liberty to 
 point out the situation in which we should have been 
 happier, unless it be one that we have forfeited through 
 our own vice or folly, and then we may allude to it as 
 a humiliating source of self-reproach, not as a topic of 
 discontent. Every class in society, and every indivi- 
 dual in each class, has his peculiar trials and tempta- 
 tions, virtues and vices, jovs and sorrows. The pee- 
 vish wordling, and the religious enthusiast, looking 
 only at a part, falsely determines the world to be the

 don of misery, and its inhabitants a mass of depravi- 
 ty. The liberal and the devout see much of real en- 
 joyment in this life, and in their fellow creatures many 
 remains of that original perfection in which their spe- 
 cies was created. We indulge our passions, my love, 
 till nothing but uninterrupted happiness will suit our 
 craving appetites. We set out in life expecting others 
 to pay us the same attention which self love tells us is 
 our due. Our fellow travellers are instigated by simi- 
 lar motives. Competitors for fame or fortune justle, 
 and then become enemies, and we afterwards quarrel 
 with our contemporaries because they too much resem- 
 ble ourselves. 
 
 " Do not, my dearest Emilv, dislike the world from 
 a supposition that it has injured me. I am in most 
 perfect charity with every creature ; nor do I take to 
 myself any merit in this ; for I have nothing to com- 
 plain of. My lot has been singular. I have been 
 called to sustain hard trials. I have fallen far short 
 of the submission which I ought to have exercised, and 
 yet I have been commended for patience. I have of- 
 ten too been accused of misdeeds of which I am inno- 
 cent. If my story were known, I should appear in a 
 very different light, and must give up the credit in one 
 instance which I should acquire in another. I believe 
 we are much oftener mistaken in our opinion of our 
 neighbours, than censorious through malice. That in- 
 nate attachment to what is perfect, fair, and good, 
 which is still discernible in fallen man, impels us spon- 
 taneously to condemn error and depravity, and in our 
 eagerness to pay what we feel to be an easy homage to 
 virtue, we do not wait to be fully acquainted with 
 those minute particulars which would enable us to be 
 correct in our decision. Indeed, our finite faculties 
 disqualify us for the office of censor, for the grave 
 closes on many a concealed excellence and many an 
 undiscovered crime.

 but I am not anxious to have you excel in mere accom- 
 plishments. It is no misfortune or disgrace to wa»t

 what is termed genius, it is a dreadful offence to mis- 
 apply it; for correct taste and a capacious intellect 
 must at least affect pure moral feeling,- and the artist 
 who embodies, or the poet who conceives, what is 
 truly beautiful and sublime, must be a practical hypo- 
 crite if he be a slave to gross or mean passions, I may 
 further add, they must have broken through more 
 barriers than unenlightened common-place characters; 
 for the acute sensations which teach us to execute or to 
 imagine what is most exalted and attractive, are all in- 
 tended as preservatives from vice. 
 
 " This long letter, my dear child, is the most satis- 
 factory proof I can give that I am well and cheerful ;

 linquishing your society to him who has a natural as 
 well as a legal right to require it. You are bound 
 to repay his fond affection for you by making all can- 
 did allowances for his infirmities, and ministering to 
 the wants of his declining years. If, consistently 
 with your other duties, you can devote a few weeks

 beautiful girl, who had long been dying for the very- 
 Adonis whom the merciless Emily vanquished with a 
 look. The reader will conceive (especially if that 
 reader be a young beauty) how wretched Miss Man- 
 deville's murderous attractions made her, and how, 
 notwithstanding her sincere determination never to 
 disturb the peace of mankind, she went on slaughter- 
 ing like the French Invincibles. Or should the eye 
 which glances over these pages dart its unlustrous 
 beams over the faded cheek of some love-lorn damsel, 
 let her be consoled bv my assuring her, that, at the 
 end of this historv, when I have married Emily to 
 my satisfaction, I shall oblige all her discarded swains 
 to find out the ladies who have long secretly adored 
 them, and lead them to the hymeneal altar in succes- 
 sion ; because all novelists and dramatists are compel- 
 led to enrich the world with a large colony of happy 
 pairs a little inferior to the hero and heroine in wealth, 
 virtue, and felicity. But being at this instant busy 
 with my principal plot, I will not (though I know it is 
 the custom) introduce long episodes, but will faithfully 
 promise, if I should happen to fill my prescribed num- 
 ber of sheets without the aid of supplementary matter, 
 that the thirteenth edition of this work shall be en- 
 riched with many new personages, all, like the chief 
 character, copied from real life. 
 
 I am, however, compelled to mention one conquest 
 which Miss Mandeville made soon after her arrival in 
 London, the young Marquis of Glenvorne ; an event 
 which has perhaps been anticipated, as I have already 
 premised that their estates joined, and that Emily 
 really was an engaging, unassuming, unaffected, young 
 woman. The Marchioness very cheerfully accepted 
 the office which she had been requested to assume, of 
 guiding the inexperienced fair through the maze of 
 what is so emphatically and justly called life ; and this 
 gave the young nobleman an opportunity of observing 
 that the Devonshire heiress possessed more sweetness, 
 delicacy, and ingenuous modesty, than he had ever 
 ''met with. He soon grew enamoured, and anxious to 
 secure the prize from a host of competitors he hazard-

 cd an early declaration. Finding a common rejection 
 would not discourage him from perseverance, or satis- 
 fy his mother, who (equally anxious for the connec- 
 tion) begged to know what objections could be made 
 to her son, Emily frankly pleaded a pre-engagement. 
 The marquis was staggered at this avowal. He knew 
 the young lady had passed her early years in almost 
 total solitude ; he also knew the neighbourhood round 
 Mandeville Castle, and judged it contained no rival 
 formidable enough to extinguish his hopes. There 
 was no dangerous-looking visitant who frequented 
 Berkley square ; and would any one who had preten- 
 sions to such a treasure be so heedless as to leave it 
 unguarded! Surely, there was something Jesuitical in 
 the lady's apparent frankness ? She had conceived 
 some prejudice against him, which not choosing to 
 avow, she pleaded an objection that most men would 
 admit was insurmountable. He felt sincerely attached 
 to her, and he trusted a more intimate knowledge of 
 his character would remove her distaste. He there- 
 fore begged to be still considered as a friend, and as- 
 sured her that though he would nevtr pain her by 
 his solicitations, he must secretly cherish hopes, and 
 would never attempt to subdue his attachment, till 
 he saw her in the possession of another, or heard 
 the enviable man she so highly honoured assert 
 his prior claim. Indeed, the Marquis had many rea- 
 sons to feel confidence in the valadity of his own 
 pretensions. He was young, rich, agreeable in his 
 person, lively and polished in his manners, and irre- 
 proachable in his conduct. He was enough in love 
 to gratify femaie vanity, and yet not so desperately 
 attached to a woman who rejected his offers as to bring 
 any imputation on his good sense. He was also an 
 affectionate, attentive son, and was generally spoken 
 of as so likely to convey happiness with rank and for- 
 tune, that the offer of his hand would not have been 
 rejected except by one who had romantically pondered 
 on the faultless image of perfection till she fell in iove 
 with Lord Avondel,

 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 u Indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly 
 frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory ; this most ex- 
 cellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'er-hanging firma- 
 ment, this majestic roof, fretted with golden fire, why it appears 
 no other thing to me than a foul pestilential congregation of va- 
 pours. Man delights not me, — nor woman neither." 
 
 Shakespeare. 
 
 BEING, like my heroine, much attached to what 
 is mysterious and sublime, I must now abandon all 
 other characters and attend Lord Avondel to his pa- 
 ternal mansion. 
 
 Nature had formed the mind of this nobleman in 
 one of her most capacious moulds, and all who saw 
 him early in life pronounced him born alike for honoura- 
 ble celebrity and domestic felicity. He had just obtain- 
 ed possession of his estate when he became attached 
 to a lady, whose merit and beauty counterbalanced the 
 the objection which his friends might form to the 
 smallness of her fortune ; and this was still further ob- 
 viated by her prudence and retired habits. Their 
 union was determined upon, the day was fixed, and 
 the earl set out for Avon Park to prepare for the recep- 
 tion of his bride. The separation was to be very 
 short, and the intended bridegroom indulged in all 
 those dreams of perfect felicity which a marriage, con- 
 tracted under the happiest auspices, could suggest to 
 a sanguine temper, animated by a strong attachment 
 to a lovely amiable object. Such was Lord Avondel's 
 situation, when he received a letter from the woman 
 he thus idolized, to tell him this dream of happiness 
 was at an end, that she was imperiously compelled to 
 renounce him for ever; and that as she should never 
 . see or hear from him more, she called upon him, as 
 he valued his honour and his peace, to forget her, and

 from that moment consider himself liberated from a 
 most unhappy engagement. He hastened to her resi- 
 dence ; it had been only a temporary one. She and 
 her servants were gone, and had left no clue to discover 
 her retreat. Her letter seemed to be dictated by the 
 deepest anguish of mind, but whether it were the an- 
 guish of guilt or of sorrow he knew not. It was a 
 dreadful mystery, but ft still remained an undiscovered 
 one, as from that moment he had neither seen nor 
 heard of her proceedings or abode. 
 
 A disappointment so unexpected, so inexplicable, 
 stamped an indelible impression on Lord Avondel's 
 character. To petryfying surprise succeeded the deep- 
 est dejection. Somewhat of indignation, however, 
 mingled with his regret. Among the various unfound- 
 ed conjectures to which this incident gave birth, envy 
 and censoriousness circulated a report, that passion had 
 transgressed the bounds of virtue, and compelled the 
 lady to a temporary retirement. Conscious of inno- 
 cence, Lord Avondel silently left the improbable ca- 
 lumny to refute itself. But a thought shot across his 
 mind : — could that angel countenance, where purity 
 seemed to sit blushing at her own attractions, be in- 
 deed the vizor of specious blandishment, the treacher- 
 ous appendage of a polluted person and contaminated 
 soul ? and was this obscure elopement the impulse of 
 contrition, or the stern injunction of necessity, shud- 
 dering at impending discovery, and fearing to plunge 
 into aggravated guilt ? Away with the unworthy 
 thought ! If fiends can speak and look like the holy 
 inhabitants of heaven, what avails discernment. 
 
 Lord Avondtl was not one of those meek, tranquil 
 characters-, who can fold the arms of patience over a 
 bosom throbbing with anguish. Domestic life was now 
 a vacuum, England was a desert. His country's ban- 
 ners were flying on the continent, and under their mar- 
 tial shade he might forget the lover in the soldier. 
 Impelled by a powerful desire of sacrificing that life 
 nobly which he had ceased to value, he joined the al- 
 lied army, while his wrongs and sorrows furnished

 conversation for every tea-table in London, and re- 
 busses and acrostics no longer pretended to involve the 
 polite world in superlative perplexity. 
 
 I have alreadv stated, that his merit soon obtained 
 the distinctions which he sought, but his bright career 
 had nearly been interrupted. After supper one even- 
 ing in the mess-room, when the bottle had circulated 
 freely, an officer mentioned the name of the mother of 
 Lord Avondel's recreant bride among the disreputable 
 characters of her time. The enthusiasm of an unsub- 
 dued attachment urged him to defend the lady's repu- 
 tation. High words ensued ; they ended in a chal- 
 lenge, but the consequences were prevented by their 
 general's ordering them both under an arrest. He re- 
 moved it next morning, and told Lord Avondel, in 
 friendly confidence, that the cause he meant to have 
 espoused was indefensible. The horrid suggestion I 
 have before alluded to, now returned with tenfold vio- 
 lence. The lady who had deserted him had certainly 
 been educated under the immediate auspices of this 
 infamous mother. If he had subsequently associated 
 with those women who blend the characters of good 
 and beautiful, his native candour would have resisted 
 the injurious suspicion, in spite of the irritation inci- 
 dent to such deep sorrows and unprovoked wrongs. 
 But a camp rarely exhibits any trait of female excel- 
 lence. His next residence was in a dissipated Italian 
 court, and there he finished that dark outline of treache- 
 ry, folly, licentiousness, and caprice, to which his proud 
 and lacerated heart affixed the name of woman. 
 
 The man who has quarrelled with one half of his 
 species is seldom on very good terms with the other, 
 especially if he has allowed himself to believe that he 
 is himself a being of a superior order. In reality, 
 Lord Avondel's merit was duly appreciated by the 
 government he served, and the society with which he 
 associated ; but his early disappointment had made 
 him one of those not uncommon characters in high 
 // life, who, with great apparent gentleness and urbanity, 
 i are really hard to please. He measured human na-

 ture by the standard of perfection, and whatever fell 
 below it he beheld with pity, indifference, or contempt. 
 He was, however, prevented by a regard for his own 
 character, from exposing those sentiments. " He 
 would be great, was not without ambition," and having 
 obtained the reputation of being the best bred man in 
 Europe, he took care to restrain every expression 
 which would invalidate his title to that distinction. 
 Though pride was his ruling passion, it was not pure 
 from the mean alloy of vanity, and with all his affected 
 preference for retirement, he was born for a public life. 
 Its difficulties exercised his great qualities, and his 
 noble avarice pointed not at wealth but at fame. 
 Though apparently indifferent to his own praises, no 
 music was so grateful to his ear, and his dislike of 
 others was always disarmed by flattery, or a conviction 
 that the offender was attached to his person. So insa- 
 tiable was his thirst of distinction, that it often counter- 
 acted his self-esteem, and the passion of being first in 
 every company so far possessed him, that had some 
 extraordinary chance placed him in a group of rustics, 
 like " mighty Csesar he would have been the best 
 wrestler on the green," rather than have passed unre- 
 garded. Conscious of his weakness in this particular, 
 he was scrupulous in the choice of his companions. 
 He formed few friendships ; he distrusted the world 
 too much to have anv confidant, and having been early 
 robbed of those blessings which would have softened 
 his high indignant spirit, his chief aim through life was 
 to seek and guard " the bubble of reputation." 
 
 In pursuit of this fancied good, he had sacrificed 
 much of his paternal fortune to munificent, patriotic 
 and splendid actions. He had by this incurred the 
 common lot of obliging some worthy and grateful peo- 
 ple, he had also armed ingratitude and knavery with 
 the power of doing him injuries. He suffered this 
 latter circumstance to dwell too much upon his mind, 
 without considering that those who aim at popularity 
 should be prepared to encounter rebuffs. The emolu- 
 ments of his appointments proved inadequate to the

 largeness of his soul, and as he felt equally incapable 
 of checking the impulse of policy or beneficence, he 
 saw for himself no future alternative but poverty or 
 dependence. To the latter he could not submit; re- 
 putation, honour, truth, attachment to his beloved 
 country, all forbade his becoming the tool of power. 
 The former he fancied he could bear — indeed, his per- 
 sonal wants were few : plain in his habits, temperate 
 in his enjoyments, and utterly void of all expensive 
 vices, he only wanted to be transported to those times 
 when eulogists, content with cameleon's food, crowded 
 the bare halls of honourable poverty, to have been per- 
 sonally contented with " the hermit's maple dish and 
 beechen bowl unstained with wine," to laugh at all the 
 wants and to despise all the enjoyments of luxury. 
 
 In this disposition he landed in England, disgusted 
 with the world, though it had paid him for his 
 waste of time and fortune by a large return of the coin 
 he most valued ; disgusted with ministry, but not on 
 account of his recall ; for the deranged state of his 
 finances compelled him to wish to be removed from 
 that station, where the grandeur of his views and the 
 steady integrity of his principles made him act rather 
 like a guardian angel, devoted to the service ol others, 
 than as a mercenary adventurer bent on securing his 
 own emolument. Neither did his dissatisfaction at 
 government arise from disapprobation of their mea- 
 sures, nor yet from their not having given him some 
 lucrative sinecure as a reward for his services. On 
 the contrary, he approved of their general plans, and 
 as he scorned to avow his wants, so he estimated his 
 services too highly to believe they couid be repaid by 
 a pecuniary reward. His resentment arose from some

 acquired indolence, as to hurry to London, with a 
 view of influencing all his connections to unite in the 
 defence of his friend. Certainly, his motives were more 
 honourable than his services were apparent, but grati- 
 tude was a predominant feature in Lord Avondel's 
 mind, and his attachments, though few, were indelible. 
 The ennui which ill health and want ot occupation had 
 considerably increased during his voyage, was much 
 dissipated by his residence at Mandeville Castle. He 
 saw there characters widely different from those he had 
 lately mixed with ; they required no study and little 
 precaution. He had only to appear amiable and agree- 
 able, and to drink largely not merely of the draught of 
 adulation but also of the more grateful beverage of 
 admiration and love. For let it not be supposed that 
 a man of Lord Avondel's penetration could long mis- 
 take the language of Emily's downcast eyes, or not 
 feel gratified at a conquest so flattering to self-esteem. 
 Yet the paeans of triumphant vanity could not make 
 him insensjble to the claims of honour. He knew his 
 character would suffer in the estimation of the world, if 
 he were suspected of having surreptitiously stolen the 
 affections of an inexperienced, wealthy heiress, who, 
 when she gave him her heart, seemed as much circum- 
 scribed as Eve was in her choice of Adam. He revolt- 
 ed from the idea of injustice to the young lady, from 
 stooping to mean expedients to repair his fortune, and 
 from the danger of entrusting his honour and his peace 
 to the guardianship of a fair novice, whose extreme 
 simplicity of mind and manners might change into 
 levity or folly when she mixed with the world. He 
 determined, therefore, whatever might be the issue, to 
 avoid all self-reproach, by preserving a manner rather 
 paternal than amatory. 
 
 Still, however, her society pleased, and her partiali- 
 ty soothed, him. None of his perfections were over- 
 looked ; his exalted sentiments were never uttered to 
 the winds if Miss Mandeville was present. She re- 
 corded all his opinions, she wept for his past dangers, 
 she felt for all his wrongs. This really was very capti-

 vating in a woman who could give not only competen- 
 cy but affluence to her husband. This woman too was 
 young, docile, gentle, almost even to his fastidious 
 fancy beautiful. There were traits in her countenance 
 which reminded him of one he wished he could forever 
 forget. He regretted he had discovered a resemblance, 
 and now believed it only consisted in the same general 
 expression of sensibility and delicacy. Insensibly he 
 grew happier. All men were not unjust, perhaps all 
 women were not faithless, wayward, and capricious. 
 He was awaked from this agreeable reverie by Sir 
 Walter's proposal, and Lady Mackintosh's hinting that 
 he was publicly suspected of a design on Emily. He 
 no longer allowed himself to consider what was sooth- 
 ing to his own feelings, but what his own fame and her 
 advantage required ; and his parting advice to Sir 
 Walter was dictated by that disinterestedness which 
 ever marked his conduct. Nor were the praises of 
 Lady Paulina Monthermer accidentally introduced ; 
 he was persuaded that Emilv ought to forget him, and 
 he fancied piqued vanity would be a strong auxiliary to 
 induce a young lady to withdraw her heart from one 
 who would be thus copious in the praise of another. 
 
 The objects which Avon Park presented to his view 
 excited the most soul-harrowing recollections. The 
 last time he had been there was the day he received 
 the mvsterious letter that had given such a dark co- 
 louring to his mind. He walked over his grounds, and 
 saw the plantations he had formed when hope buoyed 
 him up with the most flattering expectations. " Not 
 a shrub that he heard her admire but he hasted and 
 planted it there." They grew and flourished as ra- 
 pidly as his own joys had faded. The buds were just 
 swelling with all the luxuriant promise of early spring; 
 he viewed their stately growth, and then contemplated 
 himself a ruin tending earthward, never more to be 
 attired in the cheerful colours of joy and hope. 
 |' But where was she for whom he had formed this 
 //paradise of rural bliss, the Eve who should have walk- 
 I ed in these groves ? He blamed himself for conform-

 ing to that rigid injunction of offended honour which 
 had forbade him to enquire her fate. She might be 
 innocent, faithful, wretched ; requiring his assistance, 
 bewailing his neglect. If the strange impediment to 
 which he had alluded were removed — No, impossible ! 
 Her letter told him the bar was eternal. Wandering 
 through his plantations he endeavoured to believe the 
 soothing predictions of Shenstone ; 
 
 The shrub and the bower and the tree, 
 "Which I reared for her pleasure in vain, 
 In time may have comfort for me. 
 
 He returned to the saloon, threw himself on a sofa, 
 gazed on the border which she had painted, and the 
 chimney-piece which had been executed according to 
 her design. To stay the tide of reflection was impos- 
 sible. He allowed himself to expatiate on the visions 
 of his early life, while all his subsequent experience 
 deepened -the conviction, that they were indeed visions 
 of bliss worth far more than whatever ambition pre- 
 sented u to crown the hero's and the patriot's toils." 
 Could they be realized ? No, the bar was eternal. 
 Poor little Emily ! she was an amiable girl, but there 
 was a sublimity, a nobleness of mind, in her who once 
 possessed his heart. Besides, could he offer himself 
 to the fair heiress while labouring under the weakness 
 of a pre-attachment ? " No," said Avondel, " I may 
 be wretched but I cannot be base, and I will continue 
 to hope that she will soon forget me." Doubtless his 
 lordship was very sincere in that wish, and it was only 
 an unaccountable start of peevishness which made him 
 exclaim, " Frailty thy name is woman," on being in- 
 formed by one of his London correspondents, that the 
 town was in daily expectation of Lord Glenvorne's 
 being married to Miss Mandeville. 
 
 If Lord Avondel were really mortified at this intel- 
 ligence, he had an opportunity of experiencing the 
 comforts which are derived from conscious rectitude, 
 and to abate his chagrin he had cause to congratulate

 himself on his escape from a woman of so much le- 
 vity. His energetic mind did not long remain supine, 
 and he struggled to subdue his regrets. Renouncing 
 every view of improving his fortune by faction, court 
 attendance, or matrimonial alliance, he determined to 
 gather up the wrecks and subdue his desires, to be con- 
 tent with what remained. Probably Lord Avondel is 
 not the first nobleman who, returning to his estate af- 
 ter a long absence, discovers that his steward has pro- 
 vided him with a vast deal of employment. The earl 
 found he had to settle embarrassed accounts, to redress 
 the wrongs of many of his tenants, to restrain the pe- 
 culations of others, to rescue his manorial rights from 
 poachers, to establish order and impartial justice among 
 his dependents, and to cultivate the good opinion of 
 his neighbours. He applied himself with avidity to 
 these pursuits, and soon made two agreeable discove- 
 ries, namely, that his affairs were rather intricate than 
 desperate, and that wherever he went his manners 
 would gain popularity and his character enforce re- 
 spect. 
 
 Refined and upright minds only can duly appreciate 
 the exquisite satisfaction of knowing, that they depend 
 not on the forbearance or bounty of others for the 
 means of existence. The satisfaction derived from 
 this noble consciousness, was too congenial to the feel- 
 ings of Lord Avondel to permit his undivided atten- 
 tion to ruminate on the festering wounds of love or re- 
 sentment. With all the dignity of a Cincinnatus, he 
 turned his mighty mind to rural occupations. Much 
 as he affected to renounce hope, he was in fact the con- 
 stant dupe of expectation, being ever in pursuit of what 
 the world did not afford, a felicity commensurate with 
 his vast desires ; and he always saw in some unattain- 
 able desideratum or future possibility, those ideal 
 phantoms which increased his disrelish of his present 
 enjoyments. This turn of mind had indeed one ad- 
 vantage, it animated him to perpetual exertion. He 
 now resolved " to bend the stubborn genius of the 
 plain, to form his quincunx, and to rank his vines,"

 not without an expectation of being admired as the 
 Palemon '•' who led the rural life in all its joys and 
 elegance, such as Arcadian song transmits," though 
 without the most distant wish of meeting with a La- 
 vinia. 
 
 This metamorphosis was however prevented by the 
 arrival of two letters from London ; the first was from 
 Sir Walter Mandeville, and contained many dolorous 
 circumstances. " This London journey," said he, 
 "which I undertook to please you, turns, out very ill. 
 Not that I dislike town more than I expected, for I 
 have found great benefit from a quack medicine for my 
 asthma, and if people do laugh at me they are too ci- 
 vil to let me see them ; but Emily don't seem contented, 
 and she is so pale and thin that you would hardly know 
 her. Her pbvsician talks of ordering her to her na- 
 tive air, and I believe they never prescribe air till they 
 have tried every thing else. She's a very good girl, 
 and if she dies I hope I shall soon follow her, for La- 
 dy Mackintosh was married last week. I never thought 
 she could have overcome -her grief for my old friend 
 Jeremiah, but women are strange creatures, even the 
 best of them." The letter concluded with several in- 
 vectives and mournful prognostics, accompanied with 
 a wish to see Lord Avondel once more before he 
 died. 
 
 The other letter was from a leading member of ad- 
 ministration, acquainting the earl, that by his Majes- 
 ty's command, he informed him of the royal wish to 
 call him to his councils, by nominating him to an ho- 
 nourable and efficient situation in the management of 
 public affairs. Lord Avondel decided that each of 
 these despatches required a pei-sonal replv. The cha- 
 racter of Palemon was laid on the shelf, the toils of 
 Cincinnatus were suspended, and he alighted from his 
 travelling chariot in Berkley square sooner than an ex- 
 press could have announced his intention of so do- 
 ing. 
 
 He found Sir Walter anxious and agitated, but not 
 so infirm and declining as he supposed ; and from this

 evident exaggeration of his fears for himself he au- 
 gured favourably with respect to Emily, to whom he 
 immediately turned the conversation. u Report, my 
 good friend, 1 ' said he, " led me rather to expect a bri- 
 dal summons. Lord Glenvorne's attachment is no se- 
 cret, and we have fixed the happy day, and drawn the 
 settlements, in Cumberland." 
 
 " Report," returned Sir Walter, " is the same lying 
 gossip she was three thousand years ago. Lord Glen- 
 vorne certainly is in love with Emily, nor will he take 
 a denial, though he has been told she is engaged." 
 
 " Engaged ! Sir Walter," said the earl, starting. 
 
 " Yes, my lord," resumed the baronet, with much 
 apparent coolness, "to a whimsical perverse fellow, 
 who seems to have neither love nor gratitude." " It is 
 impossible," resumed the nobleman, " that Miss 
 Mandeville can devote her affections to a man of this 
 description. Allow me to converse with her on the 
 subject." 
 
 " With all my heart," answered Sir Walter, ringing 
 the bell ; " I tell you she saw him in a masquerade 
 domino, and all the plain suits in the world won't drive 
 him out of her head again." 
 
 {t I cannot," said Lord Avondel, " affect to doubt 
 intelligence so flattering; and if Miss Mandeville still 
 believes my character deserves such a preference, I 
 have only to assure her that gratitude and love are as 
 much inmates of my heart as honour and rectitude. 
 But I hear her step, I must not wound her delicacy 
 by taking her by surprize. Inform her I will do my- 
 self the honour of waiting on her this evening." 
 
 " By the lord Harry, it shall be settled directly," 
 returned Sir Walter, chuckling with heart-felt satisfac- 
 tion. 
 
 " You are caught, general, the enemy is at the door 
 and your retreat is cut off. All you can do is to throw 
 yourself into that fort, while I hold a parley and treat 
 for your surrender." 
 
 Lord Avondel had indeed scarcely time to withdraw

 to a recess ere Miss Mandeville entered, and asked 
 her uncle. the reason of this sudden summons. 
 
 " You will be the death of me," said he, affecting to 
 look terribly furious, while the broad grin of delight 
 distended his rough features. " By Jove, I will make 
 you marry directly. So much about love and lovers, 
 they will twirl my head off my shoulders." 
 
 " My dear sir," said Emily, with a faint smile, 
 " you know my answer to Lord Glenvorne." 
 
 " Yes," returned her guardian, " but that will not 
 do any longer. The man in the moon must come 
 forth. You must say xvho ) 7 ou are engaged to V

 avowal ?" • y 
 
 " Come, come, no high-flying. People, I tell you, 
 have begun to guess. There has been a fellow with 
 me this morning, who has found you out, and he tells 
 me Lord Avondel is old, proud, discontented, a bank- 
 rupt in his fortunes> given up to ill humour, resolved 
 to make you miserable." 
 
 " How could you, sir, listen to such scurrility. — 
 Why did you not order your footman to turn the low 
 impertinent out of doors ?" 
 
 " Hey-day, Emily, why you are riding post ! Who 
 but Lord Avondel himself dares to speak thus of his 
 character ?" 
 
 " Lord Avondel in London!" said Emily, shrink- 
 ing with terror, " and visited you this morning ?" 
 
 " Certainly," returned her uncle. " What if he is 
 come to prevail on you to marry his friend the young 
 marquis, would you refuse him, girl'?" She looked 
 round witli astonishment, and met the respectful glance 
 of Avondel, who, unable to see her thus tormented, 
 advanced from his retreat, not with the proud con- 
 sciousness of success, but with that graceful affectation 
 of doubt which would have reassured a mind less in- 
 genuous and susceptible than the timid Emily ; who 
 found it impossible not to feel overwhelmed with con- 
 fusion, though in the presence of him without whom

 the world had appeared a dreary void. Lord Avondel 
 hastened to relieve her distress. 
 
 " I am," said he, " indeed a suitor, but not in the 
 cause of another. Sanctioned by your guardian's ap- 
 probation, I have the presumption to ask you to forget 
 your brighter prospects for one who pleads no desert, 
 but a deep sense of your goodness, and a determina- 
 tion to devote to you that life which vour favour would 
 render worthy the name of existence." 
 
 Emily trembled, wept, leant on her uncle's bosom, 
 and seemed only anxious to conceal her emotion, which 
 the effort made more visible. 
 
 " Take her, my lord," said Sir Walter, " and thank 
 you for ridding me of a great trouble. But, in my con- 
 science I do think, if you knew the plague of these 
 girls you would never undertake to manage them." 
 
 Lord Avondel respectfully pressed the hand which 
 Emily silently permitted her uncle to bestow, and as- 
 sured him he so well knew the excellence of his man- 
 agement as to be convinced he received from him an 
 inestimable blessing. 
 
 " Somehow or other she has made me of that opin- 
 ion," returned the baronet, folding his niece to his 
 heart with warm affection. Then resuming an air of 
 humorous asperity, " but come, Emily, now give us 
 a little of your sex. Play the hypocrite, and tell my 
 lord you detest the sight of him." 
 
 Lord Avondel interposed to divert Sir Walter's rail- 
 lery. " I must," said he, " exercise the happy right 
 you have conferred upon me, to insist that Miss Man- 
 deville may be suffered to follow her own unbiassed 
 judgment. I will only be indebted to herself for my 
 future happiness. I invite myself to be your guest 
 this evening, and till then will be confident of nothing 
 but that you are my warm-hearted advocate." 
 
 Sir Walter could only murmur, that Avondel was 
 
 the most positive man in the world ; but Emily raised 
 
 i her eyes and gave him a look of bashful gratitude, as 
 
 I, he retired, while she felt that had this been their first

 interview the delicacy of his behaviour would have 
 inspired a permanent attachment. 
 
 " So," said the earl to himself, " I am again in the 
 high road to wedlock. Once I dreamt of congenial 
 minds, of according habits, tempers, tastes, and ages. 
 ' Time, who has thinned my flowing hair,' and bade 
 the grey somewhat mingle with my manly brown, has 
 kindly taught me lessons of moderation and prudence. 
 I must now meditate on making provision for a proper 
 establishment. Yet, if administration expect me to 
 make any undue compliances as a return for their fa- 
 vours, I will sooner beg my wife to settle on me an 
 equivalent for pin-money than hold an ostensible situ- 
 ation without the power of acting as I wish. Emily 
 is docile and affectionate. She possibly would prefer 
 retirement ; but it is not every woman who possesses 
 sufficient powers of mind to make retirement palata- 
 ble. He then ruminated on the prospects which his 
 early attachment presented, and did not rouse himself 
 from that train of thought till he arrived at the pre- 
 mier's. A long conference terminated in his consent- 
 ing to accept the proposed office ; and thus, after years 
 of disappointment and chagrin, love, wealth, and am- 
 bition, united to choose one auspicious day to shower 
 upon him unexpected favours.

 MISS MANDEVILLE received her uncle's con- 
 gratulations on her good fortune, mixed with reproach- 
 es {or having welcomed it with so bad a grace, and 
 retired to her chamber almost afraid of trusting to the 
 reality of the scene which had just past. " Is this,''' 
 said she, " indeed the happiest hour of my life ? have 
 I every reason to look with exultation on my future 
 prospects ? Then why these tears ? why this self- 
 abasement ? Is love so humiliating an associate to 
 female modesty, that it is impossible for it to receive 
 any exaltation from the dignity of its object ? Had I 
 volunteered my affections to a coxcomb I might have 
 trembled at the idea of being sacrificed to his vanity, 
 and becoming the mark of public ridicule ; but Lord 
 Avondel is incapable of so far abusing a generous pas- 
 sion as to make it minister to his self-love. He will 
 respect the peace and honour of her w dvrew her- 
 self on his protection, without another but to 
 | promote his happiness, and to be guided by hi ill.

 such a protector, such a guide. Shielded by such 
 wisdom and goodness no dangers can- assail me. How 
 enviable is my lot ! a life of elegant, liberal retirement, 
 passed with a companion who will inform my mind 
 and direct my conduct ! Away reserve, 'tis girlish 
 fastidiousness, not womanly decorum. I will not add 
 disingenuousness to any other unworthiness. Lord 
 Avondel shall know how entirely his image occupies my 
 heart ; and while I submit all my weakness to his correc- 
 tion, he shall see it is my first ambition to copy his excel- 
 lencies and to form my mind by his perfect model." 
 
 Emily spent the day in building fairy bowers of ru- 
 ral happiness and domestic tranquillity : and in con- 
 firming her resolution of being perfectly unreserved 
 to her noble lover at their next interview. But the 
 stability of her resolution was shaken by the earl's 
 apologizing, with more ceremony than their present 
 situation required, for obtruding his company that 
 evening, without inquiring if she had a pre-engage- 
 ment. Could she tell him with what infinite satisfac- 
 tion she would make every plan give way to his 
 wishes, when he so plainly intimated that he thought 
 the laws of female decorum inviolable ? She could 
 only say that she had no engagement. Lord Avondel 
 said something in praise of domestic habits, but ad- 
 ded, that our social comforts must sometimes yield to 
 the sterner obligations of public duty. He then stated 
 the arrangements he had made with ministry, and the 
 necessity which he felt of complying with the call of 
 loyalty and patriotism ; and he painted the satisfaction 
 which attended vast designs and fair achievments in 
 such pleasing colours, that though Emily saw her fairy 
 bowers of rural happiness and domestic tranquillity 
 completely overturned, and the gargeous palaces of 
 ambition erected in their stead, .still, as the elegant 
 improving companion who walked by her side through 
 the grove was only exchanged-.ior thejjiero with whom

the refusal. 129 
 
 taking the renown of Germanicus, was quite as happy 
 as an Arcadian shepherdess listening to the pipe of 
 her beloved. 
 
 After thus giving her to understand that she must 
 not expect a great public character to dwindle into an 
 uxorious puppet, governed by the fears and fancies of 
 a woman, he entered on a brief review of his own his- 
 tory. He expressed his hope that he should not pre- 
 judice himself in her good opinion by owning, that 
 when very young his heart had received a deep, nay 
 an incurable, wound. Deep, as he never could forget 
 the person who had inflicted it ; incurable, as it had 
 cankered his temper, transformed his character, and 
 compelled him to be suspicious and often unjust. He re- 
 lated the history I have already recorded, but his nar- 
 rative cast so much odium on the perfidious lady, that 
 Emily was ashamed of herself for even supposing it 
 could be her aunt Selina. 
 
 From this subject he turned to his fortune, and own- 
 ed that a title was a troublesome appendage to one 
 whose estate would barely supply the wants of a pri- 
 vate gentleman. Of the emoluments of his future of- 
 fice he spoke like one who knew his own failing too 
 well to make them sufficient for their incidental ex- 
 penses ; and he told her he should ever consider them 
 as the mere appendages of his station, not as a fund to 
 assist the deficiencies of his private purse, being re- 
 solved not to remain in place one hour after honour 
 and conscience called upon him to resign. 
 
 He told Emily that he durst not promise her the 
 fond solicitude, the unruffled tenderness, which a mind 
 less occupied would pay to her deserts. Would she 
 be contented with his considering her as the spotless 
 sacristry where he enshrined all his comforts, the part- 
 ner of his glorv and success, or the secure asvlum to 
 which he should flee when pursued by envv, calumny, 
 or disgrace ? Was she content to renounce the advan- 
 tages which her happier fortunes and blooming years 
 might command, to divert ennui, to soften acrimony, to 
 nurse indisposition ? All those evils had haunted him,

 and though he felt a delightful persuasion that the 
 charming Emily would prevent their return, he knew 
 his own fallibility, and he must warn her that even 
 sweetness and tenderness like hers were not endued 
 with omniscient power to annihilate these foul fiends, 
 whose nature was unhappily composed of imperishable 
 materials. 
 
 If some part of this portrait resembled the dark 
 shades oi a Rembrandt ; others boasted the divine ex- 
 pression of a Carlo Dolci ; and how much praise was 
 due to the ingenuousness of the painter, who seemed 
 more studious to exhibit defects than excellencies. She 
 was not sufficiently acquainted with the world to know, 
 that though the blazing meteor of distinguished talent 
 dazzled every distant beholder, the steady lamp of 
 cheerful good-humour was a more agreeable inmate. 
 Summoning all her courage, she told Lord Avondel 
 that a disposition which abhorred all disguise, and a 
 lortune which derived no support from base compli- 
 ances, had been from her earliest youth the objects of 
 her profound veneration. Her acquaintance with him 
 had confirmed this predilection, and her friends knew 
 that her fears of being unworthy of his regard had 
 preyed upon her spirits. ~ " Disguise, my lord," she 
 continued, " is therefore impossible. But, I conjure 
 you, do not in future suppose, that because you have 
 found me easy to win, mine is a light and wanton 
 mind. You shall find my constancy as inviolable as my 
 preference was precipitate. At least, never dread a 
 rival till you can find a man like yourself, noble, disin- 
 terested, with every quality which might inspire self- 
 esteem, yet generously refusing to take any advantage 
 of that inexperienced heart which you must have dis- 
 covered has long since been yours." 
 
 The misery which Lord Avondel had suffered from 
 female fickleness induced Miss Mandeville to be thus 
 frank in her declaration, and the warmth and elegance 
 of Lord Avondel's acknowledgements prevented her 
 from reproaching herself for having gone too far. 
 " Suffer me, my Emily," said he, " to plead the right

 of a long attachment, by urging you to name an early 
 clay to confirm my title to so great a treasure. I have 
 been used to celerity in the arrangements of important 
 transactions, and I will undertake to expedite even' ne- 
 cessary preparation. As to settlements, my part is 
 easv. I have only to sign such deeds as your counsel 
 will think fit to prepare. If, however, they are dictated 
 by your generous uncle, I shall claim a right to object to 
 them, should they lay me under too oppressive obliga- 
 tions." Emily was too humble a mistress to wish to 
 prolong the reign of female power. She referred her 
 lover to Sir Walter, with a confidence, she said, that 
 her honour and fortune were safe in their care. 
 
 One of the happy circumstances which resulted 
 from this conversation was, that Miss Mandeville felt 
 herself at liberty to unbosom her whole heart to Lady 
 Selina, to whom an unaccountable connection of impro- 
 babilities had lately made her be reserved. She imme- 
 diatelv took her pen, and called for her aunt's con- 
 gratulations on her approaching marriage to a man of 
 rank and birth superior to her own, and superior also 
 to the whole world in every noble, estimable, and en- 
 gaging quality. " Can you," said she, " believe that 
 your little foolish, fearful niece, destitute of every shin- 
 ing talent, and only made remarkable by the adventiti- 
 ous gifts of fortune, has really secured to herself for 
 the protector and guide of her future life, a nobleman 
 on whose mind avarice and vanity never made the least 
 impression ; who has seen the beauties of every court 
 and climate without being made a slave by their blan- 
 dishments, and who really thinks an artless, well-inten- 
 tioned girl a suitable alliance to unparalleled magnani- 
 mity and unblemished fame. Yes, my dear aunt, this 
 is the object on whom I told you my affections Avere 
 highly set. He has proved the reality and strength of 
 my affection, but he has proved it in a manner equally

 have ever seen the object of my attachment you will 
 know him by my description, if not, I will tell you 
 that my destined husband, in whom every good, every 
 noble quality, is centered, is the Ear^ of Avondel. 
 And my uncle confirms my choice with an enthusiasm 
 equal to my own. 
 
 " But do not, my dearest aunt, suppose that my pre- 
 sent attachment absorbs all those claims duty and early 
 tenderness have inscribed so indelibly on my soul. It 
 shall be inserted in my marriage articles, that 1 will 
 spend some weeks every year at Lime Grove, I mean 
 if the united requests of myself and my lord cannot 
 prevail upon you to renounce your solitude, and live 
 with us in London, where my lord's duty, as an effici- 
 ent member of administration, will oblige us chiefly 
 to reside. You shall not deny my request on pain of 
 my employing a resistless pleader, who has governed 
 courts and animated senates, guided the statesman to 
 wisdom and the soldier to victory. Nor will I allow 
 that your resolution of hiding your virtues from the 
 wond ought to be more_durable than my determina- 
 tion of continuing single, and living with you at Lime 
 Grove, never allowing any one to dispute your claim 
 to the first place in the affections of your still fondly at- 
 tached and ever grateful niece, Emily Mandeville." 
 
 By the way of breaking the tedium of uninterrupted 
 narrative, and to shew die world what epistolary trea- 
 sures are in my possession, I shall chiefly fill this chap- 
 ter with some of the correspondence which passed on 
 this occasion. The next letter is from the Marquis of 
 Glenvorne.

 " As my attachment to you was too ardent to allow 
 me to attempt to subdue it while a hope remained that 
 respectful perseverance might render it successtui, so 
 it is too disinterested to wound your generosity by per- 
 sisting in a suit which I know to be desperate. The 
 Earl of Avondel has just convinced me of the futility

 of every pretension which disputes his prior claim to 
 your regard. I resign you, madam ; but the pang of 
 relinquishing what has long been the first wish of my 
 heart is absorbed by the conviction that there has been 
 a peculiar felicity in your fate. You have had an op- 
 portunity of selecting the worthiest, and you have also 
 had the judgment to discern who that person was 
 whose congenial mind and superior virtues are best 
 adapted to your own deserts. Nor shall my congratu- 
 lations be less sincere because I fancy that my own lot 
 might have been happier had you never seen him with 
 whom I own contention would be vain. It is my boast 
 to possess the friendship of Lord Avondel, and my 
 mother joins me in requesting a place in your esteem 
 through his intercession. As the wife of mv friend 
 you will ever command the lively respect and faithful 
 service of, madam,

 I think it is observed, that in the disease called the 
 calenture the seaman's earnest desire for those green 
 fields and shady bowers which he fancies would relieve 
 his sufferings takes such possession of his perturbed 
 mind, that he sees nothing roand him but those de- 
 lightful objects. Thus in the respectful farewel of 
 Lord Glenvorne, the enamoured Emily only saw the 
 merits and praises of her Avondel. " How carefully," 
 said she, " does he guard my character from indeco- 
 rum. He urges a prior claim to Glenvorne, founded 
 on our meeting at Mandeville Castle. His prudence 
 and delicacy will thus ever shield my indiscreet preci- 
 pitation. The winds of heaven can never visit my 
 face too roughly. Surely, I am transported into some 
 paradise. Can this be the world's chequered maze ? 
 Can this be the labyrinth in which virtue toils and suf- 
 fers ? I fear my delirium of full content cannot last 
 long ; I feel I am too happy I"

 letter from Lime-Grove, which is of importance to the 
 history. 
 
 " May every blessing attend the nuptial engagement 
 of my dearest Emily; I would say, complete as her 
 own impassioned fancy paints, but as romantic expec- 
 tation is often a source of disappointment and misery, 
 I will not mislead my beloved girl, but will say, perfect 
 as the chances of this state of mutability and the weak- 
 ness of human virtue w.ill afford. I have seen the earl 
 of Avondel, my child, and I subscribe to your high 
 but just encomium. Sir Walter fulfils the part of a 
 faithful guardian by committing you to the care of a 
 husband of such unblemished worth. 
 
 " Be not alarmed at the shortness of this letter, I 
 have had a slight return of my complaint, and am now 
 so nervous that I am forced to have recourse to my old 
 recipe of perfect quietness. You know at such times 
 I could not even bear your company. 
 
 " Let me, however, intreat you to observe my pre- 
 cautionai:v injunctions. Do not stipulate for an annual 
 visit to Lime Grove, nor even mention my name to 
 Lord Avondel till you have been his wife long enongh 
 to discover ever}- peculiarity in his temper. Even the best 
 and wisest are not free from shades of error, and my long 
 knowledge of the world has enabled me to discover, 
 that very sensible men are often most averse to their 
 wives having any very strong female friendships or 
 confidential intimacies. Besides, I was once much 
 talked of, and I have cause to fear Lord Avondel has 
 imbibed the general prejudice against me. He might, 
 therefore, even think less favourably of you, if he knew 
 the ties which subsisted between us. I do not require 
 you to subdue your affection for me ; it is the consola- 
 tion of my life, and I know our love is so deeply root- 
 ed that it may silently subsist in our hearts till a fit op- 
 portunity permits us to exercise its duties and assert its 
 rights. When you have long observed Lord Avondel 
 in that near point of view which your intimate connec- 
 tion permits, when time and trial have convinced him, 
 of my dear child's intrinsic worth, when your inclina-

 tions and pursuits are become similar from habit, and 
 your rooted affection rests upon a basis which cannot 
 be subverted, it will be time enough to introduce such 
 a friend as you, my dearest Emily, will ever find in 
 your faithful Selina Deiamore." 
 
 This letter somewhat interrupted Miss Mandeville's 
 dr >ms of unruffled felicity. I do not say that it took 
 her out of her hymeneal paradise, but it certainly led 
 her to the mount of vision, and gave her a view of the 
 perplexities and vexations with which the world 
 abounds. Lord Avondel, her all-perfect lover, to 
 conceive a prejudice against her all-perfect aunt ; the 
 two dearest and best of beings to dislike one another ; 
 — It was very astonishing : and, really, independent- 
 ly of the conviction that this mutual enmity would in- 
 terrupt her own happiness, it would be a most chris- 
 tian office to attempt to reconcile them. At least, every 
 principle of justice, regard to her lord's character, and 
 attachment to his person, required her to combat her 
 aunt's opinion, that his abhorrence of her was so root- 
 ed as to be even capable of shaking his affection for 
 his young bride, when informed of her having been 
 educated under Lady Selina's auspices. She could on- 
 ly ascribe this notion to the effects of that infirmity of 
 which her aunt complained. Indisposition clouds the 
 serenest mind with phantoms of spleen, and when our 
 bodies are in snch a state that the soul quarrels with 
 its companion, she is very apt to extend her animosity 
 to the rest of her species, at least to believe that we are 
 as disagreeable to others as we are to ourselves. 
 In this persuasion Miss Mandeville addressed Lady 
 Selina. 
 
 " My dearest aunt, 
 
 " Had you not informed me that you are unwell I 
 
 should have discovered it in the style of a letter so 
 
 evidently dictated by languor and dejection ; and, in- 
 
 . deed, I am now convinced of the truth of the obser- 
 
 w vation which I have often heard you make, that the 
 
 most elevated minds, and the happiest tempers, are

 not always able to resist the depression and dissatisfac- 
 tion which results from a life of total seclusion. This 
 makes me more anxious that you should change your 
 plan ; and though I dare do no other than obey your in- 
 junctions, I must hope you will soon cancel them, and 
 bless me with seeing the two people I best love united 
 in that strict friendship which all whoknotv them must 
 believe them born to cherish for each other. 
 
 " My dearest aunt, you are above listening to the idle 
 reports of tale bearers ; whence then comes this con- 
 viction, that my lord is prejudiced against you ? I am 
 now assured you have only seen him ; for if you knew 
 his worth you would conclude, that candour, liberality, 
 and a wise disdain of mean suspicions, are his ruling 
 qualities. Even when he has been basely used, or in 
 cases wherein he has witnessed very censurable beha- 
 viour, this admirable disposition does not forsake him. 
 I can mention two instances. He will scarcely allow 
 the extreme malevolence of Lady Mackintosh's cha- 
 racter, though, since I have had the courage to speak 
 to him freely, I have told him how cruelly she used 
 me on his account. The other case is still stronger. 
 He has told me, that in early life he experienced a 
 most cruel disappointment from a lady to whom he was 
 fondly attached. The day was fixed, the settlements 
 finished ; every point was arranged, when, without 
 any alleged misconduct on his part, or the least con- 
 sciousness of having acted reprehensibly, this fickle, 
 treacherous woman renounced him forever. He has 
 suffered so much from this event, that he calls it the 
 sera of misery, pi'oducing a complete change in his 
 temper and habits. Yet will he not divulge the name 
 of the unworthy creature, and he assures me he has 
 avoided making any inquiry after her, because he will 
 not gratify the impressions of resentment by hearing 
 of the misery which must be her portion. 
 
 " Can you believe that a man who thinks and acts in 
 this manner is capable of cherishing an unfounded 
 prejudice against you? and that of so strong a kind as 
 even to affect the artless girl who owes every laudable

 quality to your care? No, indeed: the black fiend me- 
 lancholy, whom I and the doctors used to scare, has 
 again been flapping her bats wings over Lime Grove. 
 You have been living by yourself, my dearest aunt. 
 Humility has read you too many homilies. You want 
 me to put you in mind of your virtues and talents. In- 
 deed, I will soon see you, and I hope you will allow 
 me to be better qualified for your eulogist now I have 
 lived in the world, and seen virtues indisputably of a 
 superior cast. In every thing Lord Avondel realizes 
 those ideas of magnanimity and honour which many 
 fancy are fabulous. He has refused the nuptial settle- 
 ment which our counsel say is always made by heiresses 
 on their bridegrooms. He says he is become unexpect- 
 edly wealthy by felling some timber which really en- 
 cumbered his estate, and by compelling his steward to 
 disburse his peculations. He hinted somewhat of in- 
 decorum in such an arrangement, and that word always 
 silences me. But he has intreated me to place my 
 name as patroness of two charities, one in the north, 
 the other in London, and to accompany my signature 
 with magnificent donations. He only permits himself 
 to enjoy the income of my fortune. He will allow of 
 no contingent settlements, to vest the perpetuity in him, 
 and he has angrily forbidden my uncle to act upon his 
 intention of bequeathing him the Mandeville estate. 
 He assigns as his reason, that such a perversion of pro- 
 perty would only give his enemies an opportunity of 
 scandalizing his honour, as it would compel him to do 
 an ostentatious, and therefore equivocal, act of jus- 
 tice, by immediately restoring it to the lineal heirs. 
 
 " Even in comparatively trivial arrangements, Lord 
 Avondel acts by the same loftv principles. He has 
 presented me with his mother's jewels. He calls me 
 his Emily now, " My Emily," said he, " they are a 
 parsimonious gift considered as the present of a nabob, 
 but I had no passion for diamonds, and you will value 
 these as coming from unsoiled hands, and from their 
 having adorned women of illustrious birth and un- 
 tainted honour. Their last possessor was eminently

 graced with all the passive virtues." His eyes shone 
 with tears as he spoke. How admirable is filial piety, 
 how does it confirm all my hopes of happiness ! 
 
 " He told me they were new set about twenty years 
 ago for an event which never happened. He had then 
 exercised his own taste, he wished me now to consult 
 mine in alterations. I shall wear them as they are, for 
 the style is extremely elegant ; and among them are an 
 aigrette and solitaire so like those worn by you in the 
 miniature you gave me at Lime Grove, that I must 
 preserve what will make me fancy I resemble you, ere 
 indisposition and sorrow anticipated the ravages of 
 time in your fiae countenance. 
 
 " My uncle (worthy man) is almost frantic with ec- 
 stacy. He says he can live without me, as joy has 
 cured the gout and asthma, and almost removed the 
 cannon ball from his shoulder. He gives up his house 
 in Berkley square to my lord, and retires to Mande- 
 ville Castle immediately after the ceremony. We are 
 to make. an excursion to the north to introduce me to 
 my lord's connections, but we must not be long absent, 
 as the winter will call him to the active discharge of 
 the important duties of his high office. I sometimes 
 doubt my own capability of appearing with propriety 
 as the wife of a great public character ; but I shall 
 have such a supporter as few can boast. Perhaps you 
 will smile when I tell you, that I am already exalted 
 into a very sublime dignified personage. The respect 
 and deference with which my lord treats me, makes 
 my acquaintance consider me in a different point of 
 view from what they used to do, and I really feel that 
 I am no longer an unimportant romantic girl. Lucy 
 Selwyn objected to the dress I had chosen to be pre- 
 sented in, and recommended one with a fuller pattern. 
 She applied to my lord as umpire, and insisted that 
 carnations on a lilac ground looked nobler than lilies of 
 the valley on pale blue : ' lis a point,' said he, ' of 
 which I cannot judge, yet sure innate nobleness is best 
 contrasted by simplicity.' He smiled when I said I 
 was very partial to woodland lilies.

 " The other evening Captain Brazely made some 
 impertinent remarks on my veneration for wisdom and 
 experience. I knew how much the maxims of false 
 honour are obeyed, and I trembled lest my lord should 
 hear him. But true courage is not ostentatiously que- 
 rulous. ' Miss Mandeville,' said he, 'the captain pays 
 you a compliment, but it requires a little explanation. 
 It implies that, as you are certain of being most va- 
 lued by those who have seen and reflected most, so 
 you shew a just confidence in yourself by endeavouring 
 to secure their approbation.' He then conversed with 
 the greatest ease with the captain about his own affairs, 
 and the coxcomb now boasts that he is in high favour 
 with Lord Avondel, whom he styles the best bred man 
 in Europe. 
 
 " I know custom requires common-place gallantry 
 from lovers, but in my absence he speaks of me with a 
 sort of holy reverence, as if all I did or said was in 
 truth ' wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.' He thus 
 gives me an elevation of character which I fear I shall 
 never support, I mean when he is not present, and the 
 world has too many claims upon him to allow me his 
 uninterrupted society. Thus am I led back to the 
 wish with which I commenced this epistle. My dear- 
 est aunt, come and guide the orphan your tenderness 
 saved from an early grave. You cherished my feeble 
 frame, you corrected my early errors ; come and ren- 
 der me worthy of the affection, and certain of securing 
 the esteem, of the faultless Avondel. Such, in spite 
 of your intimations, I know I shall ever consider the 
 aftan who in a few days will be the husband of your 
 ever grateful and happy 
 
 Emily Mandeville." 
 
 I am now forced to acknowledge, that the something 
 which nobody liked, which every body saw, and which 
 no soul could account for, in Lady Selina, induced her 
 to behave in a most singular way on receiving -his let- 
 ter ; and as I am not bound to write a chapter of te^rs 
 and sighs, or to analyze all her feeiings, I must give

 her up to those who assert, that the tidings of a happy 
 marriage operate on an old maid exactly like vinegar 
 poured upon nitre. As I wish her, however, to pre- 
 serve some small portion of esteem, I will not have it 
 supposed, that though she might long be a countess 
 herself, she actually hated Emily, or wished her the 
 future evils which single sybils are always said to dis- 
 cover on these occasions, by a faculty similar to second 
 sight. Her niece's letter determined Lady Selina in 
 two points, first to avoid the earl of Avondel, and next 
 to take the earliest opportunity of urging the fair bride 
 to restrain her exhuberant sensibility- If my readers 
 can ascribe these resolutions to any other motive than 
 ill-nature, envy, or obstinacy, I will compliment them 
 for possessing an extraordinary share of candour and 
 discernment. 
 
 I pass over the bridal ceremony, to which only the 
 pen of a Richardson could do justice. Suffice it to say, 
 as long a string of carriages attended, and those carri- 
 ages filled with as many noble lords and beautiful la- 
 dies, as accompanied Sir Charles Grandison and his 
 interesting Harriet to the altar. After as elegant a de- 
 jeune as ever the Morning Post immortalized, the 
 happy pair were bound in the indissoluble bond, and, 
 according to immemorial custom, set off in a chariot 
 and six, with four out-riders stuck round with white fa- 
 vours, no matter whither. The event was announced 
 in all the public prints. The bride's paraphernalia were 
 exhibited at the most celebrated milliner's, nuptial pre- 
 sents were distributed, and cards sent out in due form. 
 Thus far Lord Avondel proved a strict conformist to 
 the manners of the world, for he thought it unwise to 
 provoke hostility by a pointed disobedience to its es- 
 tablished forms.

 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
 
 A pleasing land of drowsy-head it was ; 
 
 Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye ; 
 And of gay castles in the sun that pass, 
 
 For ever flashing; round a summer sky ; 
 There eke the soft delights that witchingly 
 
 Ins-til a wanton sweetness through the breast, 
 And the calm pleasures always hover'd nigh ; 
 
 But what'ere smack'd of noyance or unrest 
 Was far, far orfcxpeil'd from this delicious nest. 
 
 Thomson. 
 
 THE experience of near six thousand years has 
 fully proved the advantages of occasional repose to all 
 the tribes of animated nature, and it would be equally 
 hard and singular if that class of beings denominated 
 authors should be denied the benefit of occasional 
 slumber, without peril of being indicted for high 
 crimes and misdemeanors at the tribunal of criticism, 
 and sentenced to endure that species of literary fla- 
 gellation which is at least sure to remove all inclination 
 to somnolency. I know not whether it be determined 
 that we are lusus natures^ and, on that account, form- 
 ing an exception to those general laws of creation 
 which require that exertion should be followed by re- 
 pose ? or whether a desire for those refreshments which 
 in other creatures conduce to the health and comfort of 
 animal life, be with us a real indication of disease and 
 danger, on account of which our skilful censors, like 
 wise physicians in some species of fever, ward of 
 drowsiness, as the harbinger of death. The critics 
 indeed reply, that they have no objections to natural 
 slumbers, or to allow authors to wish their readers 
 good night, and lay themselves up till they are in ab- 
 solute possession of their faculties ; but that, if they 
 will continue to write, and protest they are awake, 
 when 'tis evident to every observer that they are under

 the influence of Morpheus, they ought to be treated 
 like other sleep-walkers, and be blistered and physick- 
 ed into the habit of lying quiet. 
 
 The fallaciousness of this observation is apparent to 
 all who have paid any attention to the anatomy and 
 constitution of an author, (a modern one I mean,) to 
 whose existence constant writing is as necessary as con- 
 tinual breathing is to other people, and who may be 
 said to cease to live the moment they lay down their 
 pens. For as she whose offspring die in the first 
 month of their existence must continue to produce or 
 else relinquish the name of a mother, so the parents 
 of those mouldering carcases that lie entombed in the 
 back warehouses of circulating libraries, preserve the 
 frail tenure of their own reputation rather by what is 
 expected from them than by what they have actually 
 brought forth, and find a literary accouchement every 
 season the only way of being reckoned among living- 
 authors. Formerly, indeed, when, owing either to 
 the profoundness of authors or the stupidity of read- 
 ers, a second or third perusal was necessary before a 
 book could be undertood, and its valuable contents 
 clearly transfused into the mind of the student, the 
 the pen was not pledged to this unremitting labour. 
 
 But a still severer task was then imposed upon eve- 
 ry instructor of the public ; all were expected to bring 
 positive credentials of science or talent ; and as the 
 intervals of writing was expected to be devoted to 
 thinking and reading. I protest our condition seems 
 improved by our emancipation from this harsh law. — 
 We are now only required to fill a certain number of 
 sheets for each migration of fashion ; that is, for the 
 world coming up to London, or for the world's going 
 down to the summer bathing places ; for the former, 
 something that may be read in a hurry for the first 
 season, and for the latter, something that will keep 
 them awake under the soporific influence of driving 
 over the same sands or lounging at the same booksel- 
 lers'. If we succeed in this latter, our business is 
 complete.

 The astonishing enlargement of the human capacity 
 whidi we old Grecians in literature have lived to be- 
 hold, proves the vast utility of this perpetual succes- 
 sion of novelties. Formerly, no one ventured to talk 
 of a book on which they had not deeply pondered, 
 now, though every body sets up for an universal judge 
 as well as reader, few do more than skim the cream of 
 every production, which, thanks to the perspicuity of 
 the writer and printer, may be done as rapidly as we 
 cut the leaves. A friend of mine, who has the cha- 
 racter of a hard student, and writes the literary de- 
 partment of a magazine, limits herself to the perusal 
 of six volumes a morning, which she gets through with 
 such ease, that she assures me she could cut up as 
 many more only she is afraid of injuring her eyes. — 
 She misses very little except the natural philosophy and 
 morality, which she says is always of the same sort. 
 Considering the rate at which she travels, I must do 
 her the justice to say she is extremely fortunate in her 
 guesses, rarely misunderstanding her author so much 
 but that, when you read her criticism, you will find as 
 near a resemblance as between some eminent public 
 characters and their caricatures in a print shop, which 
 I admit to be a sufficient likeness. 
 
 Unless, therefore, we belong to that enviable class 
 of our community who write books of riddles, analyse 
 popular games, or compose songs for new music, we 
 must never presume to answer the continual demand 
 for something new by requesting the world to pick out 
 a few morsels from among the undigested fragments of 
 our last regale. The insult would be as gross as to 
 place hashed mutton and broiled drumsticks before a 
 gourmand, or to present a rural belle with a last year's 
 turban. Without adverting to hard times and heavy 
 taxes, or descending to the trite inapplicable jests of 
 Tuinger and poverty (so ill suited to the present race 
 of writers, who shew by their works that they con- 
 verse with no one below the rank of a baronet, and are 
 versed in all the nice arcana of polite life) this voraci- 
 ous appetite in readers binds us, who cater and cook

 for the public, like Ixion, to a never-resting wheel , 
 and as we are absolutely forbidden to stand still, I 
 trust we may have permission to plead the infirmity of 
 our nature, and be allowed to publish our dreams. — 
 Nay, we hope the frequency of our naps will rather 
 be ascribed to our extreme avidity to gratify our read- 
 ers, than to indifference to their approbation. 
 
 Having thus asserted the right, by proving the ne- 
 cessity, of an author's dozing, I might enlarge upon 
 the various advantages resulting from that practice, 
 but shall confine myself to one, which is in such high 
 estimation as to swallow up ail others, I mean expedi- 
 tion. I do not refer to the inconceivable celerity of 
 thought and imagination when we are actually enjoy- 
 ing bodily repose ; the benefit I allude to results from 
 a total absence of those faculties, and simply means 
 the mechanical velocity with which the pen is known 
 to move when the writer is entirely disburthened of 
 ideas, and unrestrained by judgment ; and the rapi- 
 dity with which a reader gets through a book after he 
 has discovered that the author really has no .meaning. 
 Under these circumstances, it may be hoped that we 
 shall yet see a thicker harvest of literature. A fine 
 gentleman might compose a farce without injuring his 
 constitution, and a lady of fashion write a sonnet with- 
 out bringing on a nervous fever ; and as gaping in 
 company is known to be infectious, may we not hope 
 that works composed under a soporific influence will 
 reunite the two-fold attributes anciendy ascribed to 
 Apollo, and induce physicians, instead of proscribing 
 study to recommend it as one of their infallible narco- 
 tics, so that hereafter we may hear of two pages of 
 poetry and three of prose being ordered as a night 
 draught instead of paregoric or laudanum ? What 
 infinite advantages will not the public derive from hav- 
 ing mischievous activity thus innocently employed, 
 and how much must parents and masters rejoice at 
 seeing a choice spirit or a bel esprit thus charmed into 
 quietness? What a golden aerA too will this be for 
 myself and all the humbler votories of the muse, when,

 besides the public being compelled to take our works, 
 certain gentlemen who have lately made much noise 
 in the world will absolutely be ruined. For let people 
 say what they please about their verses, 'tis certain, 
 like Macbeth, " they murder the innocent sleep," and, 
 however distilled or disguised, can never be used as 
 lullabies. 
 
 I might here say something respecting the antiquity 
 of the practice of literaiy dozing, and prove, that in 
 those venerable remains which have descended to us 
 uninjured by the lapse of ages, we may discover in- 
 dubitable proofs, that the poppy was always permitted 
 to hold a place in the garland of bays. But it is not very 
 prudent for us moderns to put our readers in mind of 
 the ancients, who seem to have been an austere race of 
 people, and if ever they indulged in a little drowsiness 
 it was only, like the halt of a race-horse, that they 
 might recover their breath and rouse their faculties to 
 more vigorous exertion. I do not advise my contem- 
 poraries to nod like Homer, who wakens with his own 
 Jupiter, and lays about him in such a manner as to 
 harrow the nerves of his readers ; nor would I have 
 them dream with Livy, who puts so much of the ter- 
 rible into his visions, that one is as much agitated by 
 them as by waking truths. When people read to gain 
 information, or to lighten the toils of business, these 
 stimuli were necessary, but now, since we only want a 
 book to kill time, to fill up the pauses of dissipation, 
 or (if it be a work of repute,) to say we have read it, 
 every thing which impedes despatch, or fixes atten- 
 tion, should be avoided. We should therefore manage 
 the transitions from sleeping to waking with such per- 
 fect equanimity of style, and glide from dreaming to 
 prosing with such quiet movements, that we may never 
 disturb the repose of our readers, nor afford them a 
 criterion to judge of the duration of our own. 
 
 I am aware I give the critics great advantage by my 
 ingenuousness, and I anticipate a thousand such trite 
 witticisms as that, my works are written to exemplify

 allow them to say, " poor old Mrs. Prudentia confesses 
 she has fallen into a lethargy," and that a they heartily 
 wish her a long good-night." I only beg to assure 
 them, that my partiality for my own productions has 
 not made me unjust to their lucubrations, and that I 
 should not have dared to recommend somnolency to 
 authors had I not detected their worships nodding upon 
 the bench, and not only passiflg sentence when they 
 knew not what they were about, but actually continu- 
 ing in such a profound trance, that all the remonstrances 
 of an infuriated author clamouring for justice could 
 not dissolve it, nor restore them to such a limited use 
 of their faculties as to say why they put words into his 
 mouth which he did not utter, or drew conclusions 
 from his arguments which he pointedly disavowed. I 
 know the enemies of these disciples of Zoilus say, that, 
 like morose husbands when they feign themselves 
 asleep, they are only suiky ; but as I am a staunch ad- 
 vocate for these gentlemen, in gratitude for their mark- 
 ed liberality to me, I must insist, that it is impossible 
 to analyze modern literatm'e in the gross without re- 
 ceiving as much injury from its soporific effluvia as 
 chymists do from preparing opium. Besides this, a 
 reviewer is subject to many indigenous diseases pecu- 
 liar to the soil on which he is bred, especially that la- 
 mentable complaint, a party fever, which is not only ac- 
 companied with an inversion of the optic nerves, unac- 
 countable nauseas, frantic, delirious incoherent ravings, 
 and other dreadful symptoms, aggravated by total in- 
 sensibility to his own situation, but often ends in a 
 coma or morbid sleepiness which no admonitions, hu- 
 man or divine, nor even the crush of nature and the 
 fall of worlds, could terminate. Now, as writing is 
 found to have the same effect upon this disorder as 
 copious perspiration has upon most febrile cases, and 
 as the unhappy sufferers can continue to use their pens 
 to the last stage of the disease, and even find some re- 
 lief to their sufferings by recording their delirious con- 
 jectures, I think we ought to look with more compas- 
 sion than indignation on those lucubrations which tend

 to shew the advantages of despotism, and the honour 
 and generosity of Napoleon : which teach us that the 
 best wav of acquiring habits of laborious research and 
 dispassionate investigation is to devote our time to dis- 
 sipation, and instruct us to submit our minds to pre- 
 judice till we discover that kindness to our adulterous 
 connections is sublime virtue, and that he is the most 
 rational of all philosophers who endeavours to weaken 
 the faith of others without having allowed himself 
 time to examine the evidences of the religion he la- 
 bours to subvert. Such decisions require pity rather 
 than argument, and surely I may hope for an eulogium 
 on my candour when I declare, that they must have 
 been uttered while the reviewer was light-headed, or 
 labouring under the insensibility of party fever, which, 
 whether it rage against church or state, public charac- 
 ters, or private individuals, is a calamity truly tremen- 
 dous and stupifying. 
 
 I have now only to state in what part of their work 
 authors may most advantageously indulge in repose. 
 The commencement is not adviseable, because there 
 they ought to appear smart upon the principle of the 
 old adage concerning the efficacy of new brooms j and 
 I strongly adjure them, if they would escape the im- 
 mediate ravage of the trunk-maker, to be wide awake 
 when they draw up their title page, especially if they 
 belong to the class of novel writers. Who, for in- 
 stance, would select for the companion of their after- 
 noon siesta, " a Winter in Wisbeach Fen," " Adven- 
 tures in Dunstable," or " Characters from White- 
 chapel ?" Let them also continue to rub their eyes 
 till they have named all their principal characters, and 
 fixed their residences ; for as no one can care about 
 Miss Molly Muggleton of the Minories, or Peter Per- 
 kins of Pimlico, so there is some inconvenience in per- 
 petually recurring to the Harlowes, Byrons, Delvilles, 
 and other classical families, as it may produce compa- 
 risons, which are truly odious. After the title and the 
 names are happily chosen, and expectation excited by

 a promise of some bustle and some scandal, the author 
 may compose herself, and trust to the works of her 
 contemporaries for incidents and characters, which, 
 with a little neat patch-work and a few slight sketches 
 of embroidery, will never be found out. This recipe 
 for making a novel will always answer, and an old dish 
 tossed up with new sauce will furnish collops and ra- 
 gouts for successive entertainments. 
 
 'Tis true, there are times when both author and 
 reader must be somewhat on the alert. I do not mean 
 at the catastrophe ; we know by the first four pages 
 whether the heroine is to die or to be married, and no 
 other conclusion is admissible, because one of these 
 events always happens to beautiful young women. But 
 when we gratify malevolence and excite curiosity by 
 some strong touches of personality, it is proper to ex- 
 ercise consideration sufficient to preserve a striking 
 likeness, and to avoid running into the net of justice. 
 
 For though a prosecution for slander gives eclat, it 
 is now so trodden a path to renown, that libelling is 
 thought to be an unprofitable and consequently declin- 
 ing trade. I would therefore advise my kindred of the 
 quill, when they would traffic with the cant phrase of 
 some celebrated wit, describe the shrug of a well 
 known fine gentleman, or remodel the irregularities of 
 a popular duchess, to be a little careful not to strew 
 thehr vices and follies too thickly. And if, for the sake 
 of effect, they find that they must make the wit a swin- 
 dler, the fine gentleman a coward, and the great lady a 
 courtezan, let them take care to introduce some dissi- 
 militude, which may enable them to creep out of those 
 trammels with which judges and juries are apt to ham- 
 per the exuberances of fancy. 
 
 I own it is difficult to adopt our periods of vigilance 
 and indulgence so as to render them congenial to the 
 feelings of our different readers. A young hoyden 
 sympathetically goes to sleep at the commencement of 
 a parental lecture, or admonitory letter from a maiden 
 aunt, and a lady of fashion finds the yawning propen-

 sity increase with each preparation for removing the he- 
 roine into the country. Indeed, unless there be an ab- 
 solute necessity for a bower-scene between two lovers, 
 an elopement at the garden gate, or an insuperable 
 want of moonlight and nightingales for a ready-made 
 sonnet, I would not recommend going into the country 
 at all. Very little can be made of a picquet engage- 
 ment with the curate, and when we have puzzled our 
 brains to arrange and describe the whole posse comita- 
 tus of a rustic neighbourhood they are people whom 
 nobody knows, and unless we do the thing by sheet 
 work they will not earn us a shilling. Maiden aunts 
 and rigid grandmothers employed in spreading plais- 
 ters and scolding forward misses, were tolerable when 
 Juliet looked through a lattice, and Romeo " with 
 love-light wings o'erleap'd the garden wall." But as 
 my aunt and my grandmother are now fixed at their 
 card-table in the assembly-room of Bath or Margate, 
 pray let them chaperon Juliet to the ball, and give her 
 an opportunity of looking at Romeo while he lounges 
 gracefully against the wainscot, too indolent even to 
 use his opera-glass, overwhelmed, not with admiration 
 but fatigue, and vowing not eternal fidelity, but that; 
 dancing is a bore and the girls are troublesome. 
 
 But of all literary dozing the moral nap is most de- 
 lightful, because it may be enjoyed with the most com- 
 plete security from interruption, and with the certainty 
 of diffusing the same divine oblivion of " low-thought- 
 ed care" over the minds of our readers. This ad- 
 mirable soporific is thus easily composed. To one 
 grain of Johnson add a pound of Sterne, melt them 
 in a crucible till they perfectly amalgamate ; this is the 
 only difficult part of the process, for the particles are 
 extremely heterogeneous. You must pour in a little 
 tincture of religion, which you may procure either 
 from the " Economy of Human Life," the " Essay 
 on Man," or any German treatise on divinity. Sweeten 
 it with a great quantity of Voltaire's liberality, beat it

 " Indeed my nature's easy, 
 I'll ever live your most obedient wife, 
 Nor ever any privilege pretend 
 Beyond your will." 
 
 Otway. 
 
 FROM the preliminary steps which are already re- 
 corded, the history of these august nuptials passed to 
 their next stage of celebrity, and furnished conversa- 
 tion for routs and morning calls. It will be always ne- 
 cessary to observe, that I am speaking of old times, 
 when the entertainment of conversation really existed, 
 before all the world was in such a hurry that not hav- 
 ing a moment to lose every body talked at the same 
 time, like the inhabitants of a rookery in the building 
 season. As it was not necessary to make fifty calls in 
 a morning, or to assemble five hundred people at your 
 evening party, there was time to hear replies, and any 
 very interesting event might be talked of a week after 
 it happened. Such was Lord /ivondel's matrimonial 
 connection. Some termed it an exceedingly proper 
 union, others a very nabob-like speculation on the part 
 of his ci-devant excellency, a sort of Othello and Des- 
 demona story, only they hoped it would end better. 
 Lastly, at best it was Hebe waiting upon Jupiter, for 
 all agreed Jupiter's nod would be decisive, and the 
 pretty young Hebe would soon sink into a mere cup- 
 bearer. 
 
 In order to exemplify these opinions, and to give a 
 little relief to my leading characters, let us suppose 
 Lady Mackintosh (now changed into Lady Caddy, by 
 her husband's receiving the title of Sir Joseph) meeting 
 the Marchioness of Glenvorne at a masquerade, the 
 former, dragging her happy baronet from the supper

 table to introduce him to the coui't lady, who, with 
 much polite affectation of interest, was showering her 
 congratulations, and lamenting the length of time 
 which had elapsed since she met Lady Caddy in De- 
 vonshire, where Sir Joseph had just secured consider- 
 able parliamentary interest by the purchase of a large 
 estate. After a thousand thanks, a thousand protesta- 
 tions of the indescribable transport of this interview, 
 we will seat the ladies side by side, and place some pine 
 apple ice before the gentleman during the following 
 dialogue. 
 
 Lady Caddy. " So, this extraordinary match has at 
 last taken place. I am happy to see Lord Glenvorne 
 is not inconsolable, he has been supporting the charac- 
 ter of Mr. Pentagon with infinite: humour." 
 
 Marchioness of Glenvorne. " I find, my dear Lndy 
 Caddy, you continue to be intimately acquainted with 
 whatever passes in the great world*" 
 
 Lady Caddy bowing. " I happened to be at Mande- 
 ville Castle when Avondel made his conquest. I used 
 often to look in on poor old Sir Walter, a worthy man, 
 Lady Glenvorne, but terribly ignorant. Good little 
 Emily had never seen a creature, so fell in love imme- 
 diately, and my lord managed so admirably that Sir 
 Walter actually believed he h<;d violent objections to a 
 young heiress with lour thousand a year, and twice as 
 much in reversionary expectations. He! he! he! Such 
 repugnance would have been singular." 
 
 Marchioness of Glenvorne. " It does not often oc- 
 cur, but we must not judge Lord Avondel by common 
 rules." 
 
 Lady Caddy. " No, certainly. He is a being of a 
 higher order, splendid talents, first-rate capav ity, uni- 
 versal information. This makes me fear they never 
 can be happy, for my good young friend is an every- 
 day character. Merely a well-meaning girl without 
 mental energy. But I say this in confidence. I >\ ould 
 not breathe a syllable to her disadvantage, only your 
 ladyship's discretion is so unquestionable."

 Marchioness of Glenvorne. " Your fiat, my dear 
 madam, is too flattering. I sincerely hope Lord 
 Avondel will reward the attachment of his lovely 
 bride." 
 
 Lady Caddy. " Ah, that's my fear after all we 
 know : and I find it is fixed that Lady Selina Dela- 
 more is to reside with them. 'Tis downright shock- 
 
 in s-" 
 
 Marchioness of Glenvorne. " I am inclined to 
 doubt the authenticity of that report. I believe Lady 
 Selina is too much wedded to her habits of seclusion to 
 renew her intercourse with a world she so willingly re- 
 signed." 
 
 Lady Caddy. "Your ladyship rejoices my heart; 
 for even supposing her to be quite correct nozv, and that 
 all that was said was not quite true, she would be a 
 most improper companion for the countess." 
 
 Lady Glenvorne. " My dear Lady Caddy, to what 
 do you allude . ? " 
 
 Lady Caddy. " Oh, I never attempt to explain that 
 mysterious business. My dearest Sir Joseph, I really 
 must interdict that amazing quantity of ice. You 
 know the opinion of your phvsicians. The best of 
 creatures, only such delicate health. The last sen- 
 tence was uttered in a whisper to the Marchioness, who 
 observed that Lady Caddy was the happiest woman in 
 the world to have had two such charming husbands, 
 adding she was well acquainted with Sir Jeremy. 
 " Were you, indeed," returned Lady Caddv, " I 
 thought I never should have survived him. My dear- 
 est Sir Joseph, I really must take you from the side- 
 board, you will certainly bring an a spasmodic atcack, 
 and then only think what I shall endure." The ladies 
 now curtsied and parted, Lady Caddy satisfied with 
 the eclat of being seen in close conversation with a 
 Marchioness, and Lady Glenvorne happy that she had 
 done her duty in making a little sacrifice to support her 
 son's parliamentary importance. 
 
 The honey-moon had now expired, and the Avon- 
 dels were re-settled in Berkley-square, whence Sir

 Walter, gratified by the fulfilment of all his earthly 
 wishes, had removed to Mandeville castle. Emily was 
 by this time quite convinced that she had not overrated 
 the virtues of htr lord, and that she had obtained a 
 complete knowledge of his temper, though uniform 
 habits of whatever is great and good could not rightly 
 be described by a term which implies caprice and infir- 
 mity. She t hevefore continued wrapped in bright and 
 blissful visions, somewhat clouded however by her re- 
 gret, that she must often be deprived of her lord's so- 
 ciety, and her fear that she should be unequal to fill 
 the public station his ministerial connections required 
 her to occupy. The society and advice of her aunt 
 became therefore the only remaining desideratum that 
 was wanting to crown her bliss, and she was particu- 
 larly anxious to secure it during her noviciate in life, 
 well knowing that the errors and awkwardness of a de- 
 but are remembered by the uncandid when graceful 
 ease has supplanted trembling ignorance, and the fine 
 polish of- self-respecting politeness has rubbed off the 
 irregularities of careless, sincerity. On re-perusing 
 Lady Selina's letters, she discovered a suggestion 
 that the separation was not meant to be perpetual, but 
 was only to last till she was Lady A vondel, and had 
 made herself perfectly acquainted with her lord's tem- 
 per and secure of his affections. The interdict was 
 therefore in her opinion removed, as these events had 
 taken place ; she accordingly resolved to communicate 
 her wishes to her husband, and engage him to over- 
 come her aunt's reluctance. She felt convinced that 
 mistake and causeless pique, combining with exube- 
 rant delicacy, had been her motive for declining an 
 invitation, which probably she would readily accept 
 were it communicated in proper form, and sanctioned 
 by the request of him from whom it ought to ori- 
 ginate. 
 
 The countess determined not only to press her suit 
 immediately, but to heighten the certainty of success by 
 a little romantic effect. She took care to be surprized 
 by her lord in the act of kissing her aunt's picture, and

 to hurry it away with a mock embarrassment, which 
 indicated a desire to be thought detected in a fault. 
 Avondel gaily proclaimed himself of a jealous disposi- 
 tion, and protested that a regard for his own honour 
 made it necessary he should discover all her intrigues. 
 Emily frankly avowed her guilt, told him he had a ri- 
 val whom she must ever love, on whom she had doated 
 from her infancy, and without whom she could not be 
 happy. " It was the person who first taught me to 
 love you," said she, playfully holding up the picture 
 he attempted to force from her. Supposing it the mi- 
 niature of her uncle, the earl threw over it a vacant 
 glance, which soon settled in a glare of horror. He 
 shuddered, staggered against a chair, his hand still 
 holding Lady Avondel, but it was with a cold convul- 
 sive grasp. The pale and morbid expression of his 
 countenance alarmed the countess. " You are ill, my 
 dearest Lord," said she. " No, not ill," was his re- 
 ply. He attempted to walk across the room, but his 
 emotion was too violent for disguise. After a sort of 
 gasping pause, he asked his young bride how long she 
 had possessed that picture ? The terrified Emily an- 
 swered that it was given her by her deai'est aunt, Se- 
 lina D<4amore, the friend and guide of her infancy, 
 and next himself her best protector and friend. 
 
 ** She your friend," exclaimed the earl, " she the 
 guide and protector of your infancy! the worthless wo- 
 man who perjured herself to make ma wretched !" In- 
 dignation diffused a burning glow over his countenance 
 while he confessed how poignantly he felt his well-re- 
 mtmbered wrongs. 
 
 Emily sunk involuntarily upon her knees, and bathed 
 her lord's hand with tears. " O forgive me," she cried. 
 " If you forbid I will not desire her society > but indeed 
 I must ever love her." 
 
 " Do you then," said the earl, fixing an eye of stern 
 regard upon his wife, justify her, and believe I provoked 
 the treatment I endured?" 
 
 " Never, never," returned the countess, alarmed be- 
 yond measure at the first harsh expression she had

 ever heard from the god of her idolatry. " Till now I 
 never knew who had wronged you. But my aunt is 
 so good, so just, so consistent, I must believe some 
 strange mistake, some calumnious misrepresentation." 
 
 " Go on, madam, if you suppose that even had the 
 whole world preferred an accusation against me she 
 would have been justified in discharging me unheard, 
 circumstanced as we then were." 
 
 " O my lord, call me still your Emily. Indeed, 
 I should have believed you against the whole 
 world." 
 
 " Hear me, my Emily," said the earl, raising her, 
 "this posture becomes neither you nor me. I am con- 
 vinced that I have not a second time embarked my 
 peace where perfidy or guilt threatens me with instant 
 shipwreck. I never practised disguise to you, I told 
 you I had loved. My present distress so overpowers 
 my fortitude that you must perceive mine was no com- 
 mon passion. You say Selina educated you from in- 
 fancy, did .she ever explain to you the motives for her 
 conduct?" 
 
 " Never." 
 
 " Yet you say she taught you first to love me ?" 
 
 Lady Avondel then related the circumstances attend- 
 ing the opening of the casket, and added, though her 
 aunt's behaviour on that occasion excited some suspi- 
 cions of their early attachment, yet when she heard 
 the story of her lord's wrongs she deemed it impossi- 
 ble they could originate from a woman whose virtue 
 and wisdom she had so long known and so deeply 
 revered. 
 
 " Listen to me, Emily," said the earl : " Selina De- 
 lamore was exquisitely beautiful, (his eye glanced on 
 the miniature which lay upon the table, and then re- 
 volted as from the sight of a basilisk). She was ex- 
 quisitely beautiful," he repeated in a faultering accent, 
 while the strong recollection of her attractions bewil- 
 dered his discourse. " She had at least the appear- 
 ance of innocence, truth, superior delicacy, correct 
 judgment"—

 " O she possesses the reality," interrupted the coun- 
 tess, " she is a pattern of piety, goodness, and benevo- 
 lence." 
 
 " Tell me," said the earl, sighing and pressing the 
 hand of his wife, " You certainly resemble her ; tell 
 me where does she live ?" 
 
 " At Lime Grove, my lord, in — — shire ; she 
 
 leads a life of most perfect retirement and sanctity." 
 
 " And does she know of our union ?" 
 
 " O yes, I correspond with her frequently. In all 
 her letters she does the fullest justice to your high de- 
 serts, and instructs me to deserve you." 
 
 " Shall I," said the earl, " too severely task your 
 acquiescence by requesting you to tell me what you 
 know of Selina's history r" 
 
 Emily readily complied. It was interwoven with 
 her own. She just recollected the death of her mo- 
 ther, who fell an early victim to a life of dissipation. 
 She remembered being wayward, sickly, and neglected, 
 when her aunt removed her from an unprincipled go- 
 verness, who despised the unvalued girl, and flattered 
 the promising heir, till the pitiable orphans increased 
 their misfortunes by mutual enmity. She depicted 
 the infantine establishment at Lime Grove, where they 
 grew healthy, happy, and affectionate. Her first afflic- 
 tion was the loss of her bi-other's society when her uncle 
 removed him to Mandeville Castle. The rest of her 
 narrative, except what the reader already knows, was a 
 description of Lady Selina's manners and habits. As 
 her limited fortune restricted her expenses, she was ra- 
 ther uniformly benevolent than liberally beneficent, and 
 whoever knows the lower orders knows also that they 
 who are most lavish are generally most admired. The 
 neighbouring society was not much to her taste. Ill 
 health often forbad her to cultivate it. She had many 
 resources within herself, and necessity obliged her to 
 retrench all superfluous expenses ; she was therefore 
 seldom seen beyond her own precincts, except when 
 called abroad by the dictates of piety, charity, or ge- 
 neral good will. For though she was indifferent to the

 applause of the million, she was most conscientious in 
 the discharge of every duty that charity, justice, or 
 compassion imposed. As a mistress, the serenity of 
 her temper made her adored by her domestics, and 
 indeed all who knew her well were unanimous in her 
 praise ; but these were too few to remove the general 
 impressions which Lady Avondel admitted were dis- 
 advantageous to her aunt's character. A seclusion, 
 chosen and persevered in from concealed motives, of 
 whose propriety no one could judge, a frugality impo- 
 sed by circumstances of which she never complained, 
 and which she never discovered, lest she should seem 
 to throw an odium on those who left her in difficulties 
 so unsuited to her birth, and a melancholy arising from 
 many untold sorrows ; were often denominated pride, 
 ill-nature, and covetousness, by the sons and daughters 
 of vulgar jollity, who rank perpetual festivity among 
 the duties of life, and plead their aversion to commun- 
 ing with their own hearts, in proof that they are very 
 sociable," pleasant characters. 
 
 Lady Avondel knew too little of the importance of 
 wealth, and the inconveniences which her aunt suffered 
 from the want of that passport to favour, to explain as 
 fully as I have done the general impression which the 
 neighbourhood entertained of Lady Selina. She 
 chiefly dilated on her piety, her meekness and resigna- 
 tion, which were all of a sublime and beatific cast. It 
 was not the self-accusing submission of a contrite 
 Magdalen, that appeared in this holy recluse, but the 
 devotedness and calm expectation of a Madona. The 
 tears which occasionally filled her eyes seemed not to 
 spring from self-reproach. " I have often," said the 
 countess, " while I looked at her, thought she had 
 much to complain of, but that she was too good to 
 murmur, and indeed merely by her sufferings from ill 
 health she has endured a martyrdom. Above twenty 
 years ago she broke a blood vessel ; since which her 
 lungs have been so very weak that she is generally con- 
 fined to her chamber in severe weather. There she 
 reads, prays, and meditates, prepares medicines for the

 sick, works for the poor, or fabricates remembrances 
 for her friends. She gives little trouble, and I never 
 heard her complain. She smiles when pale with dis- 
 ease, or exhausted with anguish, and while I have wept 
 over her she only talked of her many blessings, and 
 the inexpressible comfort of that 'peace of mind 
 which passes all understanding.' " 
 
 Lord Avondel's eyes were filled with tears at Emily's 
 artless narrative. It did not paint the Selina he once 
 knew, the pure though playful and affectionate idol of 
 his youthful heart. The smiles of silent fortitude and 
 christian resignation were different from those with 
 which hope, love, and joy, irradiated her enchanting 
 visage when she talked of a life of felicity with her 
 adored Avondel ; yet, surely, she was just what he 
 might expect her to become, when wounded by incura- 
 ble affliction. In one point the resemblance was exact. 
 She discovered the same anxiety to act rightly rather 
 than to be much admired. Praise was not at all times 
 necessary to her content. Selina, satisfied with the ap- 
 probation of her own heart, awaited the decision of 
 that tribunal which reviews motives as well as actions. 
 Avondel felt what he termed a noble avarice for fame. 
 Selina indulged no proud contempt for the opinions of 
 her fellow creatures, but the applause of the world was 
 insufficient for one, who, in the silent dictates of her 
 own heart, anticipated the judgment of Omniscience. 
 
 The earl now asked his young bride, why her inti- 
 mate connection with her aunt had been thus late and 
 reluctantly discovered ? Emily, after explaining her 
 uncle's injunctions, and what she esteemed his unfound- 
 ed aversion to Selina, put into his hands the correspon- 
 dence which is contained in the eighth chapter. Lord 
 Avondel retired to ruminate, and Emily had now lei- 
 sure to reflect on her own impatience in not quietly sub- 
 mitting to the wise restrictions which her aunt had 
 imposed. But curiosity still continued to be a power- 
 ful stimulus. The mystery was only in part develop- 
 ed, and while she felt gratified in having her own opi- 
 nion of Selina's worth confirmed by so powerful an

 attestation as the fixed attachment of such a man as 
 Lord Avondel, her utter inability to guess at the ob- 
 stacles which could separate these congenial minds 
 caused a very painful emotion. For herself, she felt 
 that her honoured aunt was the onlv person to whom 
 she could allo^ 1 a preference in her husband's affections, 
 and she still hoped such a disclosure might be made as 
 would re-unite those in friendship who had been dis- 
 joined in love. 
 
 Meantime, Lord Avondel, with tremulous impati- 
 ence, ran over the well-known characters of the belov- 
 ed of his soul. Kis heart swelled with anguish at every 
 allusion to her own situation, and every testimony 
 which she gave to his deserts. He sometimes blamed 
 the proud resentment which had prevented him from 
 making any inquiry after her, and had even caused him 
 to cherish a hope that she was no more. He knew 
 that Lady Honoria Mandeville was heiress to the 
 house of Delamore, and consequently sister to Selina, 
 but Sir Walter's dislike of his brother's wife occasioned 
 a general reserve at Mandeville Castle respecting every 
 branch of the house of Montolieu ; and Lady Selina 
 had kept up but a slight intercourse with her own fa- 
 mily. From these reasons, added to a lapse of time, 
 and the intervention of other objects, Lord Avondel 
 did not call to mind the connection till Emily's resem- 
 blance of her aunt brought it to his recollection at the 
 time that he discovered in the young lady the symp- 
 toms of a growing attachment. Whether from unex- 
 tinguished love or cherished resentment, certainly this 
 near relationship to his first choice was one motive for 
 his wishing to avoid a permanent connection with a fa- 
 mily which he thought honour required him to re- 
 nounce for ever. 
 
 But imperious circumstances had prescribed a dif- 
 ferent conduct. His wife was not only the niece of 
 Selina, but formed and fashioned under her auspices. 
 " She had been the guide of her infancy, her protector, 
 without whose society she never could be happy, the 
 person who had taught her to love him, and whom she

 must ever tenderly regard." These were words he 
 never could forget. How great and alarming was the 
 influence which they implied, especially if exercised 
 by an artful and treacherous, or even by a rash mis- 
 guided woman. Had she not renounced him confess- 
 edly without any provocation ? to what extravagance 
 might she not impel his wife ? and how dangerous a 
 fomenter of family quarrels might such a woman prove ? 
 Inadvertencies would become crimes, and differences 
 sweil into disgusts. W.is there in the whole train of 
 possibilities any combination of circumstances which 
 could justify Selina's conduct to him, or reconcile it 
 to the rules of honour and pood sense ? and till this 
 was done, must not her protegee, her adopted child, 
 whose mind she had formed and avowedly governed, 
 be viewed with more of dread than confidence ? True, 
 she had all the appearance of artless innocence and 
 chaste attachment, but so hod Selina the evening he 
 left her to prepare Avon park for the reception of its 
 future mistress. . Painful recollection ! Innocence and 
 fidelity assumed in her at that well-remembered inter- 
 view a higher character than in the quiet passive Emi- 
 ly. The latter had the unoffending simplicity, and 
 indiscriminate attachment, of an amiable girl ; the 
 enlarged understanding and exalted sentiments of Se- 
 lina conveyed an idea of seraphic purity and affection. 
 The love ot Selina was like that of a superior being, 
 acting as a watchful guardian to some beloved charge, 
 Emily was a weak timid creature clinging to him for 
 protection, conscious of inferiority, fearful of offend- 
 ing him, and willing to sacrifice, even his character to 
 gratify his inclinations or allay her own terrors. The 
 reader will easily discover, which of these ladies Lord 
 Avondei thought best adapted to him for a wife, but I 
 would not have him from thence conclude that he 
 formed a right judgment. The result of these reflec- 
 tions was, that Emily should urge her aunt to explain 
 her reasons for writing the letter of May 175", and

 positively to depend. The young countess eagerly un- 
 dertook the task, convinced that the mystery would 
 be so explained as fully to justify Selina's conduct, and 
 produce that perfect reconciliation, which she now 
 found wanting to complete the bliss of her conjugal 
 paradise.

 AKEKSIDE. 
 
 A FEW posts brought Lady Avondel the following 
 letter. 
 
 " My dearest Lady Avondel, 
 
 " Your happiness being the first wish of my heart, 
 I willingly renounce every consideration immediately 
 connected with myself, and though I might briefly 
 answer your letter by acknowledging rnat I tr>ve given 
 your lord most just cause to hate and despise me, I 
 khink myself called upon to satisfy (as far as my con- 
 science will permit) the anxiety which your mind must 
 feel, and which I can well appreciate. 
 
 " My history is melancholy, but it is connerted with 
 what yon wish to know. About the tine of my birth,

 ria Mandeviile, continued with her father, and I re- 
 mained with my mother, who received a separate 
 maintenance, till the death of her husband put her in 
 possession of her jointure. She then return ■ d to the 
 world from which she had long been exiled. She 
 procured for me the best masters, and introduced me 
 to the first circles, though she knew mv fortune was

 been consigned to your mother, who was the declared 
 favourite of \our grandfather. My poor mother at-

 this child, but it was cold and formal, unlike the warm 
 affections which result from family harmony. She 
 soon after married Sir James Mandeville, without 
 asking the approbation of her surviving parent and 
 even the forms of civility were then suspended. 
 
 " Lady Montolieu, became disgusted with the 
 world, and resolved to bury herself in retirement. — 
 The motive which she assigned for this change of plan 
 was to save a fortune for me, but I believe some mor- 
 tifications aud neglects from her former friends occa- 
 sioned that resolution. Her health was then good, and 
 seemed to promise success to her maternal exertions 
 in my favour ; and certainly it was a painful sacrifice 
 in one who was still young, beautiful, and fitted to fill 
 a conspicuous place in the first circles. A country so- 
 litude presented no charms to her imagination, and 
 her temper, which had never been corrected in her 
 vouth, now became extremely burthensome to herself 
 and others. I hope I was not materially wanting in 
 my duty, but my hours passed very painfully. I 
 murmured sometimes in secret, for I was very young, 
 Emily, and passionately attached to the world. I had 
 acquired a strong relish, for its pleasures without dis- 
 covering that they were interspersed with cares and 
 dangers. I fancied innocence had a right to happi- 
 ness ! Ah ! my child, how many useful lessons are 
 taught by adversity. 
 
 " I was thus situated, when I received an invitation 
 from a friend of my mother's to pass the winter with 
 her in London. The countess, though she sometimes 
 reproached me with causing all her wretchedness, ten- 
 derly loved me, and perceiving my health and spirits 
 injured by a close attendance on her, she consented to 
 relinquish my society for a few months. I returned to 
 London with every sanguine hope a young and ardent 
 mind could form, delighted at the prospect of renew- 
 ing an intercourse with many beloved companions, 
 above all with the Marchioness of Gienvorne, who 
 had recently formed a most happy and honourable alli- 
 ance. An important event signalized this excursion.

 I engaged the affections of the Earl of Avondel, then 
 in the bloom of youth, universally admired and uni- 
 versally beloved. I will not expatiate on my feelings 
 when assured that I was the object of his choice. Ask 
 your own heart, my Emily ; mine was as attached to 
 his person, and as sensible of his virtues. 
 
 " But I must tell you, for probably his delicacy will 
 not, the circumstances under which he avowed his 
 passion. It was only by his frequent visits to Mrs. 
 Spencer's, and his refined attentions to me, that I was 
 induced to hope I had attracted his regard, since a man 
 of his honour and good sense would abhor the mean 
 triumph of misleading inexperience. It was in his 
 presence Mrs. Spencer received a letter from Ur. R. 
 informing her, that he had been sent for to attend the 
 Countess of Montolieu, whom on his arrival he found 
 dead, after an illness of a few hours. Mrs. Spencer 
 spoke with great concern of mv friendless, unprovided 
 situation ; and it was then Avondel generously declar- 
 ed his wish to engraft me on his noble stock. The 
 two-fold intelligence was communicated to me at the 
 same time. Emily, I will open to you my whole 
 heart. It was said I bore my mother's death with for- 
 titude, but I never loved her. I trust I performed 
 my duty, but her wayward temper and extreme seve- 
 rity repressed affection. I knew not that her soul was 
 pierced with incurable sorrows, and I too much con- 
 sidered, that through her misconduct I had been de- 
 prived of the protection of my father, and the love of 
 my kindred. Her death therefore rather inspired a 
 selfish apprehension for my own future lot, than the 
 tender emotions of filial regret. To know at that mo- 
 ment that I was not to be thrown upon the world, a 
 friendless orphan with a scanty provision, inadequate 
 to the claims of my birth, and insufficient to extort 
 that respect to my youthful attractions which would 
 awe the licentious from attempting to ensnare my in- 
 experience : to be invited to partake the fortunes of a 
 man whose personal merits conferred honour on his 
 high dignity and ancient house ; to be offered the pro-

 tection of one of the first characters in the kingdom, 
 and thus be -held forth as an object of envy instead oi 
 commiseration ; — Wonder not, my child, that the re- 
 membrance oi my early sorrows faded like the recol- 
 lection of a distressing dream, when our eyes open to 
 the beauty of a summer morning ; or that I surrender- 
 ed my whoie soul 10 the delight of inspiring and che- 
 rishing virtuous and happy love. 
 
 " It was at this time that I first discovered the ver- 
 satility of the world. The future Countess of Avon- 
 del was as much courted and admired, as the indi- 
 gent Selina Delamorehad been dreaded and neglected. 
 I received numerous invitations, every matron of rank 
 offered to be my chaperon. I was the glass of fashion 
 and the ornament of societ\ . The most agreeable cir- 
 cumstance connected with this inundation of good will 
 was my restoration to the countenance of my family. 
 I received an invitation to Mandeville Castle, and was • 
 civilly treated by your father and mother ; yet, as I 
 did r.ot experience that full cordiality which I had 
 hoped for, I shortened my visit, and resolved not to 
 introduce Lord Avondel to them till as his wife I 
 should feel myself elevated above the mortification of 
 perhaps undesigned negligencies. 
 
 "The day, my Emily, as" you have heard, was 
 fixed; the nuptial attire purchased; the settlements 
 drawn according to the liberal plan dictated by his ge- 
 nerous heart. He left me in order to prepare Avon 
 park for my reception, and I returned to my mother's 
 late residence to make the small arrangements in my 
 province. We met no more ! — 1 wrote the letter which 
 I am required to explain: — I had motives for it — im- 
 perious motives, which I cannot divulge: nor would 
 the discovery contribute to lord Avondel's peace ; on 
 the contrary, I am convinced it would overwhelm him 
 with horror. 
 
 " As concealment now became my duty, I fled 
 where no one knew me and she who but a few hours 
 before looked forward to bridal happiness, title, for- 
 tune, every desirable good which is ranked in the cata-

 logue of earthly blessings, became a dubious wander- 
 er, an unknown stranger, who, like a proscribed cri- 
 minal, sought concealment under a borrowed name ; 
 and at the moment when she most wanted consolation 
 and support, estranged herself from all she loved. In 
 the morning of my life, I looked forward to my future 
 existence as to a cheerless void, unvisited by hope, 
 unillumined by the endearing sympathy of social affec- 
 tion ! 
 
 " Do not, my beloved Emily, compliment my forti- 
 tude. It consisted merely in enabling me to live 
 through the early period of my trial. You must not 
 suppose that, when the blow was first struck, I sup- 
 ported my disappointment with the equanimity you 
 have been accustomed to see me exert in those happier 
 hours, when the playful prattle of yourself and your 
 brother made me feel that there was something worth 
 living for. I brought into the agonizing confines of 
 affliction a heart strongly attached to sublunary good, 
 and proportionably cold to those better prospects our 
 high calling enjoins us to prefer. I am now one of 
 those who, with resigned humility and grateful content, 
 can enumerate the advantages, nay the blessings, of 
 calamity. You have heard of the accident which has 
 occasioned me so much bodily suffering ; it was caused 
 by the stormy emotions of rebellious grief. During 
 the state of extreme weakness to which it reduced me, 
 terrestrial happiness assumed a very different aspect to 
 that it exhibited when youth, health, hope, and love 
 taught me to forget I was merely a pilgrim and sojour- 
 ner on earth. Stretched on the bed of infirmity, and, 
 as I believed, of death, the forlorn Selina Delamore 
 escaped those pangs which the beloved wife of Avon- 
 del must have felt. If I wanted the support and com- 
 fort of sympathizing tenderness, I did not endure the 
 miserv of witnessing the anguish of a heart whose 
 peace was dearer to ine than my own. I mused upon 
 his glories, I prayed Heaven to shield him in the day 
 of danger, but the ties which bound him to a wretch

 like me, were dissolved, and thus death had lost half 
 its terrors. 
 
 " Yet, I was not bereft of all external consola- 
 tions. I had the assistance of a faithful servant, 
 the confidential attendant on my mother. Notwith- 
 standing the mysterious air of my concealment, 
 my appearance interested strangers, who, in my 
 extreme sufferings, forgot the suspicions they had en- 
 tertained of .my character, and showed to an unknown 
 stranger all the offices of christian charity. Among 
 the rest, I most gratefully acknowledge the services of 
 a skilful physician, and a judicious pious divine. The 
 former so assisted my naturally vigorous constitution 
 as to prevent me from falling a premature victim to 
 grief and despair, and preserved (under providence) 
 what I thought a valueless life, to be useful to you. 
 The latter told me that, as the immoderate indulgence 
 of grief argued an unsanctified rebellious spirit, so de- 
 spair could never find the wa)' into a heart which had 
 rot broken the injunction against placing our affections 
 on things beneath. As my body gained strength from 
 the restorative quality of those medicines which ' dis- 
 played the power of art without the shew,' my mind 
 derived energy front submission, and fortitude from 
 meekness. I no longer proudly asked, why I was 
 called to ibis hard trial ? what I had done to forfeit such 
 brilliant hopes : nor why the bolt of Heaven passed by 
 the more guilty to crush me to the earth ? In the events 
 which had dissevered me from the object I idolized, and 
 dissolved the fascinating visions of sublunary bliss, I 
 recognized the mercy that substituted an omniscient 
 and unchangeable Iking to my affections, and an eter- 
 nal and infinite happiness to my hopes. I rose from 
 the couch of infirmity languid and delicate in health, 
 but strong in mird, duly appreciating the brevity of 
 human life, anxious to secure the immortality for which 
 it was meant to prepare me, ready to fulfil the unknown 
 duties which inscrutable wisdom had preserved me to 
 discharge, and so sensible that I was in the hands of 
 one who would dispose of me in the way which would

 ultimately tend to my advantage, that I was able, with 
 the most entire acquiescence, to say, ' The will of Hea- 
 ven be done !' 
 
 " I continued in obscurity some years, till the death 
 of my sister again summoned me to the performance 
 of active duties. She knew of my retreat, and its 
 motives. It was necessary she should, as I received 
 from her the annuity which was my support. She led a 
 gay, and, as it was termed, a happy life, till she sunk 
 under the fatigue of continual pleasure. I attended 
 her in her last illness, and received her orphan children 
 as a solemn trust. Sir James, who died a few months 
 before her, had appointed his brother to be their guar- 
 dian, but as General Mandeville was on the continent, 
 I was for some time allowed the delightful employment 
 of nursing and educating you both. On his return, he 
 took George from me ; he was then of an age to re- 
 quire being removed from female superintendance. 
 The same prudent concern for your welfare induced 
 him to take you also, when your time of life gave you 
 a claim to an establishment suited to your birth and 
 fortune. 
 
 " And now, my love, you must perceive I had suffi- 
 cient reason to decline residing with you : nor will I 
 even expect the indulgence of your company at 
 Lime Grove. A load of obloquy has been thrown 
 on my character, which, as my story will not be 
 told, I cannot remove. The wife of the Earl of 
 Avondel must, like Caesar's, be as untainted in her 
 fame as in her person. My misfortunes are now 
 almost forgotten, my person is known to few. Why 
 should the censorious, the curious, and the tattling, 
 be invited to rake up the ashes of my mysterious 
 history, and to cast them on your untainted for- 
 tunes? Why should it be proclaimed, that you were 
 educated by one who had forfeited every pretence 
 to principle and honour? Calumny has been busy 
 with my name, and I have never stepped forward 
 to refute its slanders. You want no companion but 
 your husband, no director, nor adviser, but him.

 If, however, circumstances should arise which might 
 make a reference to an unprejudiced umpire desi- 
 rable, any casts of decorum best submitted to fe- 
 male indulgence and delicacy, the pen may be a 
 faithful expositor of our reciprocal sentiments. I 
 allude to the scarcely probable event of any differ- 
 ence of opinion arising between you and your lord, 
 or of your finding yourself exposed to those temp- 
 tations from which your rank and the reputation of your 
 husband, if attended by discretion and exemplariness of 
 manners on your part, will most probably secure you. 
 Yet, alas ! I too well know, that neither high birth, re- 
 putation, nor purity of intention, can prevent the daring 
 seducer from attempting to contaminate matronly chas- 
 tity and virgin innocence. Beware, then, my Emi- 
 ly, lest you invite his approaches. You shudder at 
 the suggestion; yet I must proceed. Hundreds, 
 innocent as you, have fallen. Bury in your own 
 bosom, I charge you, those petty differences, those 
 shades of dissatisfaction, which (such is human in- 
 firmity) will interrupt the "felicity of the happiest pair. 
 Never let the world perceive that you discover im- 
 perfections in your Avondel. Never let a word or a 
 look intimate that you conceive yourself less nobly 
 treated than you deserve. The licentious and the 
 designing will build the ruin of your fame or your 
 peace on such an intimation. The honour of a wife is 
 seldom attempted till she shews her seducer that 
 she may be wrought upon to hate or despise her hus- 
 band. 
 
 " I have laid open my whole heart, Emily, not 
 knowing whether this letter is to be submitted to your 
 lord's perusal. If the affection he bore ine have so 
 far subdued the keen sense of injury, which his lofty 
 mind must feel, as to induce him to forgive me, his 
 generous heart will rejoice to hear, that his once beloved 
 Selina is happy ; that she is so happy, so contented 
 with her lot, and so convinced that it was a meet cor- 
 rection of a disposition which had cultivated refine-

 THE young countess did not hesitate how to dis- 
 pose of this letter. She presented it to her lord, and 
 asked him. if it did not appear like the composition of 
 a beatified spirit ? Such indeed it seemed to that no- 
 bleman. Was he once so near possessing this trea- 
 sure, did she still exist, might he never call her his, 
 nor even know why the ties which bound her to him 
 were dissolved ? 
 
 On repeated perusals, several of Selina's expressions 
 struck him as tending to darken rathrr than elucidate 
 the mystery. She " knew too well the arts and the 
 effrontery of the seducer, she was conscious of having 
 incurred a load of obloquy, which she could not re- 
 move. She thought her niece's fame might suffer 
 from being intimate with her, she chose to remain in 
 obscurity ; she acquitted him of having provoked her 
 rejection, and she refuted the excuse he had sometimes 
 formed of her having heard some unfounded and af- 
 terwards disproved slander on his reputation, by own- 
 ing that her first pangs at this separation were aggra- 
 vated by a full conviction of his worth." Her letter 
 told nothing but the severity of her sufferings, yet her 
 conscience would not permit her to be more explicit ?

 What conclusion could he draw ? Had she after their 
 last interview fallen a victim to brutal violence or dia- 
 bolical fraud ? He determined to write to her himself, 
 and urge her to entrust this fatal secret to his unques- 
 tioned honour. 
 
 Yes, he resolved to write to his Selina, but the hand 
 even of Avondel trembled while performing the task. 
 His last letter to her was written from Avon Park, and 
 breathed the soul of tenderness and fond expectation. 
 He was now the husband of another, while with vestal 
 fidelity she still fed the never dying lamp of her early 
 love. Ashamed of this trepidation, which unmanned 
 the hero and degraded the statesman, he blamed his 
 weakness, and resolved after this one act of submis- 
 sion never more to be the puppet of a woman, but to 
 brace his nerves by referring to her acknowledgment 
 that she had given him cause to hate and despise her. 
 With this determination he commenced a correspon- 
 dence which it is my duty to give entire, especially 
 since it passed without the knowledge of Lady Avon- 
 del. 
 
 " To Lady Selina Delamore.

 nounce your vows to me, I still know not whether I 
 ought to condemn or applaud the principles on which 
 they were grounded, and which caused you to sacrifice 
 your own happiness and cloud my brightest hopes. I 
 cannot assume that language of distant respect which 
 a keen remembrance of my wrongs might seem to de- 
 mand. It is you I address, the adored associate of

 Tell me if the years of anguish thou hast suffered

 me how to assuage thy sorrows, or where to direct the 
 vindictive enmity which shall avenge thy wrongs. — 
 Above all, tell me, (though I tremble to ask) might

 terms insuperable, have been removed, had not I re-

 to whom I owe the happiness of my later years. She

 diffidence, as are painful to the possessor, and require 
 the support of every generous heart.

 without breach of that high sense of decorum which I 
 know you to possess, you would sometimes allow me 
 the society of my dear adopted child at Lime Grove, 
 I should receive every addition of joy of which my lot 
 is capable. I submit this request to your judgment,

 " I cannot close this soul-harrowing correspondence 
 in the language of unforgiving resentment. Cold and 
 distrustful as you are, I cannot divest myself of a lively 
 interest in your fortunes. Among other evils you enu- 
 merate that of a contracted income ; this must not be 
 while I possess affluence. You have a natural, if not 
 a legal right to the moiety of Emily's estate ; for Lord 
 Montolieu's unjust preference of his eldest daughter is 
 indefensible. Since it is your determination to conti- 
 nue in retirement I should only encumber you by in- 
 sisting on your taking your full share ; but, unless* jou 
 are resolved to disregard every proposal I can make, 
 you must allow your niece to remit you your present 
 annual stipend every quarter, and the inclosed deed se- 
 cures the perpetuity of this settlement. I blush to dis- 
 cover how cruelly your liberal spirit has hitherto been 
 circumscribed. If there be any other method by which 
 I can alleviate your -.lifricuities, command the services 
 of him who is ever your faithtul friend.

 <l To the Earl of Avondel. 
 " My lord, 
 
 u I have neither natural nor legal claim on the pro- 
 perty your wife inherits, yet, to convince you I am suf- 
 ficiently humble to re ceive obligation where I acknow-

 ment. I will owe the addition -wholly to yourself. I 
 do not wish Emily should know ol your bounty, nor 
 of my former difficulties. But since, after allowing 
 mvself every additional gratification, I can even fancy 
 I may want, I shall now have a large surplus, you must 
 permit me to consider myself as Emily's almoner, and 
 to distribute in her name the superfluities which I de- 
 rive from her inheritance. 
 
 M This correspondence has not been wholly painful, 
 for it proves that you have forgiven me, and that I still 
 possess your pity and your fi iend^hip. I submit to 
 your suggestion without a murmur, but, as my dear 
 child can suffer no reproach from corresponding with

 me, I trust this indulgence may be sometimes allowed 
 on the strict condition that it passes under your in- 
 spection. I fear Emily is so attached to me that even 
 your tenderness would not be a sufficient compensation 
 to render her happy, if you insist upon an immediate 
 and total breach. Besides this, I have neither wants 
 nor wishes ; should any arise, I will appeal to your 
 friendship, in full confidence that your goodness will 
 never reject, nor your wisdom mislead me. Till then 
 farewel. 
 
 " Selina Delamore." 
 
 " And farewel too," said Lord Avondel, " thou be- 
 witching inexplicable being ; yet perhaps, after all, only 
 a wayward trifler with my happiness and thy own. Thy 
 renewed remembrance burst upon me arrayed in all thy 
 apparent truth and loveliness, but like Ossian's ghosts 
 thou hast vanished in mist and storm, and left the 
 cheated fool who believed himself pursuing a superior 
 being, engaged in following the same ignis fatuus which 
 has misled him through life. The hand-writing, the 
 sentiments, renewed the idea of early confidence ; my 
 soul rushed forth to meet her with all the impassioned 
 warmth of fond sincerity. A reply, chilling as win- 
 ter, nipped my ardours. I asked what I deemed a 
 kindred mind to intrust me with its wrongs, and I re- 
 ceived a prudent lecture on duty : I was reminded that 
 I had an uxorious young wife who was tenacious of 
 every 'moiety of my affection ; and thus my fancied 
 paragon betrays the littleness of her sex, doubts when 
 she should place implicit confidence, and fears the 
 phantoms her own imagination has formed, till she 
 terms scrupulousness delicacy, and suspicion wisdom ! 
 'Tis too late to regret that I have soothed her vanity by 
 avowing the power she has over me. Important duties 
 happily will divert my time and thoughts from the ca- 
 pricious sex. Henceforth, I will be anv thing but a 
 lover." 
 
 Had Lord Avondel condescended to learn the uses 
 of affliction from the meek and devout recluse, whom

 lie alternately revered and condemned, he would have 
 entered on those engagements to which he determined 
 to devote all the powers of his vigorous enlightened 
 mind, with a spirit better prepared to sustain the ap- 
 proaching trials. But his high sense of his own merits 
 had taught him to expect happiness as a right, and he 
 considered every opposition to his claims of full suc- 
 cess and high enjoyment as an infringement of his 
 lawful property, not as a trial of his patience and wis- 
 dom ; as a violation of which he might complain, not 
 as a correction to which he ought to submit. His de- 
 signs were always noble : the general good of his spe- 
 cies, the happiness of all h'\6 connections, the universal 
 empire of benevolence and honour — Ought such de- 
 signs to be counteracted ? ought the exertions of ability, 
 integrity, and beneficence to be thwarted by folly, frus- 
 trated by meanness, or superseded by the narrow 
 views of cold-hearted selfishness? This would not be 
 right, yet. Lord Avondel, such is the state of this 
 world, arid this world is governed by Divine Provi- 
 dence ! These disappointments, therefore, of enlarged 
 views and noble intentions, mast happen by the permis- 
 sion and with the foreknowledge of God ; consequent- 
 ly some real advantage will result from these seeming 
 evils, the issues of which must be sought in a future 
 world. 
 
 Lord Avondel was not so fastidious and unreflecting 
 a being as to expect, diat he could secure the enjoy- 
 ments due to binh and station without enduring per- 
 sonal inconv. nience and mental labour. These, like 
 the duties of the tented field, he considered as glorious 
 toils, and much of his satisfaction consisted in his self- 
 felicitation, when, on reviewing his own conduct, he 
 considered the adroitness with which he had vanquish- 
 ed opposition, surmounted difficulty, and detected 
 fraud. But then he required that success should ulti- 
 mately crown his labours. The world must honour, not 
 his address only, but also his good fortune. Above all, 
 he must be soothed with the choral of congenial spi- 
 rits, possessed of capacities and engaged in pursuits si-

 roilar to his own, to enable them to discern his merit, 
 and with sufficient magnanimity to confess his superi- 
 ority. It was in this point of view he had once beheld 
 Selina Delamore, and when the resentment which her 
 refusal to repose in him the confidence which his at- 
 tachment and his wrongs gave him a right to demand 
 had excited, had so far cooled as to allow him to re- 
 flect, he acknowledged that thus he ought still to regard 
 her. His young countess was amiable, gentle, and af- 
 fectionate ; too timid and susceptible, as her aunt 
 justly observed. Fortitude was a most essential qua- 
 lity in a woman, without it, considered as the wedded 
 partner of a man of enterprize, she was but " a fair 
 defect in nature." In the views he had formed of fe- 
 male worth, fortitude was the leading virtue. Selina 
 possessed this quality. She could suffer either pain or 
 sorrow without complaining. How could he overlook 
 the want of this quality in Emily ? But Emily was 
 not his choice. He would either have walked solitary 
 to his grave, or had a companion to whom he might 
 have imparted his high designs, and whom he might 
 have consulted upon any important emergency, instead 
 of an apprehensive child who was ever needing his 
 instruction or fearing his displeasure. Yet, as he had 
 married Emily, the world never should say he had 
 been mercenary, nor should she complain that her pre- 
 ference hid been bestowed on a proud ungrateful man, 
 while Selina accused him of paining the fond crea- 
 ture who lived but for him. A whirl of ideas suc- 
 ceeded, which ended in a closer application to political 
 speculations. 
 
 The young countess, like her lord, was a determin- 
 ed expectant of full and perfect happiness, but then, 
 as she had found those essential ingredients in him 
 which he sought in the fortunate result of his labours, 
 she only wanted that consciousness of her own deserv- 
 ings (ot which her noble husband was not deficient) to 
 be truly blest. She soon discovered that by lifting the 
 lid of the mysterious casket, she had, like Pandofa, 
 suffered a host of cares and doubts to escape, and

 these continually haunted her in the shape of convic- 
 tions of her own unworthiness, and of her dissimili- 
 tude, and inferiority to the person who had once wholly 
 possessed, and still obviously shared, the heart of 
 Avondel. Apprehensive from extreme gentleness, and 
 depressed from humility, Lady Avondel was one of 
 the few people who think too much of their own de- 
 fects to correct them. The conspicuous station in 
 which her husband's talents placed her, was ill-suited 
 to her temper and character. Embarrassed by the at- 
 tention of the circle in which she moved, she was ever 
 shrinking from the self-possession and frankness of a 
 hostess into the retiring delicacy of a modest guest, 
 and if, conscious of omission, she forced herself out 
 of the back ground, she generally made some mal-a- 
 propos inquiry or ill-sorted compliment. She haran- 
 gued on the delights of domestic life to old bachelors, 
 and uttered a panegyric on independence to led cap- 
 tains and place hunters. She asked Mrs. Bloomwell 
 the age of her eldest daughter, and reminded Miss 
 Hecatissa Gorgon of the ravages of the small pox by 
 inquiring if it was she who had been sung under the 
 charactei of " Clormda, whom none can approach 
 without losing their heart or their senses ?" Many 
 people called Lady Avondel a sarcastic wit, more 
 thought her a fool. In reality she was neither of these 
 characters, but a well-principled, well-intentioned 
 young woman, acting in a sphere which did not suit 
 her, alarming some of her acquaintance from the ex- 
 cess of her own fears, and offending others by attempt- 
 ing to be superlatively agreeable. 
 
 " Ii was the universal opinion, that so fine a gentle- 
 man as the Earl of Avondel ought to improve the 
 manners of his wife, and if anxiety to have the per- 
 son who shared his title reflect lustre on his coronet, 
 would have made Emily a move a. goddess and look a 
 queen," while presiding at his banquets, or doing the ho- 
 nours on her own public days ; the amiable young count- 
 ess would have fulfilled all his wishes by appearing as 
 chc reflection of his own unquestioned brightness. —

 But not the most invidious of those many enemies, 
 which her apparent good fortune and real desert at- 
 tracted, could more severely judge or faithfully enu- 
 merate her own little errors than the conscious, self- 
 accusing Emily ; and her graceful instructor often 
 found himself compelled from humanity to soften the 
 humiliation of her own reproaches, rather than ad- 
 monish her to avoid a repetition of her petty trans- 
 gressions. Her dejection at knowing herself to have 
 behaved ridiculously was so painful to his generous 
 spirit, that, as the lesser evil, the all-elegant, all-com- 
 manding, Avondel was content to see his consort hur- 
 ry through the stated round of ceremony like a board- 
 ing school girl at her dancing master's ball. I speak of 
 the boarding school girl of the last century, who, with 
 tears in her eyes and blushes on her cheek, performed her 
 first public minuet with trepidation, rejoiced when it 
 was over, and, instead of anticipating praise, was 
 only desirous to avoid committing a very egregious 
 blunder. In Lady Avondel's vocabulary the axiom 
 of " know thy own self" was not interpreted to mean, 
 know thy own perfections, believe thyself the first 
 person in the room, and hold every one cheap who 
 doubts thy superiority. She read in it a perpetual me- 
 mento of her own personal insignificance and unde- 
 served elevation. How praiseworthy soever diffidence 
 may be in the abstract, like all other virtues it wants 
 the correction of judgment, and in the amiable Emily 
 it destroyed a quality which her arduous situation pe- 
 culiarly required, I mean self-possession.

 Lord Avondel's approbation was so necessary to Emily's 
 repose, that she never could listen to those remarks 
 which pointed at her behaviour with that state of feel- 
 ing which promises improvement. In the agony of 
 knowing she deserved severer censure, she lost sight 
 of those delicate delineations of manner which would 
 have insured his future approbation.

 at his appearance, threw an alarmed eye round the

 Pollexfen." 
 
 " Did you observe me, my Lord ? I thought you 
 were engaged in the next box." 
 
 " Be assured, Emily, that wherever my attention 
 may seem to be fixed, you are ever the most interest- 
 ing object. I must add, I hope no one else observed 
 you. Uncandid people might think you declined the 
 Marquis's civilities because he was too interesting, or 
 they might degrade me with the imputation of being 
 an austere suspicious husband." 
 
 Who durst be so ungenerous as to form such ground- 
 less conclusions ?" said Emily, her eyes swimming 
 with tears. 
 
 u Common observers, the numerous tribe of gos- 
 sips, those pests of every clime, from whose inventive 
 facukies I have deeply suffered. 'Tis the occupation 
 of the idle to watch your terrified looks, and they de- 
 termine never to be ignorant of the secret cause of 
 every casual, action. Let me ask you, if such ob- 
 servers are now present would thev not be justified in 
 reporting me to be a stern forbidding master, school- 
 ing my trembling pupil into perfect obedience." 
 
 " No," said Emily, energetically ; " they would 
 see a generous husband bearing with the weakness of 
 a heart which he knows to be all his own, and endea- 
 vouring to make his wife acquire that distinction on her 
 own account which now she only borrows from the 
 eminence of his character." 
 
 Lord Avondel acknowledged this grateful compli- 
 ment with a smile, which seemed to say, " Whatever 
 your faults are certainly you do not want penetration." 
 
 Emily determined that next time she saw Lord 
 Glenvorne the censorious should not quote her avoid- 
 ance of him in proof that he was too interesting. They 
 met at the drr. wing-room. He bowed slightly and 
 passed on. *' Doubtless/' thought the countess, " he 
 is piqued; now thev will determine us to be lovers. I 
 must go and speak to him immediately."

 She followed him with an anxiety that prevented 
 her from considering what she should say. She found 
 him conversing with several gentlemen, and accosted 
 him by his title ; but the fear of being impertinent now 
 seized her: every subject of conversation fled from her 
 recollection, and she could only ask if he had seen her 
 lord. 
 
 " I have the honour of presenting him to you," 
 said the Marquis, turning to one of his campanions, 
 " and of congratulating you, my lord, on your singu- 
 lar felicity. In this large circle Lady Avondel only 
 looks for vou." He bowed and retired. 
 
 w Did you want me ?" said Lord Avondel, in a low 
 tone. 
 
 " No," returned Emily : " only as I was so rude to 
 Lord Glenvorne at the opera I thought I would speak 
 to him first." 
 
 " And was there no other topic of conversation but 
 inquiring after me ? I had but just left you : have you 
 been spoken to r" 
 
 « Yes." 
 
 fi Then there is but one way to silence the invidi- 
 ous." He laid her trembling hand upon his arm and 
 led her to her chair. 
 
 " When," said Emily, '< shall I learn to acquit my- 
 self in public with such propriety as will preserve you 
 from being embarrassed by my folly." 
 
 " When you are content to improve those opportuni- 
 ties of civility which spontaneously offer, without dis- 
 tressing yourself and others by attempting to do too 
 much. I must now go back, and apologise for the 
 Secretary of State's being ferreted out of the diploma- 
 tic circle by his lady. Prepare yourself to answer 
 cards of inquiry, for I must insinuate that you were 
 overcome by the heat of the apartment." 
 
 " Would I could add I was entirely recovered from 
 my habitual awkwardness. Seriously, my lord, I can 
 never dare appear in public under this continual terror 
 of disgracing you."

 " You use a strong and improper term. Disgrace 
 attends guilt, and honour presides in the tribunal which 
 jusdy banishes real criminals from society. There is, 
 however, an inferior court governed by ridicule, and 
 though here inflictions are allowed to be often arbitrary 
 and unjust, I must deprecate the idea of your being 
 exposed to her censures. As to the court of honour, 
 Emily, never had husband less fear of seeing his wile 
 amenable to its jurisdiction." 
 
 " You are ever kind and conciliatory, my lord, and 
 I am encouraged by thinkir.g thai" only petty trespasses 
 come under the jurisdiction of ridicule." 
 
 " I have never found," answered the earl gravely, 
 " that persons long continued respectable after they 
 had become ridiculous." 
 
 k ' Then," said Emily, " I must as usual take shelter 
 under your wing, and defy the shafts of undiscerning 
 wit." 
 
 " Rather learn to be self dependent. When you are 
 alone in your own dressing room act and think as if 
 you had hundreds observing you, and when you move 
 in a crowded circle maintain that self-respect which will 
 make you feel as recollected as if 3'ou were at borne."

 the numerous inquiries after his countess on his reiurn

 me as the first of statesmen, I deserve to be immortal-

 memorial, have been appointed to watch where the 
 health of the community required the -animating cor- 
 dial of a falsehood, and to drug the charmed bowl 
 with a proper quantity of stimulating ingredients. 
 Probably such institutions may not now subsist, but at 
 the time I am speaking of an old cat party (as it was 
 called) met every evening at the Duchess of Stingwell's, 
 to talk over the events which either had happened, or 
 were adjudged probable. The president of this divan 
 was a woman of talent, who, with an affectation of 
 contempt for the world, nourished a secret grudge 
 against it for not having paid her sufficient homage, 
 and having failed in her early years to dazzle as a 
 beauty, she determined when she grew old to alarm as 
 a wit. Her coterie embraced all who were seldom in- 
 vited to other parties ; dowagers who could not afford 
 to play deep, and spinsters whose scanty portions for- 
 bade their taking the lead in fashion. All who were 
 destitute of those credentials which allowed them to 
 mix in the world, and yet wanted sufficient quietness 
 of disposition to bid it willingly adieu. Her grace, 
 who had been once complimented on her talent for sar- 
 casm, was equally celebrated for cutting up the censors 
 and the censured. Yet, though from htr keen reproofs 
 to the former she seemed to intimate that she abhorred 
 the innuendos which her guests circulated, she was in 
 reality one of those splenetic valetudinarians who find 
 both food and physic in a spirited slander. Her guests 
 too well knew her secret propensity, and were too 
 much gratified by being admitted to her converzasio- 
 nes, and having a card from a carriage with a ducal 
 coronet occasionally left at their door, to be piqued at 
 the disdainful air with which she often received their 
 communications, or to believe her sincere in her vindi- 
 cation of the devoted victims they chose to asperse. 
 
 On the day on which Lord Avondel felicitated him- 
 self on having played the part of an attentive husband 
 in the most dexterous manner, the Duchess of Sting- 
 well held one of her attic evenings.

 Mrs. Caudle introduced the subject. " I know," 
 said she, " your grace is deeply interested in the pros- 
 perity of the noble house or Avondel, and I have 
 great pleasure in assuring you that an heir may be ex- 
 pected. The countess tainted in the presence to dav, 
 and his lordship was so alarmed and assiduous — I hear 
 he makes a most tender husband? — 
 
 " To rather an affected sill)' wile, 1 ' continued Mrs. 
 Bloomwell. " Whether the fainting was artificial, I 
 cannot determine, but I am sure there was some art in 
 the rase ; for I heard her colour was quite carnation 
 as she was carried down the great staircase." 
 
 " Carried down the great staircase ?" resumed Mrs. 
 Caudle, "• I did not hear that. Bless me, how verv 
 shocking in her situation ! but I remember once before 
 I was confined — " 
 
 "• The fainting was not artifice, I assure your grace," 
 observed Miss Hecatissa Gorgon ; " but I much doubt 
 its arising from the cause Mrs. Caudle supposes. — ■ 
 There actually Mas a most unpleasant altercation in

 her as he put her into the chair, and " 
 
 " Poor, sweet, pretty young creature ;" exclaimed 
 a lady, who, though past her grand climacteric, still 
 wrote Miss Dizen upon her cards, and trembled lest 
 Hymen should one day entrap her in his cast net ; 
 " what dreadful creatures men are ! But Sir Walter 
 Mandeville made up this match, and sacrificed the 
 dear love before she knew how to act. You Lady 
 Caddy know the whole story, for I think you almost 
 lived at Castle MandtviUe." 
 
 " No, Madam, I assure you," returned the nabob's 
 lady colouring, " I now and then looked in on the old 
 baronet, and punished myself with listening to his vale- 
 tudinarian complaints. As to Lord Avondel, he never 
 was a favourite of mine." 
 
 " Nor of mine either," returned Miss Dizen. " If 
 he had made proposals to me 1 wouid not have marri- 
 ed him for fifty worlds. O, Lord Gienvorne was a 
 thousand times the best connection."

 " But," inquired the duchess, " what caused the dis- 
 pute between the earl and countess ?" 
 
 " I meant to inform your grace, if the company will 
 permit," resumed Miss Hecatissa, significantly look- 
 ing at Miss Dizen with the affectionate air common to 
 rival beauties. " Lord Glenvorne and Lady Avondel 
 were lounging against the window saying no harm in 
 in the world ; but just chit chat, as, Lord how hot — 
 What a quiz — I think that head tolerable — Pray do 
 you like that architectural trimming all frieze and pilas- 
 ter, but the wearer seems of the composite order — As 
 I live the German baroness in her yellow satin — 
 Well the sight of an old acquaintance is comfortable — " 
 
 Miss Hecatissa stopped for the exhilerating charms 
 of laugh, the company chimed in and she proceeded. 
 
 " In the midst of these innocent remarks up stalked 
 Lord Avondel. Your grace knows how ; stiff as a 
 drill serjeant, and extending his right arm, said very 
 solemnly, u Your ladyship had better go home." The 
 poor lady, fainted away directly, and my lord followed 
 muttering down the great staircase." 
 
 The company observed, it was the most shocking 
 affair they ever heard, and the duchess inquired if 
 Lady Auricle heard all that passed ? " Every sen- 
 tence," replied Miss Hecatissa. 
 
 " Really," said the duchess, " her powers of hear- 
 ing are astonishing. Was she placed in the drawing 
 room or in the court ?" 
 
 Miss Hecatissa paused, and then added, Lady Au- 
 ricle was so kind as to follow the countess, thinking 
 she might want assistance. 
 
 " It would have been still kinder if she had been a 
 silent assistant," resumed her grace. 
 
 Lady Caddy now fanned the embers of slander which 
 the duchess's mal-a-propos observations threatened to 
 extinguish, by expressing her fears it was too true. — 
 " I hope," said she, " it will not draw Lord Glenvorne 
 into any embarrassment. His mother is the best friend 
 I have in the world. The worthiest, most exemplary

 creature ! If any thing happens to her son it will break 
 her heart ; I hope she knows nothing of it." 
 
 " I don't say," continued Miss Hecatissa, that the 
 world goes so far as to call Lord Avondel jealous, or 
 to hint at any thing wrong about Lord Glenvorne ; but 
 we all know she is dreadfully distressed in the mar- 
 quis's company." 
 
 Every body owned they had observed it, though in 
 fact Lady Caddy was the only person who was autho- 
 rised to speak on the subject by having actually wit- 
 nessed their interviews. She alone was silent, but 
 shook her head in a manner more impressive than the 
 most sententious observation. She again hoped the 
 affair was quite a secret. 
 
 " It is in admirable hands to remain so," said the 
 duchess, surveying her myrmidons. They all agreed, 
 that since the happiness of a newly married pair, and 
 the reputation of a lady, were most tender points, it 
 was excessively wrong to talk of such strange proceed- 
 ings. 
 
 The assembly broke up about one o'clock, and for 
 twelve hours very little was said upon the subject, ex- 
 cepting to humble cousins and confidential Abigails. 
 About noon the next day. Lady Caddy made an early 
 call on her friend the marchioness to inquire if she 
 had heard any thing of the young countess ? " No," 
 returned Lady Glenvorne, " my son dined there ves- 
 terday after the drawing-room, and escorted her to an 
 evening party."

 " Certainly." 
 
 " Was not that singular ?"

 to tell me what the -orld has made of that incident."

 think it right to tell their acquaintance what they know 
 will give them uneasiness. Lady Caddy was of this

 order. With much affected reluctance, and many 
 hopes it would not distress her, she repeated the con- 
 versation which passed at the duchess's, and affirmed 
 it was the general opinion that Lord Glenvorne caused 
 all the unhappiness ot the Avondeis. 
 
 " Scarcely a day has passed," returned the marchi- 
 oness, " without my seeing my young friend, and it is 
 quite extraordinary news to me, to hear that she and 
 her lord are unhappy ?" 
 
 " Then," said Lady Caddy, " I do trust that the 
 other affair is a secret." " To me, at least, it is," re- 
 plied Lady Glenvorne; nor will I press you to di- 
 vulge any more painful mysteries." 
 
 u O, my dearest madam, I place implicit confidence 
 in your honour. I know you will not utter a syllable, 
 as it might ruin my informant." Then drawing her 
 chair close, in a low whisper she assured the marchion- 
 ess, that she knew Avondel had settled an annuity on 
 Lady Selina Deiamore, and corresponded with her at 
 that moment. 
 
 She added, u It is too .bad. Candour cannot sug- 
 gest an apology, to employ the poor young woman's 
 fortune this way." 
 
 Lady Glenvorne inquired, if she was sure of the 
 fact ? and Lady Caddy vowed she could produce a 
 person who knew her writing, and could name the so- 
 licitor who drew up the deed of settlement. Then 
 mustering her whole stock of inquisitorial significance, 
 " As we have gone so far," said she, " pray do you 
 know if the child is alive ?" 
 
 " You have infinitely the advantage of me," said the 
 Marchioness, " for I am compelled to ask you, what 
 child ?" 
 
 u Nay, my dear Lady Glenvorne, now you are too 
 cautious. You must remember why Selina disappear- 
 ed. Mrs. Caudle suspected her shape three months 
 before she became invisible." 
 
 " The report you allude to," replied the Marchion- 
 ess, " was discredited by all well-informed people at 
 the time ; and as you could then be only in your in-

 fancy, I must blame the convenient memory of some 
 dealer in antiquated scandal for not telling you, that 
 though Lord Avondel's enemies attempted to promul- 
 gate a silly story, it was too absurd to be credited. 
 Lady Selina was one of my earliest and dearest friends. 
 We still occasionally correspond, and I know enough 
 of her history to justify her character. I cannot under- 
 take to prove a negative, but if there be any depend- 
 ence on moral evidence, if it be fair to draw conclu- 
 sions from an unbroken chain of circumstances, I may 
 assert, that neither Lord Avondel nor Lady Selina ever 
 have had cause to blush at an attachment, singularly 
 unfortunate, I own, but not disgraceful." 
 
 " You rejoice my heart," returned Lady Caddy. 
 " My warm affections really torment me. I take too 
 lively an interest in the distresses of those I love." 
 
 " I honour sensibility," answered Lady Glenvorne, 
 " and to make you quite happy let me assure you, even 
 yourself and Sir Joseph are not more perfect patterns 
 of domestic felicity than our friends in Berkley-square. 
 Glenvorne's pretensions to Emily were well known, and 
 I most anxiously wished to embrace her as my daugh- 
 ter. It required, therefore, no common merit in her 
 husband to reconcile us to an event which compelled us 
 to renounce such cherished hopes. Glenvorne was a 
 generous lover, he wished for the happiness of the be- 
 loved object even if it were distinct from his own. 
 From the ease with which he meets her, now she is 
 Lady Avondel, and his warm admiration of her lord, I 
 am convinced love with him has subsided into friend- 
 ship. The extreme delicacy of the young countess, 
 still creates an awkward reserve in her manner to my 
 son, and she seems to suppress her affectionate attach- 
 ment to her lord in his presence from a fear of giving 
 pain to her rejected admirer. This will abate in time, 
 and the motive is so refined that even her reserve and 
 apprehensive shyness increase our respect for her cha- 
 racter." 
 
 Lady Caddy doubtless heard this valuable informa- 
 tion with rapture, but as she drove to her other morn-

 ing calls, she recollected, that since the Marchioness 
 had not desired her to contradict the rumours that were 
 afloat it would be taking a great liberty to publish her 
 private sentiments, and at this moment she determined 
 to abide by the decision of that cabinet council of vir- 
 tue and prudence assembled at the Duchess of Sting- 
 well's, and to say nothing of such strange proceedings. 
 
 It may seem extraordinary, that a woman of Lady 
 Caddy's avowed candour and general philanthropy, 
 and one too who was so tenderly attached to the dear 
 little Emily, at least during the siege of Castle Mande- 
 ville, did not voluntarily undertake what seemed a 
 friendly action. But ladies do not always measure 
 their own characters with such mathematical exactness, 
 as to avoid taking credit for a large quantity of those 
 virtues of which in fact they have not a scruple. Be- 
 sides, though the plant of female friendship seems to 
 grow upon every soil, its roots frequently only spread 
 over the surface, and thus either wind or sun absolutely 
 destroys it. Indeed, Lady Avondel had not behaved 
 quite correctly to so susceptible and refined a person as 
 Lady Caddy, or to use plain English, to a woman so 
 engrossed with her own perfections, and so apt to take 
 offence. The combined attractions of youth, modesty, 
 gentleness, and simplicity, gave the fair countess that 
 degree of eclat which the looms of Lyons or the mines 
 of Golconda were in vain employed to secure to the 
 maturer charms of the bridal widow. Emily had 
 moreover inconsiderately refused to profit by the taste 
 and judgment of her friend in choosing her iurniture 
 and arranging her parties ; and, worse than all, she had 
 been guilty of the unparalleled ingratitude of never ap- 
 propriating a plate at the head table at her gala suppers 
 to a person who had been so very kind to her when 
 she was quite a raw girl. But Lady Caddy knew the 
 world, and was not surprised at this treatment irom 
 one whom she had noticed when she was nobody. 
 
 Her dislike of Lord Avondel was publicly avowed, 
 and as it originated from his inherent qualities, there

 protested, that she saw in her own husband the stand- 
 ard of excellence, her looking with repugnance on a 
 man who exhibited an exact contrast to her adored 
 spouse was accounted for. His tall graceful figure, his 
 majestic aspect, large expressive eyes, and "voice clear 
 as a trumpet with a silver sound ;" his manners polish- 
 ed into elegance, not ground down to foppishness or 
 unreflecting acquiescence ; his high birth, his lofty 
 aims, his capacious views, his superiority to mean pas- 
 sions and criminal gratifications, his disdain of wealth 
 and all the low advantages and selfish enjoyments it 
 could procure ; presented so strong a dissimilitude to a 
 little square man whose person resembled a well cram- 
 med rouleau, and whose broad flat features were ren- 
 dered yet mere vapid and insignificant by being dis- 
 tended with a constant grin, that they scarcely seemed 
 of the same species. Sir Joseph said nothing about his 
 parentage. Fortune found him a sutler in the British 
 camp, when, at the battle of Plassey, she rained pago- 
 das on the lucky adventurers, who revenged the mise- 
 ries of the suffering victims in the prison at Calcutta 
 on the perfidious and wantonly cruel Surajah Dowla. 
 Sir Joseph lost a brother in that scene of indescribable 
 distress, but he always spoke of the circumstance as a 
 good thing, because it introduced him to the considera- 
 tion of the officers, and the plunder of a Rajah's tent, 
 which was awarded him, made him what he called a 
 good man. Soon after, he obtained a contract and thus 
 became a very good man indeed, and being appointed a 
 permanent commissioner, he was found in that situa- 
 tion by Lord Avondel, with whom he formed an official 
 acquaintance. As he was very punctual in performing 
 his engagements, he acquired respect as an industrious 
 steady character, sufficiently alert at making bargains. 
 All other talents, excepting those which are requisite 
 in accumulating and managing money, Sir Joseph de- 
 spised as useless, and nourished a secret contempt for 
 Lord Avondel, who, with fine opportunities, returned 
 from India poorar than he went, and thus was forced

 to marry a wife to maintain him instead of choosing 
 one to his fancy, like himself. 
 
 Ey.en in minute particulars these gentlemen were 
 oppotites. For as Lord Avondel had practised tem- 
 perance till excess became distasteful rather than an 
 indulgence, so Sir Joseph, who saw in wealth no other 
 delight than as it ministered to animal enjoyment, led 
 a life of misery from the diseases attending repletion, 
 and the torment of self-denial. Thus, let selfishness 
 embark in whatever vessel it pleases in search of hap- 
 piness, it is sure to get entangled among rocks and 
 quicksands. Sir Joseph cared for no public calamities 
 while the Bank of England was safe. He felt no anx- 
 ieties from sympathy ; for even if Lady Caddy died 
 he could get another wife. Domestic disappointments 
 did not trouble him ; for if his pines rotted he had 
 money to buy some at Covent Garden. Yet, he too 
 found, that " man was made to mourn." Agony 
 perched upon the turtle soup, vexation hovered over 
 the under-done venison, gout was mixed in his sauces 
 and ragouts, and phthisic lurked in his West India 
 sweetmeats. Thus, while Lord Avondel felt his soul 
 wounded by some national loss or disgrace, vainly 
 struggled against the tide of faction, or deplored the 
 imbecility of his friends and the active malice of his 
 enemies, Sir Joseph Caddy was grumbling that a man 
 cannot eat what he likes without suffering pain, and 
 devoted his time to the study of what good things 
 were wholesome, and how nature might be assisted to 
 throw off her accumulation of undigested humours 
 without submitting to too severe a discipline. He, 
 however, found a little time between his cook and his 
 physician to join his lady in laughing at Lord Avondel, 
 as a man whose talents were rather shewy than substan- 
 tial, as was proved by his having spent his life to very 
 little purpose.

 AMONG the nominal colleagues of Lord Avon- 
 del's political career was the youthful Lord Norbury. 
 His father had so distinguished himself on the opposi- 
 tion benches as to convince the uninitiated, that if ever 
 the good genius of England should so far prevail as to 
 bring him into office he would make the most uncor- 
 rupt and enlightened minister ; but adepts thought he 
 would be an adroit active coadjutor, useful in holding 
 out lures adapted to the characters he had to contend 
 with, in dressing up a bad cause, and in practising that 
 most dexterous part of state machinery, the appearing 
 perfectly plausible and communicative and at the same 
 time not disclosing one iota but what was publicly 
 known. He had no other objection to putting on the 
 court livery than the difficulty of finding a suit that 
 would fit him ; and as soon as his measure was exactly 
 taken he vaulted from his oratorical tribune into the 
 treasury bench, and commenced Baron Norbury with 
 a pension fit to support his honours. He was, howe- 
 ver, soon found to be an incumbrance rather than an 
 assistant, for in moving the machine of government it 
 is necessary to draw altogether at a steady pace and 
 with determined strength. But Lord Norbury was 
 for curveting, prancing, or standing still, biting at one 
 of his yoke fellows, and kicking another, gallopping off 
 after the casual game that crossed the road, and falling

 down in the first slough he encountered. In fine, he 
 was a man of wonderful invention, amazing projects, 
 and inexhaustible resources, but destitute of decision, 
 coolness, and arrangement. After despatching various 
 expeditions, .and devoting the resources on which their 
 success depended to other purposes ; after planning 
 several improvements in legislature and finance, and 
 introducing new corruptions into every department, 
 Lord Norbury discovered that his health was unequal 
 to the fatigues of public life. He therefore retired 
 with some valuable sinecures, and devoted his time to 
 the education of his son, who, he determined, should 
 be a still more celebrated statesman than himself, and 
 unite the qualities of Lycurgus, Pericles, and Demos- 
 thenes. 
 
 Though we are all ready to allow, that culture fails 
 to produce the perfection which parents expect from 
 its application, yet few who have been long and deep- 
 ly occupied in instructing their own children are will- 
 ing to acknowledge, that thev have spent their time in 
 twisting a rope of sand. Lord Norbury saw in his 
 son all the latent properties of a cot-summate states- 
 man, while every discerning friend discovered pro- 
 pensities which would be insuperable impediments to 
 his acquiring renown. The young Tuily was found 
 to be like his father, brilliant rather than solid, and 
 more desirous " that the club should hail him master 
 of the joke," than that wondering senates should hang 
 on all his words. The world is sometimes so good- 
 natured as to credit bills which are drawn upon its 
 admiration by an established firm, without examining 
 whether they are fictitious drafts or securities of real 
 value. So much was said of the astonishing talents 
 and premature wisdom or' Mr. Davenant, son of the 
 great Lord Norbury, that expectation stood on tiptoe 
 to witness the parliamentary debut of this phenome- 
 non. His maiden speech was extremely admired as 
 something out of the common line, classical, spirited, 
 and profound. I admit, if you sifted the eulogist nar- 
 rowly, they began to talk of his youth, allowed he was

 not well acquainted with the powers of his own voice, 
 that his action might be improved, and that his argu- 
 ments, though ingenious, had been all used by the 
 former speakers on the subject. His phraseology too 
 was rather crowded by a too frequent return of those 
 unlucky M Mr. Speaker, I beg pardon Sir, my own ir- 
 resistible feeling," 8cc. which are apt to be strewn on 
 the harangues of novices. Yet still the speech was a 
 capital speech, that is, for a young man who was heir 
 to a title, and new to the forms of the house. In fine, 
 according to the newspapers, it excited very powerful 
 sensations in all who heard it : and since smiling, wink- 
 ing, coughing, and gaping, are natural expressions of 
 powerful sensations, the newspapers said no more than 
 what is truth, which is a very high commendation. 
 
 Mr. Davenant took his seat at the board, where he 
 was to learn the routine office before he realized his 
 father's expectations, and rushed forth mighty to go- 
 vern and to guide. But ere that period arrived, the 
 impenetrable veil of death dropped on the eyes of 
 Lord Norbury, and if (indulging in poetical imagina- 
 tion) I attend his shade to the Elysian fields, where, as 
 in a city coffee-house, the heroes of classical antiquity 
 walk about and ask what news, I could not with correct- 
 ness introduce the parallel of Ulysses in the shape of a 
 a modern quidnunc telling the enraptured sire the 
 speeches and measures of his illustrious son. From 
 the period of his taking possession of his fortune to the 
 time I am treating of, the world kept inquiring what 
 Lord Norbury was about. Much had been said of his 
 talents and patriotic principles, surely envy, intrigue, 
 treachery, and a thousand similar hindrances must 
 have united to confine so wonderful a young statesman 
 behind the scenes, and to deprive his injured country 
 of the grand specific which he had been preparing for 
 all her disorders. 
 
 But Lord Norbury was all this time very busy, stu- 
 dying tin; baser parts of society preparatory to his go- 
 verning the better, as Warwick described Prince Hal, 
 to sooth the sorrows of his disappointed father. His

 lordship drank, intrigued, and frequented the two lead- 
 ing gaming houses, for he was too liberal to be a party 
 man at dice or billiards. He became a member of the 
 Savoir vivre, and the leading demireps toasted him at 
 their coteries as a divine feliovv. I do not mean that 
 he studied or practised divinity, or possessed what very 
 orthodox writers now call the divinity of talent, but di- 
 vine was the indefinable cant word of the year, and was 
 applied to divine dresses, divine masquerades, a divine 
 run of good luck, and a divine eclaircissement ; I am 
 not sure that there were not divine elopements, in 
 which case I hope the husband had divine damages. 
 The character of Lord Norhury in the world of gal- 
 lantry was that of a male coquet. He kept off other 
 offers by persuading the unmarried ladies he meant to 
 make them an honourable proposal ; and he whispered 
 away the reputation of wives by insinuating, that, 
 though renowned for secresy, he was more admired 
 by ladies and hated by husbands than any man of his 
 age. His fair auditors blessed themselves when he 
 talked in ' this style; called him a wicked creature, 
 vowed they did not believe a word he said, and pu- 
 nished him with violent blows with their fans, whis- 
 pering each other at the same time "That he was a 
 divine fellow after all." 
 
 But though Lord Norbury was thus studying the 
 world for his future improvement, he did not forget his 
 present duties. He regularly attended the sittings of 
 the board to which he belonged, that is, he came in just 
 as the business ended, nrdded his assent to what he 
 was told they had been doing, and while the minutes of 
 their transactions were read pro forma, he enlivened 
 the fiat routine of labour by some inimitable jests on 
 two or three of the humble members, who submitted 
 to be his buts, as in that character they had free access 
 to hib table. Lord Norbury, like some other great men 
 of that age, (Heaven forbid I should allude to the pre- 
 sent) fancied that as the Roman capitol had been saved 
 by geese, monkies might eventually prove the best 
 guardians of the Lritish empire : he therefore always

 preferred a jest to a reason, and antic gestures to wise 
 suggestions. Nothing to him was so intolerable as a 
 dry discussion of a dry subject; and whenever he 
 condescended to argue, he confuted his adversary with 
 sarcasms and defended his own opinion by flights of 
 fancy. Thus, when his natural indolence could be 
 roused, he became extremely useful to his party ; for, 
 in all intricate questions, I believe-, it is reckoned, that 
 not more than one convert is gained by conviction .or 
 twenty who have been completely pu2zled or laughed 
 out of their opinions by an adept in the science of ca- 
 villing, armed with the irresistible weapons of rhodo- 
 montade and irony. 
 
 Such was the situation which this phcenix held, not 
 without a secret consciousness that he was fitted to 
 mount higher, whenever he could be content to resign 
 the plumes oi wit, spirit, and humour, for the civic 
 Wreath of the plodding man of business, a character 
 which, though much below his own, he one day intend- 
 ed to assume. The embarrassments which Lord Nor- 
 burv's irregular habits had introduced into this depart- 
 ment, first suggested co the premier the necessity of 
 recalling Lord Avondel into public life ; and it was at 
 this board he was appointed to preside to counteract 
 the genius of disorder in the shape of a town wit turn- 
 ed statesman. The firmness and promptitude of the 
 noble eari, seconded by his high reputation, produced a 
 complete revolution. Whoever has had tne honour of 
 sitting between two very great men of opposite charac- 
 ters, whom he was alike desirous of propitiating, and 
 has felt the difficulty of preserving his face in a proper 
 equilibrium while one great man was very facetious, 
 and the other profoundly grave, may guess the mise- 
 ries of the humbler coadjutors of these two noblemen 
 while the senior kept recommencing attention to busi- 
 ness, an; 1 the junior was persuading one of the com- 
 missioners, who mighc have sat for a frontispiece to

 Norbury's facetious powers were diminished, but be- 
 sides that Lord Avondel daily seemed more hostile to 
 jesting, he dismissed two subalterns for being negli- 
 gent, and as his influence was known to gain ground 
 in a quarter where worth is sure to be esteemed, the 
 earl was suspected of being prepared to bring out a 
 very intelligible comment on the texts which assert, 
 " that there is a time to laugh and a time to weep, a 
 time to keep silence and a time to speak." It seemed 
 imprudent to irritate the testy statesman beyond the 
 act of biting his nails or dashing his pen on the table. 
 By the secession of laughers at his jokes, Lord Nor- 
 bury found himself either compelled to be merry alone, 
 which is the dullest of all undertakings, or to transport 
 his mirth to a more eligible situation. A few month's 
 observation convinced him, that, as the earl was not to 
 be trifled with, the price of non-attendance or inatten- 
 tion would be dismission, and though it was now crowd- 
 ed with what was disagreeable, like Bobadil, he found 
 the " cabin convenient." He was therefore compelled 
 to put on the man of business, and at least to be pre- 
 sent and silent while Lord Avondel exercised his great 
 mind in arranging the minutiae of those plans which 
 his wisdom had suggested, with the persevering atten- 
 tion of a mechanic fixed in his loom to a daily task. 
 
 Whatever road we happen to choose to conduct us 
 to reputation, self-attachment makes us feel peculiarly 
 susceptible of any rebuff or impediment in our passage, 
 even though it should be the means of diverting us 
 into a more respectable path, or one better adapted to 
 our talents. Lord Norbiiry was designed by nature 
 for something better than a rattle, but he cherished a 
 strong dislike to a man who had compelled him to af- 
 fect those sedate qualities which he was ever ready to 
 sacrifice to the applause of the moment. Dislike soon 
 grew into irreconcilable enmity, when he perceived that 
 though he could rival or even excel Lord Avontkl in 
 pointing a repartee, or relating an anecdote, he could 
 never eclipse him in a debate, suggest wiser expedi- 
 ents, or penetrate into the characters of men, or the

 designs of foreign courts, with such masterly discern- 
 ment. Driven from the seat where he had been ac- 
 customed to exercise sovereign power, and compelled 
 to sit on the stool of inferiority in another's kingdom, 
 he was left without hope of humbling the prepondera- 
 ting greatness which had made him kick the beam. 
 An attempt to impugn Lord Avondel's integrity and 
 disinterestedness would but discover his own foulness, 
 like the crawling of a slug on a tablet of alabaster: and 
 he might as well have attempted to answer the Sphinx 
 as to refute his rival's arguments, or render his propo- 
 sals ridiculous. Was Avondel then invulnerable to the 
 shafts of malice ? or, as Norbury would have put the 
 question, could not just resentment teach him to feel 
 the pain of being mortified, and the vexation of sub- 
 mitting to the loss of some valued acquisition, or the 
 consciousness of degradation ? How untainted must 
 be that virtue in which revenge, assisted by wit and 
 talent, could find nothing base or contemptible^ 
 
 But though invincible in his own person, Avondel 
 had a young wife, whom his public duties compelled 
 him to trust chiefly to her own discretion ; and if Nor- 
 bury allowed him pre-eminence on the stage of busi- 
 ness, surely, in the field of gallantry, his youthful 
 competitor must be the Caesar who would " come, see, 
 and conquer." He had met the countess ; she inte- 
 rested him just as much as any other woman of fashion, 
 that is to say, she would serve to trifle with, and was 
 handsome enough to justify him for pretending an at- 
 tachment. As the wife of the haughty Earl of Avon- 
 del she became a most desirable conquest ; but then as 
 he could not suppose this man of loftv aims and high 
 desires had ever submitted to the bondage of Cupid, 
 he doubted if he would keenly feel the infidelity :md 
 disgrace of the insignificant girl who shared his coro- 
 net. Norbury had never been a witness of connubial 
 happiness. He fancied Avondel, like his own father, 
 had been content " to wive it wealthily ;" and as he 
 supposed Emily must have been a reluctant votress at 
 the shrine of Hymen, he thought the victory would be

 too easy to give eclat to the conqueror. For compare 
 the stilt sententious solemn spouse with the airy graces, 
 the infinite humour, the everflowing small talk, of the 
 gallant, forty three with twenty iour, Count Osmond, 
 Lord Constable of Sicily, with the gay Lothario, the 
 u dear deceiver," with the best dressed beau in London, 
 the chiet of cicisbeos, the phcenix of phaeton drivers, 
 the pattern of every polite art and happy invention : — 
 Pshaw ! it was too ridiculous. She would be fascinated 
 at the first glance, vanquished by one compliment, and 
 ready to elope before he could order a chaise and four, 
 and bribe the Abigail. He doubted whether diaboli- 
 cal revenge (1 use the proper phrase, Norbury called 
 it a counterplot on Avondel) could be a sufficient stimu- 
 lus to persuade him to undertake such a stupid intrigue. 
 Emily's extreme modesty and gentleness gave her such 
 a 1 a^hlul appearance in public, that he, like many 
 others, unjustly under-rated her understanding. Every 
 feeling of her soul was spontaneously imprinted on her 
 ingenuous countenance, and as she oitcn felt confused, 
 embarrassed, and vexed with herself, this very pecu- 
 liar quality of self-condemuation was generally con- 
 strued to imply unhappiness in her wedded lot. Of 
 all intrigues an attempt on a discontented simpleton is 
 the dullest, and, had she not been Countess of Avon- 
 del, she affected so little eclat, and was so retired in 
 her habits, that Lord Norbury would never have 
 thought of her a second time. 
 
 On further enquiry into the history of the married 
 pair whose comforts he meant to poison, he found with 
 amazement that Emily was fondly attached to her 
 lord's person and an idolater of his fame. This im- 
 plied thc»t she was one of the few women who really had 
 what might be termed some character. He heard also 
 she had always lived in the country, had seen verj lit- 
 tle, and had been romantically educated. This came 
 of course, and would make her a pleasant relief to the 
 vapid sameness of town ladies. Hut she had rejected 
 a higher title, a younger man, and a better fortune than 
 Lord Avondel's. True, but Glcnvorne was a solemn

 fop, as dull as Avondel, and not so much talked of. 
 The young lady had shewn she was captivated by re- 
 putation ; what attractions had the renown of a gene- 
 ral, an ambassador, a statesman, or a governor, for a 
 young woman? at least when compared with the glory 
 of chaining to her car the most invincible rover, and 
 most formidable seducer who had appeared since beau- 
 ty formed so strict a league with her sister chastity, 
 that the Lovelaces and Pollexfens of the times were 
 formed to brave the gallows ere they could establish 
 their claim to the honour of an amour ? 
 
 To the no small gratification of Lady Caddy, Lord 
 Norbury's name was inscribed on her visiting list, and 
 the acquaintance was a mutual convenience. For be- 
 sides that Sir Joseph kept the best cook in London, he 
 had no objection to the world's loan and premium, and 
 her ladyship played very ill, and liked a high stake. 
 On the other hand, though in what related to sound 
 sense and sterling goodness she could place Sir Joseph 
 on a par with Lord Avondel without making her audi- 
 tors violate the rules of politeness further than by a 
 smile, she could not compare them as parallels in wit 
 and taste without urging the risible muscles of her 
 friends beyond all power of retention. Here Lord 
 Norbury became very useful, and he might be describ- 
 ed as better bred, better dressed, a finer figure, a more 
 liberal patron of the fine arts, a more entertaining com- 
 panion ; and, in fine, her friend Lord Norbury, who 
 took his mutton with them twice a week, and never 
 missed her parties, was in all respects superior to Lord 
 Avondel, who rarely left a card at her door, took little 
 pains to disguise his dislike of her, and was just civil 
 to Sir Joseph. 
 
 On that accommodating principle which induces pub- 
 lic characters to be on good terms with every body, 
 Emily complied with her lord's desire, and kept up a 
 slight acquaintance with her Devonshire duenna ; and 
 the title of countess sounded too well through the 
 anti-room on a gala night, especially where there was a 
 scarcity of that commodity, to allow Lady Caddy to

 be as angry with the Avondels as she wished. It was 
 at her house, therefore, that Lord Norbury met his in- 
 tended prey at a morning visit. Contrary to her usual 
 style of conversation, Lady Caddy introduced politics, 
 and expatiated on a public measure, which she said 
 was generally agreed to be more beneficial than any 
 that had been brought forward for half a century. It 
 was difficult to know what she was about, till she turned 
 to Lord Norbury and observed, that the world would 
 owe this blessing to his patriotism. " The world, 
 madam," answered he, "bestows on me a degree of 
 fame which I do not deserve, for I assure you, upon 
 my honour, the bill you so justly commended originat- 
 ed with Lord Avondel." 
 
 Emily, who w r ith the depressed composure of exalted 
 meekness had dropped her pensive head during this 
 ebullition of ill-will, which she knew was pointed at 
 her lord, suddenly felt her face glow with delight. She 
 darted a look of inexpressible satisfaction and grati- 
 tude at Lord Norbury. She roused from what might 
 be termed a stupor, but what really was the lively emo- 
 tion of sensibility, conscious of injury, yet too gentle 
 to contend, and viewing the champion of her lord's 
 honour with more than common approbation, she en- 
 tered into a spirited conversation with the young lord ; 
 who, while handing her to her carriage, observed, that 
 the warmth of her connubial attachment at once adorn- 
 ed and ennobled her beauty. " I detest invidious peo- 
 ple," said she, " as much as I honour candour ;" and 
 then in the gaiety and sincerity of her heart, kissed 
 her hand, bowed to Norbury, and drove home to tell 
 her lord how generously he had behaved. 
 
 Lord AvondePs love of praise rendered the cup of 
 flattery always grateful provided the ingredients were 
 well mixed, and offered with an air of gracefulness. 
 *' I think," said he, " I have been unjust to this young 
 man; I fancied him vain and frivolous, and thought 
 he regarded me with peculiar animosity." 
 
 " He did you noble justice," replied Emily. " But, 
 my dearest lord, you always leave me to hear of your

 renown from strangers. Why did not you tell me that 
 your sleepless nights and thoughtful days were employ- 
 ed in perfecting this plan ? I should not then have been 
 terrified, sometimes with thinking I had offended you, 
 at others with fearing you were indisposed." 
 
 " I would cure you of your solicitude in this respect, 
 Emily, by giving you opportunities of discovering its 
 unreasonableness. Amid a hundred causes which may 
 account for my being serious or absent, will you never 
 allow yourself to fix on any that may neither impeach 
 my affection for you nor wound your own feelings ? But 
 with respect to Norbury, he has done me more than 
 justice, for he really threw out the original idea on 
 which I laboured till I gave it consistency and practi- 
 cability ; he is therefore justly entitled to share the re- 
 putation." 
 
 " He concealed all this," replied the countess, " and 
 spoke of you with such warmth of esteem that I quite 
 fell in love with him." 
 
 " 'Tis a pity he is so dissipated," resumed the earl ; 
 " he certainly has talents and penetration, and I now 
 hope principle. I have treated him too cavalierly, pos- 
 sibly a little regular society might correct his morals." 
 
 The next time they met at the office, Lord Avondel 
 returned Lord Norbury's bow with a less formal air. 
 The members were not assembled : " We punctual 
 men," said the earl, " may derive an advantage from 
 our early hours, since it will allow us an opportunity 
 of cultivating more than an official acquaintance." 
 
 u So," thought Norbury, " the bait has taken. 
 Charming little soul ! I see she can move this mighty 
 machine at pleasure, and the destined cornuto is as 
 tractable as I could wish." He then protested he was 
 the worst in the world at grave speeches, or he should 
 say it was his highest ambition to possess the private 
 as well as the political friendship of the Earl of 
 Avondel. 
 
 " We have lost too much time," said that nobleman, 
 " to waste any more in mere formality ; you must dine 
 with me to-day."

 " I have but one objection, my lord, my heart is 
 very vulnerable, and the charms of your countess'' — 
 
 " Are defended by my entire confidence, and her 
 unswerving discretion," returned the earl with an air 
 of gravity. 
 
 " I am not such a determined coxcomb," answered 
 Norbury, u as to attempt vanquishing such invincible 
 guardians. My lord, I'll put a bandage on my eyes 
 and wait upon you*" 
 
 " Your lordship, I presume, has been too much ac- 
 customed to the beams of beauty to be dazzled by its 
 brightness. I therefore conceive the precaution you 
 propose unnecessary, unless when it is required by the 
 great susceptibility of the lady, or the jealous irritabi- 
 lity of the husband." 
 
 The man of intrigue was inclined to laugh at the 
 proud confidence this speech manifested, but recollect- 
 ing that conciliation was his cue, he answered, that 
 waving those reasons still the bandage would be neces- 
 sary, as it would prevent him from seeing his own in- 
 feriority, " which," said he, " is the only inconveni- 
 ence people can suffer in the company of the earl of 
 Avondel." 
 
 The commissioners now entering prevented further 
 conversation. " 'Tis a pity," thought the president, as 
 he walked to the chair, " this young man should not 
 allow himself leisure to be consistent and persevering. 
 Certainly he is a very agreeable companion."

 " AGAIN" in the penitentials, Emily," said the earl 
 to his j'oung countess on his return to Berkley-square. 
 " Come, relieve yourself by confession, and receive 
 absolution." 
 
 " I shall exhaust your patience by my foily," said 
 she ; " nay 'tis not mere folly, I have been quite cul- 
 pable." 
 
 " Only in your own estimation. I shall indeed be 
 surprized if I discover anv criminal err ;rs." 
 
 " I know not by what other name to call my thought- 
 lessness." 
 
 "■Suppose we call it thinking too much, only not in 
 the right place ?" 
 
 " Well, i will admit your liberal definition. I thought 
 so much of Lord Norbury's magnanimity to you that 
 this morning, hearing him spoken of in a comtemptu- 
 ous. manner, I vindicated him with all my power, and 
 even asserted that the bill which has gained so much 
 eclat was rather his measure than yours, though he 
 endeavoured to give you the entire credit. I saw 
 Lady Caustic bridle, and the Duch j ss of Stingwell 
 said, "very candid indeed," with such a significant 
 smile, that I knew I was wrong. The moment they 
 were gone, my :xcellent friend Lady Glenvorne told 
 me, that Norbury is a notorious libertine, one who 
 boasts of his vices. O, my Led, I shall sink with 
 contusion ; I have been vindicating a man ot infa- 
 mous character." 
 . "Well, Emily?"

 " To think what suspicions I have excited, I have 
 committed myself to the most dangerous set in Lon- 
 don." 
 
 " The story is but half completed, I must furnish 
 the catastrophe ; for, like a most accommodating good 
 man, I have invited this dangerous gallant to dinner. 
 Will not these dragons ol virtue forget your indiscre- 
 tion in my imprudent negligence ?" 
 
 "Surely," replied Emily, turning still paler, and 
 trembling with horror, " you have not commenced an 
 acquaintance with Lord Norburv ?" 
 
 " Indeed, I have, but not upon your account. We 
 meet too often to be neutrals, the question is, shall we 
 be enemies or friends ?" 
 
 " I can never feel at ease in the company of a man 
 of his character. I know he will misconstrue all my 
 words and looks, and I detest a vicious person too 
 much even to assume towards him, civility." 
 
 "It is painful," said Lord Avondel, "to correct 
 such an ingenuous temper, yet, my Emily, I .must tell 
 you, common civility is- a tribute which all who have 
 not personally offended you may demand. Neither 
 will an outrageous vindication of your sex's wrongs be 
 half so mortifving to a bold r-.nd boasifai iibertine, as 
 the calm indifference, the unimpassioned ease, of 
 conscious virtue, too confident of its own strength to 
 provoke hostility, and too insensible of the boastful at- 
 tractions of a coxcomb to feed his vanity by treating 
 him as a dangerous being. As for Lord Norbury, he 
 dares not meditate your dishonour. Let him not sus- 
 spect that you are so indelicate as to believe he thinks 
 you vulnerable." 
 
 Emily gratefully assured her husband that he was 
 born to be her counsellor, her friend, and her protector. 
 
 The earl answered, " I need not tell you that your 
 reputation is dearer to me than my life. Bat though 
 the laws of honour require our sex to be the avengers 
 of your wrongs, I have ever thought women the best 
 guardians of their own honour, and I have always

 imost admired that discretion which rather avoids diffi- 
 culties than vanquishes presumption. " He comes too 
 near who comes to be denied," is an invaluable adage. 
 I have seen viragos in delicacy fall an easy prey, but 
 I never yet knew a woman ensnared whose chastity, as 
 well as her manners, was ' not obvious, not obtrusive, 
 but retired.' " 
 
 Lord Avondel sighed as he uttered these remarks. 
 He recollected the incident which first led him to ob- 
 serve those superior graces of mind and mien that had 
 so firmly engraved the charms of Selina Delamore on 
 his heart. He saw her at a masquerade exposed to 
 those freedoms which the licence of the place seemed 
 to justify, buc which her extreme beauty and unpro- 
 tected dependent situation rendered peculiarly offen- 
 sive. His sword was ready to start from its scabbard 
 to avenge any insult she might endure, but with quie£ 
 dignity she repelled insolence, and awed the most li- 
 centious, even without the intervention of his inter- 
 dicting frown. He" remembered, too, that never from 
 that hour did she expose herself to be again offended 
 by him who had so far thrown off the gentleman as to 
 suppose a beautiful and noble child of poverty might 
 be insulted with impunity. A formal courtesy, a cold 
 monosyllable, or a distant smile, was all that even an 
 acknowledgement of his fault could obtain. " In such 
 a situation," thought Lord Avondel, "Emily's tears 
 and terrors would have drawn me into a dispute. The 
 business would have got wind, and the delicacy of fe- 
 male fame always suffers by discussion. Emily would 
 have exposed hserelf, risked her lover's life, and con- 
 firmed the coxcomb in h.s impertinence by giving him 
 notoriety. Selina Delamore, — but why do I talk of 
 Selina Delamore i she has renounced me and bidden 
 me think of the amiable affectionate creature who lives 
 but for me." 
 
 Lord Norbury was determined to mnke his debut 
 in stvle, and accordingly appeared in Berklev-square 
 dressed for conquest. He resolved that his person, 
 manner, and conversation, should compel Emily to

 regret her precipitate and eccentric choice. He did 
 not come attired like our present Adonises, in a jock- 
 ey's livery, a coachman's iong coat, or /he round frock 
 and Belcher handkerchief, of .. pugilist. Nor did he 
 talk oi exercises which violate law and outrage hu- 
 maniiy, or introduce the language and behaviour of 
 the stable to the festal board oi an hereditary legit. a- 
 tor of the British empire. Neither did he ruth u,to 
 the room during the removal of the first course, 
 thrust his chair between two women of fashion, give 
 a holt bow to the lady hostess, violate the ceconon., of 
 the table, make the cook swear and the butler per- 
 spire, while the more civil part oi the company won- 
 dered at his voracious appetite, and the perfect non- 
 chalance with which he vowed he was notorious for 
 being an hour beyond his time, and had won a wager 
 bv never being known to see fish except at his own ta- 
 ble. 
 
 Doubtless, as a " divine fellow," Norbury would 
 have done all this, had coarse freedom at that period 
 been voted tonish, and guests not being required to oe 
 well-bred and to wea* the exterior of gentlemen. 
 Lord Norbury, therefore, had to exhibit his gra( ,1 
 boM s in the drawing room; he was expected to h . d 
 Lady Avondel to her seat, to assist her in perform g 
 the honours of hospitality, to appear delighted ■ ith 
 the entertainment, and to be respectful to the giver 
 and the guests. This last rule could never b< viol ited 
 with impunity, unless when some humble retainer or 
 starved genius, was permitted to wield his knive and 
 fork m silence, and being overlooked by my lord and 
 my lad)', was allowably neglected by the company. 
 Such lorlorn beings never displayed their piteous i es 
 at Lord Avondel's b nquets. I do not mean to say 
 thev were interdict! d, bm when admitted beneath his 
 truly hospitable roof, they appeared in such a style 
 that the most accurate observer oJ high life could not

 solicitude to pay their commons with acquiescence and 
 flattery. 
 
 Behold, then, the gay and gallant Norbury reflect- 
 ing splendor from the rich silver embroidery on his 
 waist-coat, and, like a blooming orange tree, diffusing 
 fragrance with every motion of his well-powdered 
 head ! Hear him criticise fiddlers and opera dancers, 
 delineate the sons and daughters of Thespis, explain 
 the initials in the scandalous magazine, and detail the 
 particulars of the last crash at the Savoir vivre ; above 
 all, hear him satirize Lady Overdone's city rout, and 
 cut up Mrs. Phantom's pines at her gala supper, a 
 privilege denied to her guests. " Wax, upon my re- 
 putation," said he, " exhibited in a tall Epargne be- 
 yond the reach of the king of Brobdingnag. Besides, 
 there were some dozens of fossil peaches, an immense 
 quantity of potted saw dust, painted entrements, and 
 a stupendous plateau furnished from her daughter's 
 baby-house. To complete the farce, there was a 
 starved poet whetting our hunger by reciting an ode 
 descriptive of a plentiful repast, and Dr. Dry bones 
 moving our spleen by enlarging on the physical ad- 
 vantages of abstinence over a goblet of Seltzer water. 
 The rascal was bribed, for Phantom started from the 
 supper table, hoped we were all sufficiently refreshed, 
 and marched us back to the ball room shivering and 
 exhausted like the famished family of Ugolina, or 
 Holbein's dance of death." 
 
 " O horrid," exclaimed an expectant young beautv, 
 who had long thought Norbury a divine title. " But 
 do tell us more about the Overdones . ? " 
 
 " O, there I was crammed and stuffed to suffoca-

 " Dreadful," again ejaculated Miss Blandish. " My 
 dear Lady Avondel, did you ever hear any thing so 
 monstrously shocking." 
 
 " I beg pardon," said Emily, turning round at this 
 appeal, " I really have been talking with Mr. Classic. 
 I fear I have lost something important. Would it be 
 very unreasonable to ask Lord Norbury to repeat his 
 remarks ?" 
 
 " She tops her part," thought Lord Avondel. 
 " That was spoken in the very spirit of Selina." By 
 way of encouraging the crest-fallen Norbury, he ask- 
 ed his assistance to detail what passed in the house on 
 the third reading of his bill, immediately after the op- 
 position made a motion of adjournment. 
 
 " Don't," exclaimed Lord Norbury, '* impose two 
 Herculean labours upon me at once. The ladies have 
 just required me to repeat all I have said to entertain 
 them while I fancied they did me the honour of at- 
 tending to me." 
 
 " We have been more just to your merits at this 
 end of the table, my lord," said Avondel, " forneither 
 of us has w T anted one of Gulliver's flappers while your 
 lordship's legislative talents were discussed." 
 
 " O, you wicked man," said Miss Blandish ; " I 
 declare, Lord Avondel, you quite deserve scolding; 
 you have deserted us, and now you want to nif.ke Nor- 
 bury as wise and as formidable as yourself. I do so 
 hate politics." 
 
 " Be merciful, dear Miss Blandish, I merely wished 
 to display all Lord Norbury's excellencies, that you 
 might not suppose he had taken refuge among you be- 
 cause he was banished from us. You now see he has 
 it in his power to make an honourable retreat to those 
 who will always think him worthy their attention." 
 
 " I mean," said Norbury, " to apply to you, Lord 
 Avondel, for as you reign alike in politics and wit you 
 can tell me which is the pleasantest soil to live in."

 A glowing smile lighted up the countenance of Emi- 
 ly, while, lifting the glass to her rosy lips, she bowed 
 to Lord Norbury, and with bewitching sweetness wish- 
 ed he might be happy and honoured in both. 
 
 " So," thought the gay Lothario of the day, " what 
 with the husband's politeness, and the wife's impene- 
 trability, I shall be metamorphosed into a good quiet 
 creature, and I presume shall be invited to stand god- 
 father, be admitted to enliven a conjugal tete-a-tete, as 
 a safe witness of my lord's hypochondriacs, or my la- 
 dy's head-aches ! Pretty piece of apathy ! Can nothing 
 light up thy frigid features but the unction of flattery 
 poured on the head of thine own good man? Pie, wor- 
 thy soul, finds the balsamic oil supple his stiff joints 
 most delightfully. Every man has his price, and, 
 thank my stars, Avondel, I have discovered yours." 
 
 The next time Lord Norbury saw the countess was 
 at the theatre. He opened the box-door, and asked if 
 she would admit him to join her party ? " Certainly," 
 said Emily, rising with grave civility: " Lady Glen- 
 vorne, will you have the goodness to admit Lord Nor- 
 bury between us ?" 
 
 " The princess of decorum and her duenna," said 
 Norbury to himself, as he stepped over the benches. 
 " I must stand a little ridicule for this. Hah ! Jack 
 Outline, with his crayons, in the pit ! Success to thy 
 labours, high-priest of slander ; my visage and the fair 
 countess's caricatured, but sufficiently like to throw a 
 jest on the originals is all the triumph I desire, to pu- 
 nish the presumptuous security of Avondel." 
 
 " Peace to this blessed retreat," said Norburv to 
 Emily, " how inestimable are the charms of mild re- 
 serve, and complacent delicacy. I have been hunted 
 round the house by various bevies of loud talkers and 
 invincible gigglers. Your ladyship can scarcely sup- 
 pose the misery and persecution from which I have 
 fled." 
 
 The countess quietly answered, ;t Indeed ! we have 
 been very happy."

 " And Avondel not here ! Surely it rarely happens 
 that you are very happy in his absence !" 
 
 " My Lord," returned Emily, who always had 
 somewhat of grandeur in her look and manner when 
 she spoke of her husband, " expected your assistance 
 this evening in the debate. His whole heart is in the 
 measure which is coming on, and he fears he shall 
 need the support of all his friends." 
 
 " Numbers, madam, will flock to his standard ; but 
 I have determined to shew my friendship for the noble 
 Avondel by protecting that attractive loveliness, which 
 the severe impositions of public duties compel him to 
 hazard abroad without a guardian." 
 
 " I must not," returned Emily, " allow myself to 
 be considered as an impediment to my lord's important 
 designs. We are in no want of a protector, are we 
 Lady Gienvorne ?" 
 
 " I cannot," replied Norbury, " submit this ques- 
 tion to a female judge, however respectable. My lady 
 marchioness cannot have penetrated into the secrets of 
 libertinism, nor can she judge what nefarious designs 
 t! e unprincipled will entertain, to which, unhappily, 
 the licence oi the age gives an alarming sanction." 
 
 " Come, Lord Norbury," returned Lady Gien- 
 vorne, " we must not allow you to turn king's evi- 
 dence, or if you will criminate your fraternity, we 
 must take you before a magistrate, and have your de- 
 position made out in form, and published for the be- 
 nefit of all tender-hearted fair ones. You will unsay 
 all you confess to us without this precaution." 
 
 The voung nobleman, who fancied he had adopted 
 the precise expressions which would have won the 
 good opinion of such strict ladies, felt so repulsed by 
 this sarcasm, that he could only suppress an imprecation 
 against old women, and assure Lady Gienvorne that 
 the world had formed a most erroneous judgment of 
 his real character.

 neation of character elucidated by a constellation of 
 dramatic talent, happily adapted to its respective parts. 
 As in those days mere bustle and practical jokes were 
 not admitted as substitutes for incident and wit, actors 
 were not influenced by the perverted ambition of sa- 
 crificing nature and their author to stage trick and 
 grimace. Emily, herself a child of nature, entered 
 into the representation with such fixed attention, that 
 she almost forgot she was sitting in public with one of 
 the most dissipated men of the age at her elbow ; and 
 Norbury was forced, in his own language, to do pen- 
 ance, by poring over the volume of antiquitv to avoid 
 the mortification of addressing his conversation to the 
 flaxen locks which fell redundantly over the shoulders 
 of the countess, while her averted face was turned to 
 the stage. Piqued by her disregard, he at length ask- 
 ed her. if the gW~ ~' Q;. Eeter had so rivetted her 
 attention i 
 
 " Surely," said she, with an ingenuous air, " there 
 is much respectability in his character." 
 
 " And yet," returned Norbury, in a soft despond- 
 ing accent, " when we contemplate the youth, the 
 beauty, and the sprightly ease, of his blooming con- 
 sort, must we not say, what a sacrifice ?" 
 
 " I admit," said Lady Glenvorne, " youth is the 
 quality which men most admire in our sex, and in 
 compliment to your taste we are successively content 
 to slide into the character of the time past at an early 
 period, and to lie upon the shelf like a last year's 
 Ephemeris ; but do not so much undervalue your own 
 superior sex as to suppose your durable virtues fade 
 like our roses. The oak, you know, is perfected by 
 centuries, but a few years destroys the beauty of the 
 woodbine which twines around it." 
 
 U Your ladyship," answered Norbury, " deserves 
 to be panegyrized by every club of odd fellows in the 
 kingdom ; but for us unhappy Ganymedes, whom you 
 deprive of what we thought our exclusive right, the 
 young and the fair, on the principle of congeniality, 
 we have only to wait till time has proved our virtues

 " Are the times become so rigid," inquired the mar- 
 chioness, " that you men of wit and gallantry can find 
 no expedient but becoming despairing bachelors, or 
 husbands of old maids ? What, does your lordship 
 think of commencing cicisbeo, on the Italian plan, and 
 persuading young wives that there is nothing obligato- 
 ry in a vow given to an odd fellow ?" 
 
 " I should think," said Lord Norbury, " that it was 
 the most hopeless of all undertakings ;" his eyes met 
 Emily at that instant, and with the airy confidence of 
 a fashionable effrontery, he asked her to correct him 
 if he was mistaken.

 that sentimental drone ?" 
 
 " No," said Emily, « for the plot does not turn 
 upon the character of Joseph Surface, but on Lady 
 leazles, whom he describes as credulous, volatile, 
 and dissipated, but not positively infamous. I grant 
 her situation is very critical. She is not onlv voun Rt 
 beautiful, and exposed to adulation, but she seems 
 virtuous rather from habit than reflection ; and, till 
 towards the conlusion of the play, she wants that in-

 u But may not this rich treasure of love be wasted 
 by an unthrifty possessor ?" inquired Norbury. — 
 " Suppose the husband turns morose, suspicious, un- 
 kind, alters his behaviour, renounces his good quali- 
 ties — is the lover's case then so desperate, or is the 
 lady very culpable if she seeks consolation in a sym- 
 pathising friend ?" 
 
 " This case," said Emily, " is very hypothetical 
 
 An entire change of character, a dereliction of prin- 
 ciple) a renunciation of habitual virtues, are surely 
 very rare. As for venial errors, or transient wayward- 
 ness, true affection will either not perceive such faults, 
 or they will seem as spots in the sun. Or, perhaps, 
 love may exert its magic, and convert defects into 
 excellencies. At all events, a fond and faithful wife 
 will never ask for pity at her husband's expense, nor 
 solicit advice which may make him wretched and con- 
 temptible. I grant Lady Teazle does this, but though 
 not abandoned, she is very far from correct. Hers 
 was a match of convenience ; the unweighed engage- 
 ment of a flippant girl, tired of restraint, and panting 
 for expensive pleasures. In this point of view, her 
 visit to Joseph Surface, and her complaints of ill 
 usage, argue no greater guilt than petulence and indis- 
 cretion ; and I admire the moral art of the poet in 
 reclaiming her, by making her an undesigned witness 
 of her hus'> .nd ; s generous affection and integrity.— 
 Honour and gratitude are thus made active principles, 
 instead of love ; and indeed, Lord Norbury, I should 
 look with horror on a lady Teazle in real life, who, 
 after she had thus been roused to a sense of duty, 
 aftervvards listened to the blandishments of a lover, 
 though every possible attraction were combined in his 
 character. 
 
 Lord Norbury was silent. The malicious marchi- 
 oness i-xpr^ssecl her fear that he was quite weary of 
 such a moral performance. He started, endeavoured 
 to recollect himself, srowed he had never passed two 
 hours more peasantry ; that he was edified and im- 
 proved, and had learnt more than from ten volumes of

 divinity. He then intreated Lady Avondel to allow 
 him to escort her to Berkley-square, that he might 
 enjoy the protracted advantage of her verv just cri- 
 tique. Without waiting for her reply, Lady Glen- 
 vorne answered, that the countess was engaged to be 
 her guest that evening. 
 
 " Had I power to command you," said Emily, " I 
 would conjure you to hasten and support my lord. — 
 He has been of late entirely engrossed with business, 
 and was extremely fatigued when he went to the house, 
 expecting a long debate. You may assist him, at least 
 you will be in time for the division." 
 
 " What reward am I to expect from obedience ?" 
 inquired the young lord, as he conducted the ladies to 
 th'eir carriage. The marchioness bowed with ironical 
 gravity, and answered, " a second dissertion on Lady 
 Teazle." 
 
 " Malicious crone," muttered Norbury, as he drew 
 back among the link-boys ; " 'tis misery enough to be 
 the fool of ■ a young woman, but to be the jest of an 
 old one is worse than the tortures of Mezentius." 
 
 The lively marchioness now told her young friend, 
 that she presumed their adventure that evening had 
 given pain to many hearts ; and on Emily's inquiring 
 for what reason, she protested she would punish her 
 indifference by claiming the conquest of the dear Ado- 
 nis herself. " Are you unconscious," said she, " that 
 you fixed the gay and fascinating Norbury the whole 
 evening?" 
 
 " 'Twas accident," returned the countess, " or, 
 perhaps, respect to my Lord. His presumption 
 never could be so blind as to suppose, even if I 
 were the basest of women, that he could ever rival 
 the Earl of Avondel. O heavens, what a falling off 
 would there be, setting honour and conscience aside. 
 This man of wit is very frivolous, dear Lady Glen* 
 vorne. He and my lord are beings of a very different 
 order." 
 
 " Most undoubtedly they are ; yet, for one woman 
 who has sufficient elevation of mind to value the sted-

 fast regard of a man of sense and honour, hundreds 
 sigh for the whisper of a coxcomb, who conceives he 
 distinguishes them by a momentary attention ; and this 
 induces me to repeat my observation, that you will 
 excite much envious observation by your flirtation this 
 evening." 
 
 " Flirtation ! Lady Glenvorne, you alarm me. Yet, 
 now I recollect, I was too familiar. I rested my fan 
 on his shoulder in the heat of my argument ; I talked 
 also much too freely. He had the audacity to press 
 my hand as he led me out. The known licence of 
 his character will take advantage of my inconsidera- 
 tion." 
 
 <c Dear susceptible Emily," said Lady Glenvorne, 
 " your behaviour this evening was as it always has 
 been when I have witnessed it, exactly what delicacy 
 and prudence would dictate. I only wish to prepare 
 you for what the purest virtue and most guarded dis- 
 cretion cannot escape, the censures of ignorance, and 
 the calumnies of malice." 
 
 " I must escape them," returned the countess, " or 
 be undone. The wife of Lord Avondel must equally 
 avoid reproach and guilt." 
 
 " I know," rejoined die worthy marchioness, " whose 
 sentiment you repeat, but her history will rather con- 
 firm my opinion. None have lived more free from 
 fault — few have suffered so much from slander. So 
 prevalent, indeed, was the prejudice against her, that 
 when, with a view to your advantage, she formed a 
 design of again appearing in- London, I recommended 
 her to abandon her intention. I found it impossible, 
 either by my own protection, or that of my Lord 
 Glenvorne's illustrious and irreproachable connections, 
 to procure for my innocent and injured friend such a 
 decided countenance as would reconcile a woman of 
 her discernment and sensibility to society; and I am 
 fully persuaded, that as she owes her present peac:. of 
 mind to the calm enjovnienu a life oi tranquil solitude 
 affords, so even the conviction of her own rectitude 
 would not have preserved her from anguish amid

 the irritations of contempt and the sneers of detrac- 
 tion." 
 
 Emily now told Lady Glenvorne, that, though she knew 
 her to be the faithful friend of her aunt, she had ever 
 feared to lead to that subject, lest she might be betrayed 
 by her feelings, to solicit from her an explanation 
 that could not be given without a breach of confi- 
 dence. 
 
 '* We are regular correspondents," answered she, "yet 
 I know nothing beyond what you are informed of. I 
 once pressed for a full disclosure, but my request af- 
 fected her to agony, and she intreated me to spare her. 
 On your arrival in London she conjured me to regard 
 you as my adopted daughter.. You know I wished to 
 have had an actual right to that title, I have lamented 
 the impediment, but I never condemned your choice. 
 Glenvorne has forgotten you sufficiently for his own 
 peace, but not to devote his heart to another. I now 
 view you as the representative of my early friend, en- 
 deared still more by your own noble frankness and en- 
 gaging simplicity. And this double capacity of heredi- 
 tary friendship and personal affection justifies me, I 
 trust, for the liberty I have taken in interrupting Lord 
 Norbury's designs this evening." 
 
 Emily was all gratitude. Unreserved confidence 
 succeeded; and the marchioness communicated her 
 conviction, that Norbury meditated a hostile attack, if 
 not on the virtue, at least on the reputation of Lady 
 Avondel. She then advised her not to inform her 
 lord of his audacity, nor yet to behave with such a 
 pointed avoidance as might be construed i.ito affected 
 prudery, that worn-out mask of hypocritical vice. 
 She endeavoured to convince her young friend, that 
 she might trust to the purity of her own heart, and 
 the guileless simplicity of her artless manners, till, 
 wearied by her coldness, his evanescent attention flew 
 to some other object ; and she promised her presence 
 in any emergency, her counsel in all difficulties, and a 
 firm defence of her conduct against those invidious 
 reflections which, she warned her, seldom spared con- 
 spicuous desert and eminent station.

 Emily now began to accuse the capricious world 
 which deemed Lady Selina Delamore, endued as she 
 was with every noble and endearing virtue, unfit to 
 enter its precincts, while it clasped in its meretricious 
 embrace such a character as Lord Norbury ; who, 
 like the pestilential winds of the desert, sought reputa- 
 tion by his power of destroying. The marchioness 
 confessed the truth of this accusation, and observed, 
 that people were generally most inimical to extraordi- 
 nary desert, and glossed over the failings of those 
 common characters, who, by courting the favour of 
 others, flattered vanity at the same time that they con- 
 fessed themselves destitute of any real claim to esteem. 
 u Fortune too," said she, " often acts as an impenetra- 
 ble veil to many rank offences, and our sex is always 
 more severely dealt with ; I mean not only by the con- 
 tempt which most men feel for women, but by the 
 harshness with which we also treat the lapses of an of- 
 fending sister. Thus she who is only suspected of 
 having sinned against decorum is either entirely shun- 
 ned, coldly received, or faintly vindicated ; while the 
 male libertine, who takes upon himself the office of 
 rumour, and even boasts of more crimes than he has 
 committed, is caressed and courted by the generality, 
 and scarcely discountenanced by the serious. Some 
 justify, none abjure him. Yet, how much soever I 
 may lament this severity to women, as far as respects 
 individuals, and however I insist that our characters 
 should never be sacrificed to any thing short of positive 
 proof of guilt, I dare not wish for a repeal of that 
 law which sentences the frail female to obscurity. 
 May every comfort penitence can enjoy attend her there, 
 but in h<_r mixing again with the world I see danger 
 to the innocent, not consolation to herself. If ever 
 the chastity and decorum for which English women 
 have long been celebrated, are exchanged for the light 
 behaviour and loose morals of many of our continen- 
 tal neighbours, the alteration will be introduced by a 
 sort of false candour, recommending lenity to offen- 
 ders: and the eloped wife, the frail spinster, and the

 well-bred courtezan, will glide along the walks of fa- 
 shion with the same smiling ease and self-possession as 
 those with which the libertine and debauchee now in- 
 trude their emaciated figures and polluted minds into 
 our domestic retreats ; while the vigilant husband, or 
 anxious father, dares not say, 
 
 " Satan avaunt ! for other guests are here 
 Then thy compatriots : Modesty and Truth 
 Bring to this shrine their offerings unprophan'd." 
 
 Lady Avondel sighed on reflecting, that the se- 
 verest duties were required from the gentlest natures. 
 " Is it," thought she, " so very probable, that virtue 
 should not entirely escape calumny ? and are the stains 
 of slander often so indelible as to compel virtue to 
 shun observation and seek shelter in the penitentiary 
 abodes of vice, — virtue too, adorned by unrivalled 
 loveliness and superior talent ? But, alas ! these only 
 excited envy, and it was unprotected virtue that was 
 thus persecuted. My dearest aunt, some unrepealed 
 misery denied thee the shelter of those generous 
 arms which would have shielded thee from the hell- 
 hounds of malice, and made him join in thy condemna- 
 tion whose powerful voice would else have silenced 
 opprobrium. How different is my blessed lot !" 
 
 She now recollected Lord Norbury's observation, 
 that characters often change, and men renounce the 
 principles on which they have once acted. She be- 
 lieved this possible when there was either instability 
 of disposition, or an unsound judgment. The con- 
 firmed virtues of her lord were regular and stable as 
 the revolutions of the ccelestial luminaries ; and in or- 
 der to insure her happiness she had only to supplicate 
 the continuance of his life, and that she might be pre- 
 served from those errors which would forfeit his es- 
 teem, or bend his lofty crest to ignominy.

 Wia was man so eminently rais'd 
 Amid the vast creation ; why oi'dain'd 
 Through life and death to dart his piercing' eye, 
 With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame ; 
 But that th' Omnipotent might send him forth

 LADY Avondel entered her own mansion breathing 
 a humble prayer to be preserved from folly and disho- 
 nour. She found her lord returned moody and pen- 
 sive. Something of state business had clouded his 
 temper. The bill he had that night introduced had 
 undergone so severe an examination, that he owed his 
 victory rather to the power of numbers than the 
 strength of argument. He scorned a triumph thus 
 acquired; and, what was more painful, he was con- 
 vinced, by the close scrutiny to which it had been sub- 
 mitted, that instead of proving, as he intended it, a 
 vigorous assistant to government, and at the same time 
 a useful regulation to the subject, his favourite mea- 
 sure might, in the hands of an ambitious man, be ren- 
 dered an engine of tyranny, or peculation. He had 
 therefore to choose, whether he should press a regula- 
 tion which his conscience now told him might be con- 
 verted into an instrument of fraud and oppression, or 
 incur the censure of vacillating conduct. Besides this, 
 his own immediate partizans were wedded to the mea- 
 sure, and though he now saw enough of its tendency 
 to discover that their partiality to it arose from inte-

 rested views, he could not desert them without excit- 
 ing their animosity, and exposing the helm of state to 
 all the inconvenience incident to distracted counsels, 
 and jarring factions. The hill was, too, so avowedly 
 of his own forming, that his reputation seemed to be 
 staked upon its being passed. Lord Norbury, in a 
 short speech, interwoven with many personal compli- 
 ments to the earl, had declared his assent, though he 
 had not deeply studied its various bearings, placing 
 implicit confidence in the wisdom of his noble col- 
 league, of whose patriotism and laborious research for 
 his country's good, he said, this might be considered as 
 the first-fruits. 
 
 Lord Avondel thought Norbury went too far in this 
 speech, but he made allowances for zeal and admiration 
 acting upon inexperience. He had given him undivid- 
 ed praise, but he had also subjected hin- to invidious 
 responsibility. 'Twas inconsiderate, it was unwise, 
 nay, some would call it unfriendly ; for the preceding 
 bill, which had added so much to Norhnry's political 
 renown, was in truth no other than a misshapen bant- 
 ling, that Avondel took up after it had been abandoned 
 by its heedless parent, and which, alter he had cherish- 
 ed, cultivated, swaddled it into shape, and nurtured it 
 to perfection, he restored to its author ; who, instead 
 of recognizing his offspring, hardly recollected i:s ex- 
 istence. But as he had disdained to claim the right 
 of sharing in Lord Norbury's praises, he thought the 
 same principle of equity ought to have made the latter 
 willing to participate in the censures to which he was 
 now exposed ; especially as the objectionable clauses 
 respecting patronage had been suggested by Lor.d 
 Norbury, and unwarily adopted by the earl. But 
 much must be allowed to youthful zeal; his friend had 
 arrived late in the debate, and probably d"<I not know- 
 that he was confirming his discredit, instead of ad- 
 vancing his renown. In fine, to confess a secret not 
 very honourable to human nature, though the profes- 
 sion of a puffer is discreditable, it is as necessary an 
 appendage to greatness as a maitre d'hotel, or valet de

 chambre. The versatile talents of Norbury, his total 
 want of steady principles, his readiness at repartee, the 
 glibness of his oratory, and*the neatness with which he 
 could interweave a compliment to those he wished to 
 please with a sarcasm on their opponents, had rendered 
 him so skilful in mixing the charmed cup, that Lord 
 Avondel was quite intoxicated ; and though he found 
 his eulogist useless at the council board, and an impe- 
 diment rather than an assistant in the senate, still he 
 thought him friendly, and that in time he would" be 
 really wovthv. Though indolent from bad habits, and 
 blundering from ofRciousness, still there was no going 
 on without Norbury. I am convinced, none but my 
 uninformed readers will start at my uniting the pro- 
 perties and dispositions of a flatterer and an enemy in 
 the same person. Besides that all parasites are really 
 enemies, adulation is often a most convenient instru- 
 ment to practise self-commanding malice ; for it acts as 
 a telescope, and discovers all the blemishes and spots 
 of the object whose grandeur and splendour it pro- 
 fesses to magnify. Governed by pride and self-love, we 
 fortify our hearts against honest reproof, who comes 
 like a blunt ally to tell us where we are vulnerable ; 
 but we admit the sycophant praise into the fortress, 
 who generally approaches as a spy to see the weakness 
 of the garrison, to discover what are our ruling pas- 
 sions, and whether violence, perseverance, or strata- 
 gem, be most likely to subdue us to that state of un- 
 conscious captivity in which superior minds often 
 repose contentedly, enslaved by low cunning, or trea- 
 cherous rapacity. 
 
 Tossed in a whirl of thought, Lord Avondel ex- 
 pected the return of Emily with that sort of querulous 
 impatience which prompts us, when tortured by some 
 vexation, to look forward to an event from which no 
 real relief can arise, and vet, to the delay of which we 
 attribute part of our mortification. Lord Norbury had 
 told him, that he met the countess at the play, and that 
 she drove off to Lady Gienvorne's evening party. He- 
 did not repeat her comment on Lady Teazle, her in-

 junction that he would hasten to support her lord, nop 
 intimate that the evening party was merely an instruc- 
 tive tete-a-tete betwt en the two ladies. Two o'clock 
 eamc, and Emily not returned. Where was the Mar- 
 quis ? He had given his proxy at the House of Peers ; 
 did he think the debate on such an important business 
 less worthy his attention than his mother's rout ? He 
 had loved Emily — Away suspicion. Gienvorne was a 
 man of honour ; and even Don Diego would have 
 tossed away his padlock had Leonora, with the simpli- 
 city, possessed the modest innocence of Emily's look 
 and manner. Her faults were of another kind. She 
 had so little confidence in her own judgment, and so 
 much timidity in her, disposition, that she was not a 
 suitable associate to a man, who, in his public career, 
 had too many difficulties to contend with, and too many 
 perplexities to engross his thoughts, to admit of his 
 attending to those frivolous minutiae on which his wife 
 was always wanting advice, while he wished her to 
 have courage to counsel, and sagacity to assist him. 
 Selina possessed those qualities. In his present diffi- 
 culties, how invaluable would be such a ft lend as Se- 
 lina ? How would her enlightened and dispassionate 
 understanding, elevated above the narrow views of 
 party, elucidate his judgment, and confirm his resolves? 
 Would she not teach him, that the voice of honour, 
 and the security of his country from any fresh inunda- 
 tion of corruption, were pre-eminent motives, and that 
 the mind which sacrificed these to a cowardly fear of 
 temporary disgrace, or petty clamour, could not belong 
 to the Avondel she had loved ? At this instant the 
 tender Emily appeared, and by her solicitude for his 
 success, and anxiety for his health, rather increased 
 than relieved his irritability. He felt it impossible to 
 answer her inquiries without paining her sensibility. 
 He could not be amused by her conversation, nor 
 soothed by her affectionate smiles. He could only 
 plead fatigue to conceal ill humour. After a perturbed 
 night, lie rose determined to act as Selina would have 
 taught him ; to renounce success, to hazard reputation,

 and to own his error, even though by so doing he lost 
 his friends. By thus submitting to be corrected by his 
 opponents, and refusing to sacrifice conscience to expe- 
 dience, he resolved to give the greatest proof of cou- 
 rageous patriotism and untainted honour. 
 
 Lady Avondel had the common fault of young af- 
 fectionate wives — she never saw her lord's brow over- 
 cast but she fancied herself instrumental in raising the 
 moody vapour. She every day more strongly felt her 
 unfitness for the public station in which she was called 
 to move, and she looked forward to the temporary con- 
 finement she expected, not as a period of mortification 
 and restraint, but as a delightful state of freedom, dur- 
 ing the continuance of which she should not be re- 
 quired to sacrifice her own pursuits and inclinations, 
 and at the same time endure the continual conscious- 
 ness that she was offending caprice, and gratifying slan- 
 der, by a thousand undesigned oversights and petty 
 indiscretions. To escape Norbury's impertinent atten- 
 tions was another gratifying hope. She knew her lord's 
 veneration for the primary duties of social life, and 
 doubted not but that he would in future allow her to- 
 be all the mother, and to sacrifice parade and publicity 
 to the health and instruction of her offspring. She felt 
 no doubt of her capacity to discharge these duties with 
 steadiness and propriety, and she saw in them a full, 
 calm and satisfactory enjoyment, secluded from invi- 
 dious observation, and free from harassing restraints. 
 Even the cares of this new character she was convinc- 
 ed must be delights, because they would be accompa- 
 nied by the consciousness of well-doing. M My lord's 
 affections," said she, " will be bound to me by still 
 stronger ties, and I shall rise in his estimation while I 
 nourish the tender frame, and direct the intellectual 
 growth, of a young Avondel." 
 
 Before the period which was to realize these expec- 
 tations arrived, she contemplated with infinite satisfac- 
 tion a visit to Castle Mandeville, whither the earl had 
 proaiisul to accompany her immediately after the re- 
 cess- She also cherished a hope of being allowed to*

 spend a few days at Lime Grove ; but, though Lord 
 Avondel had not forbidden the expectation, Lady Se- 
 lina herself discountenanced it by a letter penned" in a 
 more than ordinary strain of cheerfulness, in which she 
 expressed herself free from every trouble, except the 
 rapid influx of wealth, which had lately increased to 
 that excess, that she had resolved to take an excursion 
 to rid herself of the inconvenient burden. She ex- 
 pressed a hope, that at some not distant period her per- 
 sonal intercourse with her beloved niece would be 
 renewed, and she concluded with requesting her to 
 keep her thoughts more fixed on the great blessings 
 that had fallen to her lot, than on the petty inconveni- 
 encies by which they were accompanied. " Thus," 
 said she, u you will always feel a powerful call upon 
 you to gratitude, fortitude, and equanimity of mind, — 
 whereas the temper which abandons itself to insignifi- 
 cant cares, cherishes a false sensibility. The new cha- 
 racter in which you will be called upon to act will prove 
 a trial to tenderness like yours. Guard yourself, my 
 Emily, against excessive cares. There is a bound fixed 
 to every virtue, and whenever we desire distinction for 
 any quality, there is great hazard of exceeding the 
 limits of right. The over-susceptible, while they sur- 
 render their own hearts to anguish, torment all their 
 connections ; but fortitude enables us to subdue petty 
 iroubles, and to be objects of comfort, rather than of 
 distress, to all around us." 
 
 This letter arrived at a time when Emily found her 
 spirits sinking under a variety of perplexities, arising 
 from the anxious agitation of her lord. He told her 
 little of the cause of his uneasiness, aware it would 
 alarm her apprehensive mind, and afford no rebel to 
 his own. Convinced that he should never satisfy him- 
 self bv merely conforming to those " fixed and settled 
 rules, that letter of the law which awes vulgar minds," 
 he resolved that the measure he had fostered should 
 not merely die a natural death by withdrawing his 
 support, but that he would candidly avow his change 
 of opinion as to its tendency, hold it up in terroreiru

 and thus, by opening the eves of the public, prevent 
 future ministers from shielding their invasions of the 
 constitution under his name. A clamour of triumph 
 rose from his political opponents, while his friends ex- 
 pressed their belief that Lord Avondel was too theo- 
 retical to make a good practical statesman. The noble- 
 man who acted as ostensible premier, whose younger 
 brother looked forward to the enjoyment of one of the 
 expected sinecures that were to be erected, declared 
 his honour would no longer permit him to go on in 
 concert with a man, who, from a want of firmness, de- 
 serted his friends, and betrayed at once their characters 
 and his own ; and a cabal was formed to displace the 
 person whose integrity was so inconveniently inflexible, 
 and whose principles of government seemed at once 
 obsolete and impracticable. 
 
 Lord Avondel saw the gathering storm, and deter- 
 mined to abide its fury. He knew it was impossible 
 to attach disgrace to his conduct. His hands were un- 
 stained by corruption. No sinister design shed its 
 mildew on his civic wreaths. By a timely resignation 
 he might so far mollify the malice of his enemies, as to 
 be able to steal back to retirement unquestioned and 
 uncensured. The mortifications he at present felt 
 might justify him for preferring the solid satisfaction 
 of self-enjoyment, to the visionary expectation of en- 
 lightening and blessing an ungrateful, refractorv world, 
 where the insulting shouts of detraction always sound 
 louder than the silver trumpet of renown. But volun- 
 tarily to desert the post where his sovereign's confidence 
 had placed him, while he knew he retained his favour; to 
 quit an important station before his secession could be 
 properly supplied ; to yield to clamour, and commit the 
 good ship to such pilots as were unequal to the helm, even 
 while aided by his counsels ; — Was this true honour ? 
 No : perish that petulance, that selfishness, that little- 
 ness of soul, which, in such circumstances, looks at any 
 thing but the common weal ! The scribblers of the day 
 would, indeed, abound in invective. They would sa- 
 tirise his insatiable thirst for power, call upon him to

 renounce his vain expectations of aggrandisement, and 
 retreat to that oblivion which best suited his confused 
 ideas of government, ere he was ignominiously driven 
 from his station by a concentration of force he could 
 not resist : — but posterity would do him justice, and 
 they who venerated a Walsingham, a Faulkland, and a 
 Clarendon, would honour the firm and upright Avon- 
 del. 
 
 Amid the vexation of threatened and actual resigna- 
 tions, one coadjutor stood firmly at his side, and this 
 was Lord Norbury. But as he could not be prevailed 
 upon to sacrifice his pleasures, so as to pay a steady 
 attention to business, his assistance did little towards 
 relieving the earl's fatigues. His name was, however, 
 something, and his party was useful in counting a ma- 
 jority. Norbury used his political importance to pro- 
 secute his designs, not on the person, but on the repu- 
 tation, of Emily. Her frigid indifference to all his 
 assiduities, her careless insensibility to his self-valued 
 graces, her steady attachment to her lord, evinced no 
 less in her general behaviour than in the glowing rap- 
 ture which lighted up her .face whenever his ac- 
 tions and merits were discussed, taught the reluctant 
 coxcomb to confess, that the virtue of one woman was 
 inaccessible, at least till some extraordinary revolution 
 shook her high-seated confidence. Yet, still he conti- 
 nued to haunt her in public as her shade, and regard- 
 less of her contempt, preserved an air of intimacy on 
 his part which might satisfy the censorious that Emi- 
 ly's reserve was the affected cover of criminal familia- 
 rity. Her features were too expressive of her real 
 sentiments, and too little subject to controul, to allow 
 her to conform strictly to Lady Glenvorne's advice, of 
 treating Norbury like any other indifferent person. His 
 society was disagreeable, his attentions to her were dis- 
 gusting. But her Lord continued to regard him as a 
 political friend, as she knew enough of his difficulties 
 to be convinced that the number of his adherents was 
 too small to admit of being diminished without serious 
 inconvenience. Besides, the Marchioness had conjured

 her to be prudent, and had pointed out the fatal effects 
 which often resulted from a wife's incautiously direct- 
 ing the resentment of her husband to the insulter of 
 her honour. She had therefore only to endure, and 
 count the days and hours till the close of the parlia- 
 mentary campaign would remove her from this scer.c 
 of persecution.

 Away ! no woman would descend so low. 
 
 A skipping-, dancing-, worthless tribe you are, 
 
 Fit only for yourselves : you herd together, 
 
 And when the circling- glass warms your vain hearts, 
 
 You talk of beauties that you never saw, 
 
 And fancy raptures that you never knew. 
 
 Eowe. 
 
 NORBURY's constant attendance on the Countess 
 of Avondtl excited general observation, and that invi- 
 dious defamer of female honour was well skilled in the 
 art of giving observation a scandalous direction. He 
 praised her beauty in the most rapturous terms, till it 
 was impossible for any one not to be convinced he felt 
 its power. He pleaded guilty to the charge of admir- 
 ing her, but knowing that in some circumstances a can- 
 did avowal of the real truth sets the imagination of the 
 invidious at work, he proclaimed himself the most 
 hopeless and desponding of all adorers. He then added, 
 that, though doomed to a life of despair, he was still 
 the moth hovering round the candle, attracted by the 
 brightness by which he was destroyed. A gay smile 
 and significrnt shrug accompanied this allusion to his 
 misery, and while candid people viewed him as a dan- 
 gerous trifler, the idle wished to discover the mystery, 
 and the censorious knew there must be something very 
 wrong in the affair. Many said it was high time for 
 the worthy husband to put on his spectacles, and others 
 observed it would be wiser in him to shut his eyes ra- 
 ther than endanger the loss of 12,000/.- a year. The 
 advantage of a pretty wife to a falling statesman was 
 discussed with great humour. Strangers pitied Miss 
 Blandish, but her friends affirmed that, as possession 
 always cured passion, if she were but patient, she had 
 still an excellent chance of becoming Lady Norbury,

 for Avondel was too poor and too avaricious to sue for 
 a divorce. If therefore the affair became public the 
 naughty creature would continue a countess. 
 
 While envy, malice, and credulity, were thus en- 
 livening the ennui of constant dissipation, and impart- 
 ing a zest to the vapid cup of satiating amusement by 
 inventing, analizing, circulating, and contradicting those 
 surmises and probable guesses, bv which the reputa- 
 tion of the wise and good are made the diversion of 
 worthless folly, the newspapers announced a rupture 
 between two noblemen in high official situations, and 
 that the resignation of the senior might be hourly ex- 
 pected. I shall not mislead my readers by stating the 
 narrative circulated bv Ladv Caddv, nor the inquisi- 
 torial proceedings at the duchess's coterie. For though 
 with wonderful memory, invention, and perspicuity, 
 each ladv knew her own story, and could tell in what 
 room, and at what hour, Lord Norbury was discover- 
 ed on his knees to the countess ; how many times she 
 fainted, what oaths the earl swore, and how he aiter- 
 wards refused the satisfaction of b ^ in 5 shot at, which 
 Norbury (very much like a gentleman) offered to give 
 him ; yet, as even at Danbury we art on a par in this 
 respect with the most adroit titled gossip in the vici- 
 nity of Hyde Park, it is but placing Mr. and Mrs. for 
 my lord and mv lady, and we shall all remember that 
 we have heard similar stories fabricated on similar oc- 
 casions. In such a variety of rumours, I feel mvself 
 obliged to call upon the prescient muse, who, as she is 
 now said to be a very matter of fact personage, having 
 resigned her talent of invention and exaggeration to 
 the daughters of slander, will I trust in future be ap- 
 plied to as evidence in a court of justice, and thus, if 
 banished from the Lyceum, may take shelter in law re- 
 ports. 
 
 Be it known then, that though Lord Avondel was 
 so far blkld«d bv his love of adulation, and Norbuvy'a 
 adroitness in preparing the grateful potion, as to form 
 a favourable opinion of that young nobleman, he neither 
 allowed himself to be misle'd by his impetuosity nor to

 overlook his foibles. His attachment to his wife rather 
 resembled the protecting care of a kind prudent father, 
 than that equalizing affection which results from simi- 
 litude of years and dispositions, and which perhaps 
 never arises in the breast of a man unless it springs 
 from choice rather than gratitude. He sincerely wish- 
 ed to make her happy, but this was more from a con- 
 viction that his honour required it, than from that 
 acute sensibility of tenderness which revolts from the 
 idea of paining those we love. While he admitted 
 that her attachment to him was a tie upon his honour, 
 he fancied he saw in it a peculiarity of taste and cha- 
 racter which was unaccountable, unless explained by 
 the strength of juvenile prepossession ; and he always 
 fancied he owed his wife to his having visited Castle 
 Mandeville before she knew London, for had she been 
 first solicited by more attractive lovers she never would 
 have surrendered " her blooming charms to his harsher 
 uncomplying years." This conviction was not sullied by 
 jealousy. He had a firm confidence in Emily's truth and 
 love, and he only « ished her to be as well satisfied with 
 herself as he was with her intentional rectitude. But he 
 perceived in her mind that innate weakness which would 
 be a source of mutual trouble. In public his behaviour 
 to her might be quoted as an example of correct atten- 
 tion. He spoke of her with confidence and regard, 
 and ever felt anxious that his gentle consort should 
 enjoy and reflect the lustre of his coronet. Yet his 
 fear that this tender plant should either be shaken by 
 the rebuffs of others, or corroded by the canker shroud- 
 ed in its own bosom, made his eye often dwell upon 
 her with a solicitude that alarmed her timidity, and 
 made some think him a prey to doubts which his 
 heart was too noble and his mind too enlightened to 
 entertain. He never thought the ingenuous child of 
 nature would really disgrace him, and he only wished 
 to preserve her from the oppression of her own fears. 
 As he knew she never merited insult, he could not be- 
 lieve that either in her character of his wile, or from

 her own unoffending sweetness she would be exposed 
 to impertinence or derision. 
 
 Engrossed as his mind now was with the desire of 
 acquitting himself to his country as a true patriot, he 
 could not but perceive Emily's extreme dislike to Nor- 
 bury. He knew she was naturally candid, and as he 
 was persuaded he had convinced her there was an in- 
 delicacy in a woman's too readily suspecting a man of 
 designs on her person, he began to fear she had been 
 alarmed and offended by some approaches which were 
 too direct to be overlooked ; and, important as his 
 hours were, he determined to sacrifice a few to obtain 
 conviction by attending a masquerade to which he had 
 persuaded his countess to subscribe. He knew Lord 
 Norbury intended to be there, and to embellish his 
 gay figure with the blaze of a splendid costume. 
 Avondel retired to his cabinet at his usual hour, and 
 the reluctant Emily, in the unstudied attire of a flow- 
 er girl, joined her party. When the earl thought the 
 motley groupe were assembled, and so fully occupied 
 that he might mix unobserved in the crowd, he involved 
 his majestic form and speaking features in a mask and 
 domino, and, declining attendants, walked to the Pan- 
 theon. There he not only saw Lord Norbury pursue 
 Emily (who was walking with her friends unmasked 
 and agitated) with that sort of decided assiduitv which 
 is painful to true delicacy, but he heard him, ou 
 joining a riotous set of his gay associates, speak of her 
 with rapturous enthusiasm, indecorous from familiari- 
 ty, and warm even to licentiousness. Should a cox- 
 comb, presuming on his political importance, behave 
 with audacity, or speak with levity, to the wife of the 
 earl of Avondel ? The indignant husband pulled off 
 his vizor, bowed significantly to Norbury, and, join- 
 ing his consort, changed her terrified dejected look to 
 the most joyous delight, by thus unexpectedly appear- 
 ing as her protector. Supported by the arm of her re- 
 vered lord, and encouraged by his approving smiles, 
 she instantly rallied her depressed spirits, maintained 
 the playful simplicity of her character, and not only

 enjoyed the evening herself and communicated delight 
 to others, but excited in her husband's mind such a 
 high idea of her prudence and ingenuousness as recall- 
 ed to his recollection the indelible idea of Selina in one 
 of the most admired parts of her character. 
 
 Lord Norbury's conviction, that he was absolutely 
 necessary to the earl, confirmed his assurance to that 
 height that he appeared the next day in Berkley-square 
 with his wonted air of familiarity. He found his host 
 towering to the summit of awful dignity, and though 
 Emily was less constrained, her ease seemed more the 
 result of happiness than amenity. He proposed to re- 
 new his visit next day. Lord Avondel pleaded a pre- 
 engagement with such marked coldness, that Ncrbury 
 was fired with indignation, and said, whatever satis- 
 faction he had derived from the unlimited hospitality 
 he had been permitted to claim, he could sacrifice his 
 own pleasure when it was incompatible with the earl's 
 repose. But, he added, that since his political friend- 
 ships were always connected with his personal attach- 
 ments, he must be pardoned if in future he supported 
 ministry no further than his honour permitted. 
 
 Avondel unruffled by this threat, calmly said, " My 
 lord, I have never required other support; and if your 
 conscience permits you to change your creed with eve- 
 ry start of wayward inclination, I have it not in my 
 power to suggest motives for stedfastness more power- 
 ful than the conviction that what you trifle with 
 are the safety of your king and the prosperity of your 
 countrv. But I must correct the insinuation that your 
 visits disturb my repose. It is Lady Avondel whom 
 you have offended. My confidence in her principles 
 and affection for me cannot for a moment be shaken. 
 Yet I should ill requite her tenderness did I not in- 
 terfere to relieve her from the misery she suffers from 
 your very unguarded admiration." 
 
 Lord Norbury lightly answered, that in future he 
 would as carefully avoid exciting Lady Avondel's 
 fears as he would the touch of a torpedo, and observed 
 that those very scrupulous ladies who took husbands a

 little mellowed by time should set up a Medusa's head 
 over Hymen's temple, to warn the young fellows of 
 the age that it was consecrated ground, " The count- 
 ess," added he, " is too pretty for a scarecrow. Take 
 my word for it, when I am gone you will have other 
 visitors." 
 
 Avondel rung the bell, ordered his carriage, and 
 rested his arm upon the table in dignified silence. 
 
 " In return for your favours," said Norbury, ad- 
 vancing to the door, " I can only observe I wear a 
 sword. I leave you my lord to appoint the time and 
 place for my using it." 
 
 " And I," answered the earl, " live in a country 
 which enjoins me to keep mine in the scabbard, except 
 when I draw it in her sacred quarrels. Rash young 
 man, would you heal insult by committing murder." 
 My sword has been too much accustomed to the field of 
 battle to start from its sheath at an unlicenced sum- 
 mons." 
 
 " ' f is well," replied Lord Norbury, almost choaked 
 with rage ; M age his a privilege." 
 
 " And youth an apology, which a true friend will 
 respect. My lord, I still have that confidence in your 
 good sense to expect, that, when you have pondered 
 calmly on this interview, we may at some future pe- 
 riod of our lives be friends." 
 
 u It were more advisable," returned Norburv, piqued 
 to madness by the calm superioritv of Avondel, M for 
 you to consider how our present rupture can be explain- 
 ed without impugning your understanding, or subject- 
 ing your lady's extreme delicacy to reproach by throw- 
 ing the blame on her. The contingence your lord- 
 ship alludes to is highly improbable." 
 
 " The story, Lord Norburv, is in your hand, my 
 part is silence. Yet be careful of your own reputa- 
 tion when vou stake it against mine or Lady Avan- 
 del's." 
 
 Norbury flung out of the house, and vowed ven- 
 geance. His first step was to resign his office, his 
 second to despatch a circular note to his party avowing

 his intention of opposing the measures of the earl of 
 Avondel. He next debated upon the expediency of 
 Maying in London, and answering all inquiries into 
 the cause of this breach of friendship with a signifi- 
 cant laugh, or a mysterious request that he might not 
 be urged upon a point which honour forbade him to 
 divulge ; but there was a sternness in his rival's com- 
 posure, raid a majesty in his defiance, which alarmed 
 him, and self- conviction whispered, that though envy 
 or credulity might interpret his insinuations to the dis- 
 grace of the Avondels, the judicious and considerate 
 part of the world would consider him as an unprinci- 
 pled coxcomb who attempted to bespatter the virtue 
 lie could not corrupt, and to undermine the happiness 
 he had failed to destroy. He therefore wisely deter- 
 mined to leave London in sullen silence, and he trust-* 
 < d to his parliamentary dependants to perform the un- 
 finished work of malice by making Lord Avondel ieel 
 those pangs as a statesman which he had warded off 
 as a husband. 
 
 But a few days elapsed before the countess, missing 
 their constant guest, asked her lord what was become 
 of Norburv ? " Are you concerned at his absence ?" 
 inquired the earl, smiling. " No, delighted," was 
 her reply. u I only wish to know the reason :" 
 
 " He is forming," answered Avondel, " the design 
 of supplanting me, and rising upon my ruin." 
 
 " My lord," said Emily, pale and trembling, " you 
 dreadfully alarm me. I hope I am not the cause of 
 Lord Norbury's enmity." 
 
 " Certainly not," returned the earl, " unless you 
 have fired his ambition to become the leader of a party 
 powerful enough to make and unmake ministers." — 
 The countess perceived by her husband's manner that 
 he wished to prevent her from alluding to a subject 
 which his honour must compel him to notice. She 
 recollected Lady Glenvorne's advice at the same mo- 
 ment, and prudently answered, that she was inexpe- 
 rienced and often foolishly fastidious, which might 
 help to account for the insuperable dislike she had

 taken to Norbury. ".But how," said she, " is he to 
 rise upon jour ruin ?" 
 
 " We are changed," replied Avondel, " from firm 
 adherents to political opponents. He thinks himself 
 better able to guide the state than I am." 
 
 44 Absurd," answered the countess, while the co- 
 lour rushed into her faded cheeks, " may you, my 
 lord, never meet with a more formidable opponent." 
 
 14 We must not," said the earl, " fall into the com- 
 mon error of depreciating the power of our enemies. 
 I have reason to know Norbury's opposition will be so 
 formidable that I must now ask you seriously, is your 
 attachment proof to a change in my fortunes ? Can 
 vou endure seeing me less an object of public atten- 
 tion and celebrity ? Can you relinquish your own 
 importance, submit to have your routs less crowded, 
 your beauty less admired, your patronage less courted ? 
 Tell me, my Emily, has vanity any share in your 
 affection ? or, to put it in better terms, have you so 
 little of your sex's love of glory in your disposition 
 that a degraded statesman may still hold his full pre- 
 eminence in your heart r" 
 
 44 O, my dearest lord," said the countess, clasping 
 her hands, while her dovelike eyes swam in tears of 
 rapture, " I fear I shall offend you, or I would say, 
 are you certain this blessed dismissal will take place i 
 Shall I see you relieved from anxiety and fatigue, and 
 shall I enjoy the two greatest blessings this world af- 
 fords, a life of tranquillity and your society ?" 
 
 44 How truly feminine is her character," thought 
 Lord Avondel. " She has all the weakness and all the 
 virtues which characterize the sex. 'Tis impossible 
 not to praise her gentleness, but I must lament that 
 her confined views never extend beyond the pale of 
 domestic life. She loves her country, she wishes welt 
 to all the human race ; her fond idolatory connects 
 the security of the commonwealth with my re- 
 taining the helm of government ; vet, because the ser- 
 vice of the public is attended with cares and privation?,

 present fame, and future glory, are all incapable of 
 poising the scale against her preponderating desire of 
 fully enjoying the present hour. She is not the mother 
 of the Gracchi, exhorting her sons to die for liberty. 
 No, she is the tender Andromache, hanging on the 
 arm of Hector, while beleagured Troy trembled at 
 the shock of assailing Greece, and detaining him from 
 battle who was to save herself from captivity and her 
 infant from death." His lordship then sunk into a 
 reverie, pondering on the marked inferiority of the 
 female character, and with much self complacence, 
 and little foresight, condemning those who submitted 
 to its influence, while with a degree of refinement, 
 bordering on fastidiousness, he lamented that his con- 
 sort's intense love wanted discrimination to appreciate 
 the worth it adored. 
 
 Harassed by faction, deserted by ingratitude, and 
 goaded by malice, Lord Avondel continued to smug- 
 gle with the difficulties of the station he found it im- 
 possible to retain, till the recess of parliament afforded 
 leisure to make fresh arrangements. He then directed 
 his sovereign's choice to an able successor, and resign- 
 ed the insignia of office. Avondel felt it his duty to 
 retire, because the opposition had been rather personal 
 than political ; but with generous integrity he refused 
 every emolument, and promised his independent sup- 
 port to the measures which were proposed to be pur- 
 sued with a frankness that spoke his generous patriot- 
 ism. He then accompanied his happy Emily on her 
 summer excursion to Mandeville Castle, and partook 
 of the joyous hospitality of Sir Walter. The baronet 
 was almost frantic with rapture at receiving his revered 
 friend in the character of husband to his niece, in 
 witnessing his generous behaviour to his lovely timid 
 spouse, and in anticipating the prospect of an heir 
 which was to engraft the family and fortunes of the 
 Mandevilles on one of the noblest stocks in Britain, 
 whether considered as to its past honours or the illus- 
 trious qualities of its present head. During the few 
 weeks that he was blessed with their society, he deter-

 mined the whole neighbourhood should be as mad as 
 himself; and Emily still found her desired tranquillity 
 and the uninterrupted enjoyment of her lord's conver- 
 sation deferred to a future period. 
 
 Lord Avondel returned to London early in the win- 
 ter to receive the honoured name of father, and to sup- 
 port his terrified consort through a trial for which the 
 timidity of her mind and the delicacy of her frame 
 rendered her peculiarly unfit. Her grateful sense of 
 her lord's generous attentions to her, still increased 
 her affection, and a son, a young Sydney, rewarded 
 her sufferings. But the lovely label partook of the 
 fragility of its mother, and seemed to require an ex- 
 traordinary degree of care and watchfulness. Emily, 
 still " a faded rose," entered upon her new character 
 with a solicitude natural to a mind which suffered it- 
 self to be engrossed by one duty. Though never more 
 fondly and faithfully a wife, her anxiety to rear the 
 tender plant which Providence had committed to her 
 care, made her often forget what was due to the in- 
 clination and temper of her husband, and that in de- 
 voting herself so exclusively to the occupations of a 
 nurse she deprived him of his companion, and con- 
 verted into a solitude that noble mansion which ought 
 to reflect the splendour of hospitality and the magni- 
 ficence of patronage and benevolence. 
 
 Independently of the natural feelings of a father, 
 Lord Avondel welcomed the heir of his honours with 
 the exultation of a man who possessed the strongest 
 attachment to hereditary rank, and piqued himself on 
 supporting the dignity of a long line of ancestors. But 
 the limited events of the nursery could not engross 
 his mighty mind. After having been present at one 
 debate on the superior qualities of biscuit pap, he 
 thought the bill which enacted its use might pass by 
 an exertion of regal authority without dignifying the 
 opposition of nurses by allowing further discussion. 
 The wit and beauty of the charming infant, though 
 far superior to what two months ever before ripened

 in the human frame, would engage him for a quarter 
 of an hour, but seemed not sufficient to occupy a mind 
 which knew the interests and policy of every Euro- 
 pean court, and meditated on the means of rescuing 
 his country from the machinations of foreign enemies, 
 and the turbulence of domestic factions. Though in 
 reality " glorious in his fall," the world considered 
 him to be a disappointed man, and notwithstanding he 
 founded the rule of right on the dictates of his own con- 
 science rather than on universal opinion, still renown 
 was necessary to his repose, and the principles on which 
 he acted had not power to stifle what he termed " im- 
 mortal longings for high-sounding fame." He was 
 particularly restless under the pressure of undeserved 
 opprobrium, and yet neglect was worse, it was a living 
 death. Norbury had injured, insulted, and deserted, 
 him. He panted for what he called noble revenge. 
 This was the power of convincing Norbury of his 
 errors, reclaiming, and forgiving him. 
 
 While he ruminated on these schemes of public be- 
 nefit and private gratification, he often wished Lady 
 Avondel would not interrupt his musings with the 
 weak indulgence of her maternal cares. But though 
 he sometimes convinced her, that she was yielding to 
 her natural infirmity of being so anxious to discharge 
 her duty that her terrors counteracted her ability, she 
 had an ally in Mrs. Caudle against whose volubility 
 and officiousness argument was ineffectual. The busy 
 widow had persuaded herself it was her duty to pay 
 daily visits to Berkley-square to instruct the inexperi- 
 enced young matron in the sure method of rearing the 
 important bantling. She regularly brought with her a 
 new raised host of apprehensions, and consigned the 
 precious charge she so doated on to some fresh disor- 
 der, the symptoms of which exactly tallied with some 
 of the infantine calamities that had afflicted one of her 
 seventeen children. In proportion as the little Caudle 
 had suffered, or was relieved, so the tender Emily 
 hoped and feared, till at her next visit, the sybil

 changed the measles into the hooping cough, or remov- 
 ed all apprehensions of rickets by discovering prognos- 
 tics of the hydrocephalus. The infirm state of Lady 
 Avondel's health rendered her more pardonable fou 
 becoming a prey to these terrors, but the earl felt ap- 
 prehensive that he should soon find himself an insu- 
 lated being, and his house a hermit's cell without its 
 quietness. Sometimes a sleepless night prevented 
 Emily from appearing at dinner. At others the ex- 
 pected party was put off because Mrs. Caudle per- 
 ceived the young lord was in a most dangerous state : 
 and Lord Avondel was more than once compelled to 
 renounce an appointment that he might attend a con- 
 sultation of physicians and know if there was any 
 hope of his son's surviving such a complication of dis- 
 orders as Mrs. Caudle had imported that morning. 
 
 Thus, with the most eligible prospects, an unusual 
 assemblage of valuable qualities, and without the in- 
 tervention of any external calamity, Lord and Lady 
 Avondel, like all the rest of the sons and daughters 
 of Adam, continued in the vain pursuit of that phan- 
 tom, perfect happiness. The former often recollected 
 that the sensibility of Sdina had never degenerated 
 into nervous susceptibility. His unsubdued regret at 
 losing her continued to impress on that unattainable 
 object the fallacious stamp of perfect excellence, and 
 the bright vision of felicity which his fancy inseparably 
 connected with the possession of his first love, cast a 
 deeper shade on the foibles of his consort. Could 
 Lord Avondel have been persuaded, that the fair herit- 
 age which he actually enjoved really overpaid his de- 
 serts, those blessings would not only have proved more 
 permanent, but he would have found their immediate 
 value increased by a humble sense of his own demerits, 
 and a grateful enjoyment of the liberal bounty of Pro- 
 vidence. But inordinate self-esteem, though founded 
 upon the most noble properties, indisposes the heart to 
 enjoy the happiness for which it repines. Humility 
 ever possesses a sort of sabbatical rest, when combined

 with. that devout resignation which alone can render it 
 real. Even the miser and the debauchee have their 
 occasional festivals, when the purse is well crammed, 
 or the wine laughs in the goblet, but the man who mis- 
 takes pride for sensibility never enjoys sunshine. His 
 imagination peoples the world with indignities, he is 
 ever fighting against fancied insults, he sees disrespect 
 in a bow, and discovers sarcasm in a compliment: And 
 when by his fastidiousness he has created the enmity 
 he suspects, he fortifies his mind against the opprobri- 
 um of the better part of his species by drawing round 
 him an assemblage of the worst. The proud man's 
 career generally ends in his being the dupe of syco- 
 phants. His talents and virtues, deprived of the lus- 
 tre they would receive from collision, become incrusted 
 with misanthropic rust, till he sinks into the prey of the 
 cabal he has created, and is the ridicule of the world 
 he was born to serve and adorn. 
 
 Lady Avondel, on the other hand, from the total 
 want of self-confidence, knew herself to be for .ever 
 falling short of the perfection to which she aspired ; and 
 not properly considering the general imbecility of our 
 nature, she was too much depressed by those infirmi- 
 ties which she ought to have resisted, and implored 
 divine assistance to subdue. Her fond idolatry of her 
 lord made her deem his splendid qualities absolute 
 perfection, and contemplating him as the unerring 
 standard of right, she continually deplored his sup- 
 posed degradation at being yoked to such an unequal 
 partner, whose faults and failings formed an insupera- 
 ble bar to his possessing that full happiness his deserts 
 merited. Thus, even diffidence may lead us into error 
 unless it is enlightened by that celestial splendour that 
 beams from the page of revelation, which teaches us 
 that being weak in ourselves we must implore the in- 
 vincible support of a never-failing friend. The infir- 
 mities of our nature may be supernaturallv supplied 
 with impenetrable armour, which shall confirm our 
 trembling knees and nerve our powerless arm. Thus,

 whether we look at our virtues or our failings, we are 
 in clanger of offending, unless we consider the former to 
 be so mixed with error as to require forgiveness, and 
 the latter as capable of being subdued by piety and 
 fortitude. We are not blind when we submit to the 
 will of Omniscience, nor are we weak when we depend 
 for support on an Almighty arm.

 Y OU must prepare," said Lord Avondel to his 
 countess, in one of those lare intervals ot repose du-

 " for the arrival of a friend from India. The fair Flo- 
 rentine Lady Paulina Monthenner, is expected in the 
 next fleet, but we shall not see the general for some 
 time." 
 
 " Is she to reside with us?" inquired Emily with a 
 look of apprehension. " Certainly not ; her establish- 
 ment must correspond with her ample fortune. Are 
 you alarmed at being introduced to a woman who 
 unites all the attractive qualities of your sex to many 
 of the talents and virtues of ours ?" " I only fear, ray 
 lord, I shall not be able to devott- so much of my time

 regard for her rt^quire. My dtar-jst babe wanis so

 treme anxiety, believing it in part the efFect of indispo- 
 sition ; but I now feel myself called upon to remind 
 you that you have other duties to fulfil than those of a 
 mother, nor will you satisfy my claims and expecta- 
 tions if you renounce them." 
 
 " I know," said Emily, " I have tried your forbear- 
 ance ; tell me what I ought to do and you shall never 
 complain of my neglecting your wishes ?" 
 
 " My first desire is, that you should allow yourself 
 to be happy ; my next, that you would provide a 
 house and a suitable establishment for Lady Pau- 
 lina." 
 
 " And consider her as my particular friend ?" said 
 the countess with an inquiring smile. 
 
 " Her manners," answered the earl, " are foreign, 
 and her opinions singular. I hope you will like her 
 sufficiently to admit her to an intimacy, but that shall 
 depend on your future choice and not upon a previous 
 arrangement." 
 
 Emily blessed her lord's goodness, lamented her own 
 unworthiness, and immediately began the desired pre- 
 parations with a hope that her little Sydney would not 
 suffer by having her attention directed to another ob- 
 ject. 
 
 I am not going to plead in favour of maternal neg- 
 ligence, but rather to check the extreme solicitude 
 which young and tender mothers are apt to indulge, 
 when I insinuate, that as the diseases of the child 
 chiefly existed in the fancy of the anxious parent, and 
 as medical cookery was peculiarly prejudical to his 
 tender frame, he sensibly grew stronger whenever La- 
 dy Avondel was roused from the exclusive contempla- 
 tion of his infirmities. But the absence of Mrs. Cau- 
 dle seemed to complete his cure.- Among the hang- 
 ers-on in great families, we generally meet with a per- 
 son who assumes much mock consequence from con- 
 forming to the reigning whi-m of the principal, whose 
 foible they labour to increase from a conviction that 
 their own importance depends upon it. The worthy 
 dowager was of this description. She was ever at

 Kmlly's elbow, aggravating her nervous terrors, and 
 clamorous in protesting her attachmest to the loveliest 
 infant her eyes ever beheld. Fortunately, however, to 
 save the life of the child, and the peace of the mother, 
 a \oung duchess, who stood at the very pinnacle of fa- 
 shion, produced an heir, and as Mrs. Caudle's friend- 
 ship and services were regulated by the exact rules of 
 precedence, she forgot to order her carriage to Berkley- 
 square every morning, to the infinite joy of Lord Avon- 
 del. 
 
 Emily had but just time to complete her preparations 
 for the Italian lady before her arrival was announced 
 by the word *' Paulina," pencilled at the bottom of a 
 slight sketch representing Octavia meeting Augustus 
 after her separation from Antony. Lord Avondel, to 
 whom this token was directed, observed, " 'Tis still the 
 same woman, Emily, you must expect to meet an ori- 
 ginal character." 
 
 " An enviable and estimable one, my lord, since she 
 possesses your approbation." 
 
 " I shall not allow your opinion to be prejudiced by 
 mine, I only repeat that she is one who must not be 
 measured by common rules. I will call on her imme- 
 diately, and prepare her to expect you." 
 
 "^ Will not you introduce me ?" 
 
 " I will not lay any restraint on your interview. See 
 her, judge for\ourself, and tell me your sentiments. I 
 have very important business to attend this evening-." 
 Emily's inquiring eyes asked of what nature? but he 
 refused to understand their language. He knew it 
 would only agonize her to hear that Lord Norbury 
 threatened to move a vote of censure on his conduct 
 when in administration. 
 
 The countess meditated on her visit to Paulina till it 
 appeared as treaiencious as entering the blue chamber 
 of Aboraeleque. She wondered of what description 
 her. singularities were, playful, lofty, intimidating, or 
 whimsical r *' Would to heaven," said she, as she at- 
 tired her delicate frame in the chaste simplicity of ma- 
 tronly decorum, " Would to heaven I had been

 baby on the green before my cottage ! I have an in- 
 conceivable dread of this stranger, but my lord re- 
 quires my acquiescence, and all he does is wise and 
 just." 
 
 Emily arrived at Paulina's mansion with a beating 
 heart. A crowd of black servants in the oriental cos- 
 tume, and footmen in gorgeous liveries, filled the vesti- 
 bule. " Surely," said she, " I shall see an Eastern 
 princess. How will n-y dress appear amid all this mag- 
 nificence ? Yet, let me support myself; I am the wife 
 of a man who needs no adventitious decorations to an- 
 nounce his innate greatness." 
 
 The Lady Paulina, who reposed on cushions at the 
 upper end of the inner apartment, rose on hearing her 
 guest announced ;• and as she advanced along the suit 
 of rooms to receive her, bereft Emily of every senti- 
 ment but admiration at the finest figure and most grace- 
 ful manner she h?d ever witnessed. Her form was ra- 
 ther displayed than concealed by the adhesive manu- 
 facture of Thibet, tastefully disposed in negligent 
 drapery. Her hair redimdant, black, and gloss)-, ra- 
 ther undulating in loose curls than crisped, was parted 
 on her forehead, and prevented from obscuring the 
 starry brilliancy of her eyes by a row of magnificent 
 pearls. Her arms, which were naked to the shoulder 
 were adorned with armlets of the same costly simplici- 
 ty, and a similar chain hung on her bosom, to which 
 was suspended a portrait half concealed in the fold.-; of 
 her garment. A hoy about four years old tripptd at 
 her side, whose light attire seemed borrowed from an 
 antique representation of Cupid, whom he appeared to 
 resemble in mischievous archness. Though enchanted 
 with the beauty of the mother and son, iheir dress, or 
 rather undress, so little accorded with Emily's deco- 
 rous ideas, that she fancied she had summoned them 
 from an unfinished toilet, and apologized for her in- 
 trusion. " Can Lady Avondel intrude on the much 
 honoured Paulina?" said the Italian, in a voice whose 
 musical tone seemed to realize the imagined sweetness

 " O discard this undue humility, and even when you 
 stand by the side of an empress say with proud supe- 
 riorit)-, my husband is the first of men. My child, 
 my Sydney, tell the noble English lady why you love 
 the hero whose name you bear." 
 
 " Because," said the child, with theatrical emotion, 
 " He saved mamma and baby from the tyger." 
 
 " True," continued Paulina, turning pale as she 
 spoke, while her eyes flashed with sparkling animation, 
 " 1 reposed in my veranda, it was near a jungle ; the 
 slaves had forgotten to secure the wicket. The moon 
 shone through a lofty magnolia ; I heard a rustling 
 sound — 'Tis the sea breeze, said I, waving the citrons. 
 I raised my head to enjoy their fragrance and the sa- 
 vage beast rushed upon me. See (pointing to a deep 
 scar on her lovely arm) the mark of his claws. The 
 anticipated horror of annihilation congealed me. I 
 neither shrieked nor moved, but gazed in petrified si- 
 lence on those glaring eyes and tusks ready to be im- 
 bued in my blood, when an arm, skilful, swift, and 
 vigorous, reached over my pallet, and plunged a fau- 
 chon down his extended throat." 
 
 " It was my Avondel !" said Emily, interrupting 
 the enthusiastic speaker with equal emotion. 
 
 " Yes, happy lady, it was thy Avondel," resumed 
 Paulina ; " who possesses such courage, such promp- 
 titude, as thy noble lord ? my slaves fled aghast with 
 terror. The danger of his wife and son were in- 
 sufficient to rouse Monihermer from the torpor of sur- 
 prize. It was thy Avondel who rescued us from a 
 living tomb, and covered us with the blood which 
 would have been infuriated with ours. The sun never 
 rises on the day on which I do not join with this dar- 
 ling boy to call down blessings on our preserver." 
 
 Emily*s rapture almost overpov/ered her tender 
 frame. She clasped Sydney Monthermer to her breast^ 
 and after a burst of tears faintly observed, her lord 
 had never told her of this incident.

 ostrich he leaves the offspring of his virtues careless 
 if they perish unknown, but they are cherished by 
 gratitude, and called to a glorious existence." 
 
 " Mv devoted heart," answered the gentle Emily, 
 it is all his own, but I want your eloquence to express 
 niv affection. I feel my own inferiority, 5'et I daily 
 bless the tie that bound me to my noble husband." 
 
 " Thou dost, and thou hast cause," said Paulina. 
 Her bosom seemed to heave with stifled sighs, her 
 dov/ncast eyes swelled with tears. She led the count- 
 ess to the sopha, and taking her guitar from the table 
 threw her hands over the strings with a meditating as- 
 pect. Then raising her melodious voice she chaunted 
 the follov/ing canzonet, accompanying the words with 
 the soft music of her plaintive instrument.

 Emily attempted to express her admiration, but 
 overcome with ecstacy rested her face on Paulina's 
 shoulder, and held her clasped hand to her throbbing 
 heart. 
 
 " O worthy of thy happy lot," returned the en- 
 chanting improvvisatrice, " yet, not because thy fair 
 and spotless form, and the regular mildness of thy 
 features, express the chaste beauty of thy temperate 
 clime, but because thy heart is filled with the only 
 image worthy such a shrine. Continue thus to cling

 ric of looks, assent to my entreaties, that thou wouldst 
 regard me as a faithful friend. Behold in me a stran-

 except this boy, and, may I add, thy Avondel ?" 
 
 " O yes," answered Emily, who if Paulina at that 
 moment had asked for her life would have given it her. 
 "• Whoever loves my lord is most dear to me. He 
 shall be your protector as he is mine." 
 
 " Then you allow me to see him ? IMark, Lady 
 Avondel ; I am a frank enthusiast, and I open my 
 whole heart to you, yet am I a rigid observer of the 
 laws of decorum. He called on me this morning. I 
 asked if his Emilia's presence sanctioned this attention ? 
 I found you were not with him. ' Go,' said I, to my 
 secretary, ' and tell him, the English ladies must not 
 accuse the ardent Italian of inconsideration. I will 
 not look on what I most revere, till his lady hallows 
 the holv bond of Platonic love with her sanction.' "

 " Surely," returned the countess, " that precaution 
 was unnecessary. I perceive you have been alarmed 
 with dreadful stories of. the reserve and prudery of 
 English women, but I must hope to convince you that, 
 however habituated to our own manners, we can be 
 just to the merit of every other clime, though it ap- 
 pear in a garb different from what we have been ac- 
 customed to behold." 
 
 " May I then hope," said Paulina, " that when 
 Wonder has gazed on the phenomenon, and Envy cen- 
 sured her behaviour. Candour, assuming thy gentle 
 form, will say, ' O pity and forgive the stranger? — 
 Her feelings, cherished by fervid suns, disclaim re- 
 serve, and defy restraint. They burst like melted 
 snow from her native Apennines ; the sordid and the 
 timid see destruction in the overwhelming torrent, but 
 elevated minds exult to behold it sweep along the 
 plains, the future source of fertility, and even in its 
 violence exhibiting nature in her unconstrained gran- 
 deur.' " 
 
 Emily promised to personify candour as far as her 
 abilities permitted. She then entreated Lady Paulina 
 to employ her in any way that might supply her wants, 
 or fulfil her wishes. 
 
 " Wants," said the fair Italian, " I have none j and 
 your provident anticipating care would have satiated 
 a sensualist. I lived among the voluptuous scenes of 
 Asiatic luxury, despising wealth and loathing dissipa- 
 tion. You have permittfed me to see Avondel ; his 
 capacious mind is to me a world. This evening I 
 dedicate to repose ; perhaps, to-morrow you will have 
 the goodness to shew me some of the wonders of your 
 city, famous through the universe as the capital of the 
 country of men of mighty xxiinds." 
 
 Lady Avondel rose to retire ; Paulina folded her 
 in her arms. " We are friends," said she, " by na- 
 ture, sisters in affection, sisters in taste. Oui' hearts 
 are devoted to the same object." 
 
 " Most unquestionably," answered Emily, returning 
 the embrace w^ith equal tenderness^ but more delicacy^

 and then withdrew enchanted with her new friend's 
 person, manner, and admiration of her Avondel. Pau- 
 lina seemed to have given a tongue to her own feel- 
 ings, and she Uimented that she Avas not an improvvisa- 
 trice too, as she thought singing the praises of her lord 
 would be a most charming employment. It was not 
 till she had long re-considered all that had passed, that 
 she began to wonder why Paulina had said so little of 
 General Monthermer ? and to blame her own want of 
 politeness in not talking to the lady about her own 
 husband, when she had been so very diffuse an enco- 
 miast of hers. This was exactly like her usual care- 
 lessness and inconsideration. Start but the theme of 
 Avondel's excellencies, and th9 soul engrossing idea 
 banished every other. She determined to behave bet- 
 ter at their next meeting. 
 
 Her mind was so occupied with her new acquaint- 
 ance, that Lord Avondel found with pleasure his child's 
 complaints required little illustration, while Lady Pau- 
 lina proved an ever-fruitful subject. She gentl)' blamed 
 her Lord for not having more fully prepared her for 
 such an astonishing assemblage of talents and beauty. 
 She informed him that they had pledged an inviolable 
 friendship, and conjured him to comply with her re- 
 quest of speedily visiting Paulina, whose feeling heart 
 would be deeply wounded by the appearance of un- 
 kindness. 
 
 " And by the appearance of tenderness too," said 
 the earl, throwing down his eyes, and seeming to be 
 lost in recollection. " Yes," said the innocent Emily, 
 " her whole soul is full of tenderness, and no wonder 
 she is so enthusiastic in your praise. She related the 
 almost miraculous incident of your preserving her from 
 a rapacious tiger, and I must chide you for never tell- 
 ing me the extraordinary circumstance." 
 
 " Rather thank me for procuring you a higher treat 
 by my forbearance. My narrative would have been 
 plain and simple, hers has been adorned with oratory, 
 and I doubt not, embellished with poetical fiction."

 " Nay, my lord, now you are too severe upon Pau- 
 lina. The exaggerations of gratitude and esteem are 
 very different from the chimeras of fancy. When the 
 heart dictates to the tongue we only speak what we 
 believe to be real ; surely, therefore, the language of 
 the passions, even when they mislead us by their vio- 
 lence, should not be confounded with the studied orna- 
 ments of those who only endeavour to amuse us by a 
 Avell-wrought story. I am convinced Lady Paulina 
 speaks less from her head than her heart." 
 
 " Yours, my Emily, is the only female heart I wish 
 to study ; and I am thoroughly convinced of its inge- 
 nuousness and rectitude. My observations on Paulina 
 were pointed at her warm poetical imagination, which 
 gives her the very power of amusing you allude to. I 
 have no inducement to scrutinize her heart and affec- 
 tions, I trust they are devoted to Monthermer." 
 
 The countess pressed her husband's hand in admira- 
 tion of the delicacy of his reflection, and then asked 
 him if the General really deserved such a charming 
 wife? 
 
 *' He has one property, which, in the eyes of ladies, 
 is always of prime value. He is an exemplary, or I 
 should rather say, an uxorious, husband." 
 
 '■'- Then," said Emily, " they must be superlatively 
 happy." 
 
 " Indeed ! Give me your reason for that conclu- 
 sion ?" 
 
 " O, iny dearest lord, talents such as Paulina's must 
 make home a real bower of bliss. She will never de- 
 press her husband's spirits by her nervous irritability, 
 nor tire him with the sameness of herremaiks, and the 
 languor of her conversation. She knows how to in- 
 troduce a perpetual variety of delight, gay, tender, 
 instructive, amusing, or profound ; her capacious mind 
 furnishes every luxury a palled appetite can rt; quire. 
 Then her harmonious voice, her skill in niusic, her 
 taste for the fine arts ! Indeed, I never before envied 
 any oiie, but it must be highly gratifying to be able to

 render our home the retreat of taste, science, and lite- 
 rary enjoyment." 
 
 A pamful consciousness of her own inferiority de- 
 pressed the diffident Emily. Her lord was silent, lost 
 in a pensive reverie. " Ah," said she to to herself, 
 *' I was very unwise to draw a parallel between his lot 
 and the fortunate Montherraer's. The comparison is 
 so infinitely to my disadvantage, and good and indul- 
 gent as he is, I see my lord discovers it." 
 
 Lord Avondel was indeed employed in considering 
 the dissimilitude of the ladies, but the result of his re- 
 flection was not what Emily believed, and to prevent 
 my readers from drawing wrong inferences, I shall 
 devote a few pages to the early history of the fair Flo- 
 rentine.

 THE father of Lady Paulina Monthermer was one 
 of the first noblemen in Florence, and he was particu- 
 larly solicitous to make his palace agreeable to the Earl 
 of Avondel when he was ambassador at that court. 
 The conversaziones of the Marchese Cagliari, Pauli- 
 na's mother, were the most brilliant of any in that ci- 
 ty, and the talents and beauty of the young lady, who 
 soon distinguished herself as an improvvisatrice, ex- 
 cited the admiration and employed the pen of many of 
 the Delia Cruscan academicians ; but no praises were 
 so grateful to the inspired nymph as those of Lord 
 Avondel, though his commendations were bestowed 
 with a chariness which proved them to result rather 
 from taste than passion. His coldness and reserve did 
 not increase the restraint which prudence and delicacy 
 ought to have placed upon her affections. She was not 
 only accustomed to indulge her feelings, but to consi- 
 der such indulgence as a virtue. Believing that, as 
 her attachment was a proof that she could discern me- 
 rit, her avowing it would be demonstrable of her sin- 
 cerity, she apprized the earl of the preference she en- 
 tained, with so little caution, and reserve as disgusted 
 his nice ideas of female decorum, and would have de- 
 termined him to slight her advances had he even felt 
 the beginning of an attachment. But the fact was, 
 though he admired Paulina as a delightful companion, 
 he had not sufficiently forgotten Selina to justify his of-

 fei-'ing. his hand to another ; and he plainly discerned 
 that the temper of the Italian was too impetuous and 
 her passions too warm to allow of her being entrusted 
 with the custody of his peace and honour. He too 
 well knew what he owed to his country in his public 
 character, and to the hospitality of the INIarchese Ca- 
 gliari to think of engaging in an illicit amour with the 
 daughter of one of the first families in the nation he 
 came to conciliate ; and he therefore absented himself 
 from their palace. Paulina was too much in love, and 
 too precipitate, to be easily refused. She prevailed 
 upon her father to make a tender of her hand with an 
 almost princely dower ; and Avondel, driven from 
 every subterfuge, declined the overture by pleading a 
 pre-engagement. His recall at this juncture freed him 
 from further persecution, and Paulina, after alternate- 
 ly resolving to follow him to his own country, and van- 
 quish him by perseverance or throw herself into a con- 
 vent, finally settled in a resolution more conformable 
 to her character. She employed her dazzling talents 
 and enchanting beauty to allure lovers, and after she 
 had excited their hopes, she gratified her revenge by 
 abandoning them to despair, similar to that she en- 
 dured from what she called the cruelty of Avondel. 
 The notoriety of her proceedings at length destroyed 
 their effect ; but though few choose to expose them- 
 selves to ridicule and vexation by professing a passion 
 for the lady, her palace continued to be the resort of 
 the witty and the gay, for whom her independent for- 
 tune and elegant taste continued to prepare the most 
 luxurious and grateful entertainments. Foreigners, re- 
 spectably connected, were particularly welcome ; and 
 it was at one of her galas, while displaying all her gra- 
 ces, that she captivated General Monthenner, who was 
 passing through Florence. His frineds lamented his 
 predilection for the beautiful jilt, and advised him not 
 to engage in such a hopeless pursuit ; but the blunt sol- 
 dier would not anticipate a refusal, and he urged his 
 address with such powers of persuasion that, to the 
 astonishment of all Florence, he carried off the prize,

 at that time, by the death of her parents, uncontrouled 
 mistress of an ample fortune. The remainder of this 
 narrative will solve the mystery. In less than a month 
 from their first acquaintance the wedded pair embark- 
 ed at Leghorn to undertake the overland passage to In- 
 dia, as General Monthermer had left England to take 
 the command of the forces in the setdement of which 
 Lord Avondel had some time been governor. 
 
 The earl did not count the presence of his Floren- 
 tine inamorata among the felicities of his situation. 
 But Paulina was now the wife of a man of honour, 
 who adored her, and he resolved never to remind hep 
 of those youthful follies which he hoped she had re- 
 nounced. A superficial observer would indeed have 
 supposed that love was succeeded by the most deadly 
 hate. She affected not only to forget their former 
 friendship, but to treat him with every mark of con- 
 tempt which his official situation allowed her to shew : 
 and as she was the first female in the settlement, she 
 assumed a sort of vice-queenship, and kept a court 
 which seemed to be intended as a rallying point for the 
 disaffected. It was at this period that chance enabled 
 Lord Avondel to render her the important service 
 which she recounted to his wife, with tolerable fidelity. 
 From that moment Paulina threw off the mask, and 
 feeling gratitude and affection predominate over 
 revenge, she proclaimed her admiration and attach- 
 ment with such vehement sensibility as might have 
 roused the .jealousy of a less doating husband than 
 Monthermer, as it excited 'the garrulity of the gossips 
 
 at for the gossip is an animal which is capable 
 
 of existing in every latitude, and can extract nourish- 
 ment in every clime inhabited by man. 
 
 Avondel was not thoroughly convinced that Paulina 
 was capable of indulging her passion at the expense of 
 her virtue. But, however she might be disposed, he 
 had an implicit confidence in his own honour. He de- 
 termined that the blandishments of the syren should 
 never make hiin forget the brave soldier, who executed 
 his martial plans with courageous promptitude, and

 trusted to his continence and his wife's fidehty wiih 
 frank secui-ity. He was amused and flattered by the 
 court Paulina paid him, yet on cool consideration a re- 
 moval from her society was one of the agreeable cir- 
 cumstances that reconciled him to his return to England, 
 which soon after took place. 
 
 The recall of Monthermer from his command was 
 despatched before Lord Avondel had a seat in admi- 
 nistration, otherwise, on a private as well as a public 
 account, he would have opposed that measure ; and 
 he heard of Paulina's early arrival with the more re- 
 gret, as he knew nothing but a removal from London 
 would prevent a renewal of their Indian intimacy* 
 This was incompatible with his legislative duties at 
 this time of the year. He could therefore only act with 
 delicacy to the absent INIonthermer, whose unsuspicious 
 credulity was rather respectable than contemptible, and 
 to his own amiable wife, by endeavouring to make 
 Paulina's afiections for him subside into friendship for 
 Emily. He knew his consort's principles v/ere too firm 
 to be shaken by sophistry, and he thought that her gen- 
 tle quiet manners would be somewhat improved by a 
 small mixture of the attractive graces of the Italian. 
 At least, he was convinced that it was highly desirable 
 to withdraw her from the too sedulous discharge of 
 her maternal duties. In M'hatever point of view he 
 considered Paulina's arrival in England, he never 
 thought it possible that his own conduct should deviate 
 from rectitude. In the absence of temptation he felt 
 confident of strength, and it must be admitted that all 
 liis early arrangements were dictated by consummate 
 prudence. Emily was to act as Patxlina's agent, and 
 liis call at her house was merely a civil inquirv after her 
 health, and to announce Lady Avondel's intended vi- 
 sit, without the least intention of seeing her himself. 
 Paidina's account of her message to him was merelv 
 an invention, which soft term is I believe used for ji 
 certain foible in fine ladies, which, when adopted by 
 the nymphs of Wapping and Billingsgate, receives a 
 coarser appellation.

ii2 THE REFUSAL. 
 
 The first interview between the ladies seenrted so 
 thoroughly to have answered his lordship's expecta- 
 tion, that he now resolved to pay his personal respects 
 to Paulina, but dreading lest she should burst into some 
 extravagance he determined to avoid the presence of 
 a third person. The untravelied reader would accuse 
 ine of indecorum, were I to particularize the raptures 
 with which the lady received her noble friend ; for 
 tliongh she had no design of violating decorum, the 
 chaste delicacy of British manners would only have 
 authorized such a welcome to the nearest' and most 
 sacred connections. Lord Avondel received her ca- 
 resses with polished dignity, rather than puritanic rigi- 
 dity. He led her to htr chair wiih an air of respectful 
 galiantry, and by enquiring after General Monthermer 
 and expressing his impatience to embrace him in Eng- 
 land, conveyed an oblique intimation to Paulina which 
 she was not disposed to receive with humility. 
 
 " I was going," said she, " co thank you for the pro- 
 vident attentions by which you have adapted this man- 
 sion to my habits and taste, and anticipating my very 
 wishes have made me in your clouded clime almost 
 breathe as I should in my native Tuscany. But I re- 
 collect it is oriy as Montheimer's wife I receive these 
 distinctions, and bis thanks will be far more welcome 
 to Lord Avondel than the unworthy Paulina's." 
 
 *' Lady Paulina," replied the earl, " is only unwor- 
 thy when she is unjust to her own singular deserts. If 
 the accommodations that have been provided for my 
 much honoured friend are calculated to conciliate her 
 mind to England, the praise is due to Lady Avondel, 
 who will rejoice to hear her assiduity is so richly re- 
 warded." 
 
 " My husband — his wife — what other demon will 
 he embody to scare me into a rectitude as cold as per- 
 fect as his own ? Yet can it be possible that this tame, 
 correct, unimpassioned girl, can hold captive a heart 
 which resists my powers of fascination ? This is but 
 grimace Avondel, and unless opposed by some more

 powerful rival I will yet make you suffer for your af- 
 fected insensibility." 
 
 Such were Paulina's reflections while, throwing into 
 her face a bewitching despondency, with a tremulous 
 reluctance, she congratulated Lord Avondel on his 
 marriage. " I have seen your lovely bride," said she, 
 " and asked her permission to enjoy your friendship. 
 Without her sanction I durst not have granted this in- 
 terview ; for I remember we do not now meet in climes 
 where liberal manners allow every social indulgence 
 which is not tainted by guilt, but in that frigid region 
 where a thousand eyes watch to misconstrue the glances 
 of gratitude, and a thousand tongues misinterpret the 
 language of veneration. Your wife must be the guid- 
 ing sybil to direct me aright through these perils, and 
 since her youthful charms far eclipse those relics of 
 faded grace which scorching suns and wasting sorrows 
 have spared, surely calumny will not dart any invidious 
 glances when I am introduced as your Italian or only 
 as your Indian friend." 
 
 " Permit me," said the graceful nobleman, " to re- 
 mark, that your partiality for the manners to which you 
 have been accustomed induces you to misconstrue the 
 laws of English society, so far as to suppose that ia 
 proportion as the British fair are reserved they are mo- 
 rose and uncandid. You will soon discover your error 
 by the liberal kindness with which they will welcome 
 you, and forget to fear a formidable rival in the plea- 
 sure of receiving a lovely stranger. On the other 
 hand, I am convinced your discernment will soon teach 
 you the propriety of adopting the modes of the coun- 
 try which you honour even with a temporary residence, 
 and as I hope in future to consider my Italian and In- 
 dian friend as a naturalized English-woman, I rest as- 
 sured you will find our customs not so restrictive as to 
 prove an impediment to the display of your native 
 graces." 
 
 " 'Tis well," answered Paulina, fixing her penetrating 
 eyes on Lord Avondel, " your humanity leads you to 
 cheat the forlorn stranger out of her terrors before she

 explores your unknown world. But should I through 
 ignorance, heedlessness, or say indiscretion, provoke 
 the censure of those whom you describe to be so com- 
 passionately candid, will you plead my cause at the for- 
 midable bar of discretion ? Recollect that I have no 
 father, brother, advocate or friend among these " lords 
 of human kind" but yourself. Will you tell them vou 
 have known Paulina from her childhood, watched her 
 temper, and fostered her genius by your praises ? Will 
 you say (for Avondel too well you know the truth) 
 that though her ingenuous nature starts from duplicity 
 as a crime, yet is she pure from the contact of depra- 
 vity, and would fly from pollution with as much abhor- 
 rence as the most rigid prude that ever recoiled from 
 the gaze of admiration, and sequestered herself in the 
 inmost sacristy of Dian's temple, to escape the pursu- 
 ing sighs of love ? Will 3'ou support, countenance, vin- 
 dicate me ? Avondel ! you saved me from the fangs of 
 the tyger, will you also preserve my fame from the 
 more cruel wounds of obloquy, aided perhaps in the 
 work of destruction, by my own precipitation?" 
 
 Avondel answered, that he should feel it equally a 
 duty and a pleasure to render her all the protection 
 which fiiendship could afford. " Yet," added he, " 'tis 
 my known opinion, that a lady's reputation is ever the 
 safest when under the guardianship of her own discre- 
 tion ; and of all the situations in which your sex is 
 placed, none requires more chariness of conduct than 
 that of a beautiful v/oman possessed of rank and afflu- 
 ence, and at a distance from her husband." 
 
 " Your remark," replied Paulina, " may apply to 
 many countries, but in England, that rich emporium of 
 female charms, peopled by celeslial houries, or shall I 
 say by animated multiplications of that marble model 
 of perfection which enriches our Florence, a care-worn 
 stranger may flatter herself that her conduct will rest 
 uncanvassed under the sombre shade of neglect." 
 
 " I anticipate a very different reception," said Avon- 
 del gaily, '■'■ when Lady Paulina Monihermer first ex- 
 hibits in the drawing room of a British queen the con-

 centrated graces ^vbich Apelles was forced to seek in a 
 variety of lovely (irecians. Hut I know you do not 
 prefer the admiration of multitudes to the devotion of 
 one faithful heart, and therefore I will only tell you, 
 that you will then be surrounded by those who, like 
 yourself, think less of their personal attractions than of 
 those indelible obligations to which beauty serves as an 
 introductory passport." 
 
 " Stay," exclaimed Paulina, perceiving the earl about 
 to withdraw. " My follies all die to-night, and I shall 
 rise to-morrow the correct discreet wife, a fit compa- 
 nion for your faithful Emily, and like her only pleased 
 with the light of beauty when it kindles the torch of 
 Hymen. We have plighted the oath of friendship. 
 Has it your sanction, Avondel ? for I already feel all 
 the localities of England, and would be a model of 
 propriety even to your countrywomen." 
 
 " Lady Avondel," said the earl, " lives under the 
 happy guardianship I have just alluded to, and I am 
 ever ready to sanction the friendships she is disposed 
 to form-" 
 
 " Can you love," inquired Paulina, " and yet be 
 free from suspicion and fear?" 
 
 " Doubtless," replied the earl, " for implicit confi- 
 dence is the soul of generous love." 
 
 " Spoken with oracular precision," said Paulina, 
 *'and I will practically shew my assent to that aphor- 
 ism. Mark, Avondel, when I address you, love and 
 friendship are synonymous terms. I know you capa- 
 ble of confidence. I know the mean ungenerous alloy 
 of vanity has never sullied your virtues. See what has 
 been the companion of my travels, to what I have pray- 
 ed as to a patron saint in all mv dangers by sea and 
 land." She drew the portrait which was suspended 
 round her neck from the folds of her robe, and loosen- 
 ing it from the pearls presented the astonished Avondel 
 with his own resemblance. Flattered bv vanity, and 
 enchanted by the graceful manner of the beautiful sy- 
 ren, he pressed her hand with fervour, and wished for

 a moment that no such beings as Monthermer and 
 Emily existed. 
 
 Paulina saw the struggle of suspended virtue, and 
 exulted in the idea that the -haughty captive would 
 soon be entrammeled in her chains. " He shall long 
 suffer the same hopeless misery I have endured," said 
 she ; while returning the pressure of his hand, she 
 asked him with a look and manner full of most exqui- 
 site softness, if he was pleased with the likeness. — 
 *' You do not," she continued, " ask the name of the 
 painter, you are conscious it was love, I mean friend- 
 ship?" 
 
 " Lady Paulina," said Avondel with a hurried ac- 
 cent, " this must not be. As friendship guided the 
 pencil, let friendship receive the admirable result of 
 her own skill. Present it to my Emily, on her bosom 
 it will appear a beautiful and appropriate ornament," 
 
 " You mean," replied Paulina, " that these pearls 
 are best suited to the lucid transparency of her com- 
 plexion, not that your image is dearer to her heart than 
 it is to the grateful woman ^yhom you rescued from a 
 living grave, and now despise for loving her preserv- 
 er?" 
 
 " This charge," said the earl, " is too futile to re- 
 quire a reply. I cannot despise a lady in whose no- 
 bleness of mind I place such confidence as to venture 
 to point out some errors in her opinion. Nor can 
 there be a clearer evidence of my approbation of your 
 general character, than my requesting you to confirm 
 your friendship for Lady Avondel by a pledge which 
 .renders it indisputable." 
 
 Paulina perceived she had gone too far, but her ever 
 ready invention had provided her with a retreat secure 
 to herself and mortifying to the haughty Briton, who, 
 with all his nice sense of honour, was not displeased 
 to be an object of love. Changing her look from 
 pleading softness to frolic levity, she exclaimed. 
 *' Why, my lord> your tone is tragically serious ! Do 
 you really suppose Monthermer's faithful wife paid 
 such warm idolatry to your picture,^ that it became

 necessary to rouse the guardian fiends of honour and 
 apprehension, and command them to immolate the 
 counterfeit deity on the aUer of wedded love ? It was 
 all a plot between nre and the general. I vowed that 
 like all your sex your virtues were degraded by vani- 
 ty, and he protested you were pure from that alloy. 
 We contrived the scene in which I was to assume the 
 despairing inamorata, and I have succeeded to admi- 
 ration. You have been trying to escape from me, and to 
 rescue your representative from my dying glances, and 
 now, with millions of thanks, I permit your retreat. — 
 Trust me, your lovely innocent unsuspecting wife shall 
 carry off the prize which has excited your terrors. Fare- 
 wel, my lord ; come, your hand in friendship. You 
 must not suffer your brow to be clouded, or I shall 
 boast that you do not bear schooling as patiently as I 
 do. Yet, believe me, though I enjoy this triumph, 
 my respect for your invincible honour and perfect self 
 command is highly increased by the trial for which you 
 must censure Monthermer's partiality, in believing 
 you not merely the noblest of human beings, but ab- 
 solutely free from every foible. 
 
 " Strange, inconsistent woman, said Lord Avondel 
 to himself, as, with ill dissembled good humour, and 
 constrained gracefulness, he retired from the versatile 
 Italian, pondering on this extraordinary interview, 
 unwilling to be either the object of love or of ridicule, 
 and woildering which sentiment he had really excited. 
 H'S nice sense of honour shrunk from the thought of 
 inspiring an illicit passion, and I'eality he held women 
 too cheap 10 be much gratified at sharing that admira- 
 tion which was generally devoted to fops and cox- 
 combs : on the other hand, his pride revolted with 
 still greater horror from the suspicion that he had sunk 
 into the toy of femal:, caprice, the puppet of coquetry, 
 and the fool of dissimulation. He could almost pity 
 the enamoured Paulina.^ and excuse an attachment 
 which merit might justify, but that she should pre- 
 sume to trifle with his dignity, that a woman should

 dare to criticize and punish faults (which certainly only 
 existed in her own imagination) were unpardonable 
 offences ; and the more so, as he could not seriously 
 notice her impertinence without owning that he *felt 
 wounded by the charge. After all, it struck him that 
 she was only guilty in tongue not in purpose. For 
 twelve years her eyes had spoken a very different lan- 
 guage, and he explained her behaviour by considering, 
 that as her transport at seeing him after a long separa- 
 tion had betrayed her into such unguarded w armth, 
 so either pique at his coldness, or a returning sense of 
 duty to Monthermer, made her fertile imagination 
 invent an excuse which would cover her own confusion 
 by his transient embarrassment. This conclusion ad- 
 mitted of an inference, that the mortification, which 
 had been sufficiently painful to reduce her to an act of 
 duplicity, would teach her such future caution as must 
 prevent her from making him ridiculous or herself 
 contemptible by permitting others to discover her at- 
 tachment. Self confidence told him, that it was im- 
 possible his virtue could ever be endangered by this 
 connection, and though he w^ished Lady Avondel a 
 less eccentric acquaintance, still slander had never 
 soiled her fame on English ground, and he thought 
 too highly of his wife's prudence and affection to fear 
 cither for her character or her peace. He had no ob- 
 jection that Emily's home-bred air should be a little 
 subdued by Paulina's travelled ease, and her confined 
 domestic habits rendered less painful to him or herself; 
 and in the wish of seeing his consort made a woman 
 of the world, he lost sight of the danger which re- 
 sulted from the contaminating influence of a character 
 whose principles he doubted, and whose eccentricities 
 he disapproved. I do not mean to describe Lord Avon- 
 del as a model of perfection. Human nature resembles 
 the world in which it acts, where magnificent cities, em- 
 bellished with stately edifices, the asylums of science 
 and the arts, are often placed contiguous to dreary wastes, 
 where may be found the cavern of the robber and the

 den of the wild beast. We may derive as many les- 
 sons of instruction from the vices as we do from the 
 virtues of eminent people, and the pen of inspiration 
 has hallowed this method of teaching posterity. Nor 
 is the value of fictitious compositions ever greater, than 
 when they lead the reader to consider, how often the 
 just retribution of Providence turns our offences into 
 instruments of punishment in the real history of man- 
 kind. 
 
 With regard to Paulina, though she called it virtue 
 to abandon her mind to the empire of the passions, 
 she was so practised an actress that she could at will 
 assume such exterior self command as to use either 
 extravagance or raillery, as an engine to extort a full 
 developement of the character of those she played 
 upon. She suspected that Lord Avondel was rather 
 a respectful husband than a passionate lover of his 
 young bride. She saw she had power to excite or to 
 mortify his vanity, and that blandishments could shake, 
 perhaps also undermine, his principles. On these 
 premises she built a certainty of future success, if, by 
 guarded advances, and an apparent deference to his 
 refined notions, she could veil her design so as not to 
 alarm his circumspection. Her views at this time 
 were limited to the gratification of her vindictive pas- 
 sions. She wished to I'ctaliate on the earl the wretch- 
 edness and mortification he had made her feel, and 
 she fancied, that by preserving personal chastity her 
 vows to Monthermer would not be violated by any li- 
 berties short of actual incontinence. As to Lady 
 Avondel, though she despised her as a rival, she 
 thought her presumption in pretending to such an alli- 
 ance deserved punishment, or that the mere honour 
 of bearing the najne of the hero was sufficient for a 
 mind of such an ordinary stamp, whose predominate 
 features were innocence, gentleness, and timidity. — 
 Convinced that guileless simplicity was most easily 
 wounded under the guise of friendship, she resolved 
 to preserve that mask, knowing that Emily's spotless

 reputation would be a convenient passport to respecta- 
 ble society, without the privileges of which she could 
 never play at her ease for that high stake, the heart of 
 a married man, correct in morals, and unblemished 
 in character. Yet, persuaded Emily's understanding 
 was as weak as her temper was placid, she resolved 
 either to terrify her by her conscious si^periority or by 
 an unguarded disclosure of her secrets to inveigle her 
 firmly in her toils.

 Dry DEN". 
 
 TO confirm Paulina in her resolution of giving up 
 his picture to Emily, Lord Avondel ordered a sump- 
 tuous tiara of diamonds to be sent to the high spirited 
 Italian, as a propitiatory offering, stipulating her im- 
 mediatel)'^ to relinquish what she had so surreptitiously 
 detained and improperly exhibited. Paulma under- 
 stood the meaning of the present, but resolved her ac- 
 quiescence should wound the delicate feelings of Emi- 
 ly. " Dearest of friends," said she, clasping the al- 
 most terrified countess in her arms at their next inter- 
 view, " thus let me thank you for allowing me the 
 most exstatic of sublunary enjoyments. I have seen 
 him, the first of human kind. Commissioned bv his 
 beloved Emilia he came to breathe out one benevolent 
 wish for my happiness. Envv me not an hour's con- 
 verse with your Avondel, but rather exult at your own 
 pre-eminent ^"elicity, to whom his days, his thoughts, 
 his life, are all devoted." 
 
 Emily's heart always bounded with transport at eve- 
 ry tender recollection of her lord, but she was prepared 
 to address Paulina on another subject, and she almost 
 wished (triuch as she enju)ccl these panegyrics) that 
 htr ItaliiMi iiisnd would discuss th? delightful theme 
 with more temjierance. A mild gravity stole over 
 her features, which Paulina observing, she expressed 
 her conviction that the warmth of her feelings oppres- 
 sed her delicacy. Adopting a look of persuasive con- 
 trition, she begged forgiveness, and said she would in 
 future restrain her errors by the gentle reproofs of her

 correct discernment. She again pleaded ignorance of 
 British customs. " The English women I have lived 
 with," said she, " were low-born adventurers, with 
 vulgar minds and mercenary views. The chosen of 
 Avondefs soul must be alike the standard of grace 
 and virtue. Spread the shield of thy sanctitude over 
 me, sweet Emilia, desert me not for my offences, but 
 teach me till I cease to offend. First tell me, may none 
 admire the demi-gods this island produces without a 
 passport from Hymen ? Must none but Andromache 
 sing the praises of Hector, must no eye, save Penelope's 
 weep for the dangers of Ulysses." 
 
 " You are mistaken," said the countess, " we con- 
 sider the fame of our husbands as reflecting honour 
 on ourselves, and our attachment to their reputations 
 makes us deem their praises the most grateful species 
 of flattery. Could I be so mean as to feel pain instead 
 of pleasure at your gratitude to my lord, I would so- 
 lace myself by determining to take ample revenge as 
 soon as General Monthermer arrives in England, with 
 whom I am determined to have a very violent flirta- 
 tion. I have already fallen in love with his character. 
 I hear he is one of the tenderest and most faithful of 
 husbands, and to deserve such epithets, while surround- 
 ed by general habits of licence and dissipation, is amaz- 
 ing merit. Come, Paulina, I saw jou press his picture 
 to your heart while I was talking. I dare you to shew 
 it me, and by the pangs you feel while I commend his 
 features, judge how you torture me by your idolatry to 
 my household deity." 
 
 " Begin, then," said Paulina, " and 1 will echo your 
 eulogies. Beautiful Emilia, the hero, the chain, and 
 its inestimable appendage, are all your own. Once I 
 thought I had an indefeasible title to this treasure, but 
 an imperative injunction, and a superior claim, compel 
 me to resign it." She unclasped the pearls from her 
 neck as she spoke, and presented the chain and picture 
 to Lady Avondel, who with pale astonishment recog- 
 nized the lineaments of her lord, and for the first time 
 wished her eyes had met some other object.

 Paulina contemplated her emotion with fiend-like 
 exultation, and folding her in her arms exclaimed, 
 " Now friendship and honour, your triumphs are com- 
 plete." Her ready tears mingl«d with those of the 
 innocent Emily, who, new to the cruel emotions of jea- 
 lous}-, wept as she supposed in pity for Paulina's suf- 
 ferings, and felt persuaded that if she had been called 
 upon to relinquish such a treasure, the deprivation 
 would have been most severe. 
 
 After frequent efforts to speak, she at last told Pau- 
 lina, she would not accept a sacrifice which cost such 
 severe pangs. " I am convinced," said she, '• voar at- 
 tachment to my lord is pure and honourable, founded 
 on the most justifiable gratitude and sanctioned by the 
 approbation of your husband. I will not deprive you 
 of this cherished resemblance of your dear and brave 
 preserver." 
 
 " No," said Paulina," putting her hand before her 
 averted eyes, *' the privileges allowed me in my hap- 
 pier days are resumed by him who awarded them. 
 Avondel has told me that your claims invalidate mine. 
 Indian attachments must not be iransplanttd to the 
 cold climes of Europe. Yet, magnificent in his cruel- 
 ty, see with what a mine of wealth he purchases my 
 obedience." Unlocking the casket she discovered the 
 blazing tiara, Avhile Emily gazed with amazement on a 
 present whose value far exceeded any she had ever re- 
 ceived from her lord. 
 
 " \V^e orientalists," proceeded Paulina, " require 
 that every remarkable occurrence should be eternized 
 by gifts, and Avondel visits with the munificence of a 
 sultan. Hallow it with your sanction, my Emilia ; till 
 you arrived it stood unaccepted on mv toilette." Emi- 
 ly recollected herself, and gracefully placed the tiara 
 on Paulina's uncon fined redundant tresses, while Pau- 
 lina fastened the string of pearls around her neck. The 
 presents being thus mutually accepted, the fair im- 
 provvisatrice uttered the following invocation.

 The gentle countess could not resist an invitation 
 cnrorcfd by the most exquisitely persuasive voice and 
 irr.pnssioned gestures. She again renewed her promise 
 of steady active friendship, and felt convinced that 
 there could be nothing very wrong in what was so pre- 
 eminently charming. Nor did she, til! she had parted 
 from Paulina, reflect on the singularity of forming 
 such an engagement with a lady, who not only avowed 
 her love for Loid Avondel, but admitted her affection 
 was incompatible with the sacred ties he had formed. 
 This implied a previous sadrifice of her vows to Mon- 
 thermer, and what then was Paulina ? Lord Avondel 
 always spoke of her as a woman of honour. The prin- 
 ciple of screening the faults of a fellow crim.inal might 
 induce him to set the fairest gloss on the character of 
 a lady whose attachment to his person might in her 
 eyes extenuate guilt ; but she recollected his extreme 
 delicacy with respect to her intimacies. He was con- 
 sistent in all his actions, could she therefore suppose, 
 that he would not only introduce her to the discarded 
 object of his illicit passion, but even recommend her

 as a woman who deserved her friendship, and whom 
 she was particularly to countenance and introduce to 
 the best society ? A gloomy host of fears and doubts 
 vanished at her recollection of the unswerving pru- 
 dence and delicacy of her revered husband. She be- 
 lieved she had misconstrued Pauhna's words, or per- 
 haps, though the lady spoke English with the greatest 
 fluency, she had no correct idea of the meaning we 
 affix to the term love when applied to one of a differ- 
 ent sex. Perhaps, too, though she had been taught to 
 consider platonic attachments as not only dangerous 
 but often a mere apology for criminality, they might 
 subsist in India, or rather in Italy, Vv'he re manners and 
 opinions were so different. In Engkuul they could not 
 be tolerated. She respected Lord Glenvorne, she re- 
 vered his virtues, she esteemed him as the friend of 
 her lord ; she was grateful for the preference he had 
 entertained for herself; but to confess she loved him 
 — to praise him in very strong terms — to wear his pic- 
 ture — there was criminality in the thought — it was dis- 
 graceful — it was impious. Her marriage oath with 
 Avondel would attest her dishonour, should she admit 
 any competition to his indefeasible right to her prefer- 
 ence. Her admiration, her affections, as well as her 
 person, ^v•ere exclusively his ovvn. She hoped Paulina 
 would be sincere in endeavouring to renounce this dan- 
 gei'ous idolatry. It was a proper terra for such roman- 
 tic feelings, and she admired her lord's prudence in 
 seeing Paulina but seldom, for really it would not be 
 humane to fan the flame of so very susceptible a heart. 
 Lady Paulina having so far succeeded in her design 
 of impressing Emily with a lively admiration of her 
 talents, and prevailed on her to forgive a sort of dubious 
 equivoque between discretion and propriety ; having 
 also engaged the guileless countess to overlook her 
 occasional extravagance ; wisely considered, that as 
 few women would be eq'.ally candid she must be care- 
 ful to conceal these sentiments, as they would prove an 
 eftectual barrier against her admission into those cir- 
 cles where her rank and fortune entitled her to move.

 She tood care, therefore, that her debut in the Eng- 
 lish world should reflect no discredit on her delicate 
 chaperone, nor raise such suspicions of her disposition 
 as would prevent the success of her designs. All 
 modes of deportment were equally at her command, 
 and she rightly judged, that, by at first veiling her ta- 
 lents under the graceful concealment of diffidence, they 
 would burst afterwards on the astonished world with 
 additional splendour. "• The pensive Nun," of Mil- 
 ton was not more " sober, steadfast and demure," than 
 Paulina when the general aspect of the surrounding 
 company seemed to require propriety. Her visage be- 
 came still more " saintly" if Lord Avondel entered 
 the circle, in v/hose presence " her eyes with a leaden 
 downward cast fixed upon the earth," while she seemed 
 disposed to " forget herself to marble." No behaviour 
 could more rapidly conciliate the good opinion or quiet 
 the fears of Emily, and at the same time it interested 
 the compassion of Lord Avondel, ever exposed to er- 
 ror and danger from his inordinate stlf esteem. He 
 now saw -Paulina as a woman of honour struggling 
 with the consciousness of a fault she was unable to 
 vanquish, and in her apparent suiFerings to subdue her 
 passion he recognized a greatness of soul with which 
 nature taught him to claim kindred. 'I'he blaze of her 
 beauty, the attraction of her talents, had failed to in- 
 thral him ; but Paulina, apprehensive and dejected, 
 looking up to him for protection, yet afraid to enjoy 
 his society lest it should increase her susceptibility of 
 his high deserts, had a claim to his admiration, pity, 
 and gratitude. 
 
 To this disposition to be interested about Paulina, 
 the voice of fame soon gave an additional stimulus. 
 The beauty of the stranger was first* commended, but 
 before the wonders of her face and form vi ere exhaust- 
 ed her graceful manners swelled the recording trumpet. 
 Then her talents stole on the / orld in succession. One

 had with difficulty prevailed on her to sing, and her 
 voice combined all the various powers of the most ad- 
 mirable performers. She excelled equally in modelling 
 and painting. Her dancing began to excite admiratioa 
 Avhen it was found out that she had the singular faculty 
 of throwing her charming figure, and adapting her fine 
 countenance, into such attitudes and expressions as re- 
 presented some of those exquisite remains of ancient 
 art which then enriched Italy. Thus the delighted 
 spectator sometimes gazed on the sober charms of Oc- 
 tavia, beheld Agrippina weeping over the urn of Ger- 
 manicus, or Cornelia devoting her sons to the service 
 of their country. The entertainment was heightened 
 by speeches or verses adapted to the assumed charac- 
 ter, and it was soon discovered that they were impromp- 
 tus flowing from a genius as flexible as her form. 
 These exhibitions were extremely rare, given as 
 pledges of friendship to a select few, the reward of 
 urgent intreaty, and with one express condition, that 
 no gentleman should be of the part}-. Paulina fre- 
 quentlv adverted to the delicacy which her temporary 
 widowhood required, and spoke of her reputation with 
 a solicitude which imposed on the credulous, though in 
 stronger minds it excited a suspicion that this extraor- 
 dinary alarm could only arise from some secret con- 
 sciousness that her fame was in danger. 
 
 In process of time, this reserve and terror wore off, 
 or rather yielded to the intreaty of some ladv of high 
 fashion or right honourable eulogist, who, charmed to 
 the extreme, begged as the most gratifying of all indul- 
 gencies that her dilettante husband, son, brother, or 
 cousin, might satiate his intense desire of witnessing 
 the excellence she had so imperfectly described. Thus, 
 by imperceptible degrees, the law excluding males was 
 rescinded, and Paulina's mansion became so much the 
 favourite resort of all who possessed or pretended to 
 taste, that hurried on bv the impulse of fashion no 
 one had leisure to recollect the very d:uc;rent preten- 
 sions under which the fascinating hostess had stolen 
 into their good opinion, or to reconcile the reserve and

 caution which she said her situation required till Gene- 
 ral Monthermer's return, with the publicity she now 
 affected or the freedom she allowed. By the first dis- 
 guise, she had drawn a large circle around her, and 
 the charms of her manners, and the elegance of her en- 
 tertainments, secured her from having the number di- 
 minished : for as none would hastily renounce what 
 they had found so delightful, Paulina had still the 
 judgment to avoid those glaring violations of decorum 
 which would compel her visitants to own themselves 
 mistaken in what they had proclaimed to be the stand- 
 ard of excellence. 
 
 Lord Avondel was sometimes at these parties, and 
 Paulina by degrees became a frequent inmate at Berk- 
 ley-square. But though she was an adept in the art of 
 dissimulation, she could not and perhaps wished not so 
 completely to disguise her feelings as to treat the man 
 who alternately excited passionate love and vindictive 
 resentment with the same graceful freedom as she pre- 
 served towards others. Even her reserve and studied 
 decorum proclaimed her secret consciousness, and her 
 stolen glances shewed him, that his tempered praise 
 and guarded attentions were more gi'ateful to her than 
 the plaudits and homage of the world. These she could 
 receive with queen-like ease, and return with spirited 
 vivacity ; but a look or word from Avondel reduced 
 her to the blushing novice, " disordered by the deep 
 regard she drew." As he was firmly resolved this 
 latent attach rnent should never burst its present bounds, 
 so as to tarnish his fame or wound his peace, the earl 
 felt his pride soothed by discovering her susceptibility, 
 and while he scarcely wished her affection, or rather 
 admiration of him, should be Jess impassioned, her va- 
 rious and commanding talents afforded him that amuse- 
 ment in his hours of leisure which the gentle sameness 
 and tranquil tenderness of his consort did not supply. 
 The proud sell-consciousness which told him it was 
 impossible he could swerve from honour, and become 
 perjured to his wife and dishonest to his friend, conti- 
 nued to lull his mind into full security, and he felt no

 alarm from discovering that Paulina's society became 
 every clay more necessary, or that he grew more de- 
 lighted at hearing the universal voice of fame reverbe- 
 rate the praises of his charming friend. 
 
 Nor did this high-minded penetrating nobleman dis- 
 cover, that the failings of his wife were aggravated by 
 the strong contrast of opposite qualities. Her childish 
 fears, her groundless self-condemnation, her excessive 
 tenderness, and susceptible diffidence, the undisguised 
 emotions of a sincere, virtuous, well-principled, but 
 infirm mind, were daily offending and repenting in the 
 presence of the most perfect self-possession, ot a cou- 
 rage that not only dared to do every thing which be- 
 came a woman but suffered not its purposes to be cir- 
 cumscribed by the restraints of conscience and deco- 
 rum, and of a disposition which, so far from acknow- 
 ledging its errors and suing to be forgiven, possessed 
 that plausibility which might excuse or even command 
 respect to its vices. When hard pressed, Paulina could, 
 by a peculiar versimilitude, give an air of whim or 
 humour to every extravagance, or take shelter from 
 disgrace by placing her accusers in so contemptible a 
 light as to oblige them to become apologists for their 
 own conduct instead of censors of hers. Even Emily's 
 sweetness and innocence, were weak allies in this con- 
 test, for Paulina could affect delicacy and innocence, 
 and had sufficient command of her passions to preserve 
 the exterior of sweetness. The countess loved her 
 lord, but in expressing her affection she was chaste, de- 
 corous, and timid. Her attachment spoke in her eyes, 
 in the tender pathos of her voice, in the constant tenor 
 of her meek observant deportment. It might be called 
 the regular affection of sensibility begging protection 
 and fearing to offend. How unlike the glowing pas- 
 sion of Paulina, M'hich, though now confined to the 
 name and language of friendship, seemed to claim the 
 heart of a hero on equal terms, while, with every varied 
 expression which elocution could dignify or invention 
 dictate, she extolled those merits on which Emily si- 
 lently meditated, and with convincing discrimination

 she detailed the various perfections of that character 
 which the tender wife considered but as one perfect 
 whole combining every thing that was great and good. 
 Paulina read every sentiment which arose in Emily's 
 mind ; nor did the deeper caution of the lofty earl pre- 
 vent her penetrating chai-acter from discovering that 
 her increasing celebrity made her of more consequence 
 in his eyes, and that the hero and the statesman was 
 not exempt from the weakness of pluming himself 
 upon the regard of her whom all the world admired. 
 Fashion, omnipotent in its decrees, had lately ordained 
 that the Lady Paulina Monthermer was not only the 
 most accomplished beauty ever known, but a woman of 
 superior judgment ; and though Lord Avondel did 
 not at first cordially subscribe to this decision, a cir- 
 cumstance occurred which made him venerate the wis- 
 dom as much as he admired the genius of Paulina. 
 This lady lent Emily a manuscript narrative of her 
 lord's Indian government, as a composition of her own, 
 though in fact she merely transcribed the journal of 
 the general's secretary which she had purchased, and 
 introduced some of those ornaments of style which 
 would gain credit for her asserting that it was penned 
 by herself. The earl's military and fiscal operations 
 were detailed with such clearness, strength, and pene- 
 trailoTi, PS proved his labours were appreci^stcd by a 
 congenial mind, capable of entering into all his views 
 and of unfolding the secret measures which produced 
 such l:)riiliaHt success, baffled perfidious and irrecon- 
 cilal)le enemies, confirmed wavering friendships, and 
 made the English name revered through that vast pen- 
 insula for daring courage and honourable fidelity. 
 Though Paulina claimed this as her own work, the 
 reader vvili not be surprised that it was undcbascd by 
 the fondness of a lover, the affectation of a poet, or bj-- 
 that narrowness of observation and redundance of sen- 
 timent which Lord Avondel thought the marked cha- 
 racteristic of a female pen, too apt to lose sight of the 
 illustrious character in its admiration of the fine gentle- 
 man and polished companion. He compared this de-

 lineation of his proceedings with some well remembei'- 
 ed observations of Selina's, and perceived they were 
 alike distinguished by strength and solidity. lie ad- 
 mitted that had the latter been his annalist the compo- 
 sition would have been more replete with moral reflec- 
 tions ; less would have been ascribed to secret causes, 
 and more to providential interposition. Delineated by 
 the woman of the world, he w^as Alcides conscious of 
 invulnerable prowess, but the devout recluse would 
 have diffused that celestial splendour around his head 
 which distinguishes the portraits of the possessors of 
 superior excellence, the favoured objects of divine pro- 
 tection. 
 
 Terrestrial honours, however, so far gratified Lord 
 Avondel as to conciliate his esteem for her who had 
 bestowed them, whom he no longer considered as a 
 person of shewy talents, strong passions, and defective 
 judgment, calculated to dazzle at a distance but dan- 
 gerous as an intimate, and agonizing as a very near 
 connection ; but as a person of vast discrimination and 
 steady judgment. He had feared she was a severe ob- 
 server and insidious friend ; far otherv/ise, she had 
 more than once delicately palliated Emily's foibles, and 
 instead of displaying her weakness and her own supe- 
 riority, seemed anxious to shade her own beams in the 
 presence of the countess, whom she endeavoured to 
 lead out of her beloved obscurity. The earl had over- 
 heard her (without knowing it was designed he should 
 overhear) seriously advise the fond young mother to 
 mingle more fortitude with her maternal feeling, and 
 once, when he could not disguise his displeasure at his 
 wife's permitting her fears at some trifling indisposition 
 of the child to bring on an hysterical affection, Paulina 
 did not retire with Emily, but leaving her to the care 
 of her woman, she staid to plead her cause with so 
 much earnestness and lively persuasion that it seemed 
 impossible she should mean to widen the breach she 
 endeavoured to heal. Yet, though he believed, or ra- 
 ther hoped, that Paulina's intentions were as noble as 
 the sentiments she avowed, he lamented that the irrita-

 bility into which he had been surprised by Emily's in- 
 curable weakness had so far betrayed his caution as to 
 have made him own that even the virtues of a woman 
 when carried to excess must place her near connections 
 in a most painful situation, obliged to condemn yet 
 fearing to censure. Thus easily are even heroic spirits 
 played upon by female artifice when they have once 
 allowed themselves to come within the vortex of tempt- 
 ation, and thus was Paulina placed in the situation at 
 which, after discovering that the earl's heart could not 
 be carried by storm, she submitted to aim. She dis- 
 covered that the happiness of Lord and Lady Avondel 
 though far beyond the common stamp, was not of that 
 pure unmixed kind which many say only existed in 
 Utopia, or in Paradise before the fall. She became 
 too the confidant of the earl, and a mediatrix between 
 him and his consort, to whom she now might boldly 
 offer her services as an adviser, and by alarming her 
 susceptibility with the dread of losing her lord's affec- 
 tious, render that event unavoidable. Or she might 
 publicly assume the superiority with which his confi- 
 dence had invested her, and with the archness and 
 brilliancy, though not with the rectitude, of a Widow 
 Belmore, shew the gentle wife that seclusion and de- 
 pression acted rather as scarecrows than as lures to a 
 recreant heart. 
 
 Sometimes Emily was incapable of doing the ho- 
 nours of her own table, and then Paulina, with admira- 
 ble grace, accepted her seat, reflected the elegant hos- 
 pitality of the noble host, and insensibly called to his 
 table the polished and the well informed. The con- 
 ve!-sation was then no longer in danger of sliding into 
 the comparative merits of cribs and cradles, nor did he 
 tremble with apprehension lest some of the multitudi- 
 nous diseases of Mrs. Caudle's seventeen children 
 should be brought forward to impress a foreign ambas- 
 sador with a conviction of the extensive information of 
 English ladies. Topics of taste, science, erudition, 
 and general knowledge were introduced ; living man- 
 ners were discussed, and classical passages elacidaied.

 Wit and humour raised the festive smile, or " the 
 feast of reason and the flow of soul" thawed the ice of 
 reserve, tempted diffidence out of its secret recesses, 
 and prevailed on cautious wisdom to impart its trea- 
 sures. At these truly attic nights Paulina presided as 
 the genial spirit of conversation. Her bewitching 
 wand had sometimes the power of detaining Emily 
 from watching the slumbers of her child, and constru- 
 ing every start into a convulsion. More frequently, 
 however, pleased to see her lord happy, and regretting 
 that she could not be as gay and entertaining as Paulina, 
 she stole in secret to her nursery, which she believed to 
 be her more appropriate sphere, and left the earl fret- 
 ting at her absence, and drawing conclusions less candid 
 than her virtues deserved, and by far too favourable to 
 Paulina. That lady, indeed, affected to be thought a 
 paragon of true maternal affection ; but by introducing 
 her son into society, and cultivatmg such theatrical dis- 
 play as attracted attention, she shewed more of the 
 vanity than the affection of a mother. To gratify this 
 feeling she could consent to endanger his health by late 
 hours and premature dissipation, provided his ad- 
 dress reflected splendour on herself. 
 
 This apparent reciprocity of character, which com- 
 mon observers fancied extended to something more 
 than manner and taste, and made many people say, 
 " surely Lord Avondel never appeai-ed to such advan- 
 tage as when in Paulina's company." It was observed, 
 that the collision of kindred minds increases their mu- 
 tual lustre, and that they seemed to have been born to 
 adorn and bless each other. Lord Avondel overheard 
 these or similar whispers. The eclat which he derived 
 from Paulina's celebrity rivetted his thraldom, and his 
 insatiable thirst for admiration wedded him to the sy- 
 ren's society. While self-love bade him feel her ab- 
 sence as a diminution of his own enjoyments, it served 
 as an opiate to lull his apprehensions. The reserve she 
 had once assumed had gradually yielded to confi(ientiaI 
 familiarity ; yet still she was too guarded to exceed 
 the bounds which English decorum affixes to friend-

 ships between the two sexes. Some people, indeed, 
 suspected all was not right, but as these suspicions 
 v/ere generally traced to some lady of tarnished repu- 
 tation or to some known debauchee, it became rather 
 a mark of a doubtful character to affix criminality to 
 the intimacy of Lady Paulina with the Earl of Avon- 
 del. Their pure attachment and exalted friendship 
 were introduced into panegj-rics on their virtues, and 
 nrged as proofs of the actual existence of plantonic 
 ]o\e between, congenial minds, v, ithout the least sha- 
 dow of impropriety. And though a few unhappy 
 wives and spiteful spinsters suspected that jealousy dis- 
 torted the pensively anxious countenance of Emily, 
 she was either given up as a fretful character, for 
 whose unhappiness nobody cares, or very candid peo- 
 ple saw more of the apprehensive mother than the sus- 
 picious wife in the occasional depression of a woman 
 -who seemed peculiarly unfit to struggle with life's 
 storms.

 THE season of universal festivity had now com- 
 menced. Spring covered the countrv with a robe of 
 beauty to enchant the admirer of nature, and art accu- 
 mulated capricious decorations for galas, routs, and 
 balls, to stimulate the palled appetites of the votaries 
 of fashion. Amid these enjoyed or anticipated de- 
 lights, nothing was so much talked of as a petit-sou- 
 per of Lady Paulina Monthermer's, which, though 
 she spoke of it merely as a little sociable party, and 
 an assemblage of a few entertaining people to steal her 
 dearest Emilia from her too domestic habits, was 
 secredy announced would prove the very finest thing 
 ever seen in England, combining Italian taste with 
 Indian magnificence. By comparing notes among the 
 invited, it was found, that Paulina's " few entertain- 
 ing people" comprised every body of fashion and 
 celebrity, to each of whom she expressed a desire 
 that they would come disposed to cr,jate pleasure. For 
 as her mansion had few attractions to oiTer they must 
 reciprocally act as magnets to keep hilaritv and good 
 humour among them, and she thought a very probable 
 means of doing so would be for every one to assume 
 and support a particular character. She added, with 
 a mysterious look, that all would go well if her prin- 
 cipal aim were answered ; but she feared England was 
 not suited to a very nervous temperament, and that

 nothing but a continental tour could wean an over sus- 
 ceptible mind from its own reveries. Yet, how could 
 England spare Lord Avondel ? and though the sweet 
 Emilia — here she paused, and, sighing, remarked, 
 that the great and good often tali short of the happi- 
 ness they deserve to enjoy. 
 
 Having thus pointed observation at the countess, (an 
 ordeal which she knew she could never sustain) and 
 called in all the great world to v,itness the weakness 
 she determu-jed to expose, she deemed her mine fin- 
 ished. All the costly and tasteful appendages which 
 prolusion, guided by genius, could crowd into the 
 comparatively narrow limits of a very spacious Lon- 
 don residence, were concentrated. The apartments 
 %vere diversified by oriental, arcadian, and gothic de- 
 corations ; fragrant shrubs and odorous perfumes 
 scented the air ; a blaze of splendour shone from 
 crystal or painted vases, and was reflected by diamond- 
 cut lustres suspended in every direction. This splen- 
 dor was relieved by falling on the rich drapery, and 
 produced the yellow light so admired in the warm 
 tints of Claude Lorrain, and deemed peculiarly fa- 
 vourable to female beautj'. Vocal anct instrumental 
 performers were placed in the galleries, v/hose succes- 
 sive strains, rather melodious and soothing than pow- 
 erful, stole on the ear at every suspension of conver- 
 sation, diffused delight over the iistner's soul, and 
 animated it to new exertions. Add to these arrange- 
 ments, the -most exquisite regale of wines, fruits, and 
 every delicate viand, all that art and wealth could an- 
 ticipate of nature's summer and autumnal products, or 
 commerce select from distant regions, and an idea may 
 be formed of Paulina's magnificent preparations. To 
 crown the whole, the mistress of the fete, in compli- 
 ment to the predominate whim of the da)% called her- 
 self a Perdita without a Florizel, and seeming to forego 
 all other distinctions in the character of the assiduous 
 hostess glided from room to room, attired in the most 
 becoming miii ner, and with all the elegant simplicity 
 which Shakespere ascribes to his beautiful shepherdess.

 She addressed every one in their assumed character, 
 and rather tired to call forth the powers of her guests 
 than to depress competition by the display of her own 
 unrivalled talents. 
 
 Lord Avondel wore the habit of an English baron, 
 \vhich seemed as well suited to his person as this cha- 
 racter was to his manner. For had the Howards and 
 Percies of ancient times united to choose a true repre- 
 sentative of their greatness, they could not have fixed 
 upon one more majestic in figure or noble in deport- 
 ment. The clear transparent complexion of Emily, 
 her auburn locks, and the apprehensive sweetness of 
 her countenance, made many suppose her to be the 
 apt resemblance of fair Rosamond, whose story had 
 been recently dramatized with a simplicity which made 
 contrition look like innocence ; but her delicacy ren- 
 dered her scrupulous of assuming a disreputable cha- 
 racter, and induced her to call herself the Lady Ba- 
 roness. She had meditated a few appropriate speeches, 
 but what witii waiting for fit opportunities to utter 
 them, and what with letting these desired opportuni- 
 ties pass unimproved, she remained a silent spectatress 
 rather than an actress. Though the guests were left 
 free to choose their amusements, and implements were 
 provided for every sort of game, conversation was 
 preferred in compliment to the literary talents of the 
 hostess and the customs of her countr}-. Masks had 
 been prohibited ; the common fun of finding each 
 other out was thus prevented, and supporting an as- 
 sumed part of little interest was discovered to be dull 
 work. The giant Ennui was just going to violate this 
 sacred haunt of exquisite delight, and to fell her vota- 
 ries with this leaden mace, when Paulina, the resist- 
 less Paulina, observed, that as there was a season for 
 every thing, so even propriety might obtain a higher 
 zest by occasionally yielding to absurdity. " We 
 have," said she, " all adapted our behaviour to our 
 characters, let us now do what is so much the practice 
 of real life, act directly opposite to what we seem. — -

 Behold in me a French Bel Esprit.*' The transfor- 
 mation was as prompt as the determination. Affecta- 
 tion, frivolit}-, dogmatism, and self-importance, a 
 confused jargon of science, erudition, and egotism, a 
 loud confident manner, a contemptuous roll of her eyes, 
 and that incessant agitation and volubility which be- 
 speak the irritation of ungratified vanity, transformed 
 the artless enchanting shepherdess into the most dis- 
 gusting of all characters. Peals of laughter succeeded, 
 and every one tried to be equally ridiculous till mirth 
 grew as fatiguing as studied consistency. 
 
 The mistress of the revel watched the joyous note, 
 and perceiving it grew fainter resolved to try, by the 
 power of contrast, to revive enjoyment in a new form. 
 A wish was expressed that she would crown her hospi- 
 tality by an exhibition of her extraordinary talents at 
 imitation ; for whatever delights she presented to her 
 guests they remained incomplete while she withheld 
 l.erself. The lady looked around, and perceiving the 
 request was general, without one yawn expressive of 
 lassitude, one smothered cough, or indication of inabi- 
 lity, she smiled her assent, and retired to prepare her- 
 self for exercising some of that magic which the poet 
 ascribes to the lyre of Timotheus, by producing plea- 
 r.ure from the throbs of pain. Her dishevelled hair, 
 the fixed stupor of her eyes, and the heedless discom- 
 posure of her sable drapery, spoke her intention of 
 pourtraying melancholy heightened to despair. A pre- 
 liide on her lute thrilled every heart with congenial 
 i-adness. The music suddenly ceased, her hand slid 
 from the chords as if paralized by grief, while with a 
 faint yet articulate voice, whose dying sweetness indi- 
 cated mortal debility, she chaunted these stanzas : — 
 
 JMy father is dead, and my mother is dead — 
 They sleep beneath the chui-ch-yard tree— • 
 
 And my brothers so brave, are all in the grave, 
 The greedy grave that yawns for me. 
 
 I am an orphan without a friend, 
 
 Courage my heart for life will end.

 They ache for a night without a morrow. 
 
 Paulina received the applause of the circle for the 
 exquisite treat which her tragic powers had afforded, 
 with the air of one to whom admiration was an every 
 day regale, too familiar to excite attention. She started 
 an inquiry into the causes of our deriving pleasure 
 from the exhibition of fictitious miseries, and, leaving 
 the learned engaged in metaphysical reasoning, she 
 cast her eyes on the quiet Emily (who hung smiling 
 on her lord's arm while he entered into the debate) and 
 observed, in a whisper to some of her intimates, that 
 the character in which Lady Avondel looked so beau- 
 tiful was capable of exciting great interest. This ob- 
 servation was meant to excite a wish, that she would do 
 it full justice, and, as the reader must observe, Paulina 
 was peculiarly obliging this evening. " I will give 
 you," said she, " suspense terminating in rapture, but 
 this reall}' must close the egotism of the night." 
 
 She withdrew to assume the proper habiliments, and 
 returned in the same magnificent yet sober costume as 
 was worn by the countess, leading her son in her hand. 
 A circle was formed ; she called on Lord Avondel to 
 be attentive, as probably she should want his support, 
 and then repeated the following ditty, changing her

 Thy blood must not quail at the cold iron mall

 Thou now art a sprightly boy ; 
 Thy father will clasp thee with fond delight. 
 
 Thy mother will weep for joy. 
 
 " When weak and pale, with many an ail,

 And when others slept, I prayed and wept, 
 
 And gaz'd on thy faded charms. 
 
 " Sir Arthur's race will be lost, I said,

 The father will die in honour's bed. 
 
 The boy of dire disease.

 Towards the conclusion of the ballad her ej^es and 
 gestures directed every one's attention to Lord Avon- 
 del as her consort ; and during the rapid utterance of 
 the last stanza she sprang forvvL-rd, and put herself and 
 her child iuto his arms. The acclamations of wonder 
 seemed suspended by surprise ! All was hushed tili

 successive sobs from a distant part of the apartmQnt 
 attracted attention. A confused bustle announced 
 some disaster : the sobs were followed by a shriek, and 
 at length it was known that Lady Avondel had fallen 
 into hysterics. The interest which she took in Pauli- 
 na's representation of sentiments so congenial to her 
 real feelings overpowered her self-command. She at- 
 tempted to withdraw from an exhibition which her ten- 
 derness too strongly realij?ed, but every eye was turned 
 upon her. The ever predominant considerations that 
 her behaviour was wrong, and that her lord would be 
 displeased, heightened the emotion she wished to con- 
 troul. At this moment the pity of Mrs. Caudle swell- 
 ed her feelings beyond all restraint, and with a request 
 to be taken into the air, she sunk into the arms of her 
 officious assistant. 
 
 Though Lady Paulina was occasionally afflicted with 
 hysterics, they proceeded more from outrageous pas- 
 sions than weak spirits, or a real derangement of the 
 nervous system ; and she was particularly careful that 
 no one but her own dependants should see her fine form 
 while affected by these distortions. She well knew 
 that in the case of real disease, the patient is injured 
 by officious attention, and insensible of argument ; and 
 that fresh air, perfect quiet, and time, are the best re- 
 storatives. But the friendship Vvhich she had plighted 
 to the artless Emily did not imply concealing her in- 
 lira.'ities. With an air of intercessive earnestness, she 
 implored Lord Avondel not to be disturbed, as she 
 was sure her dearest Emilia had some cause for this 
 violent emotion ; and she conjured him to hasten to 
 her aid, till he looked round v/ith the embarrassment 
 natural to surprise and vexation. She apologized to 
 the company for her being absorbed by the distress of 
 the dear creature, whose many excellencies atoned — 
 here she sobbed too, held her handkerchief to her eyes, 
 talked of the weakness of human nature, and deter- 
 mined to follow, and be reconciled to her friend. 
 ^'' Alas," said she, turning up her eyes to heaven.

 " that our best and purest intentions should be subject 
 to misapprehension." 
 
 Lady Avondel had just recovered sufficiently to at- 
 tribute her indisposition to heat and fatigue, when Pau- 
 lina, by rushing forward with a request to be forgiven, 
 brought on a fresh paroxysm. " Surely," said the sub- 
 tile Italian, " she abhors me ! What can have caused 
 such a revolution in her opinion ? Hear me, my Emilia, 
 while I swear I had no aim to supplant thee in the af- 
 fections of thy lord. My first wish was to amuse thee, 
 my next to personify thy dear domestic virtues." But 
 Emily was beyond the power of hearing, and Paulina 
 franticly exclaimed, that she was doomed to murder 
 her whom she best loved. 
 
 The pomp of sickness was now spread in its full 
 terrors. The company were told that it was impossible 
 their fair hostess could rejoin them that evening ; me- 
 dical aid was called in ; and after all possible publicity 
 had been given to the- adventure, Lady Avondel was 
 conveyed home to experience the restorative effects of 
 composing medicines on her tremulous frame, and to 
 wake the next morning with such a confused recollec- 
 tion of the past as made her thoroughly ashamed of 
 the behaviour for which she could not account, and 
 fearful that she should never be able to fulfil her in- 
 tentions of not transgressing in this manner again.

 CHAPTER XXI. 
 
 A wife's virtue still surmounts all pride : 
 I come to claim you as my own, to show 
 My duty first to ask, nay, heg your kindness. 
 You hear, my lord, 'tis mine j I love your honour 
 Because 'tis mine. 
 
 Dryden. 
 
 LADY Avondel's confused recollection and placa- 
 ble temper, did not permit her to blame any one but 
 herself; and her first object was to conciliate her lord, 
 whom she feared she had severely mortified. She 
 possessed none of that address that would have ena- 
 bled her to palliate her weakness, to laugh off her ab- 
 surdities, or make her own errors the foundation of an 
 accusation against him, which is undoubtedly the sum- 
 mit of female management. Confession and supplica- 
 tion were the only pacificators she had recourse to, 
 and she trusted, that the generous disposition, which 
 had so ofen overlooked and supported her infirmities, 
 ■would not be implacable to those that were constitu- 
 tional rather than mental. 
 
 She found the earl in a mediating posture, stretched 
 in his arm "chair, his cloudy brow indicating displea- 
 sure, and his eye fixed in a sullen inattention which 
 her appearance did not divert. She expressed her deep 
 concern that she had made him unhappy, and added, 
 that as she was not quite well she would not wait for 
 his inquiries, but came to announce her own recovery. 
 He congratulated her with a most unsympathizing as- 
 pect, and expressed his desire to know, why she thought 
 proper to indulge such an extraordinary emotion ?— 
 The '' blushes of ingenuous shame" which flushed her 
 cheek were quenched by the stei"n disdain of his lord- 
 ship's manner. He had never before appeared inexo-

 rable, and surely being really overcome was not so 
 very unpardonable. 
 
 Collecting a sort of firmness from being more harsh- 
 ly treated than she deserved, the countess answered, 
 that her emotion was involuntary ; and so fur from 
 indulging it, her endeavour to conceal it had subdued 
 her strength. " I was taken by surprise," said she, 
 " and I believe reason has nothing to do with these 
 sudden bursts of feeling." 
 
 " These incessant weaknesses, madam," returned 
 Avondel, '* intimate an inherent imbecility, alike cal- 
 lous to the admonitions of tenderness and reckless of 
 what consequences may follow the exposure of domes- 
 tic secrets. In future, when you are beginning to 
 overcome, as you term it, in public, recollect you are 
 then subjecting my reputation to wanton assassination." 
 " Surely, my lord," said Emily, amazed at such a 
 strange connection of opposite ideas, '* my over sus- 
 ceptibility cannot give an occasion for any reproach to 
 you ? I may be accused of want of fortitude, of un- 
 fitness for the high duties I have undertaken, but even 
 in censuring me they must do you justice. Had not your 
 desert been as unquestionable as my attachment, Lady 
 Paulina never could have so powerfully affected me by 
 assuming the character of a wife and a mother." 
 
 " Assuming, Lady Avondel ! Recollect yourself, 
 and do not prefer the charge of dissimulation against 
 a lady whose ideas are as pure and whose conduct is 
 as correct as your own. You have witnessed her im- 
 passioned tenderness as a mother, and till you see her 
 in the presence of her husband let no illiberal reports 
 to her prejudice induce you to say she does not really 
 feel her sacred duties." 
 
 " My dearest lord," returned Emily, " I have no 
 invidious meaning. I only meant to say, that the part 
 Paulina acted last night was so admirably sustained as 
 to transport me into a passionate reverie, in which I 
 real'sed the drama. I fancied that you were returned 
 home after a long and perilous absence, that^f^^vas 
 telling my own dear Sydney how to know you, and

 that he was become a rosy cherub. Bat when Pau- 
 lina spoke of her anxious solicitude during his illness, 
 I could listen no longer. You know I am very fool- 
 ish. I have watched, wept, and prayed, as she des- 
 cribed." She burst into tears at this sentence, and 
 added, " May he live to inherit your virtues and ho- 
 nours." 
 
 The sweetness of her faultering voice, and the pale- 
 ness of her countenance, indicating at once feebleness 
 and tenderness, subdued the resentment and revived 
 the affections of Lord Avondel. He grasped the 
 trembling hand which courted his pressure, and felt, 
 that though sincerity and meekness seem as defence- 
 less as the lamb, they possess an mvincible power to 
 develope artifice and disarm anger. His unusual dis- 
 pleasure arose from an apprehension, that jealousy was 
 the passion which had brought on his countess's indis- 
 position; and though he considered Paulina as indis- 
 creet in singling him out as her fellow comedian, and 
 adapting an exhibition to his character which might be 
 misconstrued, he allowed much to foreign manners, 
 and the rapid impulse of enthusiastic inspiration height- 
 ened by a latent attachment. He was convinced, no 
 liberal-minded spectator would have suspected crimi- 
 nality in a predilection which even courted publicity, 
 had not Lady Avondel's sobs and shrieks directed 
 them to recollect the untransferable obligation of the 
 marriage vow, and to condemn those who seemed to 
 disregard its most punctilious observance. The inge- 
 nuous tenderness of EmiU' convinced him he had mis- 
 interpreted her feelings. But though he was happily 
 imdeceived, he was persuaded the world would che- 
 rish the less candid explanation. His cooler judg- 
 ment often told him, that Paulina's friendship, like 
 the high-flavoured fruits of the climate which nurtur- 
 ed her ardent character, was delicious and dange^'ous ; 
 but to renounce her now would only confirm the sus- 
 picion, that the attachment had been criminal, though 
 either satiety, Lady Avondel's renewed influence, or 
 the dread of public reproach, had caused au apparent

 or transient reformation. His attentions to Paulina, 
 at first enforced by fear, then allured by pity, vanity, 
 and self-indulgence, now became necessary from 
 the prudential consideration of mutual defence from 
 slander. 'Tis true, he was not at this moment in per- 
 fect charity with her, even setting aside her public 
 caresses as lady baroness. Her attentions to Emily 
 were very officious, and " a lurking devil in her eye'* 
 whispered, that she triumphed in exposing the weak- 
 ness of her friend. But his lofty spirit told him, that 
 it was impossible for an exalted mind not to feel its 
 own superiority, and that nature would discover some 
 satisfaction at witnessing the self-inflicted degradation 
 of those who occupied the station to which the secret 
 aspirations of conscious merit \vere forbidden to ascend. 
 And as to Paulina's being a bad nurse, it did not fol- 
 low that a woman of her talents should know the best 
 way of managing that medical sinecure, a nervous 
 lady. 
 
 Shielded by the invulnerable armour of veracity, 
 Emily was proof to some insnaring questions proposed 
 by her lord respecting the termination of the ballad ; 
 and her extreme regret at hearing that she had so vio- 
 lently agitated Paulina, and prematurely dispersed the 
 
 party, induced her to offer to call that morning in 
 
 street with an apology. It was plain that " the green- 
 eyed monster" had nothing to do with her illntss. — 
 Her pardon was therefore fully confirmed ; my lord's 
 brow relaxed into cheerful blandishment, and he se- 
 cretly acknowledged, that though the graces dance 
 very agreeably, the virtues are most expert at weaving 
 the web of happiness. Breakfast was now served, and 
 as a proof of his mind being tranquillized. Lord 
 Avondel took up the morning paper, for even political 
 anxiety had been suspended by the visitations of do- 
 mestic chagrin. The earl's eye was not turned to the 
 column of fashion. Indeed, at the time I am speak- 
 ing of, such ephemeras as galas, dinners, and balls, 
 did not form the article of public information which is 
 first looked at ; and notwithstanding its never varying

 sameness always delights astonished rustics, and 
 mortifies those unhappy votaries of high ton who 
 are too poor to give banquets, and too obsolete to 
 be asked to partake cf them. Lord Avondel's at- 
 tention was directed to occurrences connected with 
 the honour and safety of his country. But the tide of 
 patriotic reflection was interrupted by reading, tiiat 
 ,the homeward bound India-men were arrived at St. 
 Helena, and that general Ptlonthermer had^ten re- 
 ceived with due distinctions by the governor and gar- 
 rison, and waited there for convoy. For some time 
 the earl had felt uneasy at the recollection of the gen- 
 tral. Honour and conscience taught him to rejoice at 
 his safety, and he was persuaded that the cold thrill he 
 felt at his heart was only anxiety to know how Paulina 
 would l)e affected at his return. The fleet in v,hich he 
 was embarked had long been an object of national con- 
 cern, and it ought to be speedily guarded to the Bri- 
 tish ports. Why then did his knowledge of the sen^ 
 timents which Paulina entertained of her husband 
 make him ruminate on a measure wh;ch might detain 
 him abroad at the price of commercial disadvantages 
 to liis country' Avondel's cheek glowed with shame. 
 Was he indeed a woman's guilty slave ? He threw 
 down the paper, and resolved to desire an audience of 
 the premier to suggest the danger of tampering with 
 public feeling, by delaying to send a powerful escort 
 to secure the expected fleet from the enem.y, who were 
 known to lie in wait for the valuable prize. 
 
 A restoration to her husband's favour had given such 
 a fillip to Emih's spirits, that she felt no unwillingness 
 to iTiake the desired concessions to Paulina. Her lord 
 had told her that she was extremely to blame, that she 
 had furnished conversation for the town, spoiled a 
 pleasant evening, and made her friend unhappy. It 
 seemed odd all these consequences should result from 
 her being unwell. What amusement could the world 
 find in an hysterical aff"ection ? or why should her 
 friend be so much alarmed at what she knew was a 
 frequent complaint ? But as her dearest husband,

 though he forgave her, still thought she had been very 
 wrong, she would, like Claudio's Juliet, 
 
 " Repent her as it was a fault, 
 " And take the shame with joy." 
 
 Though Paulina knew the gentle frame of Emily- 
 was tenated by a mind as placable, she did not expect 
 to see her at her morning toilette. Anxiety for the 
 lovely creature's sufferings had not so fully occupied 
 her thoughts, as to prevent her from receiving an 
 early visitor, before the return of the messenger whom 
 she sent into Berkley-Square, to know how the plot 
 thickened. The gay Lord Norbury never permitted 
 a star to rise in the horizon of fashion without watch- 
 ing its circumvolutions, and his observations were the 
 more diligent as he discovered Avondel was its ac- 
 knowledged centre. He could plead a very juvenile 
 acquaintance with Paulina at Florence, but probably 
 the lady would not have admitted this as a sufficient 
 sanction to silence her avowed chariness on the point 
 of male visitors, had not his lordship possessed the 
 only accomplishment in which his political rival was 
 deficient, the art of flattery. 'Tis true, his praises 
 were too general and lavish to please a nice palate, but 
 every one knows th.-it, in this instance, taste soon be- 
 comes appetite, and voraciousness gives a zest to the 
 coarsest food. Besides, Norbury had once been inti- 
 mate with the Avondels. Something mysterious hung 
 over their rupture, which had ended in open aversion 
 on one side, and cool contempt on the other. She 
 doubted not her blandishments would soon worm the 
 secret out of him, which might be held in terrorem 
 over Emily, or furnish another clue to unravel the 
 heart of Avondel. 
 
 In the midst of a very lively conversation, in 
 which Norbury was stalking upon the stilts of 
 rapture, and Paulina was reproaching him with bes- 
 towing upon her the shreds and patches of that com- 
 plimentary wit which he had worn to tatters in the

 service of the young countess, the latter was announc- 
 ed, and entered, surprised at interrupting a tete-a-tete, 
 and perhaps mortified at not discovering in her friend's 
 countenance that extreme sympathy of which she had 
 heard so much. Nothing could be more mal-apropos 
 than this visit at first appeared. But Paulina had suf- 
 ficient dexterity to make it turn to a good account. — ' 
 She clasped Emily in her arms, vowed a hecatomb to 
 the powers who preside over friendship for her reco- 
 very, and gently blaming Avondel for allowing her to 
 indulge her native benignity till her health was more 
 reinstated. She asked her permission to present her 
 to a nobleman who had the goodness to renew the ac- 
 quaintance they had formed at Florence. Norbury 
 made a distant bow, and Emily courtesied as at a first 
 introduction, yet vi^ondering Paulina should suppose 
 they could be strangers, as she must know the political 
 situation in which he stood with her lord. Her cold 
 reserved manner, and the studied non-chalance of 
 Noibury, confirmed in Paulina those suspicions which 
 the guilty love to harbour against those whose virtue 
 silently rebukes their misdeeds ; and she enjoyed the 
 confusion of the supposed criminals. She then bade 
 Norbury, as her professed knight, instantly relieve 
 the town from the anxiety it suffered on the fair count- 
 ess's account, by affirming that he had seen her in all 
 the glow of recovered beauty, and adding, that she 
 would expedite his zeal by an anticipated reward ; 
 she seized the hand of Emily and presenting it to 
 him, he pressed it to his lips and retired. His look 
 of profound devotion, and her angry confusion, af- 
 forded Paulina a pleasure which she had never before 
 perceived at discovering a passion of which she herself 
 was not the object. The resentment of the countess, 
 who almost saw a violation of her conjugal purity in 
 this freedom, furnished the Italian with ample food 
 for raillery. She fixed her eyes on her blushing friend, 
 and tok! her, that she was so far conversant with Eng- 
 lish manners as to be convinced she v/as only surprised 
 and angry at the gallantry of an entire sstranger.—

 " But," said she, " had Florence been the scene, I 
 should have interpreted your prudery so differently as 
 to be assured, that if Norbury was a discarded, he still 
 was the favourite cicisbeo." 
 
 The perfect delicacy of Emily's mind made her 
 shrink with horror from the idea of exciting a crimi- 
 nal passion, instead of exulting in the power of her 
 charms. So far from wishing any one should hear of 
 her triumph, she heartily. wished she could forget what 
 gave her such extreme pain, but as she deemed Nor- 
 bury a dangerous acquaintance to a woman in Pauli- 
 na's situation, she thought it was the duty of friend- 
 ship to warn her against such an inmate. Thus inno- 
 cence and candour influenced her to adopt the very 
 mode of conduct effrontery and jealousy would have 
 preferred, and Paulina eagerly clung to the persuasion, 
 that the English lady, supposed to be the personifica- 
 tion of chastity, had exceeded herself in guilt, and 
 added personal impurity to alienation of the affections. 
 She gravely thanked her for her cautions to beware of 
 a professed libertine, " but," she observed, " slander 
 is very busy, and we often cannot distinguish truth 
 from falsehood. If you only know Norbury by i-eport, 
 are you not in danger of measuring his good name by 
 the standard of his enemies V 
 
 Emily now owned that he had visited in the fiimily, 
 and that Lord Avondel, whose judgment could not be 
 implicated, had found it expedient to decline his ac- 
 quaintance. "• On political or personal motives ?" en- 
 quired Paulina. " Ah, my Emilia, your perturbation 
 increases ; you will have another attack. Cruel, or 
 rather thoughtless, Avondel, to permit you to leave 
 your chamber till you were quite recovered. Or say, 
 have j-ou eloped without his permission ? and was the 
 favour of this early call designed for me or Norbury?" 
 Emily thought Lady Caddy herself could not have 
 uttered a more irritating speech, but recollecting that 
 she hud just experienced how unable her physical 
 strength was to contend with strong emotion, she re- 
 solved to get rid of a subject to which Paulina affixed

 SO much painful meaning. ." I see," said she smiling, 
 *' you think you can banter me with as much effect 
 this morning as you overpowered me by your tragic 
 graces last night ; but I am now on my guard, and it 
 is one purpose of my visit, after thanking you for your 
 sympathizing anxiety, to tell you, that I know my own 
 weakness so well I will never more commit myself to 
 the mercy of such an able professor of the histrionic 
 art. Therefore, dear Paulina, when you wish to de- 
 picture the stronger emotions of love and duty, send 
 me out of the room, as a tender parent would a timid 
 girl when the conversation turns on cruel murders." 
 
 Let me understand your request," said the Italian 
 lady, " Is it the exhibition of love or of duty that you 
 wish to avoid?" Emily answered, they were so blend- 
 ed in her mind that she knew not how to distinguish 
 their properties. Paulina heaved a forbidden sigh, but 
 unable to endure the language of self-reproach she 
 bade the countess attend to their distinguishing traits, 
 and burst into the following impromptu ; 
 
 LOVE AND DUTY. 
 
 Wandering swain, didst thou survey 
 On a prancing courser gay 
 
 A maid triumphant move ? 
 By hei* side a sportive boy, 
 *" Redolent of youth" and joy— 
 
 'Tis the cavalcade of Love. 
 
 Tfell me didst thou also view. 
 On a steed of sable hue, 
 
 A reluctant beauty ? 
 Near her walks a piilmer sage. 
 Grim with travel, bent with age ; — 
 
 'Tis tlie cavalcade of Duty. 
 
 Round Love's votress laughing pleasures 
 Gaily dance in wanton measures, 
 
 S yiphs their painted pinions wave : — 
 Chiiiing doubts, presaging terrors. 
 Groups of sorrows, hosts of errors, 
 
 Silent pace by Duty's slaves

 And bless the reign of Love. 
 
 Lady Avondel thanked her friend for this lively ef- 
 fusion of fancy, and expressed a wish, that every in- 
 tended victim of conntibial avarice, every silly girl in- 
 fatuated with some unworthy coxcomb, and every mer- 
 cenary parent who forged ciiains for his children, would 
 consider that some minds require an additional restraint 
 besides the influence of obligation. " But for us, Pau- 
 lina," added she, " whose happy lot it is to be accom- 
 panied through life by the amiable genii as well as the 
 cautious palmer, we have only to mingle pitv for the 
 unfortunate with exultation at our happy lot/' 
 
 There was more of preconsideration in this remark 
 than accorded with the usual style of Emily's conver- 
 sation, which did not escape Paulina's discernment. 
 Anxious to draw her into a confession which she fan- 
 cied trembled upon her tongue, she boldly avowed her- 
 self to be the wretched slave of the palmer. An ex- 
 pression of such profound distress accompanied this 
 acknowledgment, that Emily immediately felt all the 
 resentment her former impertinence had excited sub- 
 side in pity, and she was not only inclined to overlook the 
 extravagance by which a mind ill at ease seeks to es- 
 cape from ruminating on its cureless sorrows, but be-

 came anxious to counsel and condole with one who la- 
 boured under what she deemed the only insupportable 
 affliction, connubial disgust. 
 
 " My dear Paulina," said Emily, gently pressing 
 her clasped hands,- and with soothing blandishment 
 wiping the reluctant tears which seemed to indicate 
 pride, grief, and shame, " I need not remind you, that 
 those who are uniformly guided by duty are never 
 miserable, though perhaps not absolutely happy. Do 
 I give you more pain by entering on this sad subject f" 
 
 Paulina continued to weep, but replied, that a free 
 discussion of her woes gave some relief to her bursting 
 heart. " I have endeavoured, continued she, " to di- 
 vert my wretchedness by assumed gaiety, but I am 
 now informed, Monthermer will speedily be in Eng- 
 land, and my anguish is insupportable. The dangerous 
 part of his voyage is over." 
 
 Lady Avondel inwardly shuddered, that a wife 
 should feel insupportable anguish from the assurance 
 of her husband's safety ; that a mother should by im- 
 plication acknowledge she wished her son an orphan : 
 and that the infallible Avondel could only see merit 
 and honour in such a woman was astonishing. He 
 could not know her real character, and Emily thought 
 it would be uncandid to inform him of an expression 
 which perhaps was the unweighed eifusion of a proud 
 spirit shrinking from apprehended controul, rather than 
 the premeditated desire of a malignant fiend. She 
 therefore begged Paulina to be calm, and observed 
 Lord Avondel always spoke most respectfully of the 
 general. 
 
 " Tell me, thou saintly pattern of connubial virtue," 
 said the Italian, " is it a wife's province to blazon her 
 husband's faults ? Would you disclose to an envious 
 and inquisitive world the crimes of your Avondel ? 
 Nay, even his little infirmities, the waywardness of his 
 temper, the coldness with which he treats your ever 
 fond attentions, the rebukes, which I have seen your 
 patient gentleness sustain"—

 "' Lady Paulina," interrupted Emily, " you are too 
 nice an observer in my case, and therefore I suspect 
 you are also in your own. My dear lord, wise as he 
 is good, only checks my fondness when it becomes ri- 
 diculous, and reproves my weakness to make me more 
 worthy of his esteem. He married me when I was an 
 inexperienced girl, without one recommendation but 
 my ardent admiration of excellence, as exemplified in 
 him. It is impossible but that I must continually of- 
 fend so nice a judge of what is estimable, but his 
 goodness pardons me. Probably he may have some 
 small portion of human infirmities, but I sincerely pro- 
 test that I have such full employment in discovering 
 and lamenting my own, that I have never yet perceived 
 any thing in his character which admits of improve- 
 ment." 
 
 Paulina gazed on Emily's countenance, which, en- 
 lightened by the blended rays of tenderness, diffidence, 
 and sincerity, possessed angelic beauty. " My friend," 
 said she, with insidious tenderness " your pure and ex- 
 alted sentiments confirm the opinion I have always en- 
 tertained of the superior generosity of our sex. You

 patience and honour, and bid him at least revere the 
 virtue which he does not imitate." 
 
 " My lord," returned Emily, *' need not come to my 
 school to learn any virtues." 
 
 " Not the theory, I grant," answered Paulina, " but 
 the most eloquent lecturers are often the worst profi- 
 cients." She paused a moment, and looking at the 
 countess, asked if it were better to excite a husband's 
 terror by our violence, or his contempt by our passive 
 submission ? 
 
 " Submission," answered Emily, " is enjoined by 
 such sacred authority that our acquiescence can only 
 excite contempt in those husbanJs who are so very illi- 
 beral, or so very worthless, that no conclusion should 
 be drawn from their sentiments." 
 
 " Enjoy thy delightful dieam, fond idolater of an 
 imaginary paragon," replied Paulina, " yet blame not

 thy more discerning friend, who discovers deformity 
 under the state mantle of thy deified tyrant. But 
 know, Monthermer has none of that fastidiousness 
 which thy blind love will not discern in Avondel. He 
 sees in me only personified perfection, and while I des- 
 pise his imbecility I know I reign over his heart with 
 unbounded sovereignty. He never uttered a complaint 
 of n^y conduct, nor even gave to another that confidence 
 and esteem of which he deemed me unworthy." 
 
 Emily was saved the pain of a reply by the appear- 
 ance of company, and the conversation ended at the 
 point Paulina wished. She had not been able to draw 
 from Emily a word or a look derogatory to matronly 
 honour, whether considered as attachment to her lord's 
 person or respect for his fame j hut she had communi- 
 cated to her mind an apprehension that her rectitude 
 was not returned by equal singleness of heart, and that 
 her entire admiration scarcely met with the decency of 
 cold approbation. Was it candid of her husband to 
 complain of her to Paulina ! She had ever been grate- 
 ful for his private reproofs, but to give publicity to her 
 follies was not the way to reform them. But her fears 
 and her feelings had made her very troublesome, and 
 perhaps he had murmured his displeasure in a moment 
 of irritation, to which Paulina had cruelly affixed too 
 much meaning. She had piqued her by obliquely cen- 
 suring her conduct and sentiments, and though she 
 must admit the maliciousness of thus repeating, and 
 doubtless magnifying, her lord's transient deviation 
 from perfect rectitude, it did not become one who 
 knew her own propensity to err to be too rigorous in 
 marking the faults of others. She felt she could not 
 now love Paulina, because such starts of passion made 
 her unhappy in her compan}-. Yet, she would forgive 
 and pity, nay try to comfort her. But in one resolution 
 she would be firm, to extract by a laudable alchymy 
 some advantage to herself out of these dark sugges- 
 tions, that her dearest lord might never more have 
 cause to complain, of finding his home a turbid ocean 
 of petty cares, when the toil-worn statesman sought it 
 as an asylum from the harassing duties of public life.

 THE philosophists of the present age having trans- 
 ferred the' law of liberty of choice from things in which 
 opinion may innocently decide, to what is in its own 
 nature fixed and definite, some well-disposed persons 
 have apprehended, not only that Christianity would be 
 superseded by some new and happier discovery, but, 
 that the exploded superstition of heathenism would be 
 revived. Though no one can be more sensible oi" the 
 danger which is to be apprehended from the universal 
 adoption of the maxim, that every human being is free 
 to select his religion without hazard of present incon- 
 venience or future responsibility, I conless 1 have too 
 much dependence on the inventive talents of my co- 
 temporaries to fear a reinauguration of the deities of 
 the 0/d Pantheon. Even if force or flattery should 
 renev/ the Olympic games, and era in Ionia, I am per- 
 suaded that the imitative arts would never do more 
 than support the fascinating personages of mythology 
 as gods of the imagination, and symbolical representa- 
 tives of their peculiar attributes, wliere I conceive they 
 may lawfully remain without any hazard of corrupting 
 our morals or bewildering our faith, at least so long as 
 we retain sufficient judgment to distinguish acknow- 
 ledged fiction from confirmed facts, and amusements 
 from commands.

 But I am not going to surrender the old woman's 
 privilege of foreseeing evils. I also predict the intro- 
 duction of an idolatory more universal than that of the 
 court of Jove or the brutish gods of the Nile, in their 
 best days of popularity. While self-love and vanity 
 have such numerous votaries, we need not fear wor- 
 shipping lizards and serpents, unless we consider them 
 as emblems of deceit, nor of bowing down to any calf 
 except a golden one. My fear is, that in a few years, 
 the world will have as many gods and goddesses as it 
 has inhabitants ; and that we shall discover ourselves 
 to be fearfully and wonderfully made, not with a view 
 to give glory to our creator, but with such admiration 
 of our own energies and talents, that forgetting our 
 sister the worm and our fellow servants the angelic 
 host, we shall soon vault from the rank of creatures 
 into that of self-existing beings ; thus, confounding 
 mechanical skill with creative faculties, and reason 
 with omniscience, we shall suppose, because we know 
 and can perform much, that nothing is beyond our 
 ability to execute. 
 
 I own that this persuasion, applied to moral purpo- 
 ses, and elevated by the conviction of supernatural 
 assistance, was found amazingly stimulative by an ex- 
 traordinary race of beings, who, (it is reported) were 
 contented to endure not only poverty, pain and dis- 
 grace, but even death itself, rather than consent to do 
 what they called a sinful action. This obsolete phrase 
 is so very dissimilar to unpleasant, unwholesome, un- 
 fashionable, stupid, tireson^e, or any other epithet by 
 which we express insurmountable repugnance, that I 
 know not how to dtfine it, and can only say, that let 
 sin mean what it might, it was a bug-bear which has 
 hiippily disappeared with the other goblins and phan- 
 toms that have been dispelled by the astonishing re- 
 fulgence of genius that has lately burst upon the world. 
 Now, though the singular enthusiasts who pretended 
 such anxiety to avoid this scare-crow, really did per- 
 form super-human actions, and appeared not only 
 blameless, undefiled, and actively benevolent, but

 were able to invert the order of nature, and dispensed 
 temporal blessings as well as wise instructions to their 
 auditors ; they never insinuated that they were dei- 
 ties. On the contrary, while they healed diseases with 
 a touch, and suspended the active properties of the 
 elements, they always spoke of themselves as frail, 
 weak and mortal men, dignified only by being servants 
 of that God from whom they professed to receive all 
 their natural and extraordinary endowments. 
 
 In the present age we are so liberal as to pity these 
 pci-secuted fanatics ; and as there seems no good 
 ground for accusing them of being ambitious or ava- 
 ricious hypocrites, we candidly suppose, that they 
 were prevented from converting their endowments into 
 instruments of self-aggrandisement by a perplexing 
 sophist, named religion, who was continually telling 
 them that all their virtues and excellencies, all their 
 properties of mind and body, were entrusted talents, 
 of which they were merely the accountable stewards ; 
 and that instead of being ennobled and even deified 
 by being appointed to an extraordinary trust, this larger 
 share of faculties imposed upon them a more fearful 
 responsibility. Thus they trembled lest they should 
 incur the punishment of misapplication, instead of 
 glorying that they were wiser and better than other 
 people. 
 
 Before these singular beings called upon the world 
 to acknowledge the strength of meekness, the dignitv 
 of liumility, and the abundance of povertv, another 
 self-denying race of men flourished, whose existence, 
 like the mamuioth's, we are compelled to admit by 
 discovering their visible remains. These people cer- 
 tainly were rot destitute of a sense of their own im- 
 portance, and in this they resembled the demi-gods of 
 the present age ; but then their self-regard was of a 
 most quiescent nature, and might rather be called ad- 
 miration than love. For they seemed to desire neither 
 riches, honours, nor pleasures, which are very sub- 
 stantial food, but fixed their inclinations upon a gossa- 
 mer sort of substance called reputation, which we now

 know is quite worthless, since the ablest chemists 
 have not found it convertible into houses, lands, goods, 
 titles, or even into routs, ^alas, or great dinners, 
 though these latter articles, by proper dilation, may 
 be spun out in'o this same gossamer. My dear fash- 
 ionable reader, 1 really am serious v-hen I tell you, 
 that the ancients I am speaking of fought, toiled, me- 
 ditated, and sviuered, not for their own private emolu- 
 ment, but for the good of their country. Now, as the 
 persuasion that myriads are of more importance than 
 an individual, and that it is more desiralDle to make a 
 nation prosperous than ourselves great, is incompatible 
 Avith an inordinate degree of self love, the idolatry 
 which I foresee could not then have been the reigning 
 religion, or at least such men as Phocion, Aristides, 
 CaiTjillus, Cincinnatus, &cc. must have been notorious 
 heretics, v;hich v.'as not in those times the direct road 
 to celebrity. Nor would contemporary historians have 
 cast such a lustre on their hetqrodox conduct as still 
 serves to reflect a temporary brightness on young 
 statesmen and popular declaimers, -who often persuade 
 their admirers, that the souls of these worthies have 
 transmigrated into their persons. The age which truly 
 appreciates the value of learning, cannot be profoundly 
 ignorant, and we must admit that it requires some 
 general habit of disinterestedness to discover those 
 stern and retiring virtues which scorn the tinsel of bor- 
 rowed ornament and lucrative distinctions. 
 
 I know liiany affirm, that virtue and vice, or as they 
 choose to say, beneficial and hurtful qualities, are like 
 the medium by which they act, solely of a physical 
 nature, depending upon soil and situation, or (to grant 
 the most to anci-materialists) created by different forms 
 of government and modes of life. Thus they say 
 China breeds cowardice and duplicity as naturally as 
 a morass does rushes, and that an Arab steals and a 
 German drinks on the same principles as a mushroom 
 springs out of a bed of fermenting manure. It is a lit- 
 tle u.nfortunate for this system of botanizing moral 
 qualities, that Greece and Italy, the native soil of ge-

 nius and glory, n'hich gave birth to men who emulat- 
 ed the actions ascribed to demi-gods, while they re- 
 nounced the comforts of ordinary life, afterwards 
 produced others who were the first introducers of that 
 selfish system of idolatry which I deprecate; and not 
 only persuaded themselves, but brought the world to 
 acknowledge their divinity on no better pretence than 
 that their passions were diabolically inordinate and 
 their humom-s extravagantly mischievous. The cha- 
 racters of these self-created deities increase my appre- 
 hensions, for as men have founded their right to an 
 apotheosis on the ground of their fiddling as well as 
 Apollo, being as intemperate as Bacchus, as gross as 
 Silenus, and as knavish as IMercury, what have we to 
 expect from the prominent attributes of those -who are 
 now most clamorous in demanding a place in the mo- 
 dern Pantheon of immortals, either as resplendent 
 geniuses, choice spirits, rising characters, or whatever 
 appellative may best describe that independent mind 
 which adopts as its motto, " Better to reign in Hell 
 than serve in Heaven !" 
 
 I have been led into these reflections by observing 
 what universal currency is given to the phrase " The 
 divinity of talent ;" and this not merely in poetry, 
 where hyperbole is allowable, but in those sober com- 
 positions, in which these exaggerations look as awk- 
 ward as a foil embroidery upon a linsey-'ivoolsey petti- 
 coat. Some of my friends, to divert the spleen v/hich 
 this idolatrous appellation constantly excites, call my 
 attention to the self-denying benevolence of those who 
 are so anxious to maintain this doctrine, observing, that 
 if I read their compositions with attention, I must be 
 convinced that they renounce all claim to the advan- 
 tages of their system, by publishing a certificate of 
 their own incapacity to be deified, which must remain 
 valid till their labours are removed from the back ware- 
 house of their publishers, and again submitted to the 
 regenerating mill of the paper-maker. But, though I 
 allow very little divinity either in a theological or clas- 
 sical sense, is to be found in these formularies of mo-

 dern paganism, I am by no means sure that the authors 
 of them are totally destitute of the buoyant spirit of 
 vanity derived from that accursed fruit which first in- 
 flamed the human intellect with false conceptions of 
 greatness. The consecrating unction which they be- 
 stow on works of the same standard with their own, 
 gives us to understand, that they have no objection to 
 receiving the same favour, and even implies a hope 
 that they shall be anointed with the very oil of which 
 they are so liberal to others. In the course of my life, 
 I have seen authors who, though they set out at first 
 with the most self denying modesty, as they waxed 
 warm in their literary carter, grew tired of waiting 
 for the slow return of regular payment which the trade 
 of mutual encomium usually brings in, and therefore 
 in their fifth or sixth pamphlet quickened the discern- 
 inent of their readers by plainly telling them, that they 
 possessed a very considerable portion of that Prome- 
 thean fire which turns geniuses into gods. To say any 
 thing derogatory of people who thus perch themselves 
 on their pedestals in the pantheon of talent would be 
 as mad, nay as impious, an attempt as the crime of 
 Lycurgus, for next to a drunken Bacchanal an offended 
 author, when " full of the god," must be considered 
 RS the most formidable of animals. Whoever, there- 
 fore, choose to say they are conscious of this latent di- 
 vinity, may take as large a share of it as they think 
 proper to claim. 
 
 If this deification of talent were confined to the sons 
 and daughters of Pheebus, I would have held my 
 peace, for on a moderate computation we should have 
 only had about fifty thousand gods and goddesses, even 
 including the subordinate genii, nymphs, fawns, and 
 household lares, who only read manuscript travels and 
 poems to their friends, or write journals of their own 
 adventures. There would still have remained in Eng- 
 land nine million nine hundred and fifty thousand men 
 and women to burn incense in the temple of genius, 
 and I question whether our deities would be more 
 numerous than those of Rome, Greece, Egypt, and

 Other enlightened nations, before the intolerant spirit of 
 Christianity prescribed unity of worship to the great 
 detriment of mankind. But genius is a very Proteus, 
 and takes many other forms besides that of an author ; 
 and we have only to cast our eyes over the advertise- 
 ments in a daily paper to recognize it alternately in the 
 birth-day ornaments of a duchess, and the superior 
 polish of an ingenious shoe-black, in the speeches of a 
 peer and the puff of a quack-doctor. 
 
 Though very partial to my kinsfolk in Grub-street, 
 I do not see why the inventor of a chymical liquid for 
 taking stains out of table-cloths is not as great a bene- 
 factor to the public, and therefore has as much of the 
 divine essence in him, as the fabricator of a satire, or a 
 novel formed out of the shreds and rags of worn-out 
 slanders made into a fool's coat to fit some person of 
 notoriety. I can even admit, that the mechanic who 
 invents an engine to save lives and abridge labour, has 
 as fair a title to immortality, as the worthy gentlemen 
 who so laboriously eniploy their quills to prove that 
 nothing can preserve us from a political apoplexy, but 
 allowing people to talk treason with impunity, and who 
 thus aot only discover, but administer the invigorating 
 nostrum. 
 
 I know I go very far in the liberality of my senti- 
 ments on these points. If I were called upon to de- 
 cide, whether the lame sailor v/ho carries his shew-box 
 at his back from fair to fair, and convinces the wonder- 
 ing rustics that one Englishman can knock down a 
 score of Frenchmen bj' the action of his puppets, or 
 the newspaper panegyrist of Napoleon, were the great- 
 er character, I should prefer Jack, and even insist that 
 he had a larger portion of those virtuous energies to 
 which the consent of ages has annexed the term god-like. 
 And yet the eulogist always affects to found his admi- 
 ration of his hero on the patronage which he affords to 
 talents of every description, and obliquely intimates 
 that though his amor patrise fixes him in a garret on 
 the banks of the Thames, where his midnight lamp 
 flames like a comet, to shew the danger and downfal of

 England ; yet if he could but bring himself to emi- 
 grate to the pleasant borders of the Seine, the sacred 
 effulgence of his genius would soon attract imperial 
 attention. Now, though my John Bull prejudices 
 make me not very anxious about preserving the breed 
 of these extraoi'dinanj patriots, a wish to save a few by 
 way of curiosity, induces me to advise, that they would 
 not all fly to this mighty Mecfenas till they can take 
 with them a large supply of the immortalizing elixir, 
 which was pi-omised a few years ago : or at least some 
 boxes of the fair Princess Isabella's balsam,* which 
 Ariosto tells us was famous for sticking on heads after 
 they had been decapitated. For though the munificent 
 Napoleon is very fond of talent when it is obedient and 
 docile, he does not take ill-manners with so much good 
 humour as that gothic disregarder of conscious merit, 
 George the third, and as he is apt to practice a little 
 poisoning, suffocating, and beheading, without exercis- 
 ing the god-like power of bringing the people to life 
 again, it will be better for them to consider ere it is too 
 late, that though a volcano looks very bright at a dis- 
 tance, its crater does not afford a safe convenient resi- 
 dence. 
 
 The eulogiums which are bestowed on this colossal 
 compendium of extraordinary talents, justify me in 
 considering the French emperor as a fair standard of 
 what the idolaters of genius mean when they apply 
 superlative encomiums to great abilities. I have been 
 an observer of this phenomenon ever since he laid 
 bare the sword of slaughter and raised the banner of 
 devastation, and I confess I discern nothing in him 
 which merits the epithet divine. Nor can I conceive 
 that the age would become happier, wiser, better, or 
 nobler, if great men generally conformed to his exam- 
 ple. I shall be accused of want of taste in preferring 
 homely equity to the generoity of giving what is not 
 our ovv'n ; yet I had rather want a national museum 
 than plunder another country of its treasures. I find 
 a charm in moderation, and a comfort in security ; and

 I confess I am terrified by the glorious convulsion of 
 a political earthquake which is more likely to over- 
 whelm my little patrimony, and despoil me of the 
 comforts my industry has acquired, than to transplant 
 to my fields the standing vineyards and olive grounds 
 of my next neighbour. It certainly may be very de- 
 lightful to live in a country of poets, artists, and wits; 
 to see marble statues instead of mile-stones ; to have 
 every sign-post decorated with the labours of modern 
 Raphaels ; and instead of meeting my own kindred, 
 the Homespuns, to visit Sapphos, and play at chess 
 with Solons. But while we have the example of a 
 whole nation, whose improvement in the arts is mark- 
 ed by a retrogade motion in morality, where scienc® 
 flourishes and manners grow corrupt, I feel no anxiety 
 for that anticipated era when universal patronage is to 
 call forth universal talent. I grant, that in the event 
 of every Bufo having his Bavius, I should at least 
 give up my lodgings at Danbury and become mistress 
 of a genteel establishment; but then my oddities would 
 be less attractive, and the comforts of a close carriage 
 and service of plate v/ould hardly compensate for the 
 incessant labour of adulatory composition, or the vex- 
 ation I should feel at seeing a clumsier eulogist pro- 
 moted to a better sinecure, or retained by a less voi'a- 
 cious patron. Much as I have simpathized in the pa- 
 thetic complaint of the arts, languishing for the want 
 of encouragement in England, or tracing these groans 
 to their source, and considering the real pretensions of 
 those who utter them, I have consoled myself with be- 
 lieving, that genius and the sciences never produce 
 better fruit than when left to the care of liberty, inde- 
 pcnt»ence, emulation, and honest industrj'. If you 
 force the soil with superabundant manure, it will bear 
 the parasitical creepers, slander, adulation, and servili- 
 ty ; or such intoxicating exci-escences as inflated style, 
 unmeaning declamation, and meretricious ornament, 
 instead of the wholesome plants of truth, chaste inven- 
 tion, and useful knowledge. Need I add, that these

 latter productions are those which bestow immortality 
 on the artist and the patron, and give a high tone of 
 feeling to the nation in which they abound. 
 
 I often think that these warm advocates, who are so 
 loud in requiring splendid patronage for the muses and 
 the arts, and in their zeal for their remuneration, pro- 
 fess themselves indifferent by whom they are reward- 
 ed, or what they are required to perform, act like bra- 
 voes rather than lovers ; and are more anxious to have 
 their mistresses well paid than to preserve their repu- 
 tation. No legitimate alliance ever took place between 
 the daughters of Harmonia and Plutus ; and whether 
 they used the " flute, the lyre, or the shell," they uni- 
 formly began their songs with an abjuration of venal 
 influence. This indeed was unnecessary ; for the least 
 cultivated ear would tell by the sound of the harp, 
 whether it was strung v/ith golden wire. We all know 
 Pegasus turned restive even under the management of 
 Dryden and Milton, when they attempted to load the 
 generous beast with such unwieldy rubbish, as pane- 
 gyrics on the hypocritical traitor, Cromwell, or the vo- 
 luptuous profligate, Charles. That keen susceptibility of 
 whatever is great and noble, which accompanies true 
 talent, cannot have its perceptions quickened by the 
 arbitrary imposition of a prescribed subject, or a bribe 
 which bids it employ falsehood and flattery as the por- 
 ters of invention. 
 
 If we search history we shall find, that this affected 
 patronage of genius has be^n the resort of those dar- 
 ing villams who united foresight and prudence to am- 
 bition and cruelty, and hoped to gain that reflected ap- 
 plause from the merit of others, which they were con- 
 scious would be deni'id to their own actions, when ^im- 
 ply stated by the pen of truth. In this they shewed 
 their wisdom : the reputation for taste and liberality 
 has supplied the total want of other estimable quali- 
 ties, and the veil which noble-minded integrity dis- 
 dains to use, has concealed many a conspirator and ty- 
 rant from opprobrium. , Wolsey and Louis' the four-

 teenth,* courted and obtained literary praise by their 
 munificence ; Clarendon and Walsingham coldly trust- 
 ed their fame to the justice of the nation whom they 
 faithfully served. 
 
 I use the term " affected patronage ;" for, in spite 
 of some apparent authorities to the contrary, I retain 
 my opinion, that as superior excellence in the fine arts 
 must proceed from exquisite moral perception in the 
 artist, so the real lovers of these enchanting records of 
 what is great and good must be stimulated to admira- 
 tion by a correpondent passion for true eminence. It 
 is the heaven appointed office of genius to record the 
 deeds of honour and virtue ; and if mistake, or some 
 base motive, induce her wayward hand to fix a tyrant 
 in the shrine of a hero, or to adorn a traitor with the 
 glory of a patriot, still homage is paid to virtue and 
 honour, by borrowing their splendour for cruelty and 
 guilt. But when the lives of the patrons and profes- 
 sors are in direct contradiction to the nature of the 
 profession, we rarely meet with the higher kinds of 
 eminence in the artist, and we may, without illiberali- 
 ty suppose vanity and cunning instead of taste and feel- 
 ing were the motives of the patron. The vigorous pen 
 of the dissipated Savage could paint the hideousness 
 of vice, but he fails when he attempts to delineate the 
 delicate st-nsations of virtue ; and it is remarked that 
 gross manners seldom produce any thing beyond a 
 satirist or a painter of broad humour and grotesque 
 scenes. 
 
 With respect to patrons, can v.e suppose that Philip 
 of Macedon really admired the orators and artists 
 whom he bribed to assist him in his attempt to subju- 
 gate Athens ? The cruel dissolute Sylla pretended to 
 honour the sciences, but can we believe that he delight-,

 losophy, or the humanizing injunction of ethics ; the 
 one describing the beauty and usefulness of a world 
 which he had laid waste, the other the necessity of 
 subduing those bloody and inordinate passions to which 
 he sacrificed the lives of others, and ultimately his 
 own ? This man's myrmidons, bewildered by the glare 
 of success, might persuade themselves that " Sylla the 
 fortunate" was " Sylla the great ;" but time has aveng- 
 ed the wrongs of truth, and has saved nothing from 
 oblivion but the remembrance of his enormities. 
 
 Is patronage, then, of no service to literature and 
 the arts ? Yes, of the utmost importance, when it con- 
 duces to the education of youth, endows those frugal 
 but respectable sinecures which foster lettered ease, or 
 rewards eminent exertions in the cause of virtue, with 
 that unostentations liberality which remunerated the 
 Christian Sage,* and gave competence to his declining 
 years ; " not for what he was expected to do, but for 
 what he already had done." In this, and many other 
 instances, which the present I'eign aflbrds, experience 
 testifies, that integrity in the protector and protected is 
 the most direct road to reputation and decent suffi- 
 ciency. These I hold to be the rewards to which ta- 
 lent may lawfully aspire. There is a respectability in 
 honest disinterestedness that disarms the fiends of par- 
 ty, and the uneducated mind, which often feels itself at 
 a loss to reconcile the crooked windings of deep po- 
 licy and refined speculation, with the rule of right, can 
 imderstand'and reverence the simplicity of plain deal- 
 ing. Include as much of natural and acquired talent 
 as you please in the composition of a great man, or a 
 great wit, I have no objection to these delightful ad- 
 juncts ; I only insist that virtue and honesty must be 
 the staple commodities or you fabricate a poison in- 
 stead of a blessing. The more knowledge, foresight, 
 penetration, acuteness and energy, which virtue and 
 honour possess, the more do they resemble Divine Pro-

 vidence ; but wicked wisdom armed with power is 
 that " sword of the Lord" which is drawn to punish 
 offending nations. We may acknowledge its might 
 and fear its chastisement, but to worship it is really 
 like the Indian adoration of the devil and the rattle- 
 snake, a superstition so absurd that it never could gain 
 votaries but in times when success is impiously invest- 
 ed with omnipotent honours. Confused by an extraor- 
 dinary course of events, and accustomed only to con- 
 template second causes, we see in the object of our 
 admiration and terror not an instrument in the hand of 
 God, but a mighty being whose extraordinary powers 
 have made him great and terrible, and thus in the com- 
 mon course of reflection we transfer our veneration for 
 the triumphant Napoleon to the supposed means of his 
 elevation, and in proportion to his renown the standard 
 of moral feeling is lowered. 
 
 Let us now direct our attention to the political anta- 
 gonist, and, (as far as respects ourselves successful op- 
 ponent) of this man's designs, who has been continually 
 reproached with not cultivating the arts of peace and 
 security, while he was required to preserve a menaced 
 empire, exposed to every species of assault which pow- 
 erful hostility and domestic faction could contrive. I 
 will not adduce private testimonies, nor even appeal to 
 the style of public harangues or written documents, 
 which would triumphantly testify that the mind of the 
 British minister was deeply imbued with the chaste re- 
 finements of classical taste, while the Corsican, in every 
 sentiment he utters, gives an example of some critical 
 as well as moral defect, and only seems to possess that 
 cruel talent of sarcasm which " shames with taunts the 
 triumphs of his sword." I wish to found the contrast 
 on the real permanent advantage which literature and 
 the sciences are likely to obtain from the tenor of their 
 respective administrations. And if the muses ever 
 have been known to prefer despotism to independence, 
 danger to security, profligate morals to iiabits of vir- 
 tue, licentious manners to decorum, extravagance to 
 temperance, and tumult to tranquillity, then I wi'l own

 France and not Britain will in future be their seat« 
 But if vanity, corruption, and restraint, never have 
 produced 'any thing truly sublime aad stable, the Sister 
 Isles may still hope to remain the favourite residence 
 of the arts, as well as the emporium of commerce, se- 
 cured by that wisdom which taught them to guard 
 their shores from the contagion of anarchy however 
 glossed by specious names. I have purposely confined 
 my views to those temporal advantages, combined with 
 that love of fame which pagans admitted as a stimu- 
 lant to praise-worthy deeds, and without turning my 
 eyes to a future state. I protest against inverting the 
 ancient order of precedence, and I require that the 
 graces should walk in the train of the virtues, and not 
 act as harljingers of the furies. I acknovv^ledge, that 
 in the latter capacity, they will be less likely to suppose 
 themselves entitled to divine honours, but then they 
 will be far more certain of obtaining and preserving 
 just renown. We may exist as a nation, we may be 
 happy and respectable as individuals, without taste ; 
 but without virtue and honesty the man is despicable, 
 and the country must fall. 
 
 It is not my wish to depreciate the advantages of re- 
 fmed taste, and an enlarged understanding; or to libe- 
 rate the great and opulent from the positive duty of 
 affording di'iijitefested cncQiiragtment to true merit. I 
 see with much concern on the one hand, the many ef- 
 forts of rigid (though perhaps well meaning) zeal to 
 limit the Sphere of elegant enjoyment, and to substi- 
 tute the gloom of fanaticism for the exhilarating sun- 
 shine of learning and wit, directed to useful or even in- 
 nocent sources of pleasure ; and on the olhcr, the ad^ 
 vocates of the muses and the arts elevating genius into 
 undue consequence, and giving that praise to mere 
 talent which we should only ascribe to ability honour- 
 ably exercised. I could speak of my attachment 
 to the imitative arts, and the delight which I take in 
 the harmless sports of the imagination, with the same 
 rapturous enthusiasm as Goldsmith does of poetry. 
 Though, through the influence of bad habits, exquisite

 genius may eventually become the minister of vice, I 
 am persuaded it originally results from strong pure 
 moral feelings, energetically acting upon a cultivated 
 and enlarged understanding. By admiration of what 
 is noble, sublime, beautiful, or salutary, in animate or 
 inanimate nature, in the recorded events of past times 
 or the present age, or in the ample regions of fiction, 
 themes are presented to the artist and the bard. Wick- 
 edness, when uncombined with the expectation of local 
 advantage, is as repulsive to true taste as deformity, 
 and every attempt to give it celebrity, except as an ob- 
 ject of terror, disgust, or avoidance, must f;\il. But 
 the critic, the artist, the poet, the oiator, or whatever 
 form genius may assume, who appeals to the best feel- 
 ings of the heart, may, if his powers are equal to his 
 subject, expect a renown, limited perhaps, but not traii- 
 sitory, independent of fashion, and often slowly tri- 
 umphing over neglect. And as the leisure and self- 
 possession of temperance afford the best advantages to 
 study, so they who are most familiar with the motives, 
 enjoyments, and exertions of virtue and goodness, will 
 always have a model to refer to when they want to im- 
 part language to correct feeling, or expression to a sub- 
 lime countenance. The natural philosopher will avoid 
 the cold cant of deism, and even in scientific pursuits 
 the influence of moral principle will be felt producing 
 humane inventions, useful discoveries and mechanicnl 
 contrivances, in which the sordid views of interest will 
 be made subservient to the nobler purposes of benevo- 
 lence. Among other happy eft'ects, we shall discover 
 that when selfishness docs not act as a first principle, 
 the individual is most likely to procure real advantar>-e, 
 and that when vanity is subdued, the ends which vanitv 
 aimed at, will probably be obtained. Tiius when ta- 
 lent ceases to lay claim to divine honours, it mav even- 
 tually obtain distinctions and rewards, which arc* iocon-

 pid sameness of his conversation, except in the deafen- 
 ing sound of winds and waves, the reverberation of 
 the hunter's horn among the rocks ; or the hideous 
 clamour of drunken bacchanals. The pallet and the 
 chisel, the lute and the harp, must be abandoned. I 
 cannot chaunt Metastasio to deaf rocks, nor translate 
 Petrarch for puritanical goatherds. I can only trans- 
 form myself into a buskined wood-nymph, or a veiled 
 Bequin, and wander over mountains and morasses to 
 visit sick highlanders, who curse my interference, throw 
 my nostrums to the dogs, and are content to die of 
 those diseases which cannot be cured by sour crout and 
 the spell of an old beldam. In time, the immortal 
 mind will be changed by the incrustations of habit, 
 and I shall become so truly domesticated, and such an 
 adept in the pharmacopia, that if my jailer permits me 
 to take a transient glimpse of your vv^orld, I shall no 
 longer fear being rivalled in the affections of my belov- 
 ed Emilia by a Dr. Slop or a Mrs. Caudle. You look 
 grave, Avondel, I own I am piqued. In vain have I 
 attempted to convince my friend that any one beside 
 herself can watch a slumbering infant with due atten- 
 tion. I have offei-ed to supply her place. I have told 
 her you were within, alone, out of spirits, wanting so- 
 ciety. She heard me not, but continued to weep over 
 her child, and at last awoke him by feeling if he were fe- 
 verish. Surely, nature meant she should have acted 
 as inspector to an asylum for orphan babes, but meeting 
 with an adverse gale as her soul descended "■ from its 
 warm abode ;"* she became the wife of the dignified 
 Avondel." 
 
 The earl either listened to these sarcasms in moody 
 silence, or by an effort of strained gaiety started some 
 lively topic, in which Paulina's talents soon contrived 
 to make him really interested. If he attempted to 
 palliate Emily's excessive tenderness bv pleading the 
 strength of her attachments, Paulina knew how to in-

 stil a sly suggestion against her delicacy or discretion. 
 " Yes," said she one day, *' she rather adores than love 
 you. Yet, my ever respected friend, allow me to 
 suggest a wish that her affection were less ostensible. 
 A wife who truly loves, and is really happy, is not al- 
 ways dwelling on a theme which so much discussion 
 makes suspicious. She talks too incessantly of the 
 goodness of her clearest lord. Her eyes swell with 
 tears which you and I know to be tears of overflowing 
 affection; but I have seen old gossips notice them as 
 telling a tale of real unhappiness, and contradicting all 
 the smooth language of her lips. You should check 
 her for her uxonousness, and, above all, pray desire 
 her not to fight your battles so warmly in public. She 
 is alwavs defending your reputation, even when it is 
 not assailed. This is being ti-emulously susceptible. 
 'I'he other morning she met -your political rival Nor- 
 bury at my toikt. It was accidentally, I am sure, but 
 had she rnt-t a Bengal tyger she could not have looked 
 more terrified. He was civil and complimentary, and 
 she became so gracious, that at parting he kissed her 
 hand. My Lord, you look uneasj-. Surely Emilia 
 can have no reserves with the idol of her fond heart : 
 I know her friendships and dislikes are all governed 
 by your will." 
 
 As Lord Avondel had a peculiar dislike to that ac- 
 quiescent sameness which leaves no stamp of charac- 
 ter on the mind, so he was enthusiastic in his admira- 
 tion of passive fortitude in a woman. In her attend- 
 diice on her little boy, Emily had caught cold ; a severe 
 tooth-ache was the consequence ; and when the child 
 began to recover, she had leisure to attend to her own 
 heahh, and promised to submit to the painful opera- 
 tion of having a tooth extracted. Her previous cares 
 had rendered her body weak, and her imagination vivid. 
 Sh-' meditated on the pain she was to undergo till after 
 having suffered more in idea than she would have done 
 in fLulitv, she tremulously impeded the endeavours of 
 the demist to relieve her, and placed herself in a dan- 
 gerous as well as agonising situation.. Pauluia disco-

 veved these particulars, and resolved to play off a con- 
 trary' game. One day when Avondel was present, 
 after delighting a large circle by the spirit and grace 
 of her exertions, a servant announced that the surgeon 
 was in waiting. The guests retired ; but the earl was 
 intreated to remain. " I am suffering," said she, " in- 
 describable torture from a tooth, and am resolved to 
 have it removed this morning ; but as the hours of li- 
 bertv are precious, I would not send excuses to my 
 friends. If I should shrink, Avondel, recal me to 
 what I owe to my own character, by a look of calm re- 
 proach. Is it not thus you fortify the gentle spirit of 
 your Emilia ?" 
 
 Refusing to be supported, she fixed herself on the 
 carpet, and with an unaltered smile surveyed the in- 
 struments, inquired into their various powers, and bade 
 the operator be resolute. Having thus played off the 
 farce of fortitude to her admiring dupe, she feigned to 
 be convinced by the arguments of the dentist respect- 
 ing the impolicy of removing what was equally sound 
 and beautiful, on the bare possibility of its being the 
 seat of a pain, for which he prepared a safe and sove- 
 reign specific. Her torture, which was as real as her 
 intention of enduring any actual anguish or despolia- 
 tion, seemed to subside, and as the affectation of he- 
 roism had helped to diminish Lord Avondel's esteem 
 for his spiritless Emily, the desired end was answered, 
 and the accommodating dentist dismissed, to sound the 
 praises of her magnanimity and generosity. 
 
 When by such insinuations to Lady Avondel's dis- 
 advantage, or cheap displays of her own superiority, 
 she had stimulated the earl to behave with occasional 
 harshness to his consort, she would reprove his seve- 
 rity in terms which tended to aggravate rather than 
 reform. " You are too austere," she would say. '* Yet, 
 Avondel, since you must confess that the magnanimity 
 of your nature makes you despise imbecility, why did 
 you unite your fate with one who never included for- 
 titude in her code of virtues ? Or why in the early 
 hours of marriage, when her docile mind might have

 weakness by a habit of indulgence, only pardonable 
 when doating love obtains the hard-won object of its 
 long solicitude ? When your wife owned that her 
 hand courted your acceptance, she virtually discovered 
 that infirmity of mind which had not strength to con- 
 troul inclinations confessedly contrary to her own sense 
 of decorum. Yet, Avondel, we must each of us bear 
 our respective burdens, the fates forbade the union of 
 Clorinda and Tancred. Come, I will set you an ex- 
 ample of magnanimity. Promise to visit me in my 
 highland eyrie. You v/ill find me learning Erse 
 and potting grouse, or brushing through the fern after 
 Monthermer, while he patriotically endeavours to fix 
 the luxurious magnolia, and the foliage of the Ganges 
 on the hideous wastes of his Grampian mountains, or 
 to bespangle the dreary confines of Loch Fyne with 
 the odorous flowers of my beloved Arno. I will ap- 
 pear reconciled to the bleak horrors of Lochabar, and 
 ceasing to regret the blue serene sky which smiles on 
 the vine-clad hills of Tuscany. At least we will hide 
 our regret from the contemptuous pity of grosser souls. 
 Only to me shall you acknowledge the pain you feel 
 from the narrowness of your consort's mind ; only 
 with vou v/ill I regret the want of social enjoyments, 
 and my distance from that happy region where nature 
 and art, science and beauty, conspire to adorn lovely 
 Italy. But while Monthermer and his mountaineers 
 are engaged at their barbarous sports, ere we catch the 
 local stupiditv of the natives, and sit like prim statues 
 with our eyes rivetted upon the floor, as if the carpet 
 were a cabalistical tablet from which the spirit of con- 
 versation might be conjured by due attention, I will 
 only for your privileged-ear bid the Tuscan harp thus 
 awake its long-forgotten strains."

 Thus did Lord Avondel drink the bewitching poi- 
 son of flattery, and submit his superior mind to the 
 machinations of a coquette, till his principles, once 
 correct even to austerity, became so warped and con- 
 taminated, that he not only viewed his own wife with 
 indifterence or disgust, but allowed himself to seek 
 and to find happiness in the society of the consort of 
 his absent friend ; viewing her not merely as the skil- 
 ful caterer who supplied his vanity with delicacies, but 
 as the companion of his hours of delight, and the faith- 
 ful confident of his domestic sorrows. Those irregu- 
 larities in her conduct, which his judgment had so jusly 
 condemned, were now either forgotten or lost in the 
 blase of superior excellence ; and he whose penetra- 
 tion was accustomed to read the hearts of others with 
 a precision which made him fastidiously overlook the

 just claims of merit, because stained with imperfec- 
 tion, now found sincerity and disinterested attachment 
 in a woman who, though she deemed him superior to 
 the rest of his sex, aimed at the possession of his 
 heart from motives of revenge or vanity. With the 
 inconsistency common to those principles which do not 
 spring from the thought-restraining injunctions oi re- 
 ligion, Lord Avondel began to think there was no 
 crime in transferring his affections to Paulina. He 
 never had professed an ardent passion for his wife. — 
 She chose him, and it was her duty either to conform 
 her manners to his character, that he might contem- 
 plate her as the reflex of himself, or to reconcile her 
 mind to the scanty comfort of possession. He depend- 
 ed on his nice sense of honour, and the calm tempera- 
 ment of his passions, to preserve him from those ta- 
 miliarities in which he still saw guilt-; and Paulina had 
 so firmly persuaded him of her invulnerable purity, 
 that his conviction of the hopelessness of any attempt 
 upon her person would alone have preserved him irom 
 exposing himself to the mortification of a repulse.— 
 He believed that himself and his admired mistress 
 would be quoted as examples of pure platonic friend- 
 ship, and his delirium sometimes rose so high as to 
 make him attach respectability and even merit to a 
 preference which, though it violated ifee laws of God 
 and the sanctions of civilized society, he no longer 
 attempted to disguise. 
 
 The v/orld of fashion soon divided into two parties ; 
 I do not mean into the rigid and the dissolute, since 
 their opinions must be readily anticipated ; but what 
 arc call.'d the decent part of good company ranged 
 themselves under different banners. Lady Paulina 
 was so very agreeable, her entertainments were sp 
 well managed, comprised so much of what every body 
 wished to meet, and afforded so much taste, wit, and 
 refined enjovment, that really, as there was no l^caring 
 to be excluded from her circle, many resolved to make 
 candour act as lady in waiting, and to believe (or at 
 least to say) that there was no harm in her affair with

 Lord Avondel ; who, considering that his wife chose 
 to seclude herself from the world, and was besides of 
 a wretched temper, found himself obliged (poor man) 
 to seek comfort somewhere else. 
 
 In contradiction to this statement, the partizans of 
 Lady Avondel loudly exclaimed against the baseness 
 of deserting an amiable pretty young creature, whose 
 affections he entirely possessed, and whose fortune had 
 raised him from a state of restraint and embarrassment 
 to opulence. They found a reason for her love of pri- 
 vacy and dejection in his estrangement, instead of 
 considering her temper as the cause of this alienation. 
 They denied the charge of her being ill-humoured, or 
 rather evaded it by saying, that in similar circumstan- 
 ces her accusers would fmd it difficult to avoid feeling 
 hurt at such in anifest injuries. The Paullnians consist- 
 ed of the gay, the young, and the beautiful, while Lady 
 Avondel's vindicators were chiefly composed of those 
 very worthy people who are invited to second-rate 
 parties, or allowed to fill a supper table when the town 
 gets thin, or every body is ill of the influenza. 
 
 These opposite statements afford two different in- 
 ferences, of which inexperience may make a pruden- 
 tial use. In the first place, when there is a manifest 
 difficulty of speaking of any action in its direct and 
 appropriate terms without using such as must revolt 
 the moral feelings, we may be apprised that there must 
 be something unjustifiable in it. The equivocal term 
 affair is a most suspicious expletive. An affair of 
 honour implies intentional murder, and an affair of 
 gallantry one of those crimes which we are expressly 
 assured will exclude us from the kingdom of God. — 
 Soft terms are merely a gossamer veil thrown over 
 sin, and as has been often obstrved there was less real 
 impurity in the gross language of our ancestors. 
 
 I would next renund those who, instead of guard- 
 ing against extreme sensibility as an infirmity which 
 prevents us from performing our social duties, culti- 
 vate it as a virtue, that die v <jrld is as apt to connect 
 depression with ill-huuiour as it is to cull reserve pride ;

 and people are so much more willing to compromise 
 their candour than to give up their discernment, that 
 that the majority of mankind determine upon our cha- 
 racters from one single instance, though perhaps con- 
 tradicted by the general tenour of our lives. With 
 regard to temper, the prevailing habits of society seem 
 to require that every body should add somewhat to 
 the general stock of pleasure, and melancholy is as lit- 
 tle tolerated as spleen, even when (as is sometimes the 
 case) it subsists with the most perfect benevolence, and 
 a desire of conferring the happiness which it cannot 
 feel. Now, though in this liberal age dissipation is 
 commended, extravagance pitied, and libertinism par- 
 doned, ill-nature meets with no quarter, because ill- 
 natui-e is never pleasant, and is therefore always hos- 
 tile to the feelings of those who in their desire of 
 self-indulgence are ever ready to sacrifice the valuable 
 to the agreeable. I mean not to imply that there is 
 any sterling worth in ill-nature considered abstractedly. 
 I regard it as equally despicable and odious ; but as I 
 have occasionally seen it united to some valuable qua- 
 lities on which it acts as the small-pox does on beauty, 
 I intreat the truly deserving to avoid incrusting their 
 virtues with this hideous deformity, since it gives vice 
 an adventitious advantage, and renders her misrepre- 
 sentations more insinuatingly dangerous to inexperi- 
 ence. Minerva did nut wear the Gorgon's head as a 
 mask, and though Diana was as chaste as she was 
 beautiful, she never thought it expedient to adopt the 
 head-dress of the furies. I would especially mtonn 
 those wives who circumscribe their ideas of conjugal 
 duty within the precincts of chastity, and who, pro- 
 vided they are not unfaithful to their husbands, allow 
 themselves to be their tormentors, that true religion 
 applies its correctives equally to the temper and the 
 passions. We can never hope to be excused for the 
 non-performance of a daily duty because v.e do not 
 commit a sin to vv-hich probably in the whole course 
 of our lives we never had any temptation. The world

 Let us not sanction the delusion, but, by calling in

 But evil, on itself shall buck recoil.

 LADY 'AVONDEL felt the painful change in her 
 situation, as soon as the recovery of her child allowed 
 her to look on any other object. 'Till then, she had 
 rather rejoiced than repined when she knew her lord 
 was amused and happy. She was conscious his house 
 was a melancholy one. In her brightest hours she 
 thought meanly of her companionable powers, but 
 when depressed by care and despondence she needed 
 consolation but could impart no delight. Often she 
 wished, and sometimes she thought it would have 
 been very kind, that her lord would have staid at 
 home, and endeavoured by his strong sense to fortify 
 her mind against the threatened trial ; wiiich surely, 
 as a parent, he must also feel and fear. But then, 
 she remembered the important claims his country had 
 upon his services at a time when her councils were 
 distracted and her efforts unsuccessful ; and after a 
 day spent in painful exertion he required an evening 
 of relaxation, not of mournful sympathy. Besides, 
 he had often comforted her and reasoned her into re- 
 signation ; and though it was heavenly to be so con- 
 soled, to hear his voice inspire while it exemplified 
 fortitude, and feel his pity dry the tear he almost 
 praised ; still, so invincible was her weakness, that 
 the courage and cheerfulness which she felt in his pre- 
 sence retired with her comforter. In Paulina he found

 she was still so much her friend that she would palliate 
 rather th;i.n aggravate her infirmities. 
 
 But when Emily was again able to change the nur- 
 sery for the saloon, the Earl's absence, and her con- 
 sciousness of the scene of his engagements, awoke re- 
 grets, which were heightened by perceiving that Pau- 
 lina assumed an avowed superiority, and gloried in 
 pa) ing and receiving those attentions which seemed 
 the exclusive privilege cf the connubial connection. 
 Lord Avondel was now never affectionate in his man- 
 ner to his wife ; he was civil, cold, or perhaps way- 
 ward. EIow different was his behaviour to Paulina. 
 Emily might have said with the injured Dorothea, 
 
 " Vi'iih her he spent those pleasing- hours 
 
 Yt'hich did to me belong', 
 She in liis eyes did all things right. 
 
 While I did all things wrong." 
 
 A change so surprising at first rather astounded than 
 afflicted her. She doubted the conviction of her own 
 senses, She believed confinement had made her cap- 
 tious, splenetic, and suspicious ; especially, as Paulina 
 sometimes in her hearing reproved Avondel for wound- 
 ing the susceptible mind of his charming wife. The 
 events of every succeeding day tended to change as- 
 tonishment into despair, and Emily was convinced 
 that she endured what was to her the greatest depriva- 
 tion, the loss of her husband's heart. The world now 
 appeared to be a dreary void, her task in life was end- 
 ed ; she almost wished the beloved child, her care had 
 apparently rescued from an early grave, wrapped in 
 his funci-al habiliments, and herself breathless by his 
 side, insensible either of his death or the unkindess of 
 his still dear and honoured father. 
 
 " Grief does not kill," or at least kills so slowly that 
 like consumption it permits its victims to revive with 
 fallacious hopes. Sometimes Emily fancied, from 
 some transient starts of attention, that her Lord's at- 
 fection was returning. Again she looked forward to 
 General Monthermer's arrival, and the Caledonian ba-

 nlshment which Paulina anticipated with so much 
 whimsical resignation and real abhorrence. Lastly, 
 she almost thought that.time would blunt the edge of 
 regret ; and though she felt no symptom of diminish- 
 ed sensibility, perhaps the increasing transports of the 
 mother might leave her less time to ruminate on the 
 sorrows of the wife. 
 
 The most painful circumstance attending her pre- 
 sent situation was the frequent presence of Paulina, 
 who, knowing how necessary Lady Avondel's counte- 
 nance was to her preserving the shreds and patches of • 
 her reputation, continued to court the woman in whose 
 miseries she triumphed, and with the easy impudence 
 of confirmed determined guilt smiled on the tears she 
 caused. Besides the usefulness of Emily's apparent 
 protection, she was gratified by the frequent opportu- 
 nities of indulging her innate maliciousness by tortur- 
 ing the gentle wife of Avondel, for whom, from their 
 first interview, she had conceived a sovereign contempt. 
 If she found her dispirited, she railed against the 
 mean passion of jealousy, and informed her that in 
 Italy it was ever the wife's aim to engage her husband 
 as the cicisbeo of her particular friend, that she might 
 be sure of her good offices. If some instance of con- 
 sideration, or even common civility, from her still 
 adored lord illuminated Emily's dejected countenance, 
 Paulina took care to cloud the sunshine by some dis- 
 play of wnt or science which fixed his attention on 
 herself. The diamond tiara was often worn with 
 proud ostentation, as a princeh'^ gift from her noble- 
 minded friend, and she insinuated to Emily that her 
 sacrifice of a picture in conformity to his wishes had 
 been rewai-ded by a more entire devotedness of him- 
 self. To whom should the pensive wife complain ?. 
 certainly not to her Lord, for Paulina had not yet 
 reached that summit of her effrontery to permit Avon- 
 del to w'itness her insolence to his countess, to whom 
 in his presence she behaved with dissembled tender- 
 ness and respect, while the cold displeasure of a mind 
 too ingenuous for dissimulation confii-raed Iiis opinion

 that Paulina had ample cause to complain of Emily's 
 waywardness, and lament the cruelty of only meeting 
 with aversion from the woman whose affection she 
 wished to conciliate. Indeed, so marked was this 
 aversion that even common observers perceived it, and 
 it served to confirm the general opinion that with much 
 apparent quietness Lady Avondel was really a peevish 
 character. 
 
 To counteract his wife's dislike, or rather to shew 
 that it would meet with no indulgence from him, Lord 
 Avondel made the praises of Paulina his favourite 
 topic of conversation, to which Emily listened in si- 
 lence, not daring to contradict, and not able to con- 
 ceive his motives. Did he wish to change her opini- 
 ons ?- He must know too much of her heart and of 
 human nature to expect his commendations to sub- 
 due the dislike his preference had cemented. Did he 
 wish her to adopt Paulina's manner ? Lnpossible ! 
 nature had cast them in different moulds, she wanted 
 energy, accomplishments, talents, and confidence. She 
 could not bear the stare of general observation, the 
 burst of universal applause would overwhelm her. — 
 She durst not engage in a contest of wit lest she should 
 be surprized into some indecorum, nor could she ral- 
 ly an absurdity for fear she might give pain. She 
 dreaded engaging in a literary dispute lest she should 
 seem ostentatious, the unchequered quietness of her 
 life did not allow her to repeat entertaining adven- 
 tures, and.asto her good works they were performed in 
 secret, and consisting of' charity, humility, and self- 
 government, though recorded in heaven, they were 
 forgotten by herself. In fine, so much did she dislike 
 the character, she would not assimilate herself to Pau- 
 lina even to secure that inestimable prize, the heart of 
 Avondel. 
 
 Yet some small sacrifice she was willing to make. 
 The enchanting Italian had prepared a musical enter- 
 tainment to commemorate her birth-day. It was to be 
 in a new style, adapted to the exhibition of her own 
 powers, the pauses of which were to be filled up by

 a few friends who consented to become amateur per- 
 formers, contented to purchase the eclat of being 
 known as her intimates by acting as ibils to the idol, 
 and chaunting like the chorus in the Greek tragedy, 
 when the principal personage required an interval of 
 rest. It was determined that these attendants should 
 be all attired in a peculiar costume, and appear as 
 nymphs encircling the tutelar deity, who, crowned 
 with laurel, should be termed Harmonia, the Mother 
 of the Muses. The plan would be spoiled, the festi- 
 val inverted, and Paulina made wretched, if her most 
 dear Emilia refused to insert her name on this scroll. 
 The world would recollect the events of the last gala 
 and would draw inferences -which it would be terrible 
 to think of. Lady Avondel's voice was like her man- 
 ner, soft, plaintive, of small compass, and only remark- 
 able for artless sweetness. Pier skill in music was 
 very limited ; she had devoted little time to the culti- 
 vation of this science, and all her aim was to amuse 
 herself or a few most particular friends. But as a 
 foil she was invaluable to Paulina, and, considering 
 that the reputation of that lady seemed to totter on its 
 base, she was still more iiseful as a friend. For all 
 these reasons her presence was required with unusual 
 earnestness, and even Lord Avondel so far threw off 
 his affected indifference to his v/ife's conduct as to desire 
 her to attend, and comply with the part Paulina had as- 
 signed her, resolving to be calm and collected, she ac- 
 quiesced. 
 
 As might be expected, Paulina's triumph was as 
 complete as her vanity could desire. Such notes, such 
 strains, were never heard ; so much grace never was 
 exhibited. She varied her instruments, but it was 
 only to give new pleasure. She paused, and the sub- 
 ordinate muses were successively called upon. One 
 was scientific, another in fine voice, some introduced, 
 the fashionable shake, others were true to time and 
 tune ; none but Paulina united melodv, harmony, and 
 grace. At last. Lady Avondel was called forth. The 
 song prescribed her by Paulino, was one of those un- 
 meaning nothings of the dity which depend entirely on

 execution, and was therefore designed to expose all 
 her faults ; but, by a mistake in the leader of the con- 
 cert, two stanzas strikingly adapted to her situation 
 and character were presented to her. She had time 
 for recollecting her resolution to be collected and calm, 
 and determining at least to rival Paulina in the praise 
 of prompt compliance, for the first time in her life she 
 sang in public, and by the meek dejection of her looks, 
 and faultering sweetness of her voice, gave full ex- 
 pression to these lines. 
 
 O tell me have I lost thy lieart, 
 
 Cold are thy words thy look austere ? 
 
 Nor fear the secret to impart, 
 
 No loud compluints shall wound thine ear. 
 
 Unseen by thee my tears shall flow 
 Till sorrow wastes my youthful bloom, 
 
 Life will not always strive with woe. 
 And g-rief is silent in the tomb. 
 
 A loud burst of approbation ensued ; the modest 
 performer courtesied to her auditors, and looked 
 round to see if her lord witnessed her success. With 
 regret she perceived he was'not in the circle. He had 
 honoured Paulina's repeated exertions with the une- 
 quivocal approbation of deep attention. Could he not 
 have spared her a few of his precious moments ? Did 
 his leaving the room at the instant she was called upon 
 imply contempt or anxiety ? Norbury indeed was 
 present, ahd seemed inclined by the warmth of his 
 encomiums to silence every other eulogist ; but his prai- 
 ses pained her still more than the absence of him whom 
 she wished to please. Her reflections were interrupt- 
 ed by Paulina, who would not permit a long space to 
 Emily's triumph. Embracing her with an enthusiastic 
 air, she protested that this interesting effusion of na- 
 ture entitled her to the chief honours of the evening, 
 and then ci"Ov,'ning her with her own laurel chaplet, 
 she exchanged the character of the musician for that 
 of the iraprovvisatrice, and recited the following stan- 
 zas to Love, taking care that her eyes should glai.ce

 at Norbur}', who stood fixed in admiration of the 
 countess as often as she described the raptures of the 
 lover. 
 
 God of the rainbow wings, didst thou purloin 
 
 The Promethean fire of beauty's eyes, 
 To form tliose sylphs who still Ps3'clie's shrine 
 
 Sport, while in day-dreams wrapt the lover lies ? 
 There admiration bids his ardent gaze 
 
 Drink deep of ecstacy's bewildering- flood, 
 'Till in one darling- object he surveys 
 
 Tiic blended charms of " perfect, fair, and good." 
 Not snch as hover'd round th' Athenian sage. 
 
 As jjondering o'er Illysus banks he hung, 
 Emilia's face presents the living page 
 
 Of soft delight, and grace for ever young. 
 Light through the buoyant air the lover sees 
 
 His mistress glide, she lifts her filmy veil, 
 Her curling locks are parted by the breeze. 
 
 And sweets odorous float upon the gale. 
 Still dreams the raptur'd youth, thy busy train 
 
 Wake the soft choral of harmonious song, 
 Emilia pours the soul-expressive strain. 
 
 The strain of love atlim'd by beauty's tongue. 
 It dies in air, she listens to his praise. 
 
 He sees the kindling blush, the melting smile ; 
 The charm dissolves, and waking he surveys 
 
 The world's dark wilderness of care and toil. 
 To soft Emilia's airy form succeed 
 
 Tlie earth-born gnomes of treachery and wrong ; 
 Pale envy scoffing sounds her scrannel reed. 
 
 And drowns the chaunt of fancy's charmed song. 
 God of the rainbow wings, let hope and joy 
 
 Thy bright creation weave these dreams divine. 
 Save the fond lover from the world's annoy. 
 
 And let him slumber still in Psyche's shrine. 
 
 Lady Avondel was too much disconcerted by the 
 distinctions which she had received, the absence of her 
 lord, and the raptures of Norbury, to attend to Pauli- 
 na's rhapsodies. Indeed the sanctity of her mind, 
 which caused her to be pained instead of pleased at at- 
 tracting any heart but her husband's, would have pre- 
 vented her from understanding, that the wily Italian 
 endeavoured to give publicity to Norbury's passion, 
 not only as an excuse for her own attachment to Lord 
 Avondel, but to lower the exalted reputation of Emily

 to the level of those married coquettes who pique 
 themselves on personal chastity, while they encourage 
 the advances of libertines. Slander had now the op- 
 portunity of whispering, that if the earl had his chere 
 amie, the countess had her favourite cicisbeo. The 
 song, which if pointed at her lord's neglect, was so 
 singularly affecting, if designed to heal some breach 
 with her gallant, was either the snare of a demirep or 
 the lure of a wedded trifler, solicitous to rival uncon- 
 nected beauty in the number and notoriety of her con- 
 quests. Lord Avondel was not present ; they could 
 not, therefore have been his affections which she wish- 
 ed to recall. Norbury was evidently much moved, 
 and the permission of conversing with her the rest of 
 the evening, and leading her to her carriage, seemed 
 to indicate a reconciliation. Who would have expect- 
 ed such tergiversation in the sober-minded Emily ? 
 But we live in a mighty odd world. 
 
 Such were the conclusions which Paulina wished to 
 enforce ; but she was disappointed in her design, 
 though she encreased Emily's sufferings by affording 
 Lord Norbury an opportunity of publicly renewing his 
 disgraceful pretensions. He was encouraged so to do, 
 not so much by discovering how deeply the young 
 countess felt her wrongs, as by perceiving that Lord 
 Avondel had really become recreant to his liege faith. 
 While with the confiding generosity and watchful ten- 
 derness of a husband he protected the virtue, and 
 guarded the reputation of his wife, the boldest views 
 of the libertine only pointed at galling ihe pride of his 
 rival, and paining the delicacy of the lady by exciting 
 the suspicion of a criminal intrigue. But he now r<:- 
 newed his devoirs with full hopes of such complete 
 success as would after a few amorous, and some legal, 
 manoeuvres transfer the united wealth of the Mande- 
 villes and Delamores from the ungenial desert of 
 Avondel, to the sunny hills of Norbury. He had been 
 earlv initiated in that prudentir»l species of alchymy 
 that taught him to extract gold from the most unpro- 
 mising materials, and though he often preferred pica-

 sure to profit, yet, as self was his god, it was peculiarly 
 delightful to him to combine a profitable speculation 
 with a pleasurable indulgence. The probability of se- 
 curing not only the person, but the wealth of Emily, 
 induced him to renounce a plan he had once adopted 
 of mortifying Avondel by rivalling him in the affec 
 tions of Paulina, which, with the experience of a man 
 of the world, he conceived would provoke him more 
 than the seduction of his wife. Such were the plans of 
 Norbury, but in either instance he was doomed to feel 
 the disappointment to which vanity is ever exposed. 
 Though Paulina was ready to admit him into the choir 
 of eulogists who sang her praises, though he might de- 
 vote his time and his talents to exalt her celebrity, or 
 sacrifice his fortune to gratify her extravagance, she 
 possessed a strong but perverted understanding ; nor 
 "would she "• on the fair mountain leave to feed and 
 batten on the moor." Neither could flattery, the affec- 
 tation of sympathy, ardent affection, and profound de- 
 votion, obtain one cold mark of gratitude, one faint 
 expression of sensibility, one extorted proof of confi- 
 dence, from the faithful wife, whose heart, though 
 deeply wounded, refused to dictate one complaint, or 
 {o form any plan for retorting her sufferings on him 
 who " in spite of her wrongs and his unkindness," she 
 still dearly " loved." 
 
 At this trying period, when the want of a friend 
 often stimulated the gentle sufferer to break those in- 
 junctions which separated her from her beloved aunt, 
 and the fear of afflicting her with the knowledge of 
 her sorrows, or offending her by the bi-each of her po- 
 sitive command to conceal all matrimonial disquietude, 
 kept her silent, Lady Glenvorne returned to London, 
 after a long absence, during which she had visited her 
 revered friend at Lime Grove. Emily enjoyed the 
 purest pleasure at ht-aring of the improved health and 
 spirits of the dear guardian of her youth, and felt her- 
 selt rewarded for her forbearance and obedience by 
 knowing. Lady Selina attributed the restoration of 
 those blessings to her full satisfaction at her niece's

 happiness, " which," said she, " has turned my pray- 
 ers into thanksgivings." Some ladies would have 
 drawn such inferences from Emily's pale woe-worn 
 face as would have compelled her ingenuous disposi- 
 tion to own her aunt had been too sanguine in her con- 
 clusions, but Lady Glenvorne was not of the tribe of 
 sifters. She saw enough to confirm the suspicions 
 which report had suggested, and she resolved to act 
 the part of a confidential friend, without submitting 
 the young countess to the pain and indelicacy of con- 
 fessing her husband's errors. 
 
 The unblemished propriety with which the worthy 
 marchioness had conducted herself through life, her 
 superior understanding and noble connections, stamped 
 an importance upon her opinions which all the raillery 
 of the dissipated, who affected to call her speaker of 
 the house of rigids, was not able to efface. The first 
 check which Paulina received in her career was Lady 
 Glenvorne's refusing to visit her, and pointedly declin- 
 ing parties which she knew she and Lord Avondel 
 would be present. Mortified at this avowed contempt, 
 and in order to remove the only reason which she 
 thought could be ostensibly given for this dereliction, 
 the haughty Italian determined not to wait for Mont- 
 hermer's return to England, but to appear at court in a 
 style of magnificence in dress, equipage, and attend- 
 ants, which should throw a disparaging shade over the 
 hitherto unrivalled splendour of the house of Glen- 
 vorne. Just as she had completed her preparations, an 
 intimation was given that she would be more secure of 
 being graciously noticed if she came countenanced by 
 the presence of Lady Avondel. To borrow lustre of 
 another was galling to her irritable passions, though 
 she thought there would be no difficulty in procuring 
 Emily's attendance ; but contrary to all previous expe- 
 rience of her acquiescing complacence, she not only re- 
 fused to accompany her, but even to appear at the 
 drawing room on the day she was presented. Lord 
 Avondel, now sunk into a woman's tool, was employed 
 to enforce obedience. He inquired into the cause of

 this unusual unwillingness to pay her duty to her sove- 
 reign, and was calmly answered, Lady Gleuvorne had 
 convinced her it would be improper. 
 
 Thunderstruck with confusion, the earl was now com- 
 pelled to draw the mortifying conclusion, so painful to 
 his pride, to his high sense of honour, and his desire 
 of being considered as the gli.ss in which the age should 
 dress itself, namely, that his pure, refined piatonic at- 
 tachment to the most accomplished and attractive of 
 her sex, instead of making them the admiration of the 
 ■world, subjected the object of his regard to such a sus- 
 picion of infamy, that even his own wife refused to 
 sanction the innocence of the "connection by giving it 
 her countenance. "SVas Paulina's character irreverently 
 canvassed, rot only by the Stingwell coterie and the 
 Gourmands who sauced Sir Joseph Caddy's turtle 
 with a well-mixi'd compound of flattery and slander, 
 but did even the intelligent and the candid entertain 
 opinions to her disadvantage ? Or did Emily's deter- 
 mination spring from the v/ayward petulance of jea- 
 lousy, which, by her indiscreet communications, she 
 had persuaded Lady Glenvorne to approve, and then 
 pleaded her name as a screen to her own narrow-mind- 
 ed fastidiousness ? 
 
 After biting his lips, playing on the table with his 
 hand, and shaking his foot with more visible irritation 
 than suited a great man on so trivial an occasion. Lord 
 Avondel resumed that air of cold politeness which had 
 lately marked his domestic deportment. "■ There is 
 something," said he " in this extraordinary business 
 which has excited my curiosity. Perhaps, Lady Avon- 
 del, you will have the goodness to tell me why you 
 asked the marchioness's opinion in this point, especi- 
 ally as you might have anticipated what would be yny 
 sentiments ?" 
 
 " I will have courage," thought Emily, " for in 
 this affair I cannot have been wrong : why then 
 should I tremble ? Alas ! he had not used to call me 
 Lady Avondel."

 " Lady Glenvorne's opinion," said she, in a tremu- 
 lous voice, " was given unsolicited ; and, from what 
 passed at the moment, I am convinced had your lord- 
 ship been present, you would so far have coincided 
 with her as to forbid my appearing in public with La- 
 dy Paulina." 
 
 " This is still more enigmatical," returned the earl, 
 willing to avoid owning the conviction which he felt. 
 " If I do not impertinently intrude on confided se- 
 crets" — 
 
 " My dearest lord, promise not to be angry with 
 me. You must remember your approval of my aunt's 
 sentiments on the chariness of reputation, and the ne- 
 cessity of avoiding suspected characters." 
 
 " Suspected characters. Lady Avondel ! Who at- 
 taches suspicion to Lady Paulina Monthermer? A 
 woman of honour and virtue equal to your own." 
 
 '' I will believe your testimony, my lord, against 
 the opinion of the world ; but till that opinion is chan- 
 ged, or shall I say corrected, pardon me if I say I 
 think your wife, the mother of the infant heir of your 
 honours, should not appear to countenance what is 
 talked of as an impropriety." 
 
 " Be explicit," said the earl, " What part of Pau- 
 lina's conduct is thus condemned ? Is it possible that 
 iny friendship for her should unhappily be esteemed to 
 depi'eciate what it surely might exalt r" 
 
 Emily was silent. 
 
 " Madam," resumed'he, " I have a right to defend 
 myself, and I insist on a reply. If, any childish jea- 
 lousy, if pique at extraordinary attainments, if any 
 wayward suspicion that I have neglected you, has 
 tempted you in your intercourse with your confidential 
 friends to defame Paulina and asperse me, you owe 
 us public reparation. For I solemnly protest that my 
 attachment to her is the tribute of virtuous admiration 
 to suj)erior excellence, the grateful incense of a heart 
 penetrated by her kind endeavours to remove the 
 thorns which strew my pillow."

 ^' My lord," said Emily, whose tears could no lon- 
 jrer be restrained, " you are the first person whom I 
 ever permitted to discover that I had a sorrow ex- 
 cept my anxiety for my dear infant. The first wish 
 of my heart is to see you happy and honourable, my 
 next to contribute to your being so ; and if Lady Pau- 
 lina is more successful in her endeavours to promote 
 your comforts, or to relieve your cares, blame nature, 
 which has limited my powers of pleasing, and not a 
 heart exclusively and eternally your own." 
 
 The earl was softened : his native generosity strug- 
 gled with the delirium of a culpable attachment, nor 
 could he behold the tears which he had forced to flow 
 without enduring the pain of self cond-jmnation. This 
 was an anguish which he ever sought to shun, and 
 pressing the trembling hand of Emily, he gently ask- 
 ed her, when she would acquire sufficient fortitude to 
 avoid aSlicting him and herself? This was so like the 
 style of his expostulations in their happy days of con- 
 nubial harmony and confidence, that she was almost 
 again persuaded that she had been very wrong, and 
 was more inclined to beg forgiveness than to expect 
 reparation. Her meek solicitude tO be restored to his 
 favour renewed his hopes of success. Yet, let me ac- 
 quit him of the baseness of endeavouring to cajole his 
 wife into an approbation of his intrigues. Pained by 
 the distress of which he knew himself the cause, he 
 determined if he could remove the cloud which he 
 had cast over Paulina's reputation to remit his future 
 attentions, though in so doing, he sacrificed his great- 
 est pleasure, her enchanting and animating society. 
 
 " My Emily," said he, caressing his weeping coun- 
 tess, who hung on him with every token of reconciled 
 affection, " let us quit a subject so painful to us both : 
 Paulina shall not know why you hesitated to attend 
 her. She may suppose you were indisposed, or out of 
 spirits. I would not for the universe have her suspect 
 the gross and illiberal rumours which have so cause- 
 lessly distressed you, and which will be so fully refu- 
 ted by your conducting her to the dravring-room."

 " It is impossible," returned the countess. 
 
 *' Courage, my good girl. Though you are thus 
 nervous and ngituted to-dav, to-morrow may bring 
 you recruited spirits, and then I will not doubt your 
 inciinntion to oblige me. You t.-ll me you will believe 
 my testimony against the opinion of the world, and 
 surely your generosity must rfjoice in the po%ver of 
 rescuing innocence from undeserved obloquy." 
 
 " My lord, my iifcj dispose of nie in every other iu- 
 str.nce as you please, but, indeed, I never can assume 
 courage to brave the censures I should incur ; and I 
 must add, since you so strongly urge me, that 1 know 
 my feeble efforts would only overwhelm myself with- 
 out rescuing Pr.ulina. Opinion is so strongly against 
 iier, and I aixi considered as so entirely devoted to your 
 will, that even for your sake I must be firm, nor give 
 the world cause to sav you required from me a sacri- 
 fice which my prinjciples condemned. Do not again 
 look at me with displeasure, but ask Lady Paulina 
 vAvy sfie makes such a point of n^y accompanying her?" 
 
 Lord Avondel answered as he really thought, " Be- 
 cause ishe is proud of your friendship, and wishes to 
 give it publicity. 
 
 Emily replied, there was a stronger motive, and, on 
 being urged, confessed, that she knew Paulina would 
 be received on no other terms than as her protegee. 
 The sting of a serpent could not have given Lord 
 AvondeJ more pain than this disclosure. " Answer 
 me," said he, " on your honour, and with that veracity 
 in which I have ever confided ; have you either di- 
 rectly or indirectly contributed to draw this odium on 
 your unhappy friend r" 
 
 " Never, to my knowledge," said the countess, in 
 the posture of solemn abjuration. " If my feelings 
 have been more strongly painted on my countenance 
 than my. will permitted, I have never uttered a sylla- 
 ble, nor intentionally breathed a sigh, which could be 
 tortured into an indication that I harboured injurious 
 suspicions of your attachment to Paulina."

 " I see," said the earl, " from whence these miseries 
 have sprung. Your trembling susceptibility, your ever 
 watchful apprehensiveness, which I have in vain urged 
 you to subdue, have not only ruined my peace, but 
 cast the black tinge of infamy over a most deserving

 timents should have told you not to cherish any that

 you owed a stranger, ignorant only of the fantastical 
 rules which dragons in decorum would establish as the 
 laws of virtue. This stranger, with all the confiding 
 openness of innocence, flew into your arms, courted 
 your protection, and confided to you at once her foibles 
 and her excellencies. I might enlarge on the tortures 
 I shall ever feel from being suspected of crimes and 
 meannesses which my soul abjures, but pity for Paulina 
 engrosses all my thoughts. I do not accuse 5'ou of 
 the premeditated cruelty of determining to sacrifice her 
 fair fame to your defeated vanity, or unreasonable 
 fears ; but such is the effect. To a woman of her high 
 sense of honour, a disreputable life is worse than death, 
 and I fear the most dreadful consequences when she 
 knows that the friendship you professed for her, ends 
 in your abandoning her to the cruel censures of an en- 
 vious malignant Avorld." 
 
 There are wives who, in Lady Avondel's situation, 
 would have taken the liberty to observe, that people 
 never ought to provoke censure till their feelings are 
 sufficiently blunted to endure it. There are others who 
 might have been tempted to inquire, if coquetry M'ith 
 the husband and insult to the wife were indubi'table 
 signs of a lively friendship ? But the solemnity with 
 which Lord Avondel uttered his apprehensions of Pau- 
 lina's keen sense of disgrace, made the placable Emily 
 forget the tears she had cost her in the anticipation of 
 the future agonies her lofty spirit must endure. Ever 
 disposed to place herself in the situation of others, and 
 to judge of their feelings by the intenseness of her 
 own, she considered how unable she should be to sup- 
 port the consciousness of being suspected, to forfeit

 that pre-eminent distinction of character which forms 
 the female passport to all the comforts of society ; and 
 though she could not look upon Paulina in the light her 
 Lord did, as possessing talents and virtues of the high- 
 est order, but on the contrary, viewed her as deserving 
 some humiliation ; she wished to prevent her feeling- 
 the pang of awakening from the dream of deified va- 
 nity to endure universal neglect or contempt. She 
 meekly answered her lord's severe expostulation by in- 
 treating him to overlook constitutional faults, and to 
 pardon unintentional errors. " If," continued she, "■ I 
 can render Lady Paulina any real service, I will not 
 scruple to shew I am grateful for her professions of 
 regard. Let no violent plan be adopted. An excuse 
 may easily be made for my declining to be at the draw- 
 ing-room, and as her appearance has been so long de- 
 ferred, surely there will be nothing in postponing it till 
 the general's return. She will by that means escape 
 any public mortification. And as to our intimacy sub- 
 siding, let me be thought whimsical or capricious, for 
 I Avill never intimate to her the real cause. Her hus- 
 band is expected next month, and I trust the propriety 
 of her behaviour under his protection will silence eveiy 
 injurious report. Then, my lord, a family intimacy 
 may be renewed, and I need not fear wounding the 
 delicacy of my sovereign by openly patronizing the 
 beauty and tulcnts v.Iiich so eminently distinguish the 
 wife of vour gallanc friend." 
 
 Avondel could not immediately reply. There was 
 a tenderness and prudence in this plan which rendered 
 it unexceptionable ; and he felt compelled to admire 
 that firmness which as it was so contrary to her usual 
 character was evidently the result of principle. The 
 conviction of his wife's real superiority to that worth- 
 less woman for whom he was so deeply interested, 
 whispered to his conscience, " Blind and unjust Avon- 
 del, reverence that meekness which even the keen sen- 
 sibility of wounded tenderness cannot violate." Self- 
 reproof was a most painful, because ignominious, sen- 
 sation, to a man who had during his whole life opposed

 undeviating rectitude and all the splendid qualities of 
 the nobleman to injustice, selfishness, and ingratitude. 
 At least, he was thoroughly convinced, that he had acted 
 thus, and as far as self-satisfaction goes the persuasion 
 was sufficient. He was now reduced to feel himself 
 blameable, to perceive that he was excelled by a wo- 
 man, by his wife, even by that well-meaning romantic 
 girl whom he had married because he saw she loved 
 him. To suffer this conscious degradation was morti- 
 fying, to own it was impossible. For though no one 
 could more happily conciliate enmity, nor more grace- 
 fully forgive a fault, Lord Avondel wanted the magna- 
 nimity of a great mind to confess his own backslidings 
 in private life, and to one too whom he considered as 
 his inferior. 
 
 He had now recourse to his memorandums, and 
 fmding the committee of the House of Lords met very- 
 early, he chided himself for having trifled away an im- 
 portant hour. " If," said he, " in the course of the 
 evening, I should find leisure to call on Paulina, I will 
 advise her to postpone her visit to court. Shall I add, 
 your engagements will not permit you to return her 
 call at present? Is this all, Emily?" 
 
 " If, without too much alarming her, you could add, 
 that I most sincerely wish her happy" — . 
 
 " Though she has made you wretched ?" 
 
 " No, my Lord ; your assurance that all my errors 
 have not deprived me of your attachment, is too re- 
 cent for Paulina to terrify me into unhappiness." 
 
 " Not if I spend my evening at her house ?" 
 
 " No, not even then ; for I will devote mine to one 
 of your sex whom I love ten thousand times more than 
 you love that engaging woman." 
 
 " I understand you," resumed Lord Avondel, retir- 
 ing with that air of graceful benignity which so well 
 became him. " Kiss the boy for me, and bid him 
 when he commits a fault learn from you how to con- 
 vert it into an attraction." 
 
 Emily's cares and sorrows were suspended by this 
 conversation. She always attributed her lord's reproofs

 to the kind interest he took in her conduct, and his 
 praises were a constant source of ecstacy, he spoke his 
 full forgiveness with so much complacence arid bene- 
 volence. Yet she rather wondered how he came to 
 think she had been wrong. On reviewing her behavi- 
 our with a degree of self-satisfaction which was new to 
 her character, she felt surprised at her own courage, 
 and convinced that she had done what she ought. But 
 people see things through different mediums, and she 
 knew her lord was perfectly satisfied of the rectitude 
 of his own motives. He had again assured her of his 
 fidelity. His regard for Paulina, and the manner in 
 which he defended her character, proved her to be in- 
 nocent of those gross offences of which Emily was un- 
 willing to accuse her, not so much from a superabun- 
 dance of candour as from her shuddering reluctance 
 to indulge so treasonable a thought as that her all-per- 
 fect husband could really be a perjured adulterer. She 
 was however glad that he now knew the world thought 
 less highly of his goddess than he did, and she rejoiced 
 in the firmness which had relieved her from the espion- 
 age of a woman who, under the occasional mask of 
 rectitude and winning grace, concealed a most malig- 
 ant temper and impetuous passions. Yet more, she in- 
 ferred from her lord's compliment to her talent at con- 
 ciliation that she might in time vanquish the spells of 
 her fascinating rival, and restore his attention and his 
 heart to those public and private duties to which his 
 life had been so honourably devoted. 
 
 But, like an evil genius, Paulina was busily employed 
 in counteracting the benign influence of innocence and 
 sweetness. She received Lord Avondel's intimation, 
 that it was impossible for Emily to accompany her to 
 court, with that sort of meek resignation which denot- 
 ed grief rather than resentment at ihcv abandonment of 
 a favourite design. " I am a forlorn stranger," said 
 she, " without the countenance of a husband, and de- 
 nied the protection of a friend. Had vanity been my 
 motive, I should have deserved a disappointment, but 
 I was impelled by a desire of paying homage to the

 virtues uf your queen. Yet I will not censure those 
 restrictions by wliich etiquette deems it expedient to 
 guard the throne from unhallowed reproach. I am 
 not known in P'-ngland. In Florence, 'tis true — But 
 no more of Florence. I know my gentle Emilia 
 ■would have complied with your wishes, but for some 
 secret reasons of which her discretion is the properest 
 judge." 
 
 Paulina's habit of rapidly assuming opposite cha- 
 racters, and of indicating by change of tone and look 
 contrary passions, had given her such a command of 
 countenance, that even the penetrating Avondel saw 
 nothing in this speech but conscious rectitude calmly 
 submitting to an undeserved slight. He had enough 
 of the old knight-errant in his nature to make him 
 prompt in his endeavours to befriend a sufferer of this 
 description ; and though he could with consummate 
 address, manngc camps and penetrate into the designs 
 Of courts, he ft It, as heroes often feel, so disconcerted by 
 a woman, that he knew not in what terms to communi- 
 cate Lady Avondel's resolution to decline her acquaint- 
 ance. With somewhat like the hesitation of a recluse 
 collegian, who seeks the patronage of a great lady to 
 his first work, he mentioned Emily's wishes for Pau- 
 lana's happiness, but he had no sooner got to regret at 
 her not being at leisure to call, than the penetrating 
 Italian saw by his embarrassment, and the formality of 
 the introduction, what was to follow. She had indeed 
 despised the young countess for the timidity which 
 had prevailed upon her to keep up an intercourse only 
 productive of pain, and wondered whether her for- 
 bearance had proceeded for fear or blindness. But 
 though prepared for the intelligence, the channel 
 through which it was conveyed alarmed and surprised 
 her. From v/hat point blew the wind when a wife 
 had such power over her husband as to make him assent to 
 the propriety of her jealous scruples, and bear a mes- 
 sage which declared in opposition to his knoxvn opinions, 
 that she would not countenance imprudence and effron- 
 tery ? Had Emily's feeble charms snatched from her a

 heart which flattery, artifice, taste, wit, talent, celebri- 
 ty, and superior beauty, had so hardly subdued ? Could 
 passive submission be the mighty enchantress who had 
 dissolved so many potent spells ? She would be more 
 passive, more submissive, and look and speak with 
 more consummate meekness. She knew how to act 
 the wife, as well as the mistress, of Antonj'. She 
 eould adjust her veil, fold her drapery, close htr hands 
 on her bosom, cast down her eyes, and utter nothing 
 but the sigh of resignation, in imitation of the pati- 
 ent Octavia. 
 
 " I understand you, my Lord," said she, when she 
 had so arranged her features as to invite his scrutiniz- 
 ing glances. " No further explanation is necessary. 
 The claims of domestic harmony are most paramount 
 obligations, and in you I surrender my only English 
 friend. Yet, perhaps my still dear Emilia, your hap- 
 py wife, pitying my forlorn situation, may allow me 
 to receive your written advice, provided our correspon- 
 dence be submitted to her unerring delicacy." 
 
 '* Charming Paulina," returned the earl, " your 
 susceptibility hurries you into extremes. I shall not 
 desert the honour with which you have invested me of 
 being your protector, till I consign you to the care of 
 Monthermer." 
 
 No allusion could be more ungrateful to Paulina 
 than the return of her husband, and that Avondel 
 could name it with indifference, nay even allude to it 
 as an exoneration fronv the trust she had reposed in 
 him, was madness. She needed all her powers of de- 
 ception to conceal her real agony. 
 
 " If I appointed you to the trust," said she, with 
 faultering emotion, " it is now my duty to liberate 
 you. Noblest of men, I could say dearest too, fare- 
 well. I -A ill not interrupt the harmony of your wed- 
 ded life. The lovely Emilia's wishes ought to regu- 
 late your intimacies. Yet, perhaps that goodness which 
 is an inmate in your bosom, that pity for an alien dis- 
 honoured and abandoned in your, shall I say inhospi»

 that cancelled all my wrongs." 
 
 " Surelv," interrupted the earl, " you forgot your- 
 self when you use such a superflux of adjurations in- 
 stead of commanding my services-" 
 
 *' My lord, I. remember but too well; the honour 
 of a British nobleman must not be committed by his 
 taking a lively interest in the disgrace of a reputed 
 Presiding powers, who watch over delicacy, can- 
 not I even name the accusation which has stabbed my 
 fame ! I only meant to ask, if there is any impro- 
 priety in requesting that your lovely child may some- 
 times visit me. He resembles you. It is not on that 
 account I beg to see him, I want no memento of your 
 features, no remembrance of your worth, but my lit- 
 tle Sydney doats upon him, and if denied his sight 
 will be as wretched as his mother. Will Emilia ob- 
 ject to this, I mean will she be taught to object, for 
 candour and tenderness zvere her characteristics ? It is 
 now my first wish that the bo3'S who bear your name 
 might consider each other as brothers." 
 
 Avondel desired Paulina would be calm, and prom- 
 ised to bring the child next morning. 
 
 " Bring him !" exclaimed she, " O be not rash. — « 
 Consider your own character, and the promises you 
 have made to his apprehensive mother." 
 
 " Neither of which," said he in astern tone, " will 
 be endangered by my visiting a woman of sense and 
 honour. And surely, Lady Paulina, you cannot sup- 
 pose, that you can ever forfeit my friendship while 
 you are conscious you deserve it." 
 
 " Repeat that assurance," answered she, anxious to 
 discover that Lady Avondel had, in addition to her 
 own renunciation of her acquaintance, prevailed on 
 her husband to promise that he would abandon her, as 
 she knew she could soon counteract so mean and impo- 
 tent a restriction. " My hurried spirits," she con- 
 tinued, " have perhaps made me hear you incorrectlv. 
 Has Emilia's superlative generosity left you indeed at

 " English ladies," returned the Earl, " are not ac- 
 customed to prescribe their husband's friends, or to 
 limit their conduct within interdicted bounds. I should 
 be sorry to be an exception to general custom. And 
 believe me, Lady Paulina, infamy never has yet been 
 associated with your name, nor shall it while I have a 
 voice to assert your innocence, or an arm to avenge 
 your wrongs." 
 
 Paulina wrung his hand with hurried emotion, and 
 called him the generous image of divine compassion. 
 " I am not then," said she, " as I feared, the vilified 
 outcast of society, whom every one might insult with 
 impunity ? The great and good Avondel is my pro- 
 tector still. He, ever wise and noble, knows how to 
 reconcile the claims of his ov.'n honour with the pity 
 due to a stranger; and though the fastidious appre- 
 hensiveness of conjugal aflection has robbed me of the 
 jewel which, next to conscious innocence, I most va- 
 lue, an unspotted character, I will not complain. — 
 Your desert sanctifies the extravagancies of jealousy. 
 Yet must I fear lest your goodness to me should wound 
 your poor Emilia's peace. If it should again induce 
 her so pathetically to complain that she has lost your 
 heart." 
 
 "■ You are mistaken. Lady Paulina, Emily never 
 did, nor will complain." , 
 
 " Not complain ! O pardon me in this. What think 
 you could have prepared me to bear this suclden breach 
 of friendship with composure, but the discovery of 
 her abhorrence of me i The events on my birth-day 
 certainly afforded an ample scope for detraction. He- 
 collect, my Lord, the song bemoaning your unkindness 
 which made the whole circle weep. Her manner too 
 of receiving their condoling applause ! Sweet gentle 
 soul! I verily believe it was a sudden impulse inspired 
 perhaps by your too unguarded admiration of mc."

 Lord Avondel reminded her that he left the party 
 after her part was concluded, and desired her to in- 
 form him how the words of the song allotted to Lady 
 Avondel could be construed into a reference to their 
 domestic situation ? After some pretended regret that 
 she had thus disclosed what he was unacquainted with, 
 Paulina recollected Emily's sonpj, described her look, 
 the plaintive tremulousness of ht,r voice, the raptures 
 of Norbury, the whispers of the company, and all 
 those circumstances which, though they did not fire 
 the earl with jealousy, made him severely condemn 
 his wife for imprudence and duplicity. How could 
 she so solemnly protest that she had never breathed 
 a sigh or uttered a complaint tending to confirm 
 the general prejudice against Paulina f Had she not, 
 with marked indifference to the usual forms of good 
 breeding, cast aside the appointed song, and in- 
 troduced a ditty to which she knew the world would 
 give the identical I'eference it was so much her duty to 
 withhold from its notice ? Was this the patient wife, 
 throwing the decent veil of concealment over her part- 
 ner's errors ? No : it was revenge, obtruding itself on 
 pity, under the disguise of meekness : and was a wo- 
 man who could act thus, and then have the meanness 
 to deny what she had done, to be gratified by his sa- 
 crificing the friendship of such a noble being as Pauli- 
 na, whose fame now depended on his steady counte- 
 nance ? " No, Lady Avondel," said he to himselr, as 
 he retired from his Italian enamorata, " pique not 
 yourself upon that delicacy which from vour education 
 and character is rather a habit than a virtue, till vou 
 practise those other branches of purity, veracity and 
 sincerity. I feel myself bound in honour to protect 
 the object of your narrow jealousy from your cruel in- 
 sinuations, and to leave you to create troubles since 
 you are mean enough to seek for consolation for ima- 
 ginary wrongs at the expense of you friend's fame."

 continued notorious, and those who wished to perform 
 supererogatory acts of politeness included the earl and 
 his fair friend in the same invitation. Some said they 
 were made for each other, some regretted " aught 
 should part the matchless pair," yet in spite of the in- 
 fluence and dignity of his character, and the attrac- 
 tions and celebrity of hers, the respectable part of so- 
 ciety imitated Lady Glenvorne, and refused to coun- 
 tenance a connection no longer sanctioned by the tacit 
 acquiescence of the wife, and to the blamcable tenden- 
 cy of which her rayless eyes and pallid cheeks bore in- 
 dubitable testimony.

 THE death of Sir Walter Mandeville, which hap- 
 pened about this period, gave Lady Avondel a fair 
 pretence loTsecluding herself from evening parties, 
 and only se«ing a few friends in a morning. She thus 
 escaped the pain of publicly enduring the neglect of 
 her Lord, and the admiration of Norbury. The so- 
 ciety of Lady Glenvorne was her chief consolation. 
 That respectable woman, from her knowledge of the 
 human mind, was able tore-assure her gentle friend's 
 self-accusing diffidence, and in some small degree to 
 assuage the poignacy of her sorrow, without laying 
 bare the incurable v/ound her affectionate heart had re- 
 ceived. She talked of their mutually revered Selina, 
 of the calm peaceful old age which promised to re- 
 ward the patience with v/hich she had sustained her 
 early trials ; how universally her own character was 
 respected, and the increasing numbers who declined 
 Paulina's acquaintance. She repeated interesting nar- 
 ratives of the ultimate success that has often crowned 
 the efforts of virtuous wives, to recall the affections of 
 their truant lords. She spoke of the pure delights 
 which the maternal character affords, and the endear-

 ing cciisolations uhkh result from the nffectionate at- 
 tachment of a deserving son, tenderly solicitous to 
 repay the debt of kindness uhich his iiclpless infancy 
 incurred. Proud of her son the marquis, his amiable 
 qualities gave peculiar animation to diis part of her 
 conversation, but with laudable delicacy she avoided 
 his name ; not daring to trust herself on a siibject 
 ^vhich would probably discover her unsubdued regret, 
 that the coronf t of Glenvorne was not enriched v.'ith a 
 pearl which the capricious possessor disregarded, nay 
 abandoned, for a worthless bead. She knew enough 
 of human frailty to be cautious of exposing virtue to 
 needless trials, and as, contrary to the modern stand- 
 ard of principle, she conceived the bond of marriage 
 to be only dissoluble by death, she thought it would 
 be imprudent to encourage an injured and afflicted 
 wife to contrast a. deserving faithful lover with a cruel 
 if not perjured husband. 
 
 Wiih similar delicacy, the young marquis carefully 
 avoided the woman* who still kept possessiou of his 
 heart. In surrendering Emily to the " lord of her 
 bosom's love," he fancied her future happiness was 
 insured, and though his attachment was sincere, it 
 was not so violent as to overpower generosity, or to 
 make him wish that the fair one whom he esteemed 
 and loved had been prevailed upon to prefer indiffer- 
 ence with him to felicity with another. But now that 
 he founjcl his own desires had been sacrificed without 
 procuring her the desired good, when he beheld Emily 
 returning indifference with inviolable attachment, and 
 opposing neglect v/ith no other sign of feeling but si- 
 lence and tears, his estimation of her value rose to 
 that height that he fenred to contemplate her, lest so 
 interesting an object should awaken sentiments fatal to 
 his own peace of mind, and which might also aggra- 
 vate, instead of alleviating, her woes. For was he 
 authorised to call Avondel to account for his absurd 
 and culpable preference of Lady Paulina ? or could 
 he take such a step without injuring the fame of the 
 lovely sufferer? If weeping gentleness failed in its

 endeavours to revive the withering plant of love, would 
 the storms of expostulation prove beneficial ? In how 
 few instances is conjugal infelicity lessened by the 
 mediation of friends ? In how many cases are petu- 
 lance and caprice changed into confirmed aversion by 
 injudicious though perhaps well-meant interference. 
 
 Lord Avondel's high deference for public opinion 
 was well known, and the Glenvornes believed that the 
 eclat which attended Paulina had rendered him more 
 vulnerable to her blandishments ; they therefore hop- 
 ed that if the meteor's splendors were involved in 
 mist, the same weakness which had seduced him might 
 serve to recall him to the contemplation of love's chaste 
 star. With this view, they exerted themselves to di- 
 minish the consequence of the bewitching Italian, ab- 
 solutely refusing to be seen in any circle she frequented, 
 or» if they met by accident, adopting that cold proud 
 civility with which even effrontery cannot long contend. 
 Fashion and fame are alike mutable in their favours, 
 and generally immolate their former idols on the shrine 
 of some new divinity. Paulina discovered, that as 
 she had owed much of her celebrity to novelty, her 
 popularity M'as decreased by a host of imitators, who, 
 though in their style of acting they " marred her great- 
 ness," by dividing public attention, obscured her fame. 
 Numbers too who had not that solid judgment which 
 distinguished the Glenvornes, endeavoured to outgo 
 them in the loudness of their censures, and took ex- 
 ceptions against the general style of her impromptus 
 as well as against the freedom of her manners and the 
 looseness of her attire. These condemned her not 
 merely as a vain, artful, treacherous coquette, but as 
 a woman who outraged every law of virtue, and aban- 
 doned herself to general licentiousness. It was infer- 
 red from various suspicious circumstances that she 
 •would be as ready to act the Bona-roba with Norbu- 
 ry, ns the Lady Baronness with Avondel, and like 
 Pope's Psyche, whether she addressed a Mounseer, a 
 Signior, or a Mynheer, always replied in the language 
 of assent.

 Paulina had not yet proceeded so far down the de- 
 clivity of vice as to avoid feeling shocked at these 
 undeserved imputations, which were become too pub- 
 lic to escape her penetration. Yet, when we consider 
 that she was so far infatuated by her passion for Lord 
 Avondel, and elated by her triumph over his supposed 
 invulnerable heart, as to contemplate thg death of his 
 countess from nelect, and her own adulterous connec- 
 tion, with complacence, as the means of dissolving 
 her own marriage and uniting her to her paramour, 
 we must not wonder at any degree of licentiousness of 
 which she might hereafter be guilty. Nor was slan- 
 der so very en-oneous in judging that the seeds of that 
 effrontery, which could glory in the notoriety of an 
 indecorum, and that cruelty which could exult in the 
 misery of innocence, v.-ould in time produce a prolific 
 crop of profligacy. Nor do I hesitate to pronounce 
 the venal wanton, chaste in comparison of her, who, un- 
 seduced by any temptation but her own passions, indulg- 
 ed, till they became inordinate, pauses on the abyss of 
 vice, calculates what advantages may result from the 
 infamy which she is going to incur, palters with the 
 devil, and strikes a bargain of worldly advantage 
 against that dreadful hazard of eternal punishment 
 which pre-concerted guilt ever braves. For, be it re- 
 membered, adultery is a premeditated crime. The 
 inclination, to offend must often be subdued before it is 
 indulged ; the plan of seduction and deceit must be 
 :)rranged, methodized, suspended, and resumed. The 
 husband must be blinded, the monitor removed, the 
 assignation formed, and the attendants corrupted, before 
 the culprits can find it convenient to consummate their 
 guilt. But women of Paulina's stamp seldom extend 
 their views beyond the things that are temporal ; and 
 amid all the characters which she assumed, and all the 
 virtues which she affected, she was too much a stran- 
 ger to its feelings to attempt that of religion. 
 
 Her ihethod of parrying public odium was not by 
 pretending to correct her conduct, but by more openly 
 displaying her superiority. She considered envy us

 the source of much of the sarcasm and hisult which 
 she now experienced, and perhaps she was not errone- 
 ous in this conclusion. The doors of so many houses 
 of fashion were now shut against her, that she could 
 no longer preserve that nice selection of society which 
 only admitted high ton and literary celebrity on her 
 visiting list. She was even glad to leave a card at Lady 
 Caddy's, and to be enrolled in the duchess of Sting- 
 well's coterie. Nor let the reader start at ladies of such 
 correct character admitting so suspicious a member into 
 their hallowed precincts. The world had talked so 
 much of the earl of Avondel and his fair friend, that 
 the duchess declared it was a duty she owed to society 
 to observe this woman's manners herself. Her ranks 
 had been rather thinned by a recent importation of 
 Irish officers, who had carried off some of her well- 
 jointered widows and rich spinsters. It became neces- 
 sary for her grace to recruit her numbers, and long 
 experience had told her none made such admirable in- 
 quisitors as those who knew by experiecce the active 
 properties of scandal. 
 
 Here then, and at Lady Caddy's, the degraded Pau- 
 lina exerted her musical and histrionic powers ; here 
 poured forth the soul of song, displayed the command- 
 ing graces, and spoke the glowing ebullitions of genius 
 which had charmed the refined connoisseurs of an en- 
 lightened nation. She now filled up the vacuums of 
 frivolit}', and assisted the labours of repletion. She 
 was heard after the lie of the day had oeen circulated, 
 and relieved the universal yawn incident to a dearth 
 of intrigue. The company whom Sir Joseph Caddy's 
 turtle had assembled, stared at her exhibitions, pro- 
 nounced them monstrously good, wondered at the la- 
 dy's memory, lost half she said, and misunderstood the 
 rest ; and her ladyship's friends hoped that Electua or 
 Angelica would not take much time, as the evening 
 hardly allowed more than five rubbers. In compliance 
 with that gregarious code of social laws which fashion 
 had then just promulgated, and which has since been 
 honoured by universal obedience, the mistresses of

 these respective mansions, glad of every thing which 
 drew a crowd to their houses, courted Paulina's com- 
 pany ; and though she was too refined to afford them 
 any real amusement, their guests flocked to the spot 
 which gave them an opportunity of saying, they had 
 seen the ItaUan lady whom every body talked about. 
 The duchess and Lady Caddy were indeed women of 
 too great virtue to defend her conduct. Her grace 
 coolly submitted it to the scalping knives of her friends 
 the moment the rattle of Paulina's wheels announced 
 her to be out of hearing, and enjoyed the dissection of 
 her new friend's reputation in silence, till she thought 
 the lagging vigour of the operators wanted the refresh- 
 ment of her own pungent salts. As to Lady Caddy, 
 she constantly protested, that if there were any thing 
 actually wrong between Lord Avondel and Lady Pau- 
 lina, she neither would nor could defend it ; which ob- 
 servation I think amounted to saying, that if vice were 
 vice, she would not try to make it virtue, which in 
 these times certainly is going a great way towards vera- 
 city. Each of these ladies could justly affirm, that 
 their houses never had been polluted by meetings be- 
 tween the criminals, for one especial reason. Fallen 
 as the earl was, he was still, like Milton's Beelzebub, 
 " majestic though in ruin." Nor did this " pillar of 
 state, in whose grave aspect deliberation sat, and pub- 
 lic care, and whose look drew audience and attention 
 still as night," condescend' to frequent less respectable 
 circles than those in which he was accustomed to move. 
 It was only when he had engagements of Vv'hich Pau- 
 lina was forbidden to partake that she escaped from 
 reflection, and gratified the cravings of inordinate vani- 
 ty by that meagre food which the wonder of ignorance 
 afforded to one whose exertions had used to command 
 admiration and enraptui-e taste. 
 
 About this time Lady Glenvorne received an unex- 
 pected visit from Lady Selina Delamore, of whom, 
 though long unmentiontd, I have not lost sight. The 
 Tumours of Emily's unhappiness and declining health 
 had penetrated the retreat of Lime Grove, and more

 severely tried the resignation of the pious rechise than 
 all her own sorrows. She was tempted to ask, why 
 does artless innocence suffer, and why does vice pros- 
 per? or to determine hastily to step forward, vindicate 
 her injured niece, and expose her tormentors. Her 
 clear comprehension of those divine promises contain- 
 ed in the sacred volume, which was her daily study, 
 and her obedience to the precepts it enjoined, soon 
 taught her in this, as in every former trial, to turn her 
 eyts to Him who knows what is best for us during our 
 mortal pilgrimage ; and her knowledge of Lord Avon- 
 del's disposition convinced her, that unless the most 
 enlightened wisdom and commanding influence guided 
 the conduct of the mediatrix, Emily's sorrows could 
 not be alleviated by her interference. And would 
 sympathy relieve them ? Would she be better able to 
 support the loss of her lord's affection b}' having wept 
 on the bosom of her maternal friend, and told her how 
 inestimably she valued the heart of which she had been 
 artfully deprived ? She knew Ladv Glenvorne would 
 be attentive and compassionate, but one suggestion 
 struck her mind, would she also be a raonitress ? It was 
 possible Emily might be faulty, might have committed 
 some error which tended to excuse Lord Avondel, 
 and the reformation of which might restore his truant 
 love. She trusted to the discernment and explicitness 
 of the marchioness, and it was with the view of know- 
 ing her sentiments that she resolved to visit her, with- 
 out informing her niece that she was in London till she 
 knew whether seeing her could answer anv good pur- 
 pose, to counteract the certain ill of exasperating the 
 carl, and drawing from her that full avowal of wretch- 
 edness which in griefs of her peculiar kind rather ag- 
 gravates than cui'es. 
 
 Lady Selina listened with pleasure to the marchio- 
 ness's assurances, that no blame attached to the 
 amiable countess, whose only fiult consisted in that ex- 
 treme susceptibility which resuUs from acute feelings, 
 instead o: unbridled pasiuons, and calls for forbearance 
 and protecting fortitude as duties that firm intrepid

 man owes to his weak and gentle helpmate, and which 
 Emily certainly might boast her husband shewed her 
 till the subtile Italian " benetted him round" with 
 snares. Her punctual adherence to her aunt's advice, 
 of concealing her unhappiness, was proved by Lady 
 Glenvorne's declaring, that though she v/as the only 
 friend who had any pretension to her co*nfidence, not a 
 word to her lord's disadvantage ever escaped her lips. 
 *' The accounts of Paulina's mortifications, which (said 
 the marchioness) I could not help having a pleasure in 
 communicating, seem to give her satisfaction, for hu- 
 man nature could not be indifferent on such an occa- 
 sion ; but she only presses my hand with a look of 
 gratitude, dries her eyes, begs me not to go too far, 
 and starts some other subject. I trust, however, thdt 
 as she grows somewhat more cheerful, she also che- 
 rishes the hope that this high-minded man cannot long 
 submit to patronize infamy. I think she suffers more 
 from considering his degradation than from a sense of 
 her own wrongs." 
 
 Lady Glenvorne now delicately suggested to her 
 friend the possibility, that her once all-powerful influ- " 
 ence might counteract the abandoned Paulina's, and 
 asked her if she could support an interview with the 
 earl. The calm and elevated Selina shuddered at the 
 proposal. " If it could dissolve an illicit connection," 
 said she, " if it could snatch the beloved Avondel from 
 a life of guilt, and restore him to his injured wife, my 
 own feelings should not |)revent me from making a 
 dreadful disclosure, which must convince bim of the 
 extensive unexpected consequences." Here she paus- 
 ed, clasped her hands, and uttered a fervent {lietition 
 for divine support and direction. 
 
 " P*ly indignation," resumed Lad)' Glenvcrne, " has, 
 I perceive, transported me too far in my censures of a 
 connection which blasts the chaste love of our dearest 
 Emily. Highly reprehensible as I consider the earl 
 to be, in withdraM'ing his affections from his wife, and 
 publicly devoting his attention to a married woman of, 
 to use the softest terms, suspicious principles and

 doubtful fame ; weak and scandalous as I hold it him 
 to declare himself bound in honour to be her protect- 
 or, while he deserts those whom God and nature call 
 him to cherish and support ; though I deem that friend- 
 ship a sin which virtually breaks the preference pre- 
 scribed by marriage, and that degree of flirtation, men- 
 tal adultery, which withdraws the heart from those to 
 whom it is pledged by solemn vows ; I still believe, 
 that, by an absurd sophistry unworthy his understand- 
 ing and principles, Avondel is self-satisfied, and thinks 
 his behaviour justifiable, which he could not do if he 
 had really committed the grosser crime. So innate 
 are his principles of honour, that I know he would 
 then feel degraded, and though he is practised in life's 
 subtle maze he has too much ingenuousness to know 
 himself to be a villain without being humbled at bis 
 own shame." 
 
 Lady Selina answered, that in these circumstances 
 she knew her interference would be of no avail. She 
 observed it was difficult to convince a criminal of his 
 faults, while through a perversion of the understand- 
 ing conscience acted as an advocate instead of an ac- 
 cuser. The false generosity of supporting what he 
 esteemed slandered innocence, might obviate every 
 plea she could urge. The expected arrival of General 
 Monthermer would tend to develope Paulina's charac- 
 ter, and nothing could so soon detach Avondel from 
 her as those violent measures which it was probable 
 her unbridled passions might suggest. As it was im- 
 possible for Lady Selina to remain tranquil at Lime- 
 Grove while the Avondels continued in this distressing 
 state, she consented to adopt Lady Glenvorne's plan, 
 of residing in London incognita, where the marchion- 
 ess might give her daily informacion. 
 
 The wiley Paulina perceived, that of all the arts she 
 had used to detach the earl from his wife none had 
 been so successful as seeming to fasten <. .. her the 
 crime ot duplicity. With the censoriousness commoa 
 to a depraved character, which generally judges from 
 its corrupt inclinations, she once expected to find some

 indiscretion which might have subjected the countess 
 to the suspicion of a criminal amour — but so blameless 
 was her behaviour, that it seemed as easy to charge 
 her with high treason as with a thought that militated 
 against her wedded faith. Norbury indeed was ready 
 to second her aims, by boldly proclaiming himself the 
 lover and the champion of the most lovely and most 
 injured of her sex ; but as the object of his vows, se- 
 cluded in her own deserted mansion, never sparkled in 
 the horizon of fashion, he could not even be see7i 
 pouring his vows into her cold and listless ear. It 
 was impossible therefore for Lord Avondel to justify 
 his actions by recriminating censures on his wife, 
 whom, while he admitted her to be perfectly virtuous, 
 he despised as a mean-spirited woman, concealing 
 much duplicity and petty art under the mask of inge- 
 nuousness. 
 
 But human nature in its best shape is so remote 
 from perfection that Paulina thought it would be use- 
 ful to confirm the earl's hatred by some new discovery 
 of his wife's unworthiness, lest, when his indignation 
 at her exposing him for a cruel husband subsided, he 
 should ask himself if he were justified in abandoning 
 her for one fault ? Lady Caddy's early intimacy with 
 the Mandeville family promised to open a fair field on 
 which penetration and invention might work under the 
 direction of malevolence. Though no two human be- 
 ings were ever more unlike than the elegant high-spi- 
 rited Italian and the mean vulgar English woman, a 
 violent friendship was formed between them, by the 
 adhesive properties of mutual accommodation and 
 mutual hatred to Lady Avondel, whom Paulina de- 
 tested as the wife of her beloved, and Lady Caddy as 
 the means of preventing her from entrapping Sir Wal- 
 ter Mandeville. For strongly as she loved her dear 
 Sir Joseph she was so attached to Mandeville Castle, 
 that the death of its possessor could not divert her af- 
 fectionate regard from what she thought would have 
 been as well disposed of in. a jointure as in swelling the 
 rent-rool of the Avondels. Now, though a woman of

 Lady Caddy's virtue must, as I have before observed, 
 hate all naughty proceedings, and though she entirely 
 wiped her hands of countenancing the (iffcnr between 
 the Lady Paulina and the earl, if there were any thing 
 in it (which indeed she doubted, never having seen 
 them together) she saw no harm in visiting the sus- 
 pected lady, having observed that the countenance and 
 conversation of a woman of virtue had sometimes pre- 
 served a backsliding sister from utter destruction. And 
 really if there ever were two contemporary Lucx-etias, 
 and had they met to abuse the Tarquins of the day, 
 their conversation could not have been more correct 
 than that of these inimitable friends, who talked over 
 every real and suspected faux-pas and crim-con of the 
 past and present age with such shuddering horror, that 
 it was wonderful their health was not injured. Pauli- 
 na in particular turned up her eyes and sighed out her 
 hopes, that she should never fall into such terrible dis- 
 grace, with so much pathos, that Lady Caddy became 
 convinced she was purity personified, 
 
 " I had no conception," said Paulina one morning to 
 her dear friend, " that the morals oi English women 
 were so very corrupt. Indeed, they exceed us Italians 
 in depravity ; for though the manners of our country 
 give a greater licence, and sanction those intimacies 
 and attachments between the difierent sexes which (I 
 have cause to lament) sul)ject women in this country 
 to undeserved reproach, yet actual guilt is so rare with 
 us that a family is thought degraded which ranks one 
 abandoned woman among its temales. Real:\', my 
 dearest Caddy, I think, like the great men of the east, 
 your nobles wear the horn as a symbol of honour. But 
 let me correct myself, the Mandevilles, Delamores, 
 and Avondels are exceptions. You have said nothing 
 against them, so I conclude all their spinsters were 
 Dianas and their matrons Faunas." 
 
 Lady Caddy shook her head. 
 
 " jNIercy !" exclaimed Paulina; "this is too shock- 
 ing, but you are a friend to these families, and I will 
 not urge you to disclose their secrets."

 " You Mall not brenthe a syllable to Lord Avondel V 
 *' Certainly not. Lord Avondel and I have so much 
 to say on other subjects relative to our respective stu- 
 dies, the climates and scenes we have visited, and the 
 present state of the European courts — Indeed, I see so 
 little of Lord Avondel except when he has the good- 
 ness to escort me abroad, for you know we foreigners 
 always expect a cicisbeo, that I could not find an op- " 
 portunity of talking to him about his own or his lady's 
 relations. My dearest Caddy, how odd it is in you to 
 think I dare take such a liberty with Lord Avondel.'* 
 Lady Caddy then, like another Pandora, raised the 
 lid of her box, and out flew secrets innumerable. The 
 earl's attachment to Lady Selina Delamore, the sepa- 
 ration of that lady's father and mother, for no good 
 certainly, though she never heard the particulars ; the 
 eccentricity and extravagance of Lady Honoria Man- 
 deville, the mysterious conclusion of Lord Avondel's 
 first engagement, and the retirement of the lady, were 
 all detailed under solemn injunctions of secrecy. For 
 as the earl had lately been very gracious to Sir Joseph, 
 either for reasons of state, or in gratitude for the 
 countenance he afforded to his friend, her ladyship 
 would not for the universe have offended his lordship 
 or diminished her hope of one day seeing his name in 
 her visiting list. Lady Paulina promised on her ho- 
 nour not to repeat what had been told her, and though, 
 as Touchstone observes, " an oath is not binding when 
 we swear by what we haVe not," she scrupulously kept 
 her word by carefulling concealing the intelligence till 
 she had cast it into such a shape, that even Lady Caddy 
 could not have recognized it as her own communica- 
 tion. 
 
 The next day, when they were alone, Paulina care- 
 fully fastened the door of the anti-room, and renewed 
 the attack in whispers. " I have scarcely rested, my 
 good friend," said she, " since you communicated to 
 me this most extraordinary occurrence. You say 
 Lord Avondel really was attached to that equivocal 
 Selina ?"

 " O most deeply ! Every body knows that whatever 
 he may now pretend, he never will feel such a regard 
 for any other." 
 
 Paulina coloured deeper than her rouge, but sup- 
 pressed her vexation at this mortifying assurance, and 
 vy'ent on to ask, if no blame, no malevolent whispers, 
 were attached to his character on this occasion ? Lady 
 Caddy was courtly enough to answer, that he was above 
 reproach. Paulina observed, there must have been 
 some motive for Selina's retirement ; and with fresh 
 assurances of secrecy urged her friend to be commu- 
 nicative. - " Why," said Lady Caddy, with important 
 gravity, " if you will be very reserved, — I do remem- 
 ber when I was a little child playing about the room 
 that I heard Mrs. Caudle tell my mother she had sus- 
 pected something a great while." 
 
 " Dreadful" exclaimed Paulina j " visible proofs of 
 indiscretion ?" 
 
 " I conclude so, and I think they said something of 
 a captain who was seen to leave the family with whoax 
 she resided at a very earl}' hour." 
 
 " Does Lord Avondel know this report ?" 
 
 " He did not for many years I am sure, for he went 
 abroad inconsolable ; but I suspect he has discovered 
 iiomcthing since his marriage, for I find he has for- 
 bidden his wife to have any intercourse with her aunt." 
 
 " Her aunt ?" returned Paulina with a sarcastic smile, 
 and eyes fixed on her companion's face. " Are you not 
 convinced that she is her mother ?" 
 
 Lady Caddy started, owned she was set upon think- 
 ing if it were possible. Lady Honoria Mandeville was 
 one of the most wayward creatures in tlie world. She 
 concluded with saying, " she certainly had a daugh- 
 ter." 
 
 "■ True," answered Paulina, but infants sometimes 
 die, and to conceal a sister's disgrace — " 
 
 " I do recollect," said Lady Caddy, '* the little girl 
 was taken ill while Sir James was out of England; 
 and the neighbourhood said, if she died, it would be 
 through the mother's neglect and mismanagement, and

 that her husband, who doated on this child, never- 
 would forgive her. But really, I always thought she 
 lived and is now Lady Avondel." 
 
 " Pray, mv dearest friend, did this happen just at 
 the time of Seiina's disappearing V 
 
 *' No, it was afterwards." 
 
 '^ Just as 1 <*xpected. Was any intercourse kept 
 vip betv/een Selina and her relations after her retire- 
 ment : " 
 
 " She never came to Mandeville Castle while Sir 
 James lived. Lady Honoria survived him, and when 
 she lay dying, Selina came and took the children ?" 
 
 " The girl you mean ?" 
 
 " No, both J but she gave up the boy to General 
 Mandeville." 
 
 " And became doatingly fond of the girl ?" 
 
 " Yes, educated and idolized her." 
 
 " And at last contrived to marry her to her own du- 
 ped degraded lover!" 
 
 " You have opened a new world to me, Lady Pau- 
 lina. I do really think what you hint at is possible." 
 
 " Possible ! my worthy friend : how much has your 
 candour hoodwinked your penetration not to have sus- 
 pected that their attachment was too remarkable for aunt 
 and niece. But 'tis ever thus with great minds, and 
 if sagacity w'ere not impeded by the unsuspicious ten- 
 dency of general benevolence, it would be impossible 
 for vicious characters to support themselves in the 
 M'orld. You must allow tne to reprove you for the on- 
 Iv fault I have ever seen in you, it is excess of cha- 
 rity. You are too apt to think people as worthy as 
 yourself." 
 
 Lady Caddy had no idea that she was thus credu- 
 lously kind, and promised to amend what she owned 
 was a great error. " On reflecting on this subject," said 
 she, " I do think Lady Honoria's real daughter cer- 
 tainly died, for three physicians were sent for, and five 
 apothecaries sat up in succession. There was such 
 fear lest Sir James should hear of it, and when the 
 child got better it was all hushed up."

 Paulina now inquired into the nature of the disor- 
 der, and finding it was the small pox declared no father 
 could know a child after the ravages of that disease. 
 ** Is it not surprising," said she, " that the pretended 
 heiress of Mandeville Castle bears no vestige of that 
 distemper ?" 
 
 Lady Caddy paused a few moments, and then ex- 
 claimed, " The changeling has no right to ^Mandeville 
 Castle." 
 
 " None, unquestionably," answered Paulina. " If 
 the fraud should be discovered, the wealthy heiress 
 will be reduced to the worth of her real father's com- 
 mission." The scrupulous justice of Lady Caddy now 
 discovered, that it would be doing an honourable ac- 
 tion to make a journey into Devonshire, and try what 
 might be picked up from old servants, adding, that 
 she could not bear to think, that eight thousand a year 
 was thrown into an indirect line by knavery and impo- 
 sition." 
 
 " For the sake of the noble Avondel," replied Pau- 
 lina, " let this business remain an unexploi'ed mystery. 
 Remember we are only suggesting probabilities, not 
 ascertaining facts. The Mandeville property is in the 
 possession of one who will render it a public blessing, 
 and by what you have told me of your English world, 
 his title is as good as that of most of his contempora- 
 ries. Unhappy man ! He is sufficiently afflicted with 
 a wayward wife. It would be cruel to deprive hiia of 
 her fortune while the incumbrance remains unaliena- 
 ble. See how the example of your confidence has 
 betrayed my prudence. You are the first to whom I 
 ever divulged my regret at Lord Avondel's domestic 
 wretchedness." 
 
 Intrusted with secrets and surmises of such conse- 
 quence, Lady Caddy returned home to ruminate, and 
 soon changed the possible into the probable ; and again 
 metamorphosed what was likely into what was true. 
 She drove to Lady Paulina's next morning, and on 
 her road thither met with fresh confirmation, for to the

 eye of slander as well as to that of jealousy, trifles af- 
 ford clear evidence of facts. 
 
 My admirable friend," said she, out of breath, 
 " are you quite alone ? O I am so impatient : all you 
 told me yesterday is fact." 
 
 " Pardon me," replied Paulina, *' the communica- 
 tion was j'ours : I only drew inferences from the facts 
 you stated." 
 
 " No matter," returned Lady Caddy, *' which of 
 us made the discovery ; 'tis all very true. The crea- 
 ture is in London, the very Selina Delamore. I am 
 confident I have seen her. It is not a trifle which has 
 brought her from Lime Grove. There is some plot, 
 some diabolical mischief about securing Castle Man- 
 deville." 
 
 Much as Paulina depended on her own power over 
 Lord Avondel, she felt alarmed at the idea of having 
 her influence disputed by a woman of whose attrac- 
 tions and abilities she had conceived as much appre- 
 hension as she underrated the passive charms of Emily ; 
 and she listened with trepidation to Lady Caddy's ac- 
 count, that she had met her in the Park that morning 
 in Ladv Glenvorne's carriage. The marchioness was 
 jcnown to patronise the injured countess, and no doubt 
 she had brought Selina to London to advise and com- 
 fort Emily. 
 
 " 'Tis really shocking," said Paulina, endeavour- 
 ing to conceal her dismay, " to what lengths an al:>an- 
 doned woman, who is careless of what she knows to 
 be a ruined character, will go. I understood you that 
 Lord Avondel forbad all intercourse between his coun- 
 tess and this creature ?" 
 
 " Unquestionably he did, and I am amazed the 
 marchioness should have the impertinence to advise 
 the breach of his orders. I was bowing to her as we 
 passed, when the wind blew aside the blind, and I 
 saw v/ho was her companion. I could not be mistak- 
 en, for I was using my opera glass, having observed 
 Lady Glenvorne generally wears very becoming morn- 
 ing bonnets."

 Paulina agreed with her friend, that such interferr 
 ence in family affairs must not be connived at, and 
 Lady Caddy was deputed to discover the present 
 abode and habits of the incognita. She soon returned 
 laden with full particulars and positive proof of the 
 marchioness's connivance at the rebellion of Emily 
 and Lady Selina. The mine being thus fully prepared, 
 Paulina commenced her attack on the earl of Avon- 
 del.

 • 
 POSSESSED of proofs of actual disobedience, and 
 such suspicions of spurious birth as would unsettle a 
 mind delicate even to fastidiousness, Paulina hoped 
 to eradicate from Lord Avondel's heart every remain- 
 ing sentiment of esteem for his unfortunate wife. She 
 took care that at his next visit he should surprise her 
 in tears. Unlike the majority of her sex, Paulina had 
 recourse to this mode of attack only on extraordinary 
 occasions, and by the rareness of its use made the ma- 
 iicKuvre irresistible ; and at the same time impressed 
 her infatuated lover with a high idea of her fortitude, 
 as contrasted with the undesigning and artless, but too 
 frequent sorrows of Emily. 
 
 These unusual signs of distress alarmed Avondel. 
 He inquired if it proceeded from the illness of her 
 son ? She answered her Sydney was well, but she 
 was in so melancholy a humour, that she doubted 
 whether any event which secured him from feeling 
 the sure attendants of protracted life ought to afflict 
 her. " I allude," said she, " not to physical but mo- 
 ral ills. ' Tis weakness and folly to complain of the 
 common infirmities of disease, the inclemency of the 
 seasons, or the vicissitudes of fate and fortune. But 
 there are miseries v/hich the generous heart is most 
 prone to feel, against which wisdom, valour, virtue, 
 every distinguishing quality of the mind, every ac- 
 quired accomplishment" — Here she turned her eyes 
 on the earl, and then averting tl^em ^vith a sort of

 ngonlzed compassion, exclaimed, " O my friend, I 
 have heard such a tale, but I dare not trust my own 
 prudence and plighted confidence. Let me intreat you 
 to leave me lest I betray myself and make you wretch- 
 ed." 
 
 The earl answered with great firmness^ that among 
 tlie duties of that sacred character with which she had 
 honoured him, one was not to leave her when she ap- 
 peared to want advice or consolation. '^ Nor am I," 
 said he, " rendered so callous by the reiterated wounds 
 of disappointment and sorrow as to be insensible of the 
 impending evil which you seem to intimate now points 
 at me." 
 
 "■ And you have really suffered, really endured the 
 pangs of blasted hope and undeserved affliction ? God- 
 like man ! Every interview discloses new excellencies. 
 This is the first time I have ever heard you complain 
 of the injustice of fortune. By the serenity and con- 
 stant elevation of your mind, I should have character- 
 ized you as dignified Content reposing on the lap of 
 Prosperity." 
 
 To make a compliment palatable, we should aim at 
 discovering what the complimented wishes to be 
 thought, rather than what he really is. As Lord 
 Avondel preserved in public a lofty reserve respecting 
 his own expectations, he was not aware that he so far 
 relaxed in private that scarcely a day passed without 
 his permitting himself to unbosom his wrongs and dis- 
 appointments to his confidential friends. But as he 
 piqued himself on the character of patient magnanim- 
 ity* and despised that of an habitual grumbler, he did 
 not, while listening to Paulina's eulogy, recollect that 
 ill-founded praise is biting satire. 
 
 " My inestimable friend," said he, apparently intox- 
 icated with the sweet beverage his Circe had prepared 
 with so much skill, *' the world in its best point of view 
 affords little to gratify a refined and intelligent mind, 
 especially if its early visions were devoted to the con- 
 templation of imaginary perfection." The deep sigh

 Emily's Incapacity to realise the romantic dreams of 
 his youthful fancy, told Paulina the unwelcome truth, 
 that all her blandishments and all her graces had not 
 obliterated the indelible impression of Selina's pure 
 and sublime attractions. The indignant feelings of 
 offended vanity and disappointed love renewed her 
 courage, and she resolved to supplant her rival or lose 
 him for ever. 
 
 " My dearest Avondel," said she, in a tone of soft 
 compassion, " I have heard the story of your early 
 love. Your wrongs and woes are of such a nature 
 that you only could feel, you only pardon ; and since I 
 f.nd you know what I was unwilling to communicate, 
 I must say that I revere your magnanimity in forgiv- 
 ing that unhappy woman so far as to allow her to re- 
 side near her daughter." 
 
 Avondel's eyes shot fire. Pale as death, and trem- 
 bling with horror, in a sepulchral tone he exclaimed, 
 " Unhappy woman ! Daughter ! Whom — what do you 
 mean ?" 
 
 " "What have I said r" answered Paulina. " Have 
 I made any discovery ? Do you know that Lady Seli- 
 
 na Delamore lives in street, where your wife 
 
 visits her with Lady Glenvorne ?" 
 
 "What daughter?" inquired the agonized earl, 
 stamping with anguish. " My wife is Selina's niece." 
 
 " O yes, certainly her niece. The world calls her 
 so. Dearest Avondel, how you terrify me by this ex- 
 travagance." I begin to fear I have tortured you by 
 disclosing something you were not appri?>ed of." 
 
 " I am calm," answered Lord Avondel. " Do you 
 know any thing to disprove the fact of Emily's being 
 the daughter of Sir James Mandeville by Lady Ho- 
 noria ?" 
 
 "■What can a stranger know on such a subject? Do 
 not let a mistaken appellation, hastily uttered, convey 
 such suspicions to your mind. Your wife inherits the 
 Mandeville fortunes. She was brought up as a child 
 of that family. Absurd suggestion ! Why should you 
 suppose her the child of Selina ?"

 Till Paulina suggested it, Avondel never had form- 
 ed such a conjecture. It now shot across his brain 
 like a barbed arrow. He saw it in the shape of a ter- 
 rific vision too horrible to be defined. Sinking into 
 gloomy silence he shuddered at the recollection of 
 some circumstances which told him it viight be true. 
 O, worse than death ! O state more dolorous than the 
 turbulent fantasies of real distraction ! To survive the 
 destruction of all those comforts which untainted ho- 
 hour and conscious rectitude could confirm ! Sclina 
 must have had some reason for her conduct to him, 
 some motive for her concealment, some imperative 
 cause which still condemned her to silence. She con- 
 fessed she had, and that the discovery would make 
 him wretched. Wretched indeed ! He had adored a 
 strumpet, and married the offspring of that illicit 
 amour which had doomed his youth to despair and 
 mortification. Did he bold the ample possessions of 
 the JNIandeville and Delamore families by a spurious 
 title, to the injury of the lav/ful inheritors? If wealth 
 and justice were incompatible, the former had no at- 
 tractions in his eye. He would doff the purloined 
 robe of opulence, and return to that honourable poverty 
 ■which bred no secret reproaches to taunt an upright 
 mind. Yes, he would again be the poor earl of Avon- 
 del, and educate his son to gain his subsistence by his 
 sword, rather than sufler him to profit by the crimes of 
 his actual progenitors. Was he then to publish Emily's 
 disgrace ? His reflections took another turn. Was it 
 probable, or indeed possible, that the Mandevilles 
 should knowingly adopt the base issue of a relative of 
 Lady Honoria's, a woman whose folly and extrava- 
 gance they ever condemned ? They must have been 
 cheated by the introduction of a suppositious child. 
 But had Honoria the weakness thus to injure her own 
 offspring? Had Selina the art and baseness to conduct 
 such a fraud ? He recalled to his mind's eye the undt- 
 faced impression of her countenance, so mild and in- 
 genuous, so replete with purity and disinterestedness. 
 Could he connect the idea of a wanton and a swindler

 with those features ? A fresh thought suggested itself 
 to his mind ; might not PauHna be artful and malici- 
 ous ? I can no otherwise account for this suspicion not 
 ripening into conviction, than from his raising his eyes 
 to look at her features, when seeing beauty in its most 
 fascinating form fixed in contemplating his emotion 
 and weeping for his distress, he afforded another in- 
 stance of the lamentable truth, that " the wisest heads 
 and noblest hearts," when duped by female artifice, 
 betray as much folly and criminality as inferior minds, 
 who, in their more frequent deviations from rectitude, 
 do not so much shock our moral feelings, as those who 
 we know must do violence to their natures when they 
 renounce the obligations of duty. 
 
 Paulina suffered Avondel to ruminate, till she saw 
 his scrutinizing glances fixed on her face, and then 
 calJed in the assistance of language to confirm the 
 powerful artillery of her eyes. She grasped his hand, 
 intreated his forgiveness ; " but," said she, " if you 
 are so merciful, I never shall forgive myself for the 
 torture my indiscretion has given you. Is it possible ? 
 I will not ask you in this moment of your surprise and 
 anger, but will you in future endeavour to acquit me 
 of any base motive ? My tongue should have rested in 
 eternal silence, had I not thought from you owning 
 yourself unhappy, that you had heard these distressing 
 rumours." 
 
 Lord Avondel listened no longer, but bade her tell 
 him, what distressing rumours she meant. 
 
 " I shall wound your delicacy, my lord, and shock 
 my own ; but I have gone too far to be reserved now. 
 The cause of St-lina's sudden retirement is too clearly 
 ascertained ; her matronly friends perceived its neces- 
 sity. It is very true Lady Mandeville had a daughter 
 born about that time, but there is, I fear, too positive 
 proof that this child died in her infancy, through the 
 mother's negligence. She was then living on very ill 
 terms with her husband ; he v.'as absent ; he adored 
 this child : it was necessary therefore that its loss 
 should be supplied. The rest I own is all inference

 and conjecture, founded on a visit which Sclina made 
 to her sister, and her extraordinary fondness of your 
 Emilia. It may be a malevolent conclusion; of this 
 at least Selina must be acquitted, your marriage with 
 the ostensible heiress of the Mandevilles is not to be 
 ascribed to her influence." 
 
 The young countess's evil genius at this moment 
 suggested to the earl's mind her innocent acknowledg- 
 ment, that it was her aunt who first taught her to lov>:; 
 him, and the playful confession of bridal tenderness 
 was now tortured by the brain-sick nobleman, into an- 
 other proof of a diabolical plot to disgrace him, and 
 secure an honourable establishment in marriage for the 
 base born fdbndling she had surreptitiously foisted in- 
 to an illustrious family. Thus was his whole life ren- 
 dered miserabk ; thus was infamy entailed on his pos- 
 terity, by one he had contemplated as the paragon of 
 perfection. 
 
 Again his soul recoiled from this conclusion. On 
 what was it founded ? An unauthenticated tale, per- 
 haps invented by some malignant gossip, and repeated 
 by a woman, faultless indeed as far as respected him- 
 self; but were he Monthermer, could he place any 
 confidence in her fidelity and veracity ? Yet she was a 
 foreigner, and too much a stranger to the respective 
 families to fabricate this story. Some rumours must 
 be afloat. Oh ! the soul-harrowing thought, that there 
 must be whispers of such a tendency ! With a stern 
 aspect, he bade Paulina give up her informer. 
 
 " It is my intention to do so," answered the false 
 Italian, " but not till your agitation has so far subsided, 
 as to convince me you will do nothing rash, nothing 
 that will endanger your own reputation, or the rights 
 of your child. I will only at present tell you, that 
 my friend is most sincerely yours, and thinks you 
 ought to be quiescent, unless the nearest male heirs of 
 the jMandevilles notice these rumours, and probably 
 they are so remote, and their rights so dubious, tlwit 
 their claims never can be adjusted, even if Lady Avon- 
 del's— " -^ ^

 " I have no business, Madam, with the rights of 
 others. It will be sufficient for me to defend what 
 are truly my own, or to resign what upon investigation 
 appears to be indefensible, without being exposed to 
 the disgrace of an iniquitous contest." 
 
 " Oh ! ever true to rectitude and truth !" said Pau- 
 lina, with energetic warmth, " my informant will act, 
 or be passive, as you require. If you wish for testi- 
 mony, the servants in the family and the medical atten- 
 dants may be questioned." 
 
 " I shall take the management of this business into 
 my own hands," returned the earl, rising, " my heart's 
 first wish is to escape from a world in which I have 
 lived too long." 
 
 " To privacy or to death would you go ?" said Pau- 
 lina, detaining him; "in either state I will be your at- 
 tendant. I will minister to your undeserved sorrows, 
 and if they wholly weigh down your mind, I will es-

 thermer will not be broken-hearted ; he will find some 
 passive, gentle, willing fair one, with a mind as vapid

 you have heard an oath which may arrest your rash- 
 ness. Whatever are your resolves, your fate shall be 
 mine." 
 
 " Pity my distress, and do not aggravate it," said 
 Avondel, hiding his face with the decorum of a dying 
 Ciesar, unwilling to shew his manly features while dis- 
 torted by agonizing grief. 
 
 " *Tis I," said Paulina, almost terrified by the 
 success of her devices, " that have made you thus 
 wretched." 
 
 " No," said the earl, somewhat recovering his for- 
 titude, " it M'as kind in you not to let me be the only 
 ignorant person. But no more ; start some other sub- 
 ject, wide as the antipodes. Have you tried your new 
 harp ? He paused a moment, but ere she could waken 
 the vibrating chords, he started, and asked her if the 
 rumour were generally credited ?" 
 
 Desirous to unravel part of her web of mischief, 
 Paulina owned it was merely a cautious whisper, 
 which, if managed with prudence, might soon die 
 away. '"' It seems," continued she, " revived by La- 
 dy Selina's re-appearance, and the only measure I 
 should recommend, would be insisting on her leaving 
 London." 
 
 In the more irritating suspicion of his wife's dis- 
 graceful birth. Lord Avondel had lost sight of this 
 positive act of disobedience, which he determined to 
 notice with due severity. Tossed in the whirl of con- 
 tending passions, he had yet the judgment to perceive 
 that the sympathy of his dear and excellent friend ag- 
 gravated his distress. Affecting, therefore, a compo- 
 sure which he did not feel, he assured her that his 
 principles and character would preserve both his con- 
 duct and person from any act of hasty frenzv, and 
 with cordial assurances of forgiveness, and even of 
 gratitude for her last proof of friendship, he hastened 
 to a home which had long been distateful and was now 
 terrible. 
 
 Paulina's malice could not have fixed upon a day 
 which was more likely to give effect to her diabolical

 contrivances. It was the second anniversary of Lord 
 Avondel's marriage, and as the common decencies of 
 lift required that it should be celebrated like the first, 
 on pain of having all the gossips in London know what 
 a painful alteration one year had made, he had felt 
 himself obliged to make that a festival which, even 
 previously to his ^■isit to Paulina, he considered as a 
 day of humiliation. A large dinner party had been 
 invited, and Emily, supported by her friend the mar- 
 chioness, endeavoufed, in the recollection of the sen- 
 timents with which she had once welcomed that morn- 
 ing, to forget her present feelings. The earl, on his 
 part, was called upon to play the happy husband at the 
 moment that his heart execrated the connubial tie, and 
 he was to preserve his reputation as the elegant host 
 and best bred man in Europe, while he hated the whole 
 world except Paulina, whom, notwithstanding an in- 
 timation that such an occasional attention would be 
 grateful to him, the countess had omitted in her invita- 
 tions. 
 
 He once determined to plead indisposition and re- 
 tire to his chamber, but remembering that this would 
 fix the object he most wished to avoid by his bed-side, 
 and expose him to the torture of her solicitations, and 
 to the impertinence of medical attendance, he resolved 
 not to have recourse to this plea, unless as an excuse 
 for negligence and abstraction after the ladies had re- 
 tired. Disdaining to be disconcerted by women, Lord 
 Avondel entered the drdwing-room with all the con- 
 scious dignity of his lofty sex, feeling like Othello the 
 hardness of dissimulation. He received the common- 
 place complin^.ents of his friends with civility. Emily 
 advanced to meet him with all the timid loveliness of 
 apprehensive tenderness. " On these occasions," said 
 he, " we do well to revive the old baronial customs. 
 In gratitude for the honour Lady Avondel did me, I 
 must to-day appear solely hers." The enraptured 
 countess pressed his offered hand with fond affection. 
 He led her to the dining table, placed himself by her 
 side, and deputed his chaplain to act as host. The

 debut vvas admirable. Emily felt the vivacity she be- 
 fore aflfected. Avpndel took his wine rapidly, and 
 with hurried conviviality exerted himself to amuse 
 and occupy the attention of his guests. 
 
 All would have glided off smoothly but for the pre- 
 sence of a character which never fails to excite dis- 
 turbance in the glossy surface of fashionable society. 
 This was a Mr. Frankly, a plain Devonshire esquire, 
 who knew nothing of the world, uttered all he thought, 
 and never took the trouble of inquiring into the con- 
 nections and private histories of the company he fre- 
 quented, and thus became remarkable, and I may 
 add terrible, for saying every thing that should not 
 have been named, without excepting the praises of the 
 political rival of his host, or the infidelitv of the gal- 
 lant of his hostess. Mr. Frankly first probed Lord 
 Avondel's festering wounds, by observing the striking 
 resemblance of the countess to Lady Selina, whom he 
 had seen at JNIandeville Castle, and thought her the 
 greatest beauty of her age. He then scared the re- 
 turning rose from Emily's cheeks by remarking, that 
 he had heard his old school-fellow. General Monther- 
 mer, had married a Florentine lady, who was the 
 most extraordinary person ever known, rich, beautiful, 
 witty, and accomplished. He found she was a friend 
 of this family, wished he had met her, and appealed 
 to Lady Avondel to say if she was indeed so dange- 
 rously captivating. Nothing could have been easier 
 or more correct than to have said " Yes," b\ut Emily 
 was dumb. An emotion like being choaked induced 
 the earl to order a glass of water. She thanked him 
 with her eyes, and Lady Glenvorne endeavoured to 
 relieve her by telling the native^ that ladies never de- 
 cided on each other's beauty. " Well then," said 
 Frankly, " I'll appeal to the gentlemen. Come, my 
 lord, give us your opinion." " Which is entirely in 
 her favour," returned the earl, carelessly, " and I 
 propose Lady Paulina Monthermer to you as a zest to 
 a glass of Champagne." The joyous Frankly rubbed

 his bands, called for a bumper, and declared himself 
 delighted with his friend's good fortune. 
 
 " I find he is expected in England so soon," said 
 Frankly, " that I will stay in London till he comes, 
 and judge for myself of tbis wonderful creature." — 
 Emily asked, when the general was expected ? Frank- 
 ly answered, that he had heard from Falmouth that 
 the Indiamen were beating about the mouth of the 
 channel. He then expatiated on the unesiness an af- 
 fectionate wife must endure whilst her husband was 
 exposed to the conflicting elements ; but the inaptitude 
 of this remark as applied to Paulina had such an effect 
 upon the company, that the pain of restraining their 
 , risible muscles in due decorum was even visible to 
 Frankly, who looked round with astonishment, per- 
 ceiving something was wrong, but unable to guess 
 what he could have said that was so covertly comical. 
 Lady Glenvorne, pitying the countess's ill concealed 
 agitation, complained of the heat of the room, and 
 the ladies withdrew. Frankly started up in admira- 
 tion, followed Emily with his eyes, and then exclaim- 
 ed, " Never was such a resemblance! just her height, 
 look, manner. I have rarely seen a daughter so like 
 a mother." 
 
 " Daughter ! Mother !" Lord Avondel ftlt these, 
 cabalistical words revive the slumbering scorpions 
 which lacerated his heart. He looked round to see if 
 his friends understood that they had a latent mean- 
 ing, and, like most unhappy people who practise phy- 
 siognoniy in such circumstances, explained the embar- 
 rassment into which his evident agitation had thrown 
 his guests into a corroboration that his shame was pub- 
 lic. " Mr. Frankly," said he, with that petrifying look 
 v^hich would have silenced most men, " your memory 
 may have failed you. It is many years since you have 
 seen the lady you allude to." He turned to address 
 a person who sat opposite, but Frankly was invincible. 
 *■' No, my lord," said he, " by the merest accident 
 I discovered Lady Selina walking in the park this 
 morning very early. I should not have known her

 but from her voice. Perhaps your lordship may re- 
 member it was the most melodious that ever was heard. 
 She was talking to a lame soldier whom she had re- 
 lieved. I made myself known to her, and told her 
 I was coming to dine here. We talked you all over. I 
 find she lives in town, to be near her dear child, I 
 suppose." The earl answered, " You were infinitely 
 fortunate," and continued to avert his face from 
 Frankly, secretly resolving to add preservation from 
 talkative rustics among his deprecatory petitions. 
 
 The company soon dispersed. Avondel ordered a 
 separate apartment, complained of indisposition arising 
 from fatigue, and prohibited intrusion. He neither 
 obtained nor courted repose. His pillow was too visi- 
 bly covered v^ith thorns to invite him to recline his 
 aching head, and his desire of privacy solely arose 
 from his wishing to have leisure to ruminate oil what 
 course he should adopt. It was plain Selina was in 
 London ; so far Paulina's evidence was correct. It 
 was probable a clandestine intercourse was kept up be- 
 tween Emily and her aunt. Suppose he charged his 
 countess with the fact ? The timid mean-spirited wo- 
 man would deny it, as she had done complaining of 
 his indifference and cruelty, and thus only add to her 
 own littleness without giving him any information. 
 What if he braved his own indignant feelings, and 
 forced himself to see Selina, and extort from her a full 
 confession of his injuries ? She had stood firmly 
 against his solemn intreaties, )-et she had said enough 
 by confessing he would be wretched when all was 
 known. Fatal prediction, uttered with the precision 
 of conscious guilt! It must be as Paulina suggested, 
 as the world suggested, l^he endearing recollections 
 of his early admiration bade him avoid the fallen cri- 
 minal Selina. No, though her voice might still retain 
 its corporeal music, the yell of the furies would not be 
 so petrifying as to listen to the strains of heaven dic- 
 tated by a diabolical mind. 
 
 Thus Wiis the name of Avondel united to infamy. 
 Thus had he given birth to a child heir to the disgrace

 of its mother, and the circumscribed fortunes of its 
 ill-fated father. Yet, again, had not this boy a natural, 
 if not a legal right to the Delamore inheritance, or 
 was that also forfeited by Selina's incontinence ? He 
 determined to inspect the writings of the respective 
 families, and to despatch a confidential friend into De- 
 vonshire, and till the discovery was clearly ascertained, 
 consider himself rather as the steward than the repre- 
 sentative of his wife's reputed ancestors. Should im- 
 position be made out, his duty would be plain, to sur- 
 render the estates to their rightful owners, to allow 
 his wife a separate maintenance, and retire to the con- 
 tinent with his son, whom he would educate to bear his 
 hard fortunes. But while his soul remained tortured 
 with suspense, he resolved to avoid the presence of 
 the unhappy being to whom be was so unequally 
 yoked.

 EARLY in the morning Lord Avondel received a 
 note from Paulina. 
 
 '■'• I have," said she, " all night endured tortures 
 vorse than stemming the fiery stream of Phlegethon. 
 I have heard, that after nobly struggling with your mi- 
 series, your anguish affected your health, and you re- 
 tired severely indisposed. Lives my Avondel ? O the 
 cruel interdiction of narrow suspicion, gross in its 
 ideas, while affecting purit}'. I am forbidden from 
 watching by your couch, lulling you to sleep with my 
 voice, or pressing your burning temples with my hands. 
 Alas ! that she only is denied to minister to your woes 
 who can enter into all the refined sensations of wound- 
 ed honour. Generous Avondel ! write to me but two 
 sentences, — that you live, and that you forgive the inad- 
 vertent zeal which rashly drew aside the veil that con- 
 cealed vour disgraces from yourself. The miseries 
 which I suffer on my own account will overwhelm me 
 with despair, unless you intimate that you sympathize 
 in the agonies of her who trembles at the near pros- 
 pect of being claimed as the wife of Monthermer." 
 
 Absorbed in meditation of his own disgraces and 
 M'rongs, Lord Avonutl had lately thought of Paulina 
 only as she had been the messenger of evil tidings, 
 and was more inclined to scrutinize the veracity of her 
 testimony than to conjecture the probable consequences 
 of the general's return to England. He had seen in-

 stances of the violence of her passions, and dreading 
 their effect, should his negligence urge her to depair, 
 he determined to pay her one more visit, though rather 
 with sentiments of compassion and subdued resent- 
 ment, than of admiration, or love. 
 
 He found her in the deepest affliction, a dangerous 
 state for a susceptible high-minded man to behold a 
 beautiful insinuating woman, who had art enough to 
 persuade him that he was the cause of her distress. 
 The soul-felt anguish of Avondel was, however, an 
 alleviation rather than addition to her sorrows. In the 
 impending arrival of Monthermer she saw the crisis of 
 her fate. Like many other coquettes, she had become 
 entangled in her own snare, and while she proposed to 
 gratify revenge revived the embers of unextinguished 
 love. In propoi-tion as her passion for Avondel in- 
 creased to warm enthusiasm, her contempt for her hus- 
 band deepened into aversion, and as her romartic ima- 
 gination loaded her favourite with virtues, so it enve- 
 loped the ill-fated general in vices of which his frank, 
 careless, pliant, yet irritable, disposition was really in- 
 capable. With pngan idolatry, and more than pagan 
 barbarity, she deified the winds and waves, calling 
 upon them to whirl the ship which bore this loathsome 
 freight to any other shore, or to inhume it in the dark 
 abyss rather than disclose to her eyes the offensive and 
 odious sight of the man she wedded to answer a sinis- 
 ter purpose, and whose affection inspired her with 
 scorn instead- of gratitude. The violence of the wind 
 for some davs had communicated hopes which can onh' 
 be termed infernal ; but should he escape being dashed 
 upon the rocks which engirt the queen of islands, she 
 determined the moment which ascertained his safety 
 should be that of her flight. Guilt and concealment, 
 or, what she still more abhorred, poverty and disgrace, 
 would be to her far preferable to sitting by his side on 
 one of the golden thrones of India, and ruling pros- 
 trate millions with despotic sway. Yet, in a hmd of 
 strangers, the fugitive consort of a man of high rank 
 would want a protector, and solitude would require a

 companion. Whom but Avondel could she choose as 
 that guardian associate ? Could he but be induced to 
 elope with her ! — Elope ! the model of correct princi- 
 ples and virtuous conduct elope ! Could she expect 
 that the dignified nobleman, the mflexible patriot, the 
 austere legislator, would soil his high reputation by 
 adultery? cancel his own solemn vows, forget the 
 claims which honour and professed friendship urged on 
 Monthermer's behalf, renounce not only his wife and 
 child but also his right to public esteem, and the emi- 
 nent station he held in society, to steal away the wife of 
 another, and lurk like a trembling criminal in appre- 
 hensive concealment, fearful lest his own servants 
 should betray him f — The deed must be disguised, 
 some softer terms must be used, or the pi-oject was 
 impracticable. 
 
 Yet, if she looked at her past achievements, did 
 any thing appear too hard for skill and enterprise like 
 hers ? She had made Lord Avondel detest his wife, 
 and execrate the woman he had once adored. Between 
 settled hate, springing from a conviction of ill usage, 
 and open renunciation, there are few intermediate 
 steps. She was aware of the resolution which Avon- 
 del's delicacy would induce him to frame, namely, that 
 he would virtually abjure the. bond he could not public- 
 ly dissolve : and though adulterer had a foul sound it 
 might be disguised by fair appendages. Lawless love 
 might (such are the flexible terms of modern morals) be 
 called justice to an unfortunate being whom his friend- 
 ship had deprived of peace and fame, and exposed to the 
 vindictive spirit of an uxorious, but jealous and vehe- 
 ment, husband. She placed much confidence in that 
 false honour which prompts a man to protect even the 
 most infamous of women who can plead that she suf- 
 fers opprobrium on his account. Then she would on- 
 ly talk of a prudent and temporary retirement, till 
 Abomeleque's fury was blown over, of hours devoted 
 to the most refined and elegant enjoyments, of pure 
 pleasures, of sanctified friendship, uf an earthly imi- 
 tiuion of the communion of celestial spirits, consisting

 in perfect love, entire confidence uninterrupted har- 
 mony, the result of the kindred wishes of according 
 minds linked together by the indissoluble tie of chas- 
 tity and honour, without the needless obligation of le- 
 gal restraints, and secure from that alienating satiety 
 which results from palled passions, the general bane 
 of matrimonial happiness. She would talk thus, and 
 trust to the common effect of those passions when ex- 
 cited by opportunity and released from the restricting 
 fear of shame by the consciousness of having already 
 incurred opprobrium. These she doubted not would 
 soon impel Avondel to a crime which would free her 
 from a detested bond, and then in the eventual death 
 of the meek and virtuous Emily (which she considered 
 as the certain consequence of her lord's disgrace) she 
 might claim from the perverted honour of her para- 
 mour that station which, when she was young and in- 
 nocent he had refused to her love. This done, if he 
 could not submit to live in England a degraded citizen, 
 her large inheritance on the flowry banks of Arno af- 
 forded them an asylum. There her taste and talents 
 might expatiate in a clime fruitful in the beauties of 
 art and nature, and in society more congenial than 
 among antiquated gossips, toad-eaters, and cormorants, 
 to which she saw she was condemned in England. 
 
 Such were Paulina's views, and, lamentable to add, 
 she soon wrought the Earl of Avondel to her purpose. 
 With infinite address, she pi-evailed upon him to ac- 
 knowledge obligation for having convinced him that 
 he had been degraded by his marriage, and rescuing 
 him from being the unconscious jest of his acquaint- 
 ance. She spoke of the fatal consequences their friend- 
 ship had brought upon her renown, and having descri- 
 bed the sacrifice in terms which implied she felt its 
 value, she protested with vehement enthusiasm that 
 she v/ould endure an infinitely greater loss for the glo- 
 ry of being the chosen friend of his soul. When she 
 saw her apparently disinterested attachment had mov- 
 ed his sensibility, she ventured to ask, if he thought 
 the Indiaman could have ridden out the late storms,

 aclJiiig her doubts of Monthermer's safety in terms 
 which spoke more of hope than apprehension. Lord 
 Avondel reproved her with his eye, and nobly express- 
 ed his xvish, that the soldier who had fought his coun- 
 try's battles might for many years repose in her peace- 
 ful and happy clime. "■ I join your wish my lord," 
 said Paulina, recollecting herself, '* may he live, but it 
 must be at a distance from me. This hand, devoted 
 to you as a sign of holy friendship, shall never again 
 be given in pledge of the union which my heart re- 
 nounces. Even a v/oman's fears confirm a woman's 
 delicacy, and bid me as I tender my life preserve my 
 person from the brutal violence of an enraged sensual- 
 ist. My enemies will soon tell JNIonthermer how my 
 fame has been scandalized through the weakness, if 
 not malice, of her whose name would wound your feel- 
 ings. O Avondel i you kno v not what Montherraer 
 is become since you left India, bloated with excess, 
 the unreflecting slave of tremendous passions. When 
 he learns that I have so deported myself that the vir- 
 tuous fly my society, my life will be the immediate sa- 
 crifice, for he has been too long the despotic lord of 
 slaves to retain those generous feelings which oni}- in 
 minds like yours withstand the corruption of manners 
 and climes. For your sake, for my child's sake, to 
 preserv-e him from the contamination of such a father, 
 I feel it my duty to live. Perhaps, too, in pity to 
 Monthermer : the penalties of mai'der are under your 
 system of police so inevitable, even self-destruction 
 would be better, if there be no other alternative ; I 
 might then choose the easiest way of welcoming eter- 
 nal sleep." 
 
 Avondel shuddered. His disturbed mind snw no 
 other expedient but flight, to which Paulina pointed. 
 But she was a stranger, could i^.e decline acting the part 
 of her friend? Her pleading t) es told him he h-.-d re- 
 duced her to this dilemma. — Was there any harm in 
 his procuring her an obscure residence, or in his act- 
 ing as her protector till she could hi rcmov d to Italy, 
 and placed under the care of her natural guardians ?

 Her flight would be attended with a thousand dangers 
 unless he stretched his succouring arm over the alien, 
 who, though almost of princely birth and fortune, was 
 now in a land of strangers and enemies ; of enemies 
 originating from his attachment. She read his thoughts, 
 and while he paused dressed up the proposed elope- 
 ment in that virtue-like garb she so well knew how to 
 fit upon vice, that in a moment of fatal weakness and 
 blinded judgment Lord Avondel consented to brave 
 the extremes of guilt and woe, by committing a crime 
 far blacker than that for which, on a false accusa- 
 tion, he first began to hate the innocent Emily. I 
 speak of his judgment when reason sat calmly upon her 
 throne; not when warped by the blandishments of art- 
 ful beauty, or misled by the sophistry of false honour. 
 
 Behold, then, the noble, the virtuous, the wise, earl 
 of Avondel, allured step by step from the limbo of 
 vanity through the Utopian paradise of Platonic friend- 
 ship, and the- chaotic regions of doubt and anguish till 
 he arrived at that shelving precipice which beetles over 
 the infernal regions of adultery ; — a region of dark- 
 ness with respect to every gleam of real comfort, a re- 
 gion too which may often be termed the land of death ! 
 Behold him whose resplendent actions invited scruti- 
 ny, and flashed confusion on those who strove to ac- 
 cuse him of base purposes, closeted with his confiden- 
 tial servant, and turning aside his blushing face while 
 he deputed him to select a residence in some retired 
 spot for a purpose he cotild not name. Behold the 
 orator confused and dumb, the statesman without a 
 resource, the man of elegant manners and blameless 
 morals shuffling in the unpractised art of evasion, and 
 compelled to demean himself by affecting causeless 
 anger to rid himself of the reproach resulting from the 
 presence of an agent he condescended to employ ! 
 
 The confidant Lord Avondel selected was his valet. 
 He had often been employed as his lord's almoner, but 
 had never till now been called upon to act as the pan- 
 der of his amours, and his soul recoiled from the task 
 proposed. He had been faithful to his lord and lady

 while their interests remained united, but ns he was a 
 man of discernment and upright intentions he did not 
 long doubt which side he should take in the event of a 
 rupture. At one of Lady Glenvorne's visits to the 
 countess her foot slipped on the stairs, and she escaped 
 a severe fall by the agility of Johnson, who received 
 some slight injurv in his effort to save her. The mar- 
 chioness's gratitude was not confined to a pecuniary 
 gratuity, her daily inquiries after his hurt till he was 
 quite recovered formed a sort of intimacy which led 
 to further communications. Lady Glenvorne some- 
 times ventured to ask, if his lord had spent the prece- 
 ding evening at home, and Johnson's negative was ge- 
 nerally accompanied by an intelligent look, full of grief, 
 shame, and respectful attachment to him whom he si- 
 lently condemned. 
 
 Burthened with an unwelcome trust, Johnson wish- 
 ed to have his honest but uninformed judgment direct- 
 ed by a more enlightened mind, and with much regret 
 he communicated to the marchioness the suspicions 
 which his lord's extraordinary commission had excited. 
 — This order coming at a tmie when the general was 
 hourly expected, and when the earl so markedly avoid- 
 ed his countess, confirmed all Ladv Glen\'orne's fears. 
 She consulted Selina, and then advised J';hnson to exe- 
 cute his commission immediately, lest it should be dele- 
 gated to one who would be less faithful to his amiable 
 lady. It was settled that Lady Glenvorne should 
 know all his proceedings, and Johnson set oflF to pre- 
 pare a rural Alexandria, where the new Antony was to 
 sacrifice virtue and renown, not on the altar of love, 
 but at the shrine of false honour, to which deceit and 
 suspicion had led him a hood-winked worshipper ; per- 
 suading him it was his duty to shield the infamous 
 though the effort was necessarily combined with a de- 
 reliction of those engagements which every law of 
 God and man bade him revere, and though in sharing 
 the fortunes of a faithless wife he onlv immersed his 
 own fame without raising the profligate from the depths 
 of opprobrium.

 It seems extraordinary that the gentle Emily, whose 
 constitutional weakness shrunk at the distant threaten- 
 ing of the tempest, was not annihilated by its near 
 approach. But it ofttn happens, that an apprehensive 
 temper, whtn combined with a good heart, underrates 
 its own fortitude, and afterwards discovers supports in 
 sorrow, and reliefs in pain, of which in anticipating 
 the iuture it discerned no prospect. She could no lon- 
 ger persuade herself that her lord's virtues and excel- 
 lencies realized the visions her ardent imagination had 
 painted. Yet affection was still true to its object. She 
 believed she had been much to blame in not trying to 
 be more agret-able, and, like Desdemona, whatever was 
 his usage she still was fixed " to love him dearl)'." 
 Most gladly would she have commuted the public dis- 
 grace which she knew attached to his misconduct for 
 even cruel usage to herself in private, could his errors 
 bvit have been concealed. She wished to share the cen- 
 sures that were pointed at him. She wished the pro- 
 vocations which she had given him were known. Yet, 
 did she really mean to provoke him ? Her temper was 
 unhappy, her conversation too puerile to gratify a man 
 of his refined taste, but how ardent was her wish to 
 please ? Paulina with all her pov/ers of enchantment 
 was too vain and dissipated to feel the entire devotion 
 and chaste fidelity of true love. 
 
 But the blame which never-dying affection still 
 averted from her lord fell on his guilty companion, who, 
 under the mask of friendship, concealed a settled pur- 
 pose to make her wretched. She pondered on all her 
 successive wiles, her attempt to awe her by the dis- 
 play of superior talents, to pique her by boasting 
 of Avondel's friendship and munificence, to lull her 
 suspicions asleep by professions of attachment, to be- 
 tray her into the practice of coquetry, or to draw from 
 her those unmeaning complaints of petty differences 
 which disturb the happiest unions, and which even af- 
 fectionate wives will sometimes disclose in that unre- 
 strained frivolity of confidence which is the blama- 
 ble part of female friendship. But though encou-

 raged by the avowal of her indifference, or rather 
 dislike, to Monthcrmer, Emily recollected with satis- 
 faction, that love had acted as an ally to prudence, and 
 that she had compelled malice to have recourse to false- 
 hood, since the putrid exhalations of Acheron might 
 as well have been sought in '* the icicle which hangs 
 on Diana's temple" as a word or deed of hers which 
 militated in any sense against the honour or fame of 
 her lord. From this review of her conduct, the 
 mourning countess derived consolation, but was still 
 so far from feeling justified that she only wished the 
 earl would remove the interdiction which prevent- 
 ed her from breaking in upon his retirement, throwing 
 herself at his feet, asking in what she had offended, 
 and suing to be forgiven. Her pure mind hindered 
 her from suspecting the tissue of falsehoods which had 
 been wrought into a plot to cause this alienation. She 
 feared to disobey his commands of being alone, she 
 would write to ask his pardon. Yet, situated as she 
 was, would not the unnecessary humiliation sound like 
 reproach? Besides, she could hope nothing from the 
 simple productions of her untutored pen. But if her 
 noble husband saw her in all the unreproving softness of 
 profound distress, surely his heart would yearn with 
 pity, and as his recent choice was far from faultless 
 he would forget her infirmities, and once more hold 
 his docile Emily to his heart in the transports of gen- 
 erous reconciliation. 
 
 Thus Emily passed a dreadful interval of two days, 
 during which many hearts partook of her anxieties. I 
 speak of the kindred and friends of those who were 
 embarked with General IVIonthermer on board the 
 Caver)-. She had been seen dismasted, firing guns of 
 distress, unable to bear up into any port, and appa- 
 rendy driving upon the Goodwin-sands, in one of the 
 most tremendous storms ever known. All ideas of 
 her safety were now discarded, and Paulina exulted 
 in the hope that one impediment to her marriage with 
 Avondel was removed without the necessity of a tem- 
 porary seclusion from the gay world, which, with all 
 
 o2

 her affected preference for retirement, was indeed the 
 haven of her desires. These criminal hopes were soon 
 changed into consternation by receiving an express 
 from the man v/hom, v/ith all the cruel selfishness 
 of vice, she would willingly have devoted to the deep. 
 His letter stated his almost miraculous preservation 
 from shipwreck by the intrepidity of the Ramsgate 
 boatmen, near which place the Cavery foundered. It 
 mentioned his impatience for a meeting which he anti- 
 cipated with all the fond affection of credulous attach- 
 iTicnt, and lamenting that exti-eme fatigue rendered a 
 day's repose necessary, it expressed a hope that she 
 would meet him on the road to London, for which 
 place he proposed to set off the next morning. 
 
 I will not describe the rage, or repeat the impreca- 
 tions, of Paulina. Her confidential emissary was im- 
 mediately dispatched to Berkley-square, and honest 
 Johnson reluctantly conveyed to his Lord a billet in- 
 closing Monthermer's letter. Certain information of 
 the general's safety was the preconcerted signal to draw 
 Avondel from the apartment where, under the pre- 
 tence of indisposition, he had meditated on the dark 
 colours of his future life, often determining to aban- 
 don Paulina and again feeling unable to break her 
 snares. Her billet was only one line written with a 
 pencil, saying that her servants thought her gone to 
 meet the general ; the die was therefore cast, she had 
 thrown herself upon his support and he should be 
 brai"!ded with treachery if he refused to follow. 
 
 Contrary to his usual practice, Johnson staid in the 
 room while the earl read the letter. The perplexity 
 of his countenance proclaimed a soul which could not 
 bend its lofty feelings to its determined purpose. He 
 attempted to order his carriage, but meeting the re- 
 proving eye of his servant he blushed with shame, 
 torr the billet, and sternly bade Johnson not intrude 
 upon his privacies, nor abuse his confidence. The 
 faithful valet Avithdrew in terrified silence. A pause 
 of awful suspense ensued. Avondel was heard to 
 pace his chamber with quick irresolute step, and John-

 son listened in the vain hope that honour would yet 
 prevail. But the snares of Paulina were wound around 
 him with irresistible force ; the terrible determination 
 appeared inevitable. He rushed out of his house with 
 the impetuosity of irresolute rashness. Johnson gazed 
 on him for a few moments, and then hastened to in- 
 form the friendly marchioness that the much dreaded 
 crisis was arrived.

 CHAPTER XXVII. 
 
 It will be pastime passing excellent 
 II' it be husbanded with modesty. 
 
 Shakespeare. 
 
 AMONG the friends of Lord Glenvorne was a Mr. 
 Sandford, who to prudent conduct and upright inten- 
 tions united that address which gives success to villa- 
 ny, and those companionable talents of mimickry and 
 playful hunnour, which often lead their possessors into 
 dissolute society and serious dilemmas. This happy 
 compound of steadiness and wit pointed him out to 
 Lord Glenvorne as a proper agent to execute the sub- 
 altern part of the scheme which the marchioness and 
 Lady Selina had concerted to reclaim the truant earl 
 without fully disclosing by what means, the marquis 
 had positively assured the ladies that Paulina should 
 be prevented from meeting Lord Avondel at the place 
 of rendezvous, namely, the cottage provided by John- 
 son. A spy had been placed on this lady's actions, 
 and as soon as she drove from her house in a chariot 
 and four, without being misled by the pretence that 
 she was going to meet her husband, Mr. Sandford 
 followed the fugitive, arid as he expected, soon saw 
 her take a road very different from that to Ramsgate. 
 When the distance from London, and the lateness of 
 the hour, diminished the chance of his meeting with 
 any interruption in his design, he bade his postilions 
 pass her carriage. Having disguised his attendants as 
 Bow-street officers, he mounted them on post-horses, 
 ordered them to stop Paulina as a delinquent escaped 
 from justice, and to charge her with being the run- 
 awaj7 shop-woman of a celebrated jeweller, and hav- 
 ing committed a robbery on her master. They were 
 then to bring her to a neighbouring inn, where they

 would find him transformed into a country justice, and 
 acting with all the dignity suitable to his magisterial 
 character. 
 
 The terror and rage of Paulina at this interruption 
 are not to be described. For relying on the supposed 
 security of travelling in England, and desirous of se- 
 crecy, her retinue consisted of only her woman, and 
 one male attendant, who did not think it prudent to 
 defend his lady's honesty against the bludgeons of 
 three sturdy fellows, who, besides, sheltered them- 
 selves from opposition under the invulnerable shield of 
 the police laws. He left it therefore for her to choose 
 between being committed as a depredator, or detected 
 in a criminal elopement, and after many ineffectual re- 
 monstrances and as ineffectual bribes, the haughty 
 Paulina was compelled to submit to be taken into cus- 
 tody and conveyed to the King's Arms at ^ 
 
 Here, as his worship would not act till morning, she 
 spent the night, glowing with shame, mad with dis- 
 appointment, and alike exposed to disgrace and dan- 
 ger, whether she aimed at concealment or made a 
 frank discovery. 
 
 At an early hour justice Sandford, so disguised that 
 not a trait of the young man of fashion v.-as visible, 
 took the chair of office, placed his clerk and arranged 
 his statute books and papers with sufficient solemnity 
 to intimidate a native of England, and more than 
 enough to prevent a foreigner even of Paulina's pene- 
 tration from suspecting there was a trick in these pro- 
 ceedings. The tale of the pretended constable was 
 first heard, who insisted that after the robbery they 
 had traced the culprit to a street in the neighbourhood 
 of Hoibcrn, where she equipped herself in the prepar- 
 ed habiliments of a woman of quality, and with two 
 accomplices, disguised as her maid and footman, hir- 
 ed a chariot, and attempted to fly the kingdom. The 
 stolen property was made to accord with the descrip- 
 tion of Paulina's ornaments, and the marquis of Glen- 
 vorne, as he furnished the inventory, took particular 
 pleasure in specifying the diamond tiara which she had

 received from Lord Avondel. The trepidation into 
 which this enumeration threw the proud Italian, would 
 have excited pity from any one who did not know how 
 her mahcioas heart had often gloried in tormenting 
 the tremulous Emily, by displaying the blazing splen- 
 dor of that magnificent present, and boasting that it 
 was the votive gift of a yet more valuable heart. The 
 marked interposition of retributive justice chilled the 
 soul of Paulina, especially when the pretended magis- 
 trate ordered her trunks to be searched, since, though 
 her appearance convinced him that the constable was 
 mistaken, that was the surest way of proving her in- 
 nocence. The disdainful silence which she had hither- 
 to maintained, now yielded to the tone of supplication. 
 Her eyes no longer rolled with contempt on the sur- 
 rounding auditory — hoping to intimidate them with her 
 scorful glances ; their sullen fire was dimmed with 
 tears. Yes, injured Emily, the shameless woman 
 who reproached thy self-accusing gentleness wept, but 
 not like thee through pity or timidity, for another's er- 
 rors or thy own supposed offences ! Hers were tears 
 of anger and terror, the overwhelming emotions of 
 rage, accompanied by remorse but not indicative of re- 
 formation. 
 
 " I intreat," said she to Sandford, " if your En- 
 glish laws permit, a private interrogation. I will then 
 convince you that the charge is grossly fallacious." 
 
 " i think," said Sandford, hesitating with affected 
 terror, " there can be no -personal danger, unless she 
 has concealed pistols. She may have a stiletto howev- 
 er, for I observe she has a foreign accent." 
 
 " Please your worship," interrupted the constable, 
 " she passed at the jeweller's for an Italian." 
 
 " An Italian too," answered Sandford, " I have heard 
 that all the men are assassins and the women prostitutes. 
 Yet I think her countenance is not so very malignant. 
 Give me my horsewhip and I'll venture. Be sure keep 
 within call. Now madam — hut pray keep your dis- 
 tance. You are going to hi tried by the best laws in

 whci and what are you ? and what makes you travel by 
 night in a chaise and four in this very suspicious and 
 aUirming manner ?" 
 
 " I presume you are a gentleman?" said Paulina 
 proudly. 
 
 His worship adjusted his wig, pulled out his cravat, 
 and with much awkward consequence, answered who- 
 ever saw him made no doubt of that. 
 
 " I will therefore," continued she, " call upon that 
 honour which prompts gentlemen rather to assist than 
 persecute my sex. Release me from this unjust and 
 insulting confinement. I am a lady of rank and for- 
 tune, and though I claim your protection as an act of 
 justice be assured 1 will be grateful for my deliver- 
 ance." 
 
 " Madam," answered Sandford, " you speak very 
 good language, and you are dressed like a gentlewo- 
 man, but 1 have known swindlers who could dupe any 
 magistrate, so your merely tellmg me that you are ^a 
 woman of quality will not do unless you give me your 
 name and re sidence. Offering a bribe to be sure looks 
 as if you were about the court, but then I have known 
 pickpockets do the same. All may be settled, madam, 
 bv }our permitting your trunks to be searched, or your 
 fairly telling me whither you are going." 
 
 Paulina recollected that she was too much out of 
 the Ramsgate-road to use the pretence that she was 
 going to meet her husband, she therefore added that, 
 she was on her way to her country residence, and be- 
 ling further pressed, added the name and situation of 
 the cottage taken by Johnson. 
 
 " O, thou abandoned child of darkness," said Sand- 
 ford ! " I'll commit you to Bridewell without mercy. 
 I know that veiy cottage is taken by a noble earl lor 
 his kept mistress." 
 
 The self-degraded Paulina felt chilled with horror, 
 conscious that she desirrved the severest stigma, yet 
 wounded by the unequivocal terms in which plain spo- 
 ken rusticity described the conne9tion she had veiled 
 with so many decorous epithets. She soon called ef-

 frontery to her aid, and expecting to overawe her in- 
 quisitor, avowed her name and rank, and bade him 
 silence the scurrility of the populace by making it 
 known, that her health required the air of the country, 
 and being a stranger her intimate friend Lord Avondel 
 had the goodness to provide a quiet retreat for her re- 
 ception. 
 
 Sandford was prepared with a formal bow, and all that 
 under-bred ceremoniousness of apology which wound- 
 ed Paulina's haughty spirit, by assuring her that he 
 never could have guessed at her rank if she had not 
 discovered it, every circumstance being so much 
 against her. With officious freedom he begged her 
 pardon, laughed at the mistake, requested her to hon- 
 our him with her company to breakfast, hoped she 
 would allow him to escort her to her cottage lest she 
 should meet with any more Bow-street runners, and 
 on her declining his offer lamented that his clerk was 
 so engaged that he could not write her discharge imme- 
 diately. Pauhna was still more offended with his fa- 
 miliarity now she had unveiled her majesty, than she 
 had been by what she thought mistaken abuse, and her 
 lofty spirit was stretched on the rack by the conscious- 
 ness that she was too much in his power to shew re- 
 sentment. She was therefore obliged to endure the 
 pain of the most mortifying species of dissimulation, 
 by appearing affable and easy when her bosom throb- 
 bed with rage and disappointment. She endeavoured 
 to thank his politeness, but the words died on her lips, 
 and she could only conjure him to allow her to proceed 
 on her journey. 
 
 " All in good time, madam," answered Sandford. 
 " There is a vast deal to be done on these occasions. I 
 must call in those knaves the constables and ask how 
 they lost sight of the real thief. I shall tell them who

 tell them I am not a felon. I freely forgive the mis- 
 take, and remember, sir, I trusted my name to your 
 honour. I would not have this mortiiying adventure 
 discovered." 
 
 "■ True, true," observed Sanclford. "Why, as you 
 are coming to live among us, it wouid be a standing 
 joke. But if it does get wind I'll countenance you, 
 and bring my wife and daughters to visit you. But 
 your ladyship eats noLiiing, and these are excellent 
 iolls."

 " Aye, your ladyship said you were ill, else that fine 
 bloom in your complexion — but it may be fever. I 
 suppose, madam, you arc used to travel all night in hot 
 climates, so forgot you were in a cold one ; we count 
 the night air unwholesome." 
 
 " I had reasons, sir." 
 
 " Just as my wife says when she spends more money

 think I have heard an odd story about that lord, that

 the full height of majesty, " I have told you enough to 
 prove that I am not cognizable to your tribunal."

 " For the pleasure of being helped by so lair a

 old college tutor for the occasion ; " you know what I 
 mean I see my lady. Well, they say abroad men 
 don't mind these ornaments, but in England, from the 
 king to the beggar, they are found so odious that they

 children, even if she does not introduce a surreptitious 
 issue, are deprived by her guilt of their natural claim 
 to maternal tenderness. She robs her kindred of their 
 untainted honour, her friends of the good offices they 
 were entitled to expect, her servants of their livelihoocl, 
 and the poor of that benevolent support her wealth 
 ought to have afforded t^em." Sandford found his 
 warmth had betrayed him into a style somewhat too 
 elevated, and added, " so our doctor said in the pulpit 
 last Sunday. Have not I an excellent memory :" 
 
 Paulina now found herself really indisposed. She 
 complained of faintness, and Sandford led her to the 
 window. " Ah, madam," said he, " I dare say vou 
 have a good memory too, and will never forget setting 
 out at midnight to meet your friend at a cottage, when 
 you was in such ill health ; no, nor the little justice at 
 the Kinji's Arms."

 Paulina assured Mr. Sandford she should always 
 remember him. 
 
 The marquis of Cilenvorne had directed his friend 
 to keep Paulina in his eye till he received some intelli- 
 gence of the proceedings of Lord Avondel. His de- 
 testation of her vices, and compassion for the deserted 
 countess, would not permit Mr. Sandford to be content 
 with restraint ; nor would he allow the persecuted Pau- 
 lina to brood alone over the disappointment and sur- 
 prise of Avondel at her failing in her assignation, or 
 indulge her with leisure to compare her present situa- 
 tion with the picture she had drawn of a voluptuous re- 
 tirement, and meeting her paramour after he had bro- 
 ken every sacred obligation for her sake. The noise 
 which this disgraceful seizure must make, and her ap- 
 prehension that her friend the justice, intoxicated with 
 the honour of serving a great lady, would divulge her 
 name, made her indeed as desirous to keep him with 
 her as he was to stay and enjoy gratifications so suited 
 to his temper, by humbling pride and alarming vice. 
 But as her acuteness made it impossible long to pre- 
 serve the deception, and as even the enjoyment of a 
 successful project pulis in time, as the evening closed 
 in he became as anxious to be released from his mock 
 dignity as Paulina was to escape from her thraldom.

 THE reader wiii recollect, tliat, nff-r a severe 
 struggle, Lord Avondel permitted vice, depravity, and 
 cruelly, disguised under the semblance of honour, to 
 gain the ascendancy. Long indulged habits had ren- 
 clered Paulina's society necesscn y to his happiness, and 
 with the common license of oiienders he pleaded the 
 necessity he had created as an excuse for his crime. 
 Yet still, as lie left his own house vvirh the intention of 
 r.bandoning his v/ife and child, his step v.as irresolute, 
 and hifi heart pidpitated svlfh a vchetnchc^ that mari-unl 
 his innate abhorrence of the part he wag goiug to, per- 
 form. His son he determined to reclaim, l)ut he sighed 
 wheri he reflected that he should see Emily no more. 
 The innocent, affectionate, gentle Emily: so he once 
 thought her. The mean-spirited offspring of Selina's 
 guilt, so (though no proof of the accusation had been 
 produced,) he persuaded himself he should henceforth 
 consider hi.r. Even as he hurried along to meet the 
 won-an for whom he had c6nsented to tarnish his bril- 
 liant reputation, he meditated more on his blasted pros- 
 pects as a lover, a husband, and a father, than on the 
 transport of possessing the object of universal admi- 
 ration. He mounted the carriaK;e which was to con- 
 vey him to his guilty associate with dissatisfaction in- 
 stead of exstacy and mused on the possibility of acting 
 as a mediator between her and her husband, and re- 
 storing her untainted in person and renovated in fame 
 to the grateful conciliated Monthcrmer. 
 
 Perhaps the practicability of his plan seemed less 
 evident as he approached the supposed sphere of her

 attractions. He alighted at the garden gate with an 
 air of rapture ; inquired if the hidv was arrived, and 
 was shewn into a parlour. " JMy loveliest, dearest 
 friend," said he, perceiving a female advancing to 
 meet him ; but the imperfect light showed it was not 
 Paulina. A form worn to that sort of ethereal trans- 
 parency, that the soul seemed ready to burst through 
 its mortal mound, a countenance illuminated by piety 
 though deeply touched by grief, the well remembered 
 lineaments of consummate beaut)', injured, but not 
 annihilated, by sorrow and time ; all struck on the 
 soul-harrowing recollection of the guilty Avondel, and 
 he recoiled with horror from a voice whose exquisite 
 music reminded him of the happier days of innocence, 
 hope, and virtuous love. I need not add, that voice 
 was Selina Delamore's, who, as he turned to shun her 
 unexpected presence, bade him stay and hear a sister's 
 woes. 
 
 Avondel staggered against the wainscot, his failing 
 knees sunk under their burden. Selina endeavoured 
 to support him. " I am your sister," she repeated. 
 " The mutual guilt of our pai'ents gave me birth, and 
 doomed the prime of our days to anguish. Avondel, 
 you owe all your sorrows to a guilty assignation, to the 
 licentious passions of our father, and the criminal 
 weakness of my most wretched mother!" 
 
 '* Selina ! Selina !" said the earl shivering with hor- 
 ror as he grasped her trembling arm, " Is this your 
 long concealed secret r" " This, and no other, so help 
 me heaven," said the devout recluse with lifted eyes, 
 then turning their mild lustre on the earl, she added, 
 ••' It is a secret which nothing should have torn from 
 me, but the wish to save vou from that remorse which 
 my dying mother endured." 
 
 " Seek not," said Avondel, " to conceal your own 
 misdeeds by calumniating the dead. Is there no other 
 reason for your concealment, no living proof of your 
 frailty ?" 
 
 " Here are documents to prove my veracity," re- 
 turned the lady. " The hand-writing of the earl your

 have long languished under the pressure of sUmdcr. 
 Tenderness to those who lie silent in the grave kept

 attractions. What have the few years which lie between 
 me and the grave, nov/ to offer, that I should turn par- 
 ricide to the reputation of those who gave me being i'" 
 
 " My sister ! the daughter of my father," exclaimed 
 Lord Avondel, gazing on that face, which, v/hen flush- 
 ed v/ith youthful beauty, v/armed his heart with chaste 
 delight. It now possessed a pensive, sublime sweet- 
 ness, not less attractive to his graver years. Its almost 
 diyine intelligence intimated that superior loveliness 
 which imaginatiotl ascribes to the inhabitants of better 
 worlds. That lace now rested on his shoulder, her 
 clasped hands held to her throbbing heart, while with 
 cautious tenderness, she often repeated, " JMy dear 
 unhappy brother !" 
 
 His eyes then glanced at the papers to which she 
 referred. He recogni/jed the writing of his father, 
 and tame<l from them with horror. " It was not on light 
 surmises," resumed Lady Selina, " that I resigned 
 vou. I examined every circumstance. I weighed 
 every testimony written and oral before I ) ielded, with 
 the prospect of being your wife, every earthly hope 
 and joy. It was with strong reluctance that I con- 
 sented to sit down the destitute child of shame, the 
 victim, I have already said, of undeserved reproach. 
 But I will not talk of what I suffered. Let me only 
 remember the past as a source of gratitude for that di- 
 vine support which enabled me to endure." 
 
 " My sister !" said the earl, still dwelling on the 
 ■ name which, in all his various reveries, in all his wild 
 conjectures to explain Selina's conduct, had never oc- 
 curred to his thuughts. " Why did not you plead the 
 claims of nature, and call upon me for protection ?-— 
 Did you not sufficiently know my heart to be convinc- 
 ed I adored your virtues still more than vour beauty ? 
 I would have shielded your innocence from a misjuclg- 
 ing world. Yea never should have known v/ant or

 solitary sorrow. We would have lived happy and 
 united as friends, though disjoined as lovers." 
 
 "■ It would have been a dangerous experiment," an- 
 swered Selina. " We v/ere too sincerely attached to 
 expect that the warm aftection of contracted lovers 
 would soon subside into the temperate kindness of 
 consanguinity. And supposing we liad lived Vvith the 
 most guarded purity of thought, we owe much to the 
 opinion of the world. Our attachment was known, 
 and even divulging the shame of our parents would 
 not have preserved us from suspicion. The law of 
 custom which prohibits dangerous intimacies, is not the 
 vague fluctuating decree of fashion, but the dictate of 
 collective wisdom and confirmed experience, resulting 
 from a thorough knowledge of the human heart ; and, 
 trust me, Avondel, few violate this restraint without 
 discovering to their cost, that their temerity has re- 
 moved one of the best safeguards of honour." 
 
 The earl felt the truth of this remark, and heaved a 
 contrite sigh. " Yet," said he, " if you renounced 
 my society, your scanty fortune and friendless situa- 
 tion should have taught you to apply to me for that 
 support my duty and inclination would have alike ex- 
 pedited. Why did you leave me in ignorance of your 
 motives ? At times cursing her I ought ever to have 
 blessed, and bereaved of the poor consolations of miti- 
 gating your afflictions, and knowing that you still de- 
 served the heart which even a persuasion of jour un- 
 ■worthiness could not liberate." 
 
 " I yielded you to your country," returned Selina : 
 " why should I arrest a hero's arm, or fix that heart 
 in the captivity of a hopeless passion which I wished 
 devoted to some worthy and happier woman? As to 
 poverty, none suffered its evils but myself, and I am 
 now convinced it was to me a blessing. It roused me 
 from the torment of reflection, and made me attend to 
 those petty cares from which affluence would have ex- 
 onerated me. Besides, Avondel, shame and regard 
 for my sister's fame kept me silent. Why should I 
 communicate to another the disgrace that attached to

 two illnstricus families ? Why infuse a doubt of the 
 right Lady Honoria Mandeville had to that fortune 
 from which Lord Montolieu precluded the spurious 
 offspring of his wife, though in pity he concealed his 
 motive ? Was I, her child, to proclaim the guilt which 
 an injured husband had consigned to oblivion ? Was 
 I to tear her shame from the grave, and divulge even 
 to your tried fidelity what it had been the labour of 
 her life to conceal ? What motive was there for this ? 
 Would your heart have been set at ease by knowing 
 that your father went to the grave stained by tlie guilt 
 of seduction ? Should I have been less forlorn if re- 
 stored to the first circles than I was at Lime Grove, 
 where I reared ray sister's orphans, and performed 
 some trivial acts of kindness to my indigent neigh- 
 bours ? You, (as I hoped would be the case,) roused 
 by disappointment, devoted your life to the calls of ac- 
 tive duty, and in time, renouncing me as one unwor- 
 thy your regard, espoused a virtuous and amiable wo- 
 man. Surely, my lord, those motives could not be 
 wrong which led you to glorj- and me to peace." 
 
 The devout resignation of Selina's sentiments, so re- 
 mote from enthusiasm, so free from contaminating va- 
 nity, or extravagant passion, communicated a portion 
 of her own serenity to Lord Avondel. He was again 
 conversing with the object of his early love. She was 
 still the pure exalted being he had formerly adored. 
 The detestable phantom raised by the conjurations of 
 malice for the vilest purposes had disappeared ; no 
 mysterious secrecy, no dubious disgrace, hung over the 
 birth of his wife, who rose upon his imagination in the 
 form of cherub infancy, imbibing the early lessons of 
 virtue from an unspotted and wise prectptress. Ab- 
 sorbed in the pleasure of gasing on his lonp'-loved, 
 long-lost, angel ; enraptured by the sweet music of her 
 \'oice, charmed by her wisdom, and elevated by her 
 piety, he forgot for some time the circumstances which 
 led to this interview. The recollection too soon flashed 
 upon his mind, and stabbed his heart with the pangs of 
 self-condemnation. He found his Selina the same, or

 rather affliction had acted upon her as a sklUul lapida- 
 ry on a beautiful gem, and polished her into brighter 
 lustre. But had iirosperity been equally kind to him ? 
 She was lowly, disinterested, devout, submissive. He 
 liad become proud, wayward, fastidious, and discon- 
 tented. It were well if he could have paused there. 
 What were the views which he had lately cherished ; 
 Why was he liere ? ^V horn did he expect to meet ? 
 Whom had he abandoned in London ? Tears of re- 
 morse p;ushed into his eyes. He clasped Selina to his 
 bosom, v.'hile an impassioned confession of his own 
 unworthiness burst from his tongue. " O my Selina, 
 my sister !" he Continued, " let me publicly claim alli- 
 ance with purity and worth like thine, as an incentive 
 to imitate thy high deservings." 
 
 " No," answered the lady, " the reasons which urged 
 me to conceal my story, are still in force. The mis- 
 deeds of tlie dead should remain silent like their 
 mouldering bodies, unless justice to the living compels 
 lis to tear from the covert of the grave the crimes of 
 those who can no longer defend or explain their ac- 
 tions. Let U3 not furnish a tale for vulgar wonder and 
 unmeaning exaggeration. I would have nothing known 
 but that I am rcr^iored to your favour, and permitted 
 to witness your happiness with my dearest Emily." 
 
 " Selina," said the earl, with a look of fixed despair, 
 " Emily and I can meet no more !" 
 
 " Is it her fault or her misfortune ?" 
 
 " Both," returned Avondel. " She exposed me to 
 the world as a faithless husband, when I only cherish- 
 ed a pure and allowable friendship." " For whom r" 
 inquired Selina. Avondel blushed, turned aside his 
 head, and answered, '* You know the story." 
 
 " P>Iy brother," answered she, " whither would that 
 friendship have led you ? and how has your mind sub- 
 mitted to that sophistry which teaches that a dangerous 
 and unMorthy object can excite a pure and allowable 
 passion ? Indeed, I know too well the fatal influence to 
 which you have surrendered your better judgment, and 
 it is to oppose that influence that I have made this

 tlreadful discovery, to prove how the indulgence oF 
 criniinal appetites may communicate misery to the in- 
 nocence which is unborn." 
 
 Avondel blessed heaven, and the -guardian angel 
 which had saved him from perdition, with a fervency 
 which shewed that his crime had not reached that full 
 consummation which would forever have exposed hiin 
 to the horror of deep remorse. He now lamented, that 
 Selina's interposition had not been siifficienlly timely to 
 preserve his honour from the imputations to which an 
 elopement must give rise, and Selina proposed his im- 
 mediate return to his family as the only method of si- 
 lencing defamation. Avondel then expressed his fears, 
 that Emily's weakness had already given too much po- 
 tency to slander for him to restrain its calumnies, and 
 he mentioned the song she had sung on Paulina's birth- 
 day as a libel on his conduct, and a public appeal to 
 pity on her own behalf. Lady Selina knew the story 
 from the Glenvornes, and suggested to him the possi- 
 bility that Paulina had contrived the oft'ence which she 
 urged as an unpardonable crime. Disdain and resent- 
 ment at being thus made the dupe of a woman's mis- 
 cliievous art, which this second instance of the false- 
 hood of Paulina's accusations afforded, gave a pang to 
 his soul, even at the moment that he felt his under- 
 standing for ever liberated from those deceptions by 
 v.'hich it had been long bewildered, and he was only 
 v.'ithheld frgni restoring transport to his consort's heart 
 and peace to his own, by his natural unwillingness to 
 acknowledge his errors. Selina understood his cha- 
 racter, and by dwelling on the conciliating love and 
 gentle humility which were the duties of every wife, 
 and the marked characteristics of his own, convinced 
 him that he would be excused from those submissions 
 which are often the easiest to those who are most apt 
 to oftend. 
 
 The jealous dignity of Avondel now prompted him 
 to inquire, what degree of publicity was attached to 
 bis elopement, and the means by which his retreat had 
 been discovered? In return he heard the pardonable

 treachery of Johnson, and was comforted by being as- 
 sured that only herself, the Glenvornes, and another 
 gendeman, who was stationed to intercept Paulina, 
 knew of his last determination, for which he could not 
 even plead the excuse of precipitate rashness. " l^hc 
 marchioness," continued Selina, " is now with Emily. 
 If possible she will be kept ignorant of your departure. 
 You have only to resume your former self. Tell her 
 the cloud which threatened destruction to her peace is 
 passed by, and her placable mind will in the happy fu- 
 ture forget every painful recollection." 
 
 Again Lord Avondel blessed the prudence which 
 had preserved him from humiliation, as well as from 
 the most criminal acts, and resolved if he could once 
 more regain the proud eminence from which he had 
 fallen, never to expose himself to a temptation which 
 his self-confidence falsely told him the native energy of 
 virtue would enable him to resist. He begged his 
 guardian angel (for so he now called Selina) to accom- 
 pan}' him to London ; but she urged the advantage of 
 a little delaying her re-appearance, lest the two-fold 
 surprise should overwhelm Emily with excessive rap- 
 ture. She assured the earl that she had never seen her 
 niece since her marriage, and she suggested the wisdom 
 of preparing her for the event of their re-union, and 
 the world for her again claiming the rights of untainted 
 tame. By the death of an old servant, he and herself 
 were the only living depositaries of Lad}' Montolieu's 
 secrets, and she left it to him either to admit the young 
 countess to a participation, or to let her seclusion still 
 remain an unexplained mysterv. 
 
 Lord Avnndel's admiration of Paulina had now 
 changed into abhorrence and disgust ; yet he consider- 
 ed himself as bound on the present occasion not to 
 leave her to the violence of her own passions, and he 
 consulted Selina what plan could be pursued to save 
 her from the exposure which she so justly deserved. 
 The same divine principle which had urged the pious 
 recluse to support the backsliding, prompted her to 
 raise the fallen. To her compassion, prudence, and

 delicacy, the eavl comautted the task of attempting to 
 reclaim his intended associate in a life of shame, and 
 separating from his angelic sister with the hope of a 
 speedy and happy i e-miion, he retm-ned to London, re- 
 joicing that he had escaped from the worst conse- 
 quences of his folly, anxious to regain domestic tran- 
 quillity, and the favourable opinion of the world, with- 
 out openly acknowledging that he had deserved to 
 incur the loss of them. If it be suggested, that this 
 temper of mind falls far short of the self-abasement of 
 true contrition, which rather seeks pardon from its 
 maker than restoration to the favour of its brotlier 
 v/orm, I shall acknowledge the justness of the remark, 
 and say, such was Lord Avondel, and such as he are 
 many v/ho call themselves penitents, who rather feel 
 piqued than grieved by the recollection of their trans- 
 gressions. These depend solely upon their own 
 strength, upon a more enlightened understanding, or 
 better regulated passions, to enable them to escape fu- 
 ture temptations, without either seeking pardon for the 
 past or grace for the future, from him whose favour 
 confers perfect peace, and whose support insures victo- 
 ry over our spiritual assailants. 
 
 In contemplating that change in Lord AvondePs 
 character which had been jointly effected by early dis- 
 appointment, and a life spent in the turmoil of ambi- 
 tion, Selina felt ample cause to lament his errors, and 
 to increase her own gratitude for receiving the whole- 
 some discipline of difficulty and son-ow. She saw his 
 proud reluctance tc; acknowledge his offences, even to 
 her whom he avowedly considered as a superior cha- 
 racter, and she saw in him also an eagerness to cling 
 to those self-justifications which the conduct of others 
 supplied. Why else did he attach such criminality to 
 the complaining strains of Emily, even supposing she 
 had seltcted that pathetic song, and at the same time 
 so easily pardon himself for having by his behaviour 
 instructed the world to make a personal application of 
 a popular ballad ? And Vvhy did he also blame her- 
 self for not interposing in time to preserve his charac-

 ter unblemished, when, from his own justification of 
 his friendship for Paulina, it was evident he would 
 not hiive believed himself to be walking in the path of 
 danger till he saw the abyss yav/n before him ? Though 
 tree from every taint of vanity, Lady Sclina rejoiced 
 at perceiving she had regained her influence over his 
 mind, and she hoped in the calm intercourse of friend- 
 ship, which now promised to gild their declining days, 
 to communicate gradually (for her knowledge of the 
 human heart discouraged the expectation of sudden 
 changes) to this idolater of honour, this man of un- 
 swerving rectitude, this consummate hero, and accom- 
 plished gentleman, that pious humility, and meek re- 
 signation, which she had learned while languishing on 
 the bed of pain, or suffering in silence the mental tor- 
 tures of undeserved reproach, heart-wounding disap- 
 pointment, and contemptuous neglect. Without the 
 means of solacing her griefs by the reflected pleasures 
 of beneficence, restrained from justifying her fame by 
 her own high sense of duty to her guilty mother and 
 dissipated sister, too independent in her character to 
 solicit from others that pecuniary assistance which, 
 from the circumstances of her birth, she believed she 
 had justly lost, she prayed and suffered for three and 
 twenty years, alternately accused as an abominable 
 branch whom society had justly cast out as an avari- 
 cious wordling, who refused to distribute the hoards 
 her mother had accumulated, and as a capricious, fret- 
 ful being, whose only affliction was a wretched tem- 
 per, fostered in moody solitude, till it became utterly 
 irreconcilable with the habits of the world. 
 
 No particular malevolence gave birth to these cen- 
 sures. Sorrow had not warped the natural gentleness 
 of her temper ; and though her limited circumstances 
 restrained her bounty, her heart overflowed with good- 
 will for every living creature, and the few com torts 
 which she enjoyed resulted from her endeavours to 
 make others happy. Yet, thus it is that the world of- 
 ten treats a character of Selina's stamp, not from en- 
 mity, but garrulity. We have, generally speaking, a

 Strong dislike to being kept in the dark, and whenever 
 there is something mysterious in the conduct of our 
 neighbours, we are apt uncharitably to conclude, that 
 it arises from a disgraceful cause. Hence the success 
 of specious characters ; hence the general failure of 
 timidity and unobtrusive worth. Lady Selina lived 
 in what is called a sociable neighbourhood, among the 
 rich and prosperous, with whose habits hers did not 
 accord, and to whose festivities she could contribute 
 no additional zest, except that of stating that they vi- 
 sited a right honourable. Most of them had sailed 
 down the stream of life so smoothly as never to have 
 experienced personal affliction, and as they possessed 
 the philosophical quality (so often called good nature) 
 of bearing the sorrows of their friends and connections 
 with easy indifference, nothing but the severe visitings 
 of bodily disease, or the failure of the Bank, could 
 have convinced them that " man is made to mourn." 
 People thus circumstanced, who never voluntarily vi- 
 sit the house of sorrow as a preparatory school for 
 themselves, are firmly persuaded, that every body 
 may if they please be happy, and they entertain the 
 same antipathy to the countenance of melancholy, 
 though illuminated by the seraphic smile of resigna- 
 tion, as Casar did to the lean and wrinkled Cassius ; 
 for with them unhappy people labour under a three- 
 fold ban, they do not contribute to their pleasures, they 
 are apt to ask favours, and they remind them that 
 prosperity is of temporary duration. 
 
 In assigning these reasons for Lady Selina's being 
 unpopular, I wish to serve many worthy people, who, 
 to the anguish of untold grief, find the vexation of un- 
 deserved opprobrium unexpectedly superinduced ; and 
 I would caution those who pique themselves on their 
 penetration to be less active in supplying the hiatus 
 which prudence or modesty leaves unfilled. In so do- 
 ing they often launch into the boundless sea of conjec- 
 ture, and with no worse motive than a desire to shew 
 their own talents, shape the mist-enveloped character 
 into a demon or a fury. And yet, perhaps among the

 cares which haunt the sleepless couches of those pos- 
 sessed by that species of sorrow which is compelled to 
 hide its festering wounds, (and how often does delicate 
 sorrow take that shape) none is more tormenting than 
 the consciousness, that though concealment is their du- 
 ty, reproach uses it as a covert from whence she may 
 shoot those barbed arrows which most severely wound 
 a susceptible ingenuous mind.

 THE dilBculty of carrying on the drama of de- 
 ception without exciting the suspicion of an alarmed, 
 cifTended, and peneti -.iting woman, rendered Mr. Sand- 
 ford extremely dtsirous to bring on the catasfrophe, 
 t^nd to decamp beiore his magisterial dignity should 
 be exposed to the degradation of commitment for a 
 fraud. With a view to expedite his retreat, he des- 
 patched a servant to the cottage, which was but a few 
 miles distant, who soon returned with the information 
 that Lord Avcndel had set off for London. The daw- 
 then immediately began to cast its peacock's feathers, 
 and depositing his wig, band, surtout, statute-books, 
 and an immense pair of false eye-brows, in the horse- 
 pond, he withdrew from the King's Arms, and appear- 
 ed on the road to London in a character perfectly op- 
 posite to the country justide, I mean a man of fashion. 
 Paulina had for some hours suspected that her de- 
 tention was not the effect of mistake, and as soon as 
 her guardian disappeared, she found, upon inquiry, 
 that he was as much a stranger as herself, and that the 
 appendages v;hich had so much terrified her as the 
 formularies of ofiice, were merely the implements of 
 disguise, or the mummeries of frolic. To whom could 
 this daring outrage be ascribed? Her own guilty con- 
 science told her it was certainly intended to disappoint 
 her assignation with Lord Avondel. Had he then 
 betrayed her? Every lineament in his character proved

 that was impossible. Even if Emily had discovered 
 their intrigue, she was unequal to this successful pro- 
 ject for counteracting it. Weak, timid, and artless, 
 she could neither plan with dexterity nor execute with 
 energy. This insult must originate with abler heads 
 and firmer hands ; and whom could she suspect but 
 her rival Lady Selina Delamore, to whom, with the 
 rancour natural to a corrupted mind, she ascribed all 
 her own vices, exaggerated to tenfold virulence? For 
 she could as soon have supposed herself a contempla- 
 tive nun or mortified devotee, as to believe it possible 
 that an ardent attachment to Loi'd Avondel could sub- 
 side into the holy fervor of devotion, or change to the 
 calm of affection of disinterested friendship. In her 
 estimation, as successful love must rise into idolatry, 
 slighted affection must be perverted into the most dead- 
 ly, active and interminable hatred. The woman wha 
 once held the heart of Avondel could never patiently 
 behold it diverge to another, without making a vigor- 
 ous struggle to regain the treasure. 
 
 But what steps was she now to take ? Doubtless, 
 Selina had not done her work by halves. Unquestion- 
 ably, some dark delusion had spirited away Avondel ; 
 and after the publicity which this adventure must ac- 
 quire, the cottage could not conceal her from the search 
 of Monthermer? What then should she do? Return 
 to London? What awaited her there? A jealous hus- 
 band, whose passionate love, combined with a weak 
 understanding, would irritate him to the wildest ebul- 
 litions of vindictive rage. The impetuosity of the ge- 
 neral's temper certainly justified her fears for her per- 
 sonal safety, which now entirely absorbed her atten- 
 tion, and made her regret rather than repent her hav- 
 ing indulged her capricious dislikes and highly culpa- 
 ble attachments to such a height as to resolve on arj 
 elopement. 
 
 While she debated how she should act, she received 
 
 a letter superscribed " to the Lady at the King's 
 
 Arms," and under cover one addressed to hei^self by 
 
 her own proper name. The signature stated that it

 came from a peace-maker, and it contained an offer oi 
 service in the way which would best promote Lady- 
 Paulina's real interests. The first suggestion was that 
 it came from an emissary of her husband's, who had 
 discovered her flight. This was followed by a hope 
 that it might be written by an agent of Avondel's. In 
 the first case, escape was impossible, in the last an im- 
 mediate interview was highly desirable ; she therefore 
 ordered that i.he writer should be admitted. It was 
 no other than Lady Selina herself, who having discov- 
 ered from the loquacious communications of Mr. Sand- 
 ford's servant to her own footman, some particulars of 
 his master's frolic, and Lady Paulina's present situa- 
 tion, resolved immediately to visit her, prompted by 
 her native goodness, and a hope that she might be in- 
 strumental in changing the criminal agonies of rage, 
 disappointment, and despair, into that sorrow which 
 terminates in hope and peace. 
 
 Conscious that the mutual attachment between her 
 and the earl must be known to Paulina, and conse- 
 quently might impede the success of her negotiation, 
 .she wished at first to conceal her name ; but the Ita- 
 lian's piercing eyes, quickened by love and jealousy, 
 soon discovered that the fine ruin on which she gazed, 
 whose benign countenance and graceful manner an- 
 nounced superior qualities, could be no other than the 
 early and indeed only real possessor of Lord Avon- 
 del's heart. She viewed her therefore as the person 
 who hud defeated all her machinations, and ruined all 
 her dearest hopes ; and witlV a determined infatuation, 
 not uncommon to extreme depravity, she resolved to 
 believe her guilty, or at least capable of all the crimes 
 with which she had slanderously aspersed her in order 
 to bend the stubborn honour of her paramour, and 
 make him the complete tool of her nefarious purposes. 
 
 The contrast which these ladies exhibited was com- 
 plete in all those points which can shtw the effect of 
 different principles on equal degrees of intellect. Pau- 
 lina employed all the power of her capacious mind to 
 gratify her passions, which by indulgence were become

 insatiable. Selina had naturally strong feelings, but 
 by the aid of religion they became so subdued that 
 they proved assistants to her in her heaven-ward course, 
 converting what reflection told her was a duty into a 
 pleasure. The former centered all her wishes in self- 
 enjoyment, varied indeed by the different shades which 
 it received from vanity, ambition, or libertine inclina- 
 tions ; but whether she sought love or fame, the ap- 
 plause of thousands, or the heart of a forbidden ob- 
 ject ; whethei', like Cleopatra by the side of Antony, 
 presiding at the festival in eastern magnificence, or as 
 Rosamond, immured with her doating Plantagenet in 
 " Woodstock's bower," self-enjoyment was what she 
 ever aimed at. Regardless of others, save as they 
 ministered to the object which she had in view, she 
 heeded not subjecting a high-minded nobleman to the 
 horrors of long remorse, and stripping the man whose 
 virtues and fame she aSected to revere, of every appel- 
 lative but that of her lover. 
 
 But as the self-denying Selina, had submitted to suf- 
 fer rather than expose her near connections to disgrace 
 or injury, so it was her consolation during her clouded 
 and perilous pilgrimage, that she had aimed at doing 
 all the good in her power, not only in words but in 
 reality, preferring the welfire and wishes of others to 
 her own. These different motives of action made the 
 Italian crafty and specious, and the English lady kind 
 and sincere. Both were eminently graceful, but in 
 Paulina's address there was a meretricious splendour, 
 an aim at pleasing, a restless assiduity' of fascination, 
 which betrayed a sinister design. Selina's manner 
 discovered that innate benevolence M'hich M'ithout 
 courting applause insures affection, by evincing that 
 disinterested and enlarged regard for her fellow-crea- 
 tures which we consider as a marked characteristic of 
 those exalted beings who minister to the designs of 
 Divine Providence. 
 
 Though I might extend these reflections to the length 
 of one ot Plutarch's parallels, there is onlv one more 
 point of resemblance and dissimilitude in which I shall

 consider these ladies. Each possessed an uncommon 
 share of natural discernment, but in both this quality 
 was considerably affected by the medium through 
 which it viewed others. Paulina, judging from her 
 own bad heart, whenever the motives for any action 
 seemed doubtful, regularly assigned the worst. She 
 had lived among the great and the gay, and as her own 
 propensities led her to prefer shewy qualities to valua- 
 ble endowments in the choice of her acquaintance, it is 
 not surprising that looking chiefly at frivolity, dissipa- 
 tion, profligacy, and artifice, she considered the world 
 as a stage for guilt, treachery, and selfishness, and as 
 far as her views extended her conclusions were just. 
 But as her pigmy standard was incapable of measuring 
 . a soul dilated by conscious rectitude, she denied the 
 existence of those virtues which reproached her own 
 depraved and perverted talents. She deduced female 
 chastity from two causes, pride, or the absence of 
 temptation. She considered misfortune as implying 
 the want of skill and address ; she thought candour 
 synonymous with folly, and if she heard of a good 
 deed which die doer had carefully concealed, she ci- 
 ther doubted its having been performed, or suspected 
 that under this studious avoidance of ostentation a 
 mine had been secretly delved to proclaim it to the 
 world, and give the performer the twofold eclat of mo- 
 desty and munificence. For as all her views were 
 earth-bound she had no conception of looking to '•' Him 
 who seeth -in secret" for her ultimate reward. 
 
 Selina's judgment sometimes erred, but it was from 
 excess of candour. As Paulina degraded the best ac- 
 tions from suspicion, so Selina was induced by charity 
 to think too favourably of the worst. She knew that 
 human nature was fallen and frail, but she recognized 
 in it too many traits of its original purity and exalted 
 destination, to give it those darker hues in which mis- 
 taken piety and real depravity equally delight to dis- 
 guise the " Lord of this lower world," from different 
 motives, I own, but I fear with equally pernicious ef- 
 fects to society. As Lady Selina's religion had no

 tincture of austerity, so her purity of mind and con- 
 duct hud not rendered her rigid. She had sustained 
 temptation and endured affliction. The latter, so far 
 as rehtted to herself, she considered solely in a medi- 
 cinal point of view, tending to correct her natural frail- 
 ties, and she was ever inclined to make large allowances 
 for those pitialile daughters of prosperity whose days 
 were spent in the giddy vortex of amusement without 
 one wholesome check to teach consideration. She ne- 
 ver called that a crime Vvhich could be termed an in- 
 discrftion, Without violating the essential distinctions 
 of language. She allowed much to infirmity. She 
 ofi'wn met with error, rarely with such incorrigible vice 
 as alone deserves the name of depravity. She saw 
 much to love and admire in her fellow mortals, much 
 to pity, something to condemn, but, till she saw Pau- 
 lina, no ^. ling to abhor. And even the recoiling shud- 
 der which this wicked woman communicated to her 
 frame, was soon changed for that glow of benevolence 
 which followed the pious wish that some temporal ca- 
 lamity might lead her to repentance. 
 
 At their first meeting, Selina courteously expressed 
 her desire to render Paulina such services as would be 
 likel)' to secure to her the respectable claims of wife 
 and mother. Paulina bowed : rage gave fire to her 
 eyes, and flushed her cheek. " You have not announ- 
 ced yourself, madam," said she with a haughty air, 
 " and to the oflfers of a nameless stranger, nothing but 
 general thanks are due, till we know their motive for 
 interesting themselves in our concerns." 
 
 Selina answered it was compassion. 
 
 " Compassion !" retorted Paulina. " How vague 
 and contradictory are our motives for pity. Perhaps 
 even now I am inclined to consider that ignorance of 
 the common forms of society which has induced you 
 to trespass on the privacy of a person to whom you 
 are entirely unknown, as a misfortune." 
 
 Nothing intimidated by this lofty language, Selina 
 answered, that she was not unacquainted with the ce-

 lebrity talents, and misfortunes, of Lady Paulina Mon-

 " I own my name and rank," returned the Italian, 
 " be equally ingenuous, and confess that I am now ad- 
 dressing Lady Selina Delamore." 
 
 " I acknowledge that you are." 
 
 " To whom," said Paulina, while terror and fury 
 shook her frame, " I owe the obligation of a mock 
 arrest, and a day and night spent in insult and igno- 
 miny ?" 
 
 Selina replied, " you only owe this visit ; — proceed- 
 ing from an earnest wish to rescue you from further 
 shame and sorrow." 
 
 " Admirable !" returned Paulina, " you are then 
 really my guardian saint, sent to snatch me from per- 
 dition, and to convert me into a pure peaceful creature 
 like yourself? But as I esteem sincerity to be an in- 
 dispensable virtue in the composition either of a wo- 
 man of the world or a religieus^ I have no doubt you 
 will answer all my interrogatories with equal veracity?" 
 
 " I will anticipate the questions. Madam, which 
 probably you will first wish to have resolved. Lord 
 Avondel is returned to London, and his disappoint- 
 ment in not meeting you has determined him never 
 more to interfere with the rights of your natural pro- 
 tector. Your reputation is safe in his inviolable se- 
 crecy; and believe me. Lady Paulina, I have too deep- 
 Iv felt the force of a strong attachment to betray you. 
 Though much may be surmised, your real intention in 
 leaving London is unknown. It is impossible that 
 General Monthermer can have reached town. Return 
 home before the length of your absence can authorize 
 the suggestions of your enemies, and future correct- 
 ness of conduct often disproves the surmises of scan- 
 dal." 
 
 " If to your unsolicited gooodness in acting as my 
 adviser," answered Paulina, " you will add the office 
 of being my vindicator, the eligibility of your scheme 
 will become more manifest. Your ladyship has so

 long endured the pressure of opprobrium, that you 
 must be an adept in the science of parrying reproach, 
 and mistress of every art which supports self-confi- 
 dence and eludes positive detection. I know of no 
 name near which I should be more desirous of placing 
 a really tarnished reputation than Lady Selina Dela- 
 more's, whose adventures will invite discussion when 
 mine are forgotten." 
 
 " I perceive," said Selina, with downcast eyes, " you 
 alike mistake my character and my offers." 
 
 " This is extraordinary !" resumed Paulina, elated 
 at the evident confusion of her rival. " Have I then 
 been misinformed as to the necessity of your retire- 
 ment, or the nature of that influence which you boast 
 of regaining over Lord Avondel's heart ? On con- 
 necting the past with the present, can I, madam, ascribe 
 your offers of service to any better impulse than jea- 
 lousy, or triumphant vanity elated by momentary suc- 
 cess." 
 
 " You are now in the bloom of beauty. Lady Pau- 
 lina, and conscious of the pov/erful influence of your 
 unrivalled charms. You can therefore hardly believe 
 that in a few years you will look with apathy, perhaps 
 with regret, on those pursuits which now engage your 
 chief regard. It is long since I have felt either jea- 
 lousy or vanity. To Lord Avondel's heart I have now 
 no pretensions. He returns to his wife and I to my 
 retirement." 
 
 " 'Till a convenient season again calls you forth to 
 insult the person, and asperse the fame, of a woman 
 who dares the universe to prove she ever swerved from 
 the laws of virtue. Yet you hallow your slanders un- 
 der the decent pretext of protecting the connubial 
 rights of your poor injured child." 
 
 Paulina looked earnestly at Selina while she empha- 
 tically pronounced the last word, but no change of 
 countenance indicated that she understood the dark 
 allusion. She had long been accustomed to call Lady 
 Avondel by that endearing epithet, under the twofold 
 sense of adoption and affection ; nor had she the least sus-

 picion that the precaution which she had used to guard 
 her niere from a remote reproach, had given a pretext 
 to malignity to fasten on them both an undeserved as- 
 persion. Wrapped in the mantle of innocence, she 
 was so far from feeling the point of Paulina's inuendo 
 that she was considering by what means she could allay 
 her rage, without committing the sanctitude of her 
 own principles by seeimg to excuse her actions. She 
 admitted the truth of her assertion of personal purity, 
 and called upon her to exercise equal candour, assuring 
 her that she had neither circulated the calumnies, nor 
 projected the insults, of which she compl-ained. She 
 5hen proceeded to observe, that there were many inter- 
 mediate degrees between a strict observance of moral 
 decorum and actual criminality. She spoke of man- 
 ners as the outworks of virtue, and of the danger 
 which must ever attend wandering beyond the bounds 
 that custom prescribed, and she referred a far greater 
 portion of error and frailty to the surprise of unexpect- 
 ed temptation than to preconcerted guilt and resolute 
 licentiousness. She concluded by assuring Paulina, 
 that she would not only bless the events which had pre- 
 served to her the possibility of being reconciled to the 
 world, her husband, and herself, but that through the 
 remainder of her life she would retain such a lively 
 horror of the danger which she had escaped, as would 
 lead her to avoid every imprudence, the final conse- 
 quences of which it was impossible to foresee. " I 
 will no longer irritate you by my presence," added the 
 benevolent Selina, " but with fervent wishes that you 
 may be speedily restored to the invaluable blessings of 
 self esteem, I commit ) ou to the guidance of your 
 own discretion. 
 
 " My own thoughts," returned Paulina, " are still 
 my pleasantest companions. I iiave been tooliale ac- 
 customed to the freedoms of sententious sarcasm to 
 imitate the moral cant with wh'-.h you veil the deeds 
 of hatred in the words of kindness." 
 
 " Why," inquired Selina, " do you call mine the 
 deeds of hatred r"

 " Because I am your enemy," was Paulina's reply. 
 Conscience gave a vehemence to her look and accent 
 which woulcl have appalled a firmness less steadfastly 
 fixed than Selina's, by shewing her that so turbulent a 
 soul would not permit hatred to remain inert and pas- 
 sive. But versed in the consolations of religion she 
 knew the rage of wickedness, like the violence of the 
 tempestuous ocean, had its bounds prescribed. Her 
 heart was more disposed to compassionate those who 
 submitted to the thraldom of malevolence, than to be ap- 
 prehensive of its effects upon herself. She was inca- 
 pable of retorting hatred or scorn, and with eyes swim- 
 ming in tears she meekly answered, " I know not. 
 Lady Paulina, why you are my enemy, but this avowal 
 would not justify me in becoming yours." 
 
 " Know then that I have injured thee, and let that 
 fire thy apathy to revenge. On what system dost thou 
 act, if not on that of self-defence ?" 
 
 " I trust my wrongs and sorrows to an abler aven- 
 ger?" 
 
 " Then," returned the enraged Italian, " as I sus- 
 pected, thy virtues are simply refinements in vice, and 
 thy malice is controuled to pierce my heart where it 
 is most vulnerable. But tell thy champion, thy Avon- 
 del"— 
 
 " I have no earthly champion," replied Lady Selins, 
 " I appeal to the Searcher of hearts. Since you de- 
 cline all conciliatory offers, Lady Paulina, I can only 
 remember you in my prayers." 
 
 *' Or rather in thy imprecations," said Paulina, re- 
 sisting those emotions of admiration which struggled 
 for predominance. 
 
 " No," returned the devout recluse, " I know my 
 imprecations would fall on my own head, and not sway 
 the purposes of a God of Mercy. I am enjoined to 
 forgive those who offend me by One of whom I daily 
 ask forgiveness for my daily offences. I was for years 
 forlorn and abandoned, nor dare I risk the loss of His 
 favour who was then my only Friend !"

 Paulina was softened. She felt her own dreadful 
 deprivation in wanting the guardianship on which Se- 
 lina relied, but it was only a temporary impression. 
 Accustomed to repress every religious feeling, her ac- 
 tive fancy soon suggested to her that her rival acknow- 
 ledged she had now an earthly as well as an hettvcnly 
 protector. This was the man she loved, the man whom 
 she had endeavoured to fix as her paramour, at the 
 hazard of every temporal and eternal hope. This re- 
 collection gave renewed fierceness to her manner, while 
 she inquired, if she was at liberty to return to the 
 home from which she had betn basely inveigled. 
 
 " Who," said Selina, " would oppose so wise, so 
 honourable a measure r" 
 
 " The perjured, mean, yet specious, Avondel. You 
 disclaim all knowledge of the plots and counterplots 
 b\' which my ruin has bt en achieved. To whom, then, 
 can I ascribe them l)ut to him, who first attempted to 
 corrupt the wife of his friend, and with ten-fold b.fse- 
 ness exposed her confidence in his plighted faith to 
 derision and shame." 
 
 Selina started at the daring effrontery of Paulina, in 
 accusing an accomplice of the crime in which she was 
 more deeply involved. The malignity which mingled 
 with her rage distorted her features, and described a 
 soul more fiend-like than- Selina could believe tenanted 
 so beautiful a form, and she deplored the depriivity 
 which contaminated such commanding talents. Fixed, 
 interminable revenge, the, sanguinary rancour ol the 
 Italian, betrayed b} the unguarded frenzy ol the wo- 
 man, fl;;shed in her countenance, whose agonized con- 
 tortions spoke the workings of two passions striving 
 for mastery, whose full indulgence were incompatible 
 with each r.ther. The horror and consternation of Se- 
 lina's look recalled Paulina's attention to the viature of 
 the confidence which she thus unwarily bestowed, and 
 convinced her of the necessity oi resuming that exter- 
 nal self-command of which she was so consummate a 
 mistress. She burst into tears, conjured Selina not to

 He meditated on the events which had restored to him 
 the long-lost Selina in a new and interesting character, 
 injured, and amiable, vj'iih no impediment either real 
 or imaginary, to his future enjoyment of her society, 
 and to his deriving ins stimable advantages from her 
 virtue, wisdom, and piety. His thoughts sometimes 
 ivandered to Piiulir-p with anxiety, but without regret, 
 and with as little of EtIf-re])roach as a considerable 
 share of self-esteem, combating a high regard for ho- 
 nour, would permit. He had lost au artful, inapetuous, 
 fraudulent mistress, he had recovered a sincere, steady 
 friend. The calm magnanimitv with which she sacri- 
 ficed her dearest wishes, and justcst claims to the ad- 
 vantage or misery of others, extorted his adniiratiou, 
 and his own gentle Emily rose in his opinion as the 
 docile pupil of such an instructress. It was long be-

 peruse the dociniients which so reluctantly discovered 
 the guilt of the dead. "With a trembling hand he 
 opened the packet given him by Selina, and first read 
 a billet from his father to Lady Montolieu, which too 
 clearly proved their criminal intercourse. His atten- 
 tion was next directed to a letter from that unhappy 
 w^oman. It was addressed to her daughter, and su- 
 perscribed by a request that she would open it previous 
 to her engaging in the marriage state. As this was

 " To Lady Selina Delamore. 
 
 " Unable to support the burden of existence any 
 longer, I shall soon escape from a world in which my 
 share ot anguish has been at least proportioned to the 
 load of my guilt. The vindictive wish of Lord Mon- 
 tolieu when we separated has extended to the confines 
 of the grave. He bequeathed me everlasting remorse 
 — Yet on his death-bed he forgave me. He prayed 
 too for my repentance. — The imprecations of resent- 
 ment were recorded in too indelible a manner to be 
 erased by the relentings of compassion. I never can 
 truly repent. I know I am a guilty, but I feel, too, 
 that I am an injured woman, and my hatred, as everlast- 
 ing as my remorse, pursues the author of my wrongs. 
 
 " Selina, you have been my only comfort, my sup- 
 port in years of misery. I owe to you a full disclo- 
 sure of circumstances, the knowledge of which, by the 
 death of Lord Montolieu and of my seducer, is now 
 confined to myself and Wilson. But with this confi- 
 dence I add a solemn adjuration, that you preserve my 
 secret. This is the command of your dying mother. 
 I shall not long survive this injunction. 
 
 " There is a dreadful mystery hangs over your 
 birth, which the small provision left you by my hus- 
 band may perhaps lead the world to suspect. You are 
 the child of adultery. The subjoined letter points out 
 the name of your father. 
 
 " I was married when very young to a man chosen 
 by my parents. Two years after our union Lord Mon- 
 tolieu went abroad in a public character. Till he left 
 me, we had lived in happiness, and I reared his child 
 Honoria with maternal affection. I was not twenty 
 years of age. I was beautiful, gay, and proud of my 
 power of pleasing. At parting Lord Montolieu ad- 
 vised me to live in the country during his absence, but 
 I disliked retirement and abhorred controul. I would 
 have accompanied him abroad, but the nature of his. 
 service precluded my attendance. 
 
 " I had many admirers during his absence. As I

 my own charms, I resolved to divert myself with mak- 
 ing conquests, and to triile whh the attention I attract- 
 ed. I fancied my pride, my principles, and my affec- 
 tion for Montolieu, secured me from the danger of 
 breaking my marriage vow. I rejected the -advice of 
 some grave relations as cold counsels, and I indulged 
 to excess in amusements and in the enjoyment which 
 sdulation afforded. Yet so far from intending to be 
 criminal, I resolved to entertain Montolieu on his re- 
 turn with an enumeration of my triumphs. 
 
 "Such was the state of my mind when I heard the 
 earl of Avondel poitited out as an universal lover and 
 successful gallant. He had been married some years 
 tn a deserving woman, but who was not possessed of 
 sufficient charms to fix a rover still young and eminent- 
 ly fascinating. I resolved to mortify his vanitv by 
 gaining his affections and eluding his snares. For a 
 time I appeared to be successful in both my aims. He 
 seemed indignant at his captivity, and incensed at the 
 cold-hearted proud coquette whose charms were irre- 
 sistible, though she wanted gratitude to make her 
 adorer happv. At last he dropped the character of a 
 lover, ancl became more dangerous as a friend. He 
 pretended to revere the only virtue he h?!d ever found 
 in\'incible, and expressed some envy of the happv Mon- 
 tolieu, who possessed a treasure which the world could 
 not tear from his grasp. 
 
 " Selina,.your youth, beauty, and inexperience, may 
 also mark you as the proy of seductit.>n. You are 
 friendless too, and my fears for the child who suffers 
 for my crimes induces me to dwell largely on the story 
 of m.y undoing. Could you conceive the anguish I 
 have endured, my griefs would act more powerfully 
 than a thousand dissuasives. O, what strength of 
 nerve, what bodily invulnerability, should she possess, 
 ■who resolves to infect her soul with ihe consciousness 
 of a crime so uncontroulable in its contingent eflects as 
 mental adultery.

 conversation, he anpected to think nnine an unusual re- 
 gale. He talked or the* tasteless insipidity of common 
 society, of the delights of pure friendship, the charms 
 of taste, and the pleasures of virtue. He grew every 
 day more interesting, and I, pleased with the thought 
 that I had reformed a libertine, and secured a man of 
 superior attainments as my friend, had no apprehen- 
 sions of his sinister designs. He knew I had a strong 
 passion for botany, he assisted me in filling a hortus 
 siccus, and with seeming carelessness mentioned a fine 
 collection of plants at his villa a few miles from Lon- 
 don. " Lady Avondel," said he, " unhappily has taken 
 a dislike to the spot, which disappoints my intention of 
 frequently visiting what I built and planted as a retreat 
 sacred to contemplation and the Muses. I dare say 
 she would most willingly attend you there, but she has 
 so little relish for the science that she v;ould only hurry 
 you through the conservatories and impede your re-

 my legitimate child, and by the dishonesty of receiving 
 the man I had wronged with the affected tenderness of 
 chaste affection. This I could not do, yet one terror 
 still chained my tongue. Was I to expose my husband 
 and my gallant to the murderous chance of indiscrimi- 
 nate revenge. The dreadful irresolution in which I 
 passed the intermediate months till I became your mo- 
 ther changed my temper and my features so much, 
 that I lost all the charms of sweetness and beauty. I 
 at last became the mother of a living child, born with 
 an unjust claim to half Honoria's patrimony. I re- 
 solved whatever was the event to disburden my op- 
 pressed conscience. I had lately heard Lord Montolieu 
 affirm, that it was folly in an injured husband to risk 
 his life for a perjured woman, and the composure with 
 which he heard my confession convinced me he sus- 
 pected my guilt. He bade me never disclose the name 
 of my seducer as he was resolved never to be tempted 
 to revenge. The last act of kindness he shewed me 
 was, endeavouring to conceal my disgrace. He told 
 my friends our tempers were so incompatible that a se- 
 paration must ensue, and the extreme wretchedness to 
 which I was a prey gave a plausibility to his statement, 
 thoLigh some, I fear, from my known levity, suspected 
 my infidelity. He allowed me a separate maintenance^ 
 and under the pretence of not depriving me of both 
 my children consigned to my care the infant whom he 
 could not look on without horror, with a solemn in- 
 junction that I would not add to my crime by a negli- 
 gent disregard to its innocent consequence. Our sepa- 
 ration v/as assented to by our nearest relations. 
 
 " I never more saw Lord Montolieu, but on his. 
 death-bed he sent me his forgiveness, and careful fof 
 my reputation implored mine, that the world might 
 think there had been mutual provocations. It was his 
 love for Honoria which prompted this delicacy. Yet 
 my crime ruined her as well as m\ self. I saw her 
 often enough to discover that she was a proud, impe- 
 rious girl, indulged in every wish by a doating father,

 and tutorecl to despise a wretched mother, who had 
 indeed forfeited all claim to her duty and love. 
 
 " I brooded over my miseries till they overwhelm- 
 ed my patience. I deserved much chastisement, but 
 surely my tortures have exceeded my fault. You, 
 my unhappy daughter, felt the full weight of my sor- 
 row. You stood before me a perpetual memento of 
 my misdeeds. I hated you as the cause of my aliena- 
 tion from the world in which I had reigned and revel- 
 led, and as a witness of the successful fraud which had 
 deceived my judgment, and foiled my firm resolves. 
 You knew not the motive of that sternness which repel- 
 led your fon.! endearments, and checked your infantine 
 vivacity. You were often driven from my presence 
 without knowing how you had displeased me. Your 
 requests were denied even when they were most rea- 
 sonable. I have cost you many tears, Selina, but in 
 future you will bless the early severities which taught 
 you patience, and habituated you to controul. You 
 had hours of comfort, I had none. Think what must 
 be the feelings of that mother who envied her child 
 its peaceful slumbers ! 
 
 " Subdued at length by that submitting sweetness 
 which met my restrictions with obedience, and my 
 harshness with affection, my heart yielded to the feel- 
 ings of a mother. I found in you the kindest nurse 
 of my infirmities, the most faithful confidante of all 
 the woes I dared to reveal. But still pursued by the 
 consequences of my fault, I only experienced a variety 
 in my anguish, and though I felt less for my own de- 
 privations, your injuries agonized every nerve. I saw 
 you, with a natural claim to every advantage which an 
 emment station affords, friendless and portionless, le- 
 taining that rank which made you an object of impei'- 
 tinent curiosity, or useless pity, but deprived by me 
 ot a father's protection and a sister's fritndship. As 
 your beauty and taimts unfolded, I feit the full con- 
 sciousness that you might one dav reproach mo for de- 
 priving you of no coinmon share of admiration, and

 ingto few. To all my pangs I added the fear that my 
 misfortunes would be discovered, that you would one 
 day be told the shame of which I had made you inhe- 
 ritrix, and induced to hate and renounce the parent 
 you now so kindly cherished. Thus, Selina, I felt all 
 the mother's sorrows, and was a stranger to all her 
 joys. The death of Lord Avondel increased this last 
 apprehension almost to madness. Death-beds some- 
 times reveal secrets. I knevv he had written testimo- 
 nies of my frailty, and the suddenness of his removal 
 might net have permitted him to destroy what perhaps 
 his vanity bad preserved. 
 
 " I now conclude he acted in this point Vlth honour ; 
 if so, Wilson only knows ray crime. I charge you

 she has been mine. My purse has been the never-fall- 
 ing spring to which her rapacity has applied to feed the 
 wants of her worthless family, and 1 have seen the 
 frugal savings of my jointure, which it was my duty 
 to lay up as a portion for you, wasted on a herd of 
 vagabonds, at the request, or, shall I say, the com- 
 mand^ of one v.'ho had, what I valued more than life, 
 my reputation in her keeping. Such is the degrada- 
 tion, such the injustice, to which the arts of a liber- 
 tine have bov/ed a woman of rank and honour ! O, 
 how I hate the memory of the villain, who, to gratify 
 a momentary pleasure, thus humbled me to the dust, 
 drove me from every social joy, made me wrong the 
 child I love, and feed the rapacity I detest ! Yet, Se- 
 lina, by all your love and duty, never provoke Wilson 
 to discover my shame. 
 
 " Since I have yielded you to the solicitations of 
 my friends in London, my despondency has increased

 pentance ? Have 1 not suffered? Have I not wept?

 gerated reverence, when he exalts you to angelical ex- 
 cellence. 'Tis then he lays the surest tnnn to degrade, 
 you to something yet meaner than his brutal self. 
 
 " I cannot live — I have no motive to wish to drag 
 on what I feel to be past all endurance. Yet, to whom 
 shall I entrust my daughter? I have heard that the 
 son of Avondel inherits the graces, but not the vices 
 of his father. Perhaps he might cherish thee with a 
 brother's holy love. But thou, destitute orphan, must 
 never seek his friendship by an act of dreadful confi- 
 dence. Little canst thou think how my heart has been 
 wrung at hearing him commended as a nobleman de- 
 serving the most amiable of women. A thought shoots 
 across my mind. A thousand chances are against it. 
 He never can select my portionless girl for !(is wife, 
 and his virtues are a securit}- ol thine. Once I resolv- 
 ed to save thy heart the pang of this discovery. " The 
 secret of her birth," said I, " shall die with me." — 
 And yet there is a possibility — Concealment may lead 
 thee to a connection at which nature recoils, and thus 
 my guilt will be increased, and my punishment too in 
 that future world to which I hardly dare cast a thought, 
 even while my wearied spirit wishes to find it a place 
 of repose. If years of anguish can atone for months 
 of guilt and folly, I cannot think, nor can I longer 
 support my present pangs. I will trust to thy meek- 
 ness, Selina, thou wilt not curse me ; thou wilt never 
 disclose my shame ; thou wilt tremble at the name of a 
 lover ; thou wilt abjure that vanity which solicits idle, 
 fi ivolous, dangerous, destructive adulation. 
 
 " Wilson continues to haunt me. If my looks are 
 wild, 'tis her impertinence that irritates me. If she 
 would leave me, all would be quietness. Am not I 
 rational, Selina ? Have not I told a connected story ? 
 She is ever calling upon me to repent and submit. —

 Lady Selina's packet contained one more letter. It 
 , was from Wilson, giving an account of her unhappy 
 lady's death, and intimating that it proceeded from 
 such an immoderate use *of opiates as proved her to be 
 resolutely bent on self-destruction. Lady Montolieu 
 seemed once to have intended to transmit her history 
 to her* daughter during her life, but her resolution 
 failed, and it was found by Selina in a private drawer 
 with her jewels, in time to prevent the incestuous 
 marriage ; the bare possibility of which appeared to be 
 the chief reason for urging the haughty, miserable, 
 lady to discover her crimes, but not soon enough to 
 , prevent the amiable lovers from unavailing regret and 
 undeserved reproach. 
 
 A narrative penned in such circumstances, by a hand 
 convulsed with pain, and trembling with the prelusive 
 „ horrors of meditated suicide, obliterated in many parts 
 / by tears which had flowed from eyes long since closed 
 in death, and breathing the proud yet deep remorse of 
 an afflicted rather than a contrite spirit, now removed 
 to that world where adulation cannot soothe, nor rank 
 protect, must surely have checked the career of the 
 most abandoned libertine, and taught him to consider 
 the ultimate end of criminal artifices and desires. Still 
 more must he have been awed into the subjugation of 
 his passions, by reflecting on the subsequent miseries 
 entailed on virtuous and highly deserving lovers. Who 
 shall set bounds to the overflowings of ungodliness, or 
 predict where the evils occasioned by one wicked deed 
 will terminate ? If the innocent offspring are not, as in 
 this instance, the victims, the influence of a bad exam- 
 ple is incalculable. It misleads inexperience, it cor- 
 rupts simplicity ; folly flies to it as an excuse, and it 
 hardens frailty into depravity. How carefully should 
 the powerlul and the eminent consider their ways, es- 
 pecially at this period, when the sword of divine pun-

 ishment is apparently suspended over our menaced 
 country ! And how strictl)- does it behove every pri- 
 vate individual to act the part of the real patriot, by 
 guarding his conduct with such religious and moral vi- 
 gilance as not to add to the burden of national sin, the 
 only invincible enemy of England. Surely, it augurs 
 ill respecting the state of public virtue, to see so little 
 of that grave abhorrence of vice in the abstract, which, 
 without infringing the claims of candour and charity 
 to particular offenders, marks the pure morals of a 
 high-minded people. We may laugh at folly, we may 
 ridicule slight deviations from rectitude ; but, by what 
 strange perversion of our faculties does the most direct 
 breach of the holy laws of God, the most determined 
 contempt of every solemn tie, abandoned profligacy, 
 avowed prostitution, or shameless elfronttry, excite 
 mirth, instead of chilling the reflecting mind with hor- 
 ror ? Alas ! the awful form of British greatness, gished 
 with thew'oundsof war, falls, not like the patriot and the 
 warrior, magnanimous and graceful, but like the buf- 
 foon in some of our earliest dramas, who, lest scenes 
 of distress should affect too deeply, diverts the audi- 
 ence with his grimaces, and while battles are fought, 
 and crowns lost and won, shakes his sides M'ith idiot 
 laughter, and finds treason and murder extremely di- 
 verting. 
 
 " Merciful heaven," exclaimed Lord Avondel, 
 " from what extremes of guilt and horror has thy 
 guiding providence preserved me ! My innocent boy, 
 never will I expose thy heart to those sorrows which a 
 father's offences have planted in mine." He again cast 
 his eyes over Lady Montolieu's letter, confessed tiie 
 weakness of self-depending virtue, and prayed with 
 energy for divine assistance. 
 
 The transport which appeared in the countenances 
 of his servants when he alighted at his own house, tes- 
 tified their own worth and their affection for him. His 
 mind was too much agitated to enjoy his wonted sa- 
 tisfaction from their looks of welcome. He summoned 
 Johnson to attend him. " Mv faithful friend," said

 he, graciously extending his hand with a look of me- 
 lancholy benignity : the overwhelming emotion check- 
 ed his utterance, and he faultered as he inquired after 
 his countess. 
 
 " Somewhat better this morning," was the reply. 
 
 " Then she knows my absence, and its cause ?" 
 Johnson bowed in silence. 
 
 Avondel smote his breast with vehemence. Shame 
 and remorse withheld him from viewing the misery he 
 liad caused. "" Fetch me my child, Johnson," said 
 he ; " that cannot upbraid me." 
 
 *' My lady," returned the upright servant, " will not 
 suffer my young lord to be removed out of her apart- 
 ment. I trust your lordship will forgive me." 
 
 " Forgive you, Johnson, yes, and revere you !" 
 
 Johnson dropped upon his knees in ecstasy, called 
 him his noble and ever honoured lord, and conjured 
 him to visit his dear lady. " Her heart," said he, " is 
 breaking, but she is all meekness." 
 
 " Stop a moment," said Avondel. " You have seen 
 me in battle, Johnson. These are fears which ill be- 
 come a soldier, but by all the pangs I suffer, I will 
 never wound her tenderness, nor tempt your honour 
 more. I have been in a delirium, a strange suspension 
 of everv just conclusion, and uprigiit purpose. I 
 awoke when on the brink of a precipice, and am still 
 giddy with recollecting my danger." 
 
 There are scenes to which description cannot do 
 justice. Such was the reconciliation of Lord and Lady 
 Avondel. The change from deep despair to the fullest 
 happiness was agonising. Emily fainted, wept, em- 
 braced her child, gazed on the recovered idol of her 
 soul, begged, conjured him, to forget the past. Again 
 wept, pressed his hand to her lips, and intreated him 
 to forgive her tears. This tumultuary joy soon sub- 
 sided into serene delight, and perfect contldence. With 
 all the obliterating conciliation of real affection, she 
 not only appeared to foiget her former trials^ but with 
 never censing solicitude strove to reconcile him to him- 
 self. This was a task of no small difficulty. By pon-

 tiering on all the circumstances which led to his infa- 
 tuation, the earl unwound the clue of Paulina' artifices, 
 and traced the causes of his credulity to his culpable va- 
 nity and fastidious respect for his own deserts. The con- 
 sequence was, that he detested her and despised himself. 
 This latter was a new and exquisitely painful sentiment. 
 The generosity of his faithful wife deepened his self- 
 dissatisfaction, and even the smiles and plaj'ful endear- 
 ments of his child could only for a moment interrupt 
 the anguish of remorse. That faithful wife he had 
 resolved to abandon. He was on the eve of blasting 
 the fortun; s of that lovely child. And for what ? To 
 become the tool of a perfidious wanton, the bravo of 
 a courtesan, the defender of one wlio deserved punish- 
 ment, the interrupter of justice, not the protector of 
 innocence. O, degraded Avondel ! what can restore 
 thee to that self-esteem so dear to thy lofty spirit ? Of 
 all the labours which an heroic soul can undertake, of 
 all the duties which magnanimity is called upon to per- 
 form, no labour is so painful as that of retracing thy 
 own bnckslidings, no duty so agonizing as that of dis- 
 claiming thy long cherished superiority, and confessing 
 not merely mistakes and infirmities, but the shameful 
 degradation of gross offences.

 LADY PAULINA, on returning home, took no 
 pains to conceal her emotion, or to give any colouring 
 to her sudden return. Finding that the general was 
 not arrived, she summoned her servants and charged 
 ihein to ='ty nothing of her absence, in a manner th.at 
 rather excited than silenced curiosity. She tiun dis- 
 iTiia'.ed them v.'ith a liberal gratuit}', and prepared for 
 the return of her husband with all the apparent fond- 
 ness of an affectionate wife, and succeeded so well, 
 that she.raetthe man she had so lately wished immers- 
 ed in a watery grave, with a tender joy, dimmed by a 
 sort of latent melancholy, the result she said of a re- 
 cent indisposition. 
 
 A few days after Gejieral Islonthermer's return, she 
 required a private conference with his secretary, Mr. 
 Viliars, of whom she inquired if her husband had re- 
 ceived any communications from Lord Avondel. On 
 hearing that the latter had only sent the usual compli- 
 mentary message, and that the general expressed his 
 surprise that his old friend did not greet him with 
 a personal \^elcorae, Paulina reiterated the word 
 "friend," and with a sarcastic smile lifted her eyes to 
 heavtn in a sort of expostulatory indignation at the 
 prophanation of that word. 
 
 " I thought," said she, seeming to recollect herself, 
 '' vou had left the room Villars. I charft-e vou do not

 notice my emotion to your master." Villars bowed. 
 " I also strictly prohibit you from making any inquirj' 
 among my servants." Villars again signified acqui- 
 escence. '* 'Tis my last command," continued Pauli- 
 na, " that you punctually acquaint me with whatever 
 passes between the general and Lord Avondel." On 
 uttering the earl's name she seemed to thrill with invo- 
 luntary horror, and Villars, who had exactly the de- 
 gree of prudence and discernment which Paulina im- 
 puted to him, retired, the prepared, but unconscious, 
 tool of revenge. 
 
 His first business was to make what he called cir- 
 cumspect, but which might with more justice be term- 
 ed general, inquiries among the persons composing the 
 establishment of his lady, from whom he learned the 
 frequency of the earl's visits, and the publicity of his^ 
 attachment. For, from regard to their own reputa- 
 tion, which servants always in some degree connect 
 with that of their employers, as well as gratitude to a 
 mistress who possessed that cardinal virtue in a mer- 
 cenary eye, liberality, they were inclined to describe 
 Paulina as being as much of a vestal as could consist 
 with the bold advances of the most audacious lover, 
 since the da^ s of Tarquin. Indians and Europeans,, 
 Gentoos, Mahomedans, and Christians, were alike una- 
 nimous in signifying, that their dear lady was a para- 
 gon v.orthy universal imitation. Her retinue was the 
 most splendid and numerous in London, indulged in 
 every iuxurious propensity, and seldom reminded of 
 their dependent situation by the imposition of unplea- 
 sant offices, or restrictions which might interfere witlv 
 their ideas of gentility. No doubt could be entertain- 
 ed of their affection for their lady, while she sailed on 
 the smooth current of prosperity, and allowed them to 
 hope their harvest was not over. 
 
 I believe that those who are well acquainted with 
 the manners of servants know, that their creed virtual- 
 ly agrees with the ancient Persians, in ascribing equal 
 potency to an evil and a good supreme agent.- As the 
 latter is always showering down, douceurs aod favours

 in the shape of a generous easy superior, so the for- 
 mer is always some griphig prying hunks who creeps 
 into every family and glides about to discover pe- 
 culation and prevent idleness. In Paulina's house- 
 hold this evil genius v/as Lord Avondel. Contrary to 
 the established rule, which requires that every gentle- 
 man who %yishes to violate the marriage-bed of his 
 friend, should ccmmence his advances by gaining over 
 her domestics, the earl had thought it his duty to in- 
 form Paulina. of some nefarious combinations, and had 
 remonstrated on the wasteful extravagance of her de- 
 pendants as sufficierit to exhaust even the ample re-^ 
 sources of an Indian General. Though such conduct 
 spoke the faithful friend rather than the insidious se- 
 ducer, yet every one of Lady Paulin-i's servants beheld 
 it as a proof of his intention to ruin their dear lady, 
 and Mr. Villars, who bad more zeal and fidelity than 
 discrimination, was easily persuaded to believe, that 
 notl'iing but a superior share of prudence and chastity 
 could have preserved this new Penelope inviolate till 
 the return of her Ulysses. He became thei'efore what 
 zealous but short-sighted people often are, a conscien- 
 tious dupe, a convenient conduit through which Pau- 
 lina could convey whatever intelligence she pleased to 
 her husband. She had long known that Ivlonthermer's 
 uxorious fondness had more of passion than confiden- 
 tial affection, and that his dotage, though extreme, did 
 not always prevent him from entertaining suspicions of 
 the fidelity'of the woman he idolized. His confiden- 
 tial secretary always acted in the capacity of a sp\% 
 and the intriictabiiit)'' of the person who had held this 
 office induced Paulina to get him removed before she 
 left India, and to introduce Villars, on whose gratitude, 
 aided by inexperience, she believed she could depend 
 for a convenient degree of blindness. 
 
 With that masterly policy and intuitive view of the 
 human heart, which formed part of Paulina's striking- 
 qualities, she appeared to admit the well-intentioned 
 Villars into her confidence, and after bitterly lament- 
 ing the treachery which, as far as regards females.

 even men of honour allow tliemselvcs to practise, she 
 expressed her luixious wishes that Lord Avondel's 
 conduct might be concealed from her beloved Mon- 
 thernier, whose generous attachment and impetuosity 
 might probal)ly cause him to have recourse to such 
 measures as would lead to consequences she trembled 
 to foresee. She therefore conjured Villars, in case of 
 that nobleman's visiting the general, to prevent an in- 
 terview, and conduct him as if by mistake to her, 
 where, indignant as she was at again beholding him, 
 she would once more try to direct his truant love to 
 his own amiable wife, or at least to make him desist 
 from his nefarious pursuit. Villars admired her pru- 
 dence and promised obedience. 
 
 Paulina's real motives were however difFerent from 
 those she assigned. The loss of her lover, the per- 
 sonal insults she had endured, the triumph of Selina, 
 and the reported happiness of the gende Emily, had 
 at first inspired her mind with the most vehement thirst 
 for vengeance, but tix; disgust and contempt which her 
 husband still excited, and the marked contrast of his 
 manners to those of the all-elegant, .?il-enlightened 
 Avondel, which her fancy hourly suggested, told her 
 that the earl yet retained possession of her heart, and 
 she resolved to try by one more interview if he really 
 was grown calious to her charms, or at least to dis- 
 cover if he was an accomplice in the plan of her de- 
 tention. She would hear from himself that he renounc- 
 ed her, before she awoke " black vengeance from the 
 hollow kell," to take " the crown and hearted throne 
 of love." 
 
 The first wish of the repentant earl was to be restored 
 to that self-esteem which he had so weakly and wick- 
 edly forfeited. His next desire was, that the world 
 should be so deceived by appearances as to be unable 
 to draw any positive conclusions to his dishonour. — 
 Finding from JMonthermer's answers to his messages 
 that there were no suspicions rankling in the general's 
 heart, he trusted that Paulina would for her own sake 
 preserve inviolate secrecy as to the past, and he rq-

 solved in future to avoid that bewitching woman under 
 the pretence that there had been some disagreement 
 between her and Lady Avondel. He hoped such a 
 sHght intercourse might be kept up with the general as 
 would serve to lull suspicion. i3ut at his first visit 
 Villars punctually fulfilled his intrusted commission, 
 and while Avondel endeavoured to bend his integrity 
 to that degree of dissimulation which would permit 
 him to meet the man he meant to have injured, with- 
 out disclosing by his humiliation his meditated villainv, 
 he suddenly found himself alone with Paulina. 
 
 Of all the bad qualities of women none gives such 
 disgust to men of reflection as effrontery. Avondel's 
 eyes flashed disdain, but Paulina softened him by an 
 affectation of extreme confusion. She pretended to 
 tremble, accused Villars of mistake, and called him 
 back to bid him go in search of his master. When 
 his retiring step announced that he had left the anti- 
 room, she turned her tearful eyes with bewitching 
 sweetness on Avondel, who, reddening with shame 
 and vexation, unwilling to reproach and abhorring to 
 console, sat iVernly silent. 
 
 After a pause long enough to give vent to those 
 signs of contrition which she thought must move his 
 flinty heart, and which indeed would have induced 
 him to pity any offender but the slanderer of Selina, 
 she exclaimed, " Is it thus we meet :" " 'Tis weil,'^ 
 returned Lord Avondel, " that we meet in circumstan- 
 ces vi^hich allow us to retrieVe our errors." 
 
 " Have you then," said she, indignant at his cold- 
 ness, " utterly renounced the woman whose confidence 
 you so earnestly solicited, and cruelly betrayed r" 
 
 "■ No, madam," returned the earl, with a look of 
 ineffable disdain ; "• Lady Avondel shall find me faith- 
 ful to m) vows, and you may depend upon m v invio- 
 lable secrecy. Let us exchange forgiveness, and meet 
 no more." 
 
 " Agreed," replied Paulina, " never did our minds 
 more fully accord. I rejoice that the mistake of Vil- 
 lars has allowed me to bid you an eternal farewell.—-

 you lured me from my house to insult and expose me ? 
 This, and your forbearing to accuse me to my husband, 
 I shall receive as magnanimous returns for that disin- 
 terested attachriient to which I would have sacrificed 
 fortune, fame, and peace." 
 
 Avondel scorned to prophane the term gratitude by 
 using it to a woman whom he no longer considered as 
 the frail victim of passion, but as wicked from princi- 
 ])le, and vitally depraved. Ke pondered whether he 
 was not called upon to shev^ Monthcrmer the real cha- 
 racter of his wife, and advise him to justify his own 
 honour and preserve his peace by separating from this 
 f;.maie fiend. But that indescribable mixture of in- 
 culg nee and contempt which men of refinement always 
 feci for women, however dangerous or infamous, with- 
 held him from attempting to crush her whom his con- 
 science reminded him was his partner in guilt. He 
 coldly ansvv'ered, that Lady Avondel's disposition was 
 a security against his ever entertaining her with sub- 
 jects which would give her pain instead of pleasure. 
 Ignorant of the insults of which Paulina complained, 
 he did not attempt to justify himself from being the 
 employer of Sandford, and expressing seme surprise 
 at the general's delay he turned to contemplate an 
 Italian landscape. Paulina shrieked, and appeared 
 fainting. Convinced it was an artifice, the earl kept 
 his seat, ruminating with horror on his past infatua- 
 tion, which now exp.-sed him to the effects of a chi- 
 canery equally obvious, and on the just retribution 
 which made that credulity the means of involving him 
 in difficulties and dangers. 
 
 The servants were soon summoned by Paulina's hys- 
 terical vociferations, and Villars among the number. 
 The lady was conveyed to her chamber, and the as- 
 tonished secretary interrogated the earl (whose atten- 
 tion seemed scarcely attracted by the farce) as to the 
 cause of this sudden disorder.

 " She will best explain it," answered he, " my visit 
 this morning was to General Monthermer, and I know 
 not by what mistake I have been suffered to intrude 
 upon his lady." 
 
 " My lord," said Villars, significantly, " the gene- 
 ral must be informed of Lady Paulina's indisposition." 
 
 The earl replied emphatically, he had no motive 
 for wishing it to be concealed, and retii*ed with more 
 self-satisfaction than he had for some time felt, rejoic- 
 ing that he hgd repulsed the blandishments of the sy- 
 ren, and persuaded that her duplicity was too apparent 
 to be dangerous. 
 
 But though the lion treads disdainfully on the snake, 
 the lordly beast often falls a victim to its poison. Pau- 
 lina knew exactly Vt'hen she ought to recover, and sum- 
 moning Villars to her couch, on which she reclined in 
 all the pomp of languishment, she ordered her women 
 to retire. She then asked him if the traitor was gone ? 
 if he shev/ed any signs of remorse ? or had affected to 
 account for the disorder into which his insuperable ef- 
 frontery had thrown her? Finding that Avondel had 
 preserved that disdainful silence which her knowledge 
 of his lofty integrity might have assured her would 
 conceal her guilt, she informed Villars that Monther- 
 mer must be informed of his designs, since the return 
 of her legal protector and her own lenient offer of for- 
 giving the past, had only so far hardened him in his 
 resolution of making her either guilty or miserable, 
 that she found he had actually whispered away her re- 
 putation, and had the boldness to assure her, th U as 
 no woman of virtue would now visit her on account ol 
 his assiduities, her situation could not be rendered any 
 worse. 
 
 The reluctance which Villars felt to involve his 
 master in a bloody contest with a man of Lord Avon- 
 del's skill and eminence, and this too immediately on 
 his return to England , where he hoped to enjoy for 
 many years the hard-earned affluence for which he had 
 sacrificed his youth and health, induced the secretary 
 to pause before he took any irretrievable step, and he

 expressed his wonder that Lord Avondel should thus 
 openly avow his designs. Paulina assured him that this 
 fearless audacity was a peculiar mark of the earl's vil- 
 lainy, who ever strove to intimidate when he could not 
 allure. That he was even capable of attempting to 
 carry her oflF by force, she inferred from a most sin- 
 gular adventure which had befallen her on her attempt 
 to meet the general, when he returned to England. 
 Her carriage was surrounded by armed banditti, call- 
 ing themselves officers of justice, who preferred a most 
 ridiculous charge against her of having been guilty of 
 a felony, and but for the accidental interposition of a 
 superintendant of police, who arrived in time to libe- 
 rate her, she was convinced she should have been con- 
 veyed to some remote fortress, entirely in the power 
 of a brutal t}rant till she would have consented to pur- 
 chase liberty by the forfeiture of honour. 
 
 A tale so romantic, so dissimilar to the usual course 
 of events in England, staggered Villars stiil more, in- 
 stead of inducing him to place implicit confidence in 
 his lady's veracity. He had not however the slightest 
 suspicion of the malignity of her intentions, and only 
 supposed that her fanciful enthusiasm had given a 
 marvellous air to some ordinury occurrence, vrhich her 
 limited knowledge of English manners did not allow 
 her to comprehend. But when on questioning the 
 servants who accompanied her, h.e found that there had 
 been a real arrest, and detention for several hours, by 
 whose contrivance they knew not, though they suspect- 
 ed by Lord Avondel's, as he certainly was privy to her 
 intention of going out of town that evening. Villars 
 fell into the usual error of candid people, who think 
 the} have been guilty of cherishing a false suspicion, 
 and with unbounded confidence surrendering his mind 
 to the guidance of a detestable woman, he became the 
 blind minister of her revenge. 
 
 Paulina now resolved to alarm Monthermer by the 
 afiectation of languor, seclusion, and grief. She de- 
 nied that she had any p.i.rticular indisposition in a man- 
 ner which convinced him that she concealed somethine

 which would cause him real distress. His intreatics 
 to be informed of the truth were redoubled. Her de- 
 nials grew fainter. She complained that he would 
 teaze her out of her prudent resolves, and at last pro- 
 tested Villai's must have betrayed her, or he would not 
 be so importunate. Monthermer took the hint, and 
 boldly taxed Villars with breach of duty in neglecting 
 to tell him the cause of that sorrow which preyed 
 upon his lady's mind. Villars stammered, excused 
 himself by his desire to avoid disagreeable conse- 
 quences, and believing Paulina had anticipated his 
 communications, expressed his hopes that Lord Avon- 
 del vv^ould give up his designs from a conviction of 
 their impracticability, without the general's interfer- 
 ence. Monthermer coloured, bit his lip, and replied, 
 that Avondel never abandoned any plan, since what- 
 ever his prudence undertook his genius rendered suc- 
 cessful. " In this instance he must," answered Villars, 
 " for I am persuaded Lady Paulina's virtue v;ill prove 
 alike impregnable whether he assail it by slander or by 
 art." 
 
 " Right," replied the general, " yet there will be 
 no harm in whispering in his ear that such is my opi- 
 nion." 
 
 " Will you, Sir, permit me to be the bearer of this 
 intelligence ?" 
 
 " I wish to avoid mistakes," said Monthermer cool- 
 ly, " and I conceive a business of this nature is best 
 adjusted by the principals." 
 
 Villars with affectionate terror expressed his dread 
 of the consequences of this rencontre. " The man is 
 mad," exclaimed the general, " what rencontre do you 
 apprehend ? Am I to stand to be shot at by every let- 
 cher who likes my wife :" Whistling a tune wth af- 
 fected gaiety, while his eye flashed fire, he returned 
 to Paulina whose penetration soon discovered, that the 
 prologue had been performed which was to usher in 
 the tragedy she had so long meditated. 
 
 "Ah!" said she with a shriek of tenor, "you 
 know all."

 '^' I know," replied Montht rmer, with passionate ten- 
 derness, " that I have the best wife in the world." 
 
 " And I fear you also know, the most perfidious 
 friend ?" 
 
 No," said the general, " when he attempted to rob 
 me of the treasure I entrusted to his care, he ceased 
 to be my friend." 
 
 Paulina replied, that his calmness removed a load of 
 terror from her mind. 
 
 " I feared," said she, " that the fatal maxims of 
 false honour, and that pride which distinguishes your 
 nation as the ' lords of human kind,' would have com- 
 pelled 3'ou to hazard your precious life, and thus plaiige 
 me in irremediable despair." 
 
 Monthermer mingled his affectionate thanks with as- 
 surances that he heartily despised the villain, and Pau- 
 lina, affecting to believe that composure to be real, 
 which she plainly perceived was a thm disguise to im- 
 placable resentment, consented to gratify him with that 
 full confidence which she had long studiously with-held. 
 She proceeded to describe Lord Avondel's solicitations, 
 insidious artifices, and daring machinations, and her 
 own at first unsuspecting friendship, and, when, his 
 purposes were unveiled, resolute prudence, in such co- 
 lours, that the indignant flesh of her husband's cheek 
 died away to the deadly pale of revenge : and though 
 he affected to listen to her narrative with careless ease 
 he muttered curses through his clenched teeth, while 
 his hand involuntary grasped his sword. 
 
 *' My life, my lord," said Paulina, again, " you alarm 
 me. You promised not to put pour own safety on a par 
 with that most infamous and insidious of friends, — of 
 seducers I mean ?" 
 
 " True," replied Monthermer, " I know I have 
 promised. My sword was entangled. Sweet appre- 
 hensive tenderness, why these terrors ?" 
 
 " O ever wise and kind," exclaimed Paulina, " the 
 air of your moody climate has damped my native fire. 
 But since even your return does not intnnicUite him let 
 us fly to Italy, there we shall be safe. Surrounded by

 powerful friends he dare not there attempt to force me 
 from you." 
 
 " It would be a desperate attempt in England," ob- 
 served Monthermer. 
 
 Paulina replied, that there was no knowing to what 
 crimes the indulgence of impetuous desires would lead 
 a powerful criminal. Like many other iniquitous mo- 
 ralizers, conscience compelled her to feel the justice of 
 the observation she made with a design to deceive. 
 
 Monthermer's eye again glanced upon his sword. 
 *' It would not be inexpedient," said he, "just to tell 
 Avondel that there is danger in impetuous desires." 
 
 "If you could do it very calmly it might recall the 
 lost wretch to the path of honour. In particular, I 
 should rejoice if he were compelled to retract the gross 
 aspersions which he has cast upon my reputation, and 
 which have so far succeeded that I am now exiled from 
 the respectable society in which I formerly moved. He 
 hoped, bv describing me as the partner of his guilty plea- 
 sures, to remove the most efl'ea<:ual barrier to actual 
 criminality. But though an unprotected stranger, ig- 
 norant of English manners, and for a length of time 
 confiding in this serpent, thus on my bended knees 
 I swear by the chaste powers who preside over mar- 
 riage"— 
 
 " Spare your assertions," interrupted Monthermer, 
 *' till I doubt your truth and honour. Go on with your 
 story. You were 50U say a stranger, a foreigner, a 
 beautiful woman, without one frit- nd or relation, in an 
 unknown country. — I commended you to the protec- 
 tion of Avondel — Curses blast the villain — Why are 
 you silent ? — He shall retract or die." 
 
 " He knows his own superior skill at the sword," 
 resumed the fiUse Italian. " At least avoid that wea- 
 pon. I hr.ve heard him say there is not a man in 
 England who could meet him in the fi,eld on equal 
 terms." 
 
 " He said so before I arrived," said Monthermer, 
 with a sardonic grin, piqued at having a superiority 
 on which he prided himself called in question.

 ' " No," replied Paulina, truth obliges me to own that 
 it was at our last interview." INTonthermer reiterated 
 the words " last interview," and Paulina confessed 
 that she had been thus unguarded from an expectation 
 that Villars had told him all. She then owned that the 
 base earl had affronted her with a visit a few days ago, 
 that he chose the known hour of the general's absence, 
 and owing to her unwillingness to cause a rupture, she 
 had once more endured his hateful presence, and had 
 urged every motive to induce him to desist from his 
 designs. But the horrid oaths which he swore, to 
 brave death in this world, and perdition in the next, 
 rather than relinquish her, added to his passionate as- 
 surances that her reputation was overwhelmed with 
 cureless opprobrium, had so agitated her, that she fell 
 into fits, a circumstance well known to her servants, 
 who indeed, by incidental evidence could confirm all 
 her testimony. 
 
 She now cast her eyes on her credulous dupe with 
 ineffable fondness, and affecting to be alarmed at his 
 undisguised frenzy, she pretended to believe that 
 Avondel might be persuaded by mild measures to re- 
 tract his slanders, and desist from his lawless pursuit. 
 Her own prudence and virtue would, she said, soon 
 rid her of this intruder without any dangerous risk. 
 The general agreed it would, and folding her in what 
 she hoped and believed was intended for a farewell 
 embrace, complained that the house was hotter than 
 liencoolen, and he must walkout for air. Paulina ac- 
 companied him to the door, as well to prevent the 
 attendance of Villars as to fan his rage by those mock 
 alleviations and warnings of danger, which she knew 
 would whet his courage to desperation. 
 
 On returning to her own apartment with somewhat 
 of the delight which oMedea might be supposed to feel 
 Avhen she had immolated her children on the shrine of 
 revenge, she was met by Villars, who, in the terror of 
 real affection, inquired where his master was gone ? 
 Paulina upbraided him severely for having violated 
 the confidence she had reposed in him, by discovering

 the baseness of Lord Avondel, and by an affectation 
 of extreme displeasure at haviiig the general tlsus ex- 
 posed to di'.nger, she contrived to withdraw the well 
 disposed young man from his first design of following 
 his master, by engaging him in a vindication of his 
 own conduct. She tlien assured him that she trusted 
 her prudence had warded off the evils his want of se- 
 crecy might have occasioned ; that she had reasoned 
 with Monthermer till he was quite calm, and laughing 
 at the earl's effrontery was gone out to dinner. Hav- 
 inp thus detained him till it was improbable his inter- 
 ference could prevent her hopes, she pardoned and dis- 
 niissid him, giving him as a sign oi restored grace a 
 collection of canzonets and sonnets to be transcribed in- 
 to her common-place book. 
 
 She now ruminated alone on the alternatives v/^hich 
 her sanguinary views presented. Both the gendemen 
 Were men of determined courage, it was therefore 
 highly probable one would fall. Suppose it was Lord 
 Avondel ? her revenge would then be gratified. i3ut 
 conr-idering his superior skill and calmness, the more 
 likely, and far more cherished, expectation was, that 
 his arm would reh ase her from the disgusting fond- 
 ness of a husband for whom her hatred and contempt 
 was increased, even by the facility with which he tell 
 into her snares. Thus, though slighted, rejected, re- 
 proved, and as she believed, insulted, by Lord Avon- 
 del, his virtue and dignity commanded her admiration, 
 and the recollection of his graceful manners, superior 
 conversation, and elegant tenderness, while she held 
 him in her chains, was so dear to her susceptibility, 
 and so flattering to her vanity, that she still considered 
 him as the first of mankind, and even while she fram- 
 ed a scheme for his destruction, wished success to his 
 arm.

 Mrs. Carter. 
 
 WHILE these scenes passed in London, Lady Se- 
 lina Delamore, reflecting on those traits of settled ma- 
 lice and deep design which were so apparent in Pauli- 
 na's character, entertained painful apprehensions for 
 Lord Avondel's safety. By way of convincing her, 
 that there was no reason to apprehend he should be as- 
 saulted from that quarter, the earl, in his letters to 
 Lime Grove, stated the affectionate welcome which 
 General Monthermer had received from his wife, the 
 perfect cordiality which subsisted between them, her 
 retirement from company, and every circumstance 
 which indicated real reformation. I need not add, that 
 this account was despatched previously to the interview 
 described in the last chapter ; and till then he really 
 hoped that disappointment had taught Paulina contri- 
 tion. A clearer insight into the disposition of this en- 
 terprising and unprincipled woman, induced Selina 
 from the first to doubt the reality of this instantaneous 
 conversion, this entire change of opinions, affections, 
 and habits, which might indeed he useful to carry on 
 a design, but which a proud unconvinced offender ne- 
 ver sincerely adopts. That she designed to blind the 
 general, and to shut his ears against every report to her 
 disadvantage, was obvious. But Selina also suspected 
 another purpose, and feared the great and generous 
 Avondel was the premeditated victim intended to ce- 
 ment with his blood the discordant union of credulity 
 and falsehood. Her anxiety to expedite the intended

 removal of the Avondels from London now became 
 extreme ; but as she knew that by strongly insisting on 
 the danger of the earl's stay she should rather retard 
 than accelerate her purpose, she urged him to recollect, 
 that, after having devoted so large a portion of his 
 life to the service of the public, the rich inheritance 
 which his wife possessed called upon him to change 
 the statesman and the legislator into the country gen- 
 tleman, the beneficient nobleman, the enlightened con- 
 siderate landlord, the friend and feudal benefac:;or of 
 the fair domain, which claimed his presence and need- 
 ed a superintending understanding liberal and discri- 
 minating as his, to repair the injuries which waste, 
 neglect, and good intentions, unassisted by vigorous 
 intellect, had caused. She spoke of the repose his 
 mird required after the painful conflicts it had sus- 
 tained. She mentioned various plans of improve- 
 ment and schemes of beneficence which Emily wish- 
 ed to establish at the seat of her ancestors, and that 
 her health and that of his son would be improved 
 by the balsamic air of Devonshire. Lastly, she re- 
 minded him, that though she had no doubt of the sin- 
 cerity of his intentions, yet the same command which, 
 founded on a knowledge of human weakness, taught 
 us to pray for supernatural aid against temptation 
 enjoined us to flee Irom it : that our prayers were 
 also precepts, and it was a solemn mockery to contra- 
 dict our requests by our actions. " The history of our 
 unhappy parents," said she, " is a dreadful warning 
 to teach us not to trust in our own strength, and as I 
 am convinced Paulina's aflection for you has been most 
 violent, I know your generous mind will feel it to be 
 a duty to leave her to cherish her returning sense of 
 fidelity to her husband, without exposing her virtue, 
 while unconfirmed by habit, to the danger of contrast- 
 ing the man she has loved with the inferior qualities of 
 him to whom she \- i.-ound, and to who n you tell me 
 she is now heroically devoting her undivided atten- 
 tions."

THE REFUSAL. 217 
 
 To arguments so cogent Lord Avondel could only 
 oppose one reason for delay. A motion was expected 
 to !)e made in the house of lords in which he thought 
 the honour of his sovereign and the national prosperity 
 were deeply involved. It was a scheme of the oppo- 
 sition to gain popularity. He had detected its mis- 
 chievous tendency, and he resolved to oppose it with 
 all the power of tiis eloquence, and the weight of his 
 name. In unravelling the sophistry of these pseudo 
 patriots, he had often lost sight of those painful im- 
 pressions of degradation which were inseparablv united 
 with Paulina's image, and with this great effort to de- 
 fend his country he determined to close his public ca- 
 reer, to bid adieu to cities, courts, and camps, and to 
 pursue the plan Selina prescribed. In the enjoyment 
 of her pure and instructive friendship, in the gentle 
 tenderness of his amiable wife, in the delightful em- 
 ployment of forming the mind and manners of his son, 
 and in all those generous and social offices which sim- 
 ple wealth permits a liberal heart and enlightened mind 
 to perform, he promised himself no common por- 
 tion of happiness, and fancied his sun would de- 
 scend in mild glory. So probably it might have done, 
 had he never submitted to that malign influence which 
 blasts with repercussive destruction after it has ceased 
 to be lord of the ascendant. 
 
 On the day the motion was brought forward, Avon- 
 del went down to the house at an early hour. In pass- 
 ing through the avenues he was assailed by JMonther- 
 mer, with an abrupt inquiry if he was alarmed at see- 
 ing him? Avondei replied, the sight of an old friend 
 was more calculated to give pleasure than alarm. " 'Tis 
 strange then," returned the general, " that I should 
 have been some weeks in England without seeing you." 
 
 " I have called," said Avondel, " and you were ab- 
 sent." 
 
 " You have called!" exclaimed Monthermer, and 
 then added with emphasis, " This to my face ? Thou 
 villain !

 Avondel retreated as if struck by the charge of a 
 culverin. His blood boiled at the opprobious epithet, 
 but he recollected rage was as delirious as insanity, 
 and determining to be calm, he asked the reason why 
 he was assaulted with such language ? 
 
 " Ask your own conscience, cursfd dissembler," 
 was the reply of the infuriated husband. He stamped 
 with his foot, and added, " my wife, my wife ! I will 
 have satisfaction." 
 
 " Your wife," returned Avondel, " is spotless for 
 me." 
 
 Monthermer continued to rave, called her an inju- 
 red vestal, and demanded a recompense for intended 
 wrongs in a still louder tone. 
 
 " This is no place," said the earl, " to discuss our 
 dispute. I am summoned into the house by import- 
 ant duties. You are a brave man, general, as such sus- 
 pend this fury." 
 
 " You will meet me then?" inquired Monthermer. 
 
 " As a friend, and as the vindicator of my own ho- 
 nour, I will meet you any where," was Lord Avon- 
 del's reply. 
 
 " To-morrow at six in the morning without seconds 
 in the Green Park." 
 
 " I will meet you without witnesses," answered 
 Avondel, " and with no other weapons than truth and 
 justice." 
 
 At this mpment Lord Glenvorne joined them, at- 
 tracted by the loud tones and violent gestures of the 
 general. ' " I trust," said the marquis, " I am not an 
 impertinent intruder." 
 
 Avondel answered this was his first interview with 
 General Monthermer since his return from India, " but 
 not our last," muttered Monthermer as he retired. " I 
 trust," replied the earl, in a firm but conciliatory tone, 
 " we shall meet often in amity and esteem." 
 
 " You must not call my friendship officiousness," 
 said Lord Glenvorne to Lord Avondel, " if I anxiously 
 ask, what has been the nature of your conversation 
 with Paulina's husband r"

 "' The denomination you have used," replied the 
 earl, " points it out. He has heard something respect- 
 ing my intimacy with that lady, which he is disposed 
 to resent. Common report is very busy with charac- 
 ters, but I am convinced it will be easy for me to clear 
 my own conduct. Though violent, Monthermer is a 
 man of honour." 
 
 " The less likely" observed the marquis, " to be 
 soon appeased, especially if, as is probable, he has been 
 wrought up to resentment by one whose influencs over 
 his passions is well known." 
 
 " We will postpone this subject," answered the ge- 
 nerous earl, who could not for a moment believe Pau- 
 lina had turned his accuser. " A more important bu- 
 siness requires immediate attention. My Lord Glen- 
 vorne, I ask your support this evening, but it is in the 
 persuasion that you will feel yourself acting as a loyal 
 subject and steady patriot, by ranging yourself on the 
 side of your friend. Firmness and wisdom, my lord, 
 united with courage, will repel public as well as pri- 
 vate enemies." 
 
 Never did the abilities of Lord Avondel appear to 
 greater advantage than on this evening. With mas- 
 terly precision he followed the popular orators through 
 the whole range of their sophistical arguments, and by 
 the power of reason, combined with historical know- 
 ledge, exposed the fallacy of their statements, and then 
 appealed to the wisdom, loyalty, and honour, of 'the 
 house, with a glow of language, a sweetness of intona- 
 tion, and a gracefulness of action, which warmed every 
 heart. The " wondering senate hung on all he spoke," 
 and the feebleness with which his opponents attempt- 
 ed to reply indicated the secret conviction which the 
 strong fetters of party would not permit them to ac- 
 knowledge. The motion was negatived by a triumph- 
 ant majority. Avondel saw himself surrounded by 
 numerous friends, all vying with each other who shouFd 
 give most emphasis and variety to their congratula- 
 tions. It was known he had fixed the ensuing day to 
 set off for Castle Mandeville. The Premier pressed

 his band with an air of fervent gratitude, and wished 
 him every enjoyment in his rural retreat. '' You emu- 
 late Cincinnatus, my lord," said he, ••' you do not re- 
 tire to your plough till you have saved your country." 
 Yet at this perhaps proudest moment of Lord Avon- 
 del's life, his soul as depressed with conscious degra- 
 dation. The arguments of his enemies had been like 
 the green withes which held Sampson, and he had dis- 
 dainfully snapped them with his touch, but in one point 
 his strength failed him, and Lord Norbury, the Ther- 
 sites of the oppositionists, assailed him where he was 
 vulnerable. Knowing the exquisite sensibility with 
 which he was endued, he knew he could gall him with 
 the sly arrow of reproach, and prevent him from en- 
 joying his full-blossoming honours by a hint which 
 none else understand. He praised with exaggerated 
 metaphor that eloquence which had, he said, paralized 
 the house, and absolutely benumbed his own faculties. 
 He declared it possessed all the bewitching graces of 
 the Italian school, enriched by the glowing phraseology 
 of the oriental idiom, and he declared neither man nor 
 ivoman could resist such insinuating persuasion. The 
 glowing cheek and averted eyes of Avondel told Nor- 
 bury his shaft had not missed its aim, nor did he again 
 attempt to rear his lofty head, or by a keen retort si- 
 lence his gibing adversary. Thus cowardly and en- 
 feebling guilt subdued the first man in England, and 
 made him, even in the moment of his triumph, abashed 
 by the sarcasm of a flippant debauchee, whose feelings 
 reproach could not wound, whose character no impu- 
 tation could degrade. Yet, the allusion which pene- 
 trated to the soul of Avondel, passed either undiscov- 
 ered, or despised for its malignity. No peals of laugh- 
 ter, not even one smile of approbation, disturbed the 
 consistent gravity of British senators, or vitiated that 
 full and solemn eclat which followed the brilliant exer-

 ating an accuser."

 The earl's depression was visible to Lord Glen\ orne, 
 •who, persuaded that it was connected with his alter- 
 cation with Monthermer, was anxious to act as a me- 
 diator, or by some other means prevent the apprehend- 
 ed consequences. But Avondcl treated that business 
 with indifference, and called on the marquis to rejoice 
 at the triumph which truth and wisdom had obtained 
 over the stubborn spirit of party. " To render that 
 triumph complete," said Glcnvorne," we must pre- 
 serve the worthy by whose exertions it has been obtain- 
 ed. INIy lord, if you meet Monthermer, I must be a 
 witness of what passes." 
 
 Lord Avondel replied, that as his object was to con- 
 ciliate, he would do nothing which could by any per- 
 version be deemed exasperating. " I will not," said 
 he, " give him an excuse for adopting a desperate 
 course by intimating that I suspected danger. I have 
 pledged my honour to m.eet him alone, and to relieve 
 your friendly anxiety I promise by the same inviolable 
 tie, that I will not take any weapon. I trust I shall be 
 able to satisfy his resentment without sanctioning a 
 practice I condemn and abhor." 
 
 " I ought," replied the marquis, " to be satisfied 
 with this assurance, as it must prevent all bad conse- 
 quences ; but there is a solemnitv in your manner so 
 unlike the exultation, I anticipated froni the events of 
 this evening, which persuades me that you have fears 
 you will not communicate." 
 
 " Say feelings," returned Avondel, " and you will 
 be correct. You are young. Lord Glenvorne ; the 
 vivid hopes and generous emulation of your age prompt 
 you to consider felicity as synonymous with the glori- 
 ous achievn>ents of virtuous ambition. To paint my own 
 reflections on retiring from the soul-harrowing scenes 
 of a public life, would be too dispiriting, and I would 
 not at this eventful period rob my country of a gene- 
 rous citizen. Yet, a retrospect of the little good our 
 best purposes and most strenuous endeavous have ac- 
 complished, of the dangers we have escaped, the er- 
 rors we have committed, our infirmities, our weak-

 ness, perhaps I should use a stronger term, — Oh Glen- 
 vorne, reviewing the circumscribed powers of man 
 when acting in his most capacious sphere, contemplat- 
 ing the temptations incident to greatness, even in this 
 hour of victory I wish myself an obscure peasant, 
 placed in some peaceful village, with sentiments cor- 
 responding to that humble lot unvexed by opposition, 
 ignorant alike of calumny and fame." 
 
 " Whither," inquired the marquis, smiling, '* does 
 your lordship, wish yourself transported ? In what 
 remote corner w ill you find a man who has neither been 
 praised nor censured, tempted nor opposed ? 'I'he 
 only difference is, the peasant's world is his own vil- 
 lage, yours the British empire, whose legislators you 
 have enlightened, whose battles you have fought, whose 
 rights you have maintained." 
 
 " And scandalized her morals," Avondel was ready 
 to add, but shame and the decent pride which attends 
 true repentance prevented him from continually ac- 
 knowledging that fault to man which he deplored to 
 God. Glenvorne continued to declaim on the futility 
 of reproach when pointed at a character whose digni- 
 fied purity repelled every invidious aspersion. Lord 
 Avondel sighed, owned unswerving rectitude was the 
 best defence from calumny, and then asked where 
 faultless virtue dwelt ? The noblemen pai'ted, but not 
 till Lord Glenvorne had requested that he might be 
 speedily informed what was the event of his interview 
 with the general. 
 
 The tender Emily received her lord with transport. 
 The success which had crowned his labours seemed to 
 her the more welcome, as it was to terminate those 
 cares which she thought corroded his health and peace, 
 and to usher in a new, and, in her estimation, happier 
 course of life. After listening with tears of affection- 
 ate exultation to the history of the debate, she expa- 
 tiated on the happiness of their future prospects, — the 
 freedom from ceremonious restraints which the coun- 
 try afforded, a larger portion of her lord's society, the 
 company of her aunt, the education of her child, the

 indulgence of every social and benevolent affection. — 
 Her entire affection ibr her Avondel had not only in- 
 duced her to forgive him, but to forget the past, and 
 she received him, not as one who sincerely repented, 
 but as one who had never erred. All her anxiety was 
 to cast the same oblivious veil over his mind ; but as 
 I have before remarked, here her efforts faile<;l, and 
 her solicitude to reconcile him to himself even deepL-n- 
 ed his self reproach. The consciousness that he had 
 been unjust to such placability, such unalterable love, 
 made him feel incapable of enjoying full complacence 
 in the contemplation of her virtues. On the present 
 evening, the insinuations of Norbury, the threats of 
 jNIonthermer, and the depression into which the mind 
 naturally sinks after the toil of great exertion, or the 
 flurry of extraordinary success, pre-disposed Lord 
 Avondel to listen with unusual interest to a conversa- 
 tion which painted the joys of benificence, the plea- 
 sures of retirement, and the satisfaction of living for 
 ourselves. The chaste simplicity of his wife's charac- 
 ter was called by the subject into full lustre. He won- 
 dered how he eould ever deem her conversation taste- 
 less, how he could forsake innocence and security for 
 guilt and danger. His past life seemed a fearful desert, 
 a thorny wilderness, his future, with such associates 
 as Emily and Selina, a paradise visited by angels.— 
 " Yes," said he, to his enraptured consort, " halcyon 
 days await us. It is only now I truly begin to live.''

 THOUGH the intrepidity which had often support- 
 ed Lord Avondel in battle prevented him from fear- 
 ing the issue of his interview with Monthermer, the 
 events of the day had too deeply affected him to allow 
 him to sleep. He hoped, he was persuaded, he should 
 be able to assuage the general's furv, which he sup- 
 posed originated from his having heard the common 
 rumour of his intimacy M'ith Paulina : yet, to meet a 
 man whom he had injured (and putting the case as his 
 own, could he conceal from himself that he had injur- 
 ed Monthermer?) to hope for at best a partial vindica- 
 tion of his own conduct, to know that he had tamper- 
 ed with the affections of a married woman, and actu- 
 ally tottered on the verge of committing one of the 
 foulest crimes, for which he must either apologize or 
 deny his own actions, were sufficieiit to stretch a miru.1 
 endued with such moral susceptibility on the rack of 
 torture, and to make him anticipate the morning with 
 more of dread and horror than he ever experienced in 
 the front of an hostile army. 
 
 He rose very early, and in passing the nursery heard 
 the cries of his little son. " Some infantine distress," 
 thought he " oppresses him, which his immature or- 
 gans are unable to ask us to relieve. It is however 
 the distress of innocence. From what motive springs 
 mine ? Why at this unusual hour do I steal from m)''

 tortured by an anguish which I cannot communicate V

 He found the general waiting at the appointed ren- 
 dezvous. A night devoted to intemperance had ren- 
 dered him still more sanguinary, and absolutely deaf 
 to every attempt at explanation. He commended 
 Avondel's honour in Ijringing no one to interrupt bu- 
 siness, and throwing oil" his coat, told him he was ready 
 to begin. The earl answered he was unarmed. Mon- 
 thermer branded him with the name of coward, and 
 Avondcl confessed he did fear to violate those laws 
 which his station called upon him to defend. 
 
 " You should have thought of this," said Monther- 
 nicr, '' when vou broke die ties of honour and friend- 
 ship, and attempted to bring disgrace and misery into 
 my family." 
 
 '" General Monthermer," returned Lord Avondel, 
 with solemn earnestness, '* according to that low esti- 
 mate of principle which satisfies ordinary minds, I 
 could deny your charge, bat I will own that I feel my- 
 self a culprit, and I give you a superiority which I never 
 before acceded to man, by asking you to pardon an in- 
 tentional offence. I have trifled with the affections of 
 Lady Paulina, but this is all my crime." 
 
 " This is not all," returned the infuriated husband. 
 " You must publicly acknowledge your baseness in de- 
 faming the virtue you could not corrupt. 
 
 " I do not understand this accusation ; speak expli- 
 ciU)'." 
 
 " Has not my wife's character been aspersed, and 
 herself banished from the best society, on your ac- 
 count?" 
 
 " Not through my levity or vanity. I challenge the 
 universe to say I ever breathed a syllable to Lady Pau- 
 lina's dishonor." 
 
 " 'Tis herself who accuses you of having first assail- 
 ed her virtue, and then her fame. Seducer ! detractor ! 
 what ! are you now appalled at being thus deprived ot 
 every subterfuge ?" 
 
 Avondel was indeed appalled by the discovery of 
 that superlative wickedness which he believed imprac- 
 ticable, at the same moment he felt the retributive hand

 of heaven in thus mnkingher the scourge of his vices. 
 Perceiving him aghast at this accusation, Monthermer 
 told him he would sheath his sword, provided he v.'ould 
 make public reparation to the slandered virtues of Pau- 
 lina. Roused to indignation by the proposal, he be- 
 came so regardless of his personal safety a& to forget 
 he was unarmed and unattended in the presence of a 
 furious enemy, instigated by two blind incentives, wine 
 and love. With proud contempt he answered, that he 
 would never degrade himself by n'sakiug concessions 
 to such a woman as Prtulina. JMad with rage, Mon- 
 iliermer rushed upon iiim and buiied his sword in his 
 bosom. 
 
 Lord Avonrlel staggered and fell. For a moment 
 all was silent; but as the blood streamed from the earl 
 tiie general's fury changt-d to deep remorse. Pie knelt 
 beside him, attempted to raise him from tlie earth, and 
 ynxiously asked if the wound was serious ? Avondel 
 faintly answered in the affirmative, and bade him con- 
 sult his own safety. 
 
 Monthermer's compunction was as lively as his vin- 
 dictive passions. He sav/ prostrate on the earth, woun- 
 ded or perhaps murdered by his hand, an English no- 
 bleman of the highest rank and fairest fame ; for many 
 years his colleague and commander, the companion of 
 las social pleasures, the friend whose assistance he had 
 often experienced, whose honour and integrity he had 
 tried. Thi? distinguished and revered character he 
 had assailed as an assassin. ' He had arrested him in 
 the midst of his glorious coiu-se with a blow which he 
 could not have warded off, and yet, instead of reproach, 
 he had only bid him escape. Was this the conduct of a 
 villain? He grasped the hand of Lord Avondel, who 
 returning its pressure said, " You have been deceived, 
 Monthermer, and stimulated to commit an act your 
 soul abhors. I forgive you. Fly, while it is in your 
 power ; I will not accuse you." 
 
 No instrument of torture could have caused an an- 
 guish so exquisite as the general now felt, '^ Yet,"

 thought he, " I will atone all I can. I will call a surgeon 
 and surrender myself to justice." 
 
 At this instant, Villars, who had in vain sought his 
 master at his accustomed haunts, having discovered his 
 appointment with Lord Avondel too late to prevent its 
 fatal effects, arrived at the spot with such assistants as 
 the too probable consequences suggested to his anxious 
 mind. His first care was to force the general into a 
 carriage which was in waiting ; his next to succour the 
 bleeding Avondel. The surgeon who accompanied 
 him expressed much apprehension from the appearance 
 of the wound, and looking round exclaimed, how could 
 this have happened, the gentleman is unarmed ?" Faint 
 and exhaused. Lord Avondel opened his eyes. He 
 recognised Villars, and with noble anxiety to save his 
 misguided murderer from the fouler imputations at- 
 tached to his guilt, he asked him to give him his sword. 
 Villars answered the weapon that lay on the ground 
 was his master's. " It must have been exchanged in 
 the scuffle," said Avondel. " Sir I require you to at- 
 tend ?«f, and cautiously apprize my family of my situa- 
 tion." 
 
 The application of styptics and cordials enabled Lord 
 Avondel to bear removal. He seized the first moment 
 of privacy to ask Villars after his master. *' My re- 
 covery," said he, " is at best dubious. I advise him 
 to leave England, and as you tender his safety place 
 some confidential person near him. His recollection 
 is extremely confused, and his account of this business 
 must be disregarded. When this is done, let me see 
 you again." 
 
 Lord Avondel now submitted his wound to exami- 
 nation, and in the looks of the surgeon read a confirm- 
 ation of his own opinion. " I am a soldier, sir," said 
 he, " you may be explicit to me, but as some tender 
 hearts are deeply interested in my safety, I could wish 
 they may be gradually prepared for the stroke, by being 
 informed that the case is not quite desperate. Your 
 application has given me ease, I thank you, sir, I have 
 much business to perform."

 The return of Vlllars set the generous nobleman at 
 rest with respect to Monthermer''s safety, who, under 
 the care of his chaphiin, was on the road to Dover, and 
 would be out of the kingdom in a few hours. Villars 
 spoke of the state of his mind as bordering on insani- 
 ty. " He accuses himself," said he, " of such con- 
 duct as w^e cannot credit, but I trust my lord you will 
 be just." " I shall be more than just," returned Lord 
 Avondel, " I shall be silent. Blr. Villars, are you in 
 the confidence of Lady Paulina Monthermer r" 
 
 " No further, mv lord, than as she is the wife of 
 that friend and benefactor to whose fortunes I am in- 
 violably bound." 
 
 " 'Tis well," answered the earl ; " preserve that re- 
 solution. She knows the events of this morning ?" 
 
 *' She does." 
 
 " And supports her firmness r" 
 
 " My lord," answered Villars, reddening, " I re- 
 quest you will not question me about Lady Paulina." 
 
 " My intention," said his lordship, " is only to de- 
 sire that you will faithfully describe to her my last mo- 
 ments, and to tell her I forgive her." 
 
 " Mutual forgiveness," returned Villars, deeply af- 
 fected, " is the duty of us frail beings." " True," 
 replied the earl ; he paused a moment, and then add- 
 ed, " I do not ask forgiveness of Paulina. Continue 
 faithful to the unhappy general, we will mention her 
 name no more." 
 
 To describe the distress O'f Lady Avondel would be 
 Impossible. The vehemence of her fears soon over- 
 powered the weak barrier of hope which the surgeon 
 pi-etended to interpose, and the threatened loss of the 
 idol of her soul so overwhelmed her, that intense af- 
 fliction subdued her weak frame, and she became in- 
 capable of rendering those services which her dying 
 lord required. But a ministering angel sat bv his pil- 
 low to give him every comfort his agonized fnime and 
 contrite spirit demanded from commiserating benevo- 
 lence. Pale as an alabaster-figure who bends over 
 some hero's ashes, with looks of unutterable woe, Se-

 lina hung over her adored Avondel, whispering the 
 consohitions which only heavenly truth can supply in 
 those moments, when the enjoyments of this world 
 vanish from our grasp, fanning that heavenly flame of 
 piety which the tempest of temporal pursuits had near- 
 ly cxtirguished, and tranquilli2ing his earth-born cares 
 by solemn promises of observing all his injunctions. 
 Her sorrow for this separation, which again blasted all 
 her revived hopes of happiness in this world, seemed 
 to be suspended, by her anxiety to secure a re-union 
 with him in a happier region, and in her solicitude to 
 remove from his death-bed those thorns which corrode 
 the feelings of a husband and a father. 
 
 Yet, not even to his beloved Selina, in whose invio- 
 lable honour and wise circumspection he so justly con- 
 fided, did Avondel detail the circumstances of his in- 
 terview with the General, or discover the full enormity 
 of Paulina's guilt. He justly considered the wound 
 he had received as a punishment for his past offences, 
 in suffering his insatiable vanity and fastidious pride to 
 seduce his affections and withdraw his society from his 
 unoffending wife, and to devote his heart and his com- 
 pany to a woman whom his judgment told him was 
 destitute of every estimable quality. That woman, 
 too, the wife of another, of a man for whoni he pro- 
 fessed a friendship, and v/ho entrusted her to his ho- 
 nour. Ought he not to have persevered in his first 
 virtuous purpose, and repelled her advances with dis- 
 gust, instead of meeting them w^ith encouragement? 
 Should he, who had planned an elopement, who had 
 consented to a criminal amour, who had abandoned a 
 guiltless woman whose life was bound up in his love, 
 could such a culprit in act and in intention, claim any 
 merit, because, by a providential interference, his ca- 
 reer had been interrupted before he reached the goal 
 of wickedness ? Was his punishment undeserved, 
 though he was cut off in manhood's glorious prime, 
 while he meditated vast desig-ns of universal benefit, 
 by the momentary impulse of a passion not more re- 
 pugnant to the laws of God and man than that which

 he had cherished for days and months ? Murder and 
 adultery are condemned by the same code, and it be- 
 came not him who had broken the seventh command- 
 ment in purpose, and who had been almost miracu- 
 lously prevented from breaking it in act, to bring the 
 hasty, repenting violator of the sixth to condign pu- 
 nishment. He felt the sword of Monthermer to be 
 the instrument of justice, and he was most anxious 
 to save the life of him who wept the deed he hud 
 done. As to Paulina, his word was plighted not to 
 accuse her. Her image haunted him in the form of 
 an infernal fury, dealing out crimes and vengeance ; yet 
 fearful of cherishing revenge, he wished her to live to 
 feel contrition. 
 
 To satisfy the anxiety of the pious Selina, who re- 
 quested him to signify his repentance for having sanc- 
 tioned the dreadful enormity of duelling by his prac- 
 tice, he assured her that his conscience was not dis- 
 turbed on that account. He acknowledged (but v/ith- 
 out owning that it was on her account) his early youth 
 had been tarnished by an intention of being guilty of 
 such criminal rashness, but having been extricated 
 from this perilous situation by the care of a friend, his 
 reputation for personal courage in his rencounters vv'ith 
 the enemies of his country had enabled him to avoid 
 all private quarrels, without giving any reason to sus- 
 pect that his refusing to subject himself to these bloody 
 appeals to chance, proceeded irom any other motive 
 than principle. " On the faith of a dying man," ad- 
 ded he, " I met Monthermer determined not to lift my 
 arm against his life. And now, my best Selina, in- 
 quire no more, I bequeath no legacy of revenge to my 
 family. Offer for me your intercessive prayers, that 
 mv offences may be forgiven as truly as I forgive." 
 
 The love of fame, that last infirmity of noble minds, 
 still clung to the soul of Avondel, and made him 
 greatly fear and deeply regret the possibility that all 
 his illustrious deeds would be sunk in the overwhelm- 
 ing accusation, that his life was at last forfeited to the 
 effects of a criminal passion. Sttmg with the appre-

 hension that he should be ranked with those fallen wor- 
 thies, who have sacrificed their laurels on the shrine of 
 venal worthless beauty, he called on his Selina to en- 
 deavour to preserve his fame. That delicacy of mo- 
 ral feeling which he had ever preserved would not per- 
 mit hiin to consider the character of a successful gal- 
 lant in any other than a disgraceful point of view, and 
 he would have surrendered the reputation of half his 
 great actions to remove the opprobrium of having been 
 a fi'.ithless husband. He protested that, except in one 
 instance, when his mind had been warped by suspicion, 
 he had ever been just to the virtues of Emily; and, 
 had his life been spared, he sincerely meant to have 
 made her reparation for all her sorrow. " Gentle in- 
 nocent," exclaimed he, " her temper was formed for 
 tranquillity and happiness, but I — " here he paused, 
 and looked to heaven with contrition and intercessive 
 anxiety, yet, full of hope that his widow's sorrows 
 Avould meet with a comforter. 
 
 His care then i-everted to that unperishable part, his 
 memory, which he inust leave to the mercy of his fel- 
 low mortals. " O my Selina," said he, " when you 
 hear my actions canvassed, endeavour to extenuate 
 those you cannot justify. Tell my accusers that man 
 is frail, most frail indeed, when proud and self-depen- 
 dent he neglects to solicit the defence of ccelestial ar- 
 mour." 
 
 Frequently he conversed about his son. " It was 
 my first wish," said he, " to have formed his mind 
 and manners, but I entrust him with a full confidence 
 to a better guardian. Should your cares succeed, 
 should you live to see him adorned with manly ener- 
 gy, liberal, brave, and disinterested, to guard his vir- 
 tues and direct his inexperience, tell him my story. 
 Prove to him that it is equally our duty to subdue the 
 querulous humour engendered by disappointment, and 
 to guard against the fastidiousness v/hich is fostered by 
 prosperity. He is born to affluence, forewarn him that 
 a lull indulgence of even its innocent gratifications 
 produces satiety, and that satiety ever inclines our vi- 
 tiated desires to tempt the paths of illicit pleasure.

 Say, that occasional self-denial, the virtue of warriors 
 and sages, the source of true magnanimity and self- 
 command, exhilirating energetic self-denial, is a pru- 
 dential as well as a christian precept." 
 
 His voice faultered while his eyes turned on his 
 best beloved with a look of never dying esteem. " Ex- 
 emplify your precepts," he continued, " by telling hlni 
 your own history. Shew him the sanctif5'ing qua- 
 lites of affliction rightly applied, and bid him to the 
 public duties which his station requires, add those pas- 
 sive virtues most difficult to practise, which are disre- 
 garded by common observers, and often misrepresent- 
 ed and traduced, yet so necessary as a check to intem- 
 perate thirst for applause, and so consolatory when our 
 best and purest intentions are opposed by a deluded 
 world. Tell him, for you who have proved the truth can 
 explain it with resistless eloquence, that the virtues 
 which are overlooked by man are the best preparations 
 for Heaven." 
 
 Thus, while his faculties remained unclouded by 
 the slow approaches of death, the illustrious and en- 
 lightened earl of Avondel continued to utter the dic- 
 tates of his long experience to what might be truly 
 termed his kindred mind. He expired in her arms, 
 and while, in bitterness of anguish, she deplored the 
 hero's fate, the awakened faith and sincere contrition 
 with which the wanderer sought consolation in the 
 promises of ever-during Mercy, afforded her inefi'a- 
 ble consolation. May such be the exit of all who 
 have like him offended! But the conscience of Lord 
 Avondel was not seared, nor his sensibilitj- weaken- 
 ed, nor his understanding degraded, by habitual 
 crimes. He could not glory in his shame, nor justify 
 that in himself uhich he knew was destructive to the 
 welfare of that country whose prosperity was the first 
 v/ish of his soul. However guarded by courage, or 
 guided bv' wisdom, he was convinced England was 
 best defended by the virtues of her offspring, with- 
 out which a nation must ever be found wanting when 
 weighed in that balance which decides the fate of em- 
 pires.

 CHAPTER XXXIV. 
 
 O Death, all eloquent you onlj- prove 
 
 "What Dust we doat on when 'tis Man we love. 
 
 I'OPE. 
 
 THE maternal tenderness of Lady Avondel pre- 
 served her from falling a victim to her intense grief, 
 and in time enabled her to listen to the admonitions of 
 her aunt, who, leading her lovely orphan to her em- 
 braces, reminded her that he now was Avondel. Yet, 
 though the duties of her exalted station, which Lady 
 Selina told her it would be criminal to renounce, at 
 length compelled her, with loath reluctance, to resume 
 her place in society, sorrow had quenched in her eyes 
 the torch of love never more to be re-illumined. The 
 generous lover, who admired her virtues, and the art- 
 ful adventurer, who wished to riot in her fortunes, 
 were alike restrained by a cold melancholy, which pro- 
 ved that it would be profanation to attempt to breathe 
 their vows in her ear. Devoted to the memory of her 
 early love, her widowed heart was only kept from 
 busting by its passionate attachment to the offspring of 
 her chaste alfection, whom she now loved less as her 
 own child than as the sole remains of her idolised hus- 
 band. It was her dearest enjoyment to gaze on his 
 features, to analyse his sentiments, and to trace their 
 analogy to those of his father. Every day he was 
 shewn the Earl's picture, and every day some anec- 
 dote of that illustrioub character w;is impressed on the 
 inemory of the wondering boy. Thus, having had what 
 she termed her dearest enjovment, the child Mas com- 
 mitted to his tutors, and Emily, su])ported by her 
 aunt, attended to the calls of social life, and the claims 
 which want and worth hove upon opulence. But though 
 these insuperable obligations called her alternately ta

 the cottage and the palace, neither among the manly 
 characters to whom adversity teaches fortitude, nor 
 the liberal minds in whom science and emulation awak- 
 en expanded intellect, did the widowed countess dis- 
 cover the counterpart of her Avondel. Some might 
 be virtuous, others wise ; this man had courage, that 
 patriotism ; she met elegant gentlemen and graceful 
 figures ; but all were inferior to him whom she once 
 called her lord. In him every excellence combined, 
 dignity, valour, unclouded intellect, magnanimity, and 
 disinterestedness, were all shrouded in his early tomb. 
 There the sun of Britain, after gilding the splendid 
 parallel of attic elegance and Roman integrity, in her 
 estimation set for ever ; and in any public emergency 
 it was her constant practice to exclaim, " Now we 
 want my dearest Lord, he could have saved us." 
 
 " But," inquires the reader, *' what terrible fate 
 overtook Paulina ? I trust Madam, you will attend 
 to poetical justice, and make her punishment exempla- 
 ry." 
 
 Poetical justice is so little similar to real life, that I 
 am apt to consider the constant attendance to the maxim, 
 that *' though vice triumphs for a time, virtue is always 
 victorious at the last," which the fashion of literature 
 now requires, to be one cause of the prevailing senti- 
 ment, that temporal prosperity is the criterion of me- 
 rit ; an opinion which peculiarizes the present age, 
 though it is equally contradicted by scripture and his- 
 tory ; I mean if by merit we understand virtue. Nor 
 have we any reason to recur to past ages, as the pre- 
 sent furnishes many striking examples in public and 
 private life, of the most atrocious wickedness becom- 
 ing remarkable by an uninterrupted career of good 
 fortune. 
 
 Why then does poetical justice require us always to 
 visit those offences with visible punishments which the 
 Almighty oftener spares ? To be instructive, fiction 
 must be a faithful imitation of real events, chosen with 
 skill, and adapted to moral improvemtnt. Surely, 
 one reason for this vapid repitition of a ft littering de- 
 ception, is, that prosperity, " the God of this world,"

 has taken such hold of our hearts, that we can form 
 no conception ol happiness, or even trnnquillity, but as 
 plants growing uniler the shade of his temple. We 
 underrate " that peace of God which passeth all un- 
 derstanding," and we believe " the worm which dieth 
 not" is too feeble an instrument of torture for unre- 
 pentant sin, unless poverty and affliction invelope it in 
 sackcloth and ashes. Even moral writers often insist 
 on the necessity of decorating virtue with adventitious 
 splendors, in the face of those Divine precepts which 
 teach us, that if we will be faithiul soldiers of our 
 master we must expect to be assailed by outward con- 
 flicts of sorrow as well as temptation, though, if we 
 resist the one, and endure the other, we shall have 
 inward repose. 
 
 Still, I willingly admit, nothing has so great a ten- 
 dency in the common course of things, to exalt a na- 
 tion as universal justice, benevolence, temperance, and 
 piety. Whenever the practice of these virtues becomes 
 general, public prosperit)' and the success of good indi- 
 viduals will be combined bj- the same course of events, 
 but while vices of a contrary descriptioa prevail th-y 
 who would preserve their innocence must arm their 
 minds to expect disappointments and vexations, a con- 
 flict and not a crown. But if their hearts are right 
 Avith God, these ev.ls will be infinitely counterpoised 
 by a calm serenity of mind, arising from a victory 
 over irregular desires, a patient dependance on uner- 
 ring wisdom, a happy consciousness of acting as they 
 ought, and such a moderate estimation of this v.orld 
 as renders them, at once thankful for its blessings, and 
 unensnared by its enjoyments. And the certainty of 
 that event which poisons all the pleasures of vice and 
 luxury, administers ineffable consolation to those who 
 consider the present state of things as probationary not 
 retributive. . 
 
 It is not with a view to diminish the incentives to a 
 life of virtue, but to place them on a steadfast basis, 
 that I wish to discourage the habit of teaching youth, 
 that there is an absolute connection between goodness

 and success, while their future experience must shew 
 it to be uncertain and precarious. And even granting 
 that the temporal rewards ot virtue were less arbitrary, 
 by instructing the opening mind to expect them, do 
 we not inculcate that vice of selfishness which is so 
 opposite to the Christian temper, and so subversive of 
 public spirit, on which the safety of our empire, hu- 
 manly speaking, depends ? The rising generation will 
 probably be called to the most strenuous exertions, the 
 most severe sacrifices. Let them therefore be taught 
 to look for happiness in the inward consciousness of 
 acting as they ought. Prosperity may be the portion 
 of true worth, or it may not, just as suits the grojid 
 designs of Providence, or its own spiritual advantage, 
 but the riches of a contented well regulated mind are 
 its certain portion. 
 
 It is therefore, from closely attending to the course 
 of events, as well as for a moral purpose, that I avoid 
 bringing down any immediate and extraordinary visi- 
 tations on the head of Paulina, who, but for the tra- 
 ces which her violent passions and guilty conscience 
 made on her countenance, (and which Vi^ere too deep 
 for art to disguise) long preserved the exterior of a 
 happy woman. It is true she had an accountable re- 
 pugnance to being alone, and unless immersed in a 
 variety, as well as a quick succession, of pleasures, 
 was subject to what she called low spirits ; but as stra- 
 tagem and apparent self-control, combined with an in- 
 ordinate pursuit of every ihdulgence, did not leave 
 the conscious murderess, she contrived to keep up a 
 sort of second rate respectabilit)-. Her equipage was 
 the most splendid, her house the most magnificent, her 
 parties the most crowded, her jewels the most brilli- 
 ant, and her establishment and engagements attended 
 with most eclat. 1 think no one who considers afflu- 
 ence f nd popularity as the criteria of desert, can doubt 
 her being the happiest as well as the worthiest woman 
 in England. Indeed she had an equal right to both 
 these appellations.

 which even the practised Paulina could not conceal, 
 \vh(.'n gratified revenge yielded to vain affection, that 
 the noble Earl had lost his life from a false accusation. 
 He took the earliest opportunity of following General 
 IVIonthermer to Hamburgh, and he found him labour- 
 ing under the consciousness of having basely deprived 
 a fellow creature of life, a reflection most agonizing to 
 an honest but impetuous character. His apprehen- 
 sions that the guilt of the victim of his fury had not 
 been so great as to justify him in the public opinion, 
 were changed into most insupportable anguish by Vil- 
 lars's account of Avondel's magnanimous silence as to 
 the cause of his death, and his endeavours to impress 
 on the minds of those about liim thnt iMonthermer had 
 taken no unfair advantages. Paulina's determination 
 to remain in England, and revel in the luxuries her 
 wealth commanded, rather than accompany him in his 
 exile, though he offered to fix with her in that Italy 
 for which she affected to sigh, convinced him that she 
 was reconciled to England by the circumstance of its 
 being the only land on which he could not set his foot. 
 Villars too, though unwilling to render his unhappy 
 master more miserable, was induced by his native in- 
 genuousness to confess, that he believed Paulina was 
 afflicted by the event of the duel, and that if she ever 
 loved any one, it v.as him she had sacrificed to the 
 demons of revenge and jealousy. A remembrance of 
 the unbounded love and confidence which he had wast- 
 ed on so ungrateful and unv/orthy a woman, a recol- 
 lection of the dreadful consequences his rash hand 
 had occasioned, and a conviction that he was for ever 
 banished from t'lat beloved country to whose shores he 
 had looked in all his former enterprizes and dangers 
 as the asjium of his age, sunk him into tliL- depth of 
 despair. In one moment he had done England a 
 greater injury than all the labours of his active life 
 could atone. And at whose instigation ? Uxorious 
 fondness changed into deadly hate. A profound and 
 cherished melancholv, which society could not illu- 
 mine, nor change of place alleviate, soon unsettled his 
 reason, and eluding the vigilance of Villars he fell by

 his own bnnd, stimulated, as he said, to the dreadful 
 <\iii;d by his constant attendant the vindictive shade of 
 Avondel. 
 
 Lady Paulina Montheimer received the news of the 
 general's death with the aftcctation of fortitude, and 
 after devoting something less than the usual time to 
 the loneliness and regret of widowhood, she returned 
 to the world the bride of Lord Norbury. As what 
 was called a tender friendship had been known to sub- 
 sist between these congenial souls, their marriage only 
 surprised those who thought the noble pair wished for 
 no closer tic. Eut they did not consider that Kymen has 
 oiher ministers beside chaste aiTection. Lord Norbu- 
 ry's wasted fortune required the reparation of Pauli- 
 na's patrimonial lands and ample dower, and her repu- 
 tation required to be new gilt by marriage, as the bra- 
 zen effrontery of the courtezan had become so apparent, 
 that even the meanest of the summer flies who buzzed 
 round her greatness could only hope that so agreeable 
 and hospitable a lady did not do any thing very wrong. 
 
 No omens of peace, happiness, or honour, gilded 
 these nuptials. The guilty pair were only bound to- 
 pether to enable them to spring with more elastic vi- 
 gour to their opposite pursuits. Paulina beheld her 
 fortune wasted at the gaming-table, and Norbury was 
 perplexed to determine, v.hich of the numerous viola- 
 tors of his bed he should select as the victim of his 
 revenge; or,-rather, he felt deterred from prosecuting 
 any individual by a conviction, that the laws of Eng- 
 land would not permit him to complain of injury, since 
 no man of the least delicacy would have selected a 
 woman who had forfeited all pretensions to character, 
 as the guardian of his honour. Thus they lived in 
 real wretchedness and apparent splendour: the lot 
 of many criminals, to whom inexperience looks with 
 envy, and murmurs at the humble comforts of inno- 
 cence. 
 
 Seven annual suns had passed over the magnificent 
 monument v^hich marked v^here Avondel's dust repos- 
 ed, and recorded his lineage and actions, when the 
 marchioness of Glenvorne received the following letter

 from her friend, Lady St-lina Delamore, with which I 
 shall conclude this histor}'. 
 
 " To the INIarchioness of Glenvorne. 
 
 "• It gives ine infinite satisfaction to hear, that your 
 worthy son has at length relinquished that cherished at- 
 tachment which his delicacy has long concealed. I 
 know the lady he now addresses, and I know her high 
 deserts. She possesses those recommendations which 
 m^• dear dejfctfd niece must ever have wanted. Her 
 heart has never been devoted to anotner, nor has sor- 
 row and regret weakened her health and spirits. She 
 will bestow her undivided aft'ection on her husloand, 
 and cheerfully enter with him on the duties of life as 
 his assistant and comfort. 
 
 " No excellence, however conspicuous, could have 
 withdrawn Emily's affection from the grave of her 
 lord, and had I (moved by your intreaties) urged her to 
 rev/ard Lord Glenvorne's generous affection, she would 
 huve passed her days in a painful conflict between her 
 attachment to the dead and her duty to the living, con- 
 tinuallv reproaching herself with her inability of re- 
 turning his tenderness, and making him wretched by 
 her ill-concealed efforts to seem happy. She feels it 
 to be her only consolation to devote herself in the 
 prime of womanhood to her first love. Who shall 
 controvert this oblation of fidelity ? Her heart is con- 
 secrated to what she deemed the compendium of mag- 
 nanimity and desert. Who shall dispel this innocent, 
 and perhaps commendable, because consolatory enthu- 
 siasm ? As the widow of Lord Avondel, she believes 
 herself an object of peculiar veneration and regard. 
 It is not every woman who is capable of constancy, and 
 in a disposition gentle and timid as Emily's, such in- 
 delible impressions are not common. Yet love and 
 grief, like religion, have their sincere martyrs, and 
 when sorrow neither murmurs nor allows itself to rest 
 in an indolent annunciation of positive duties, firmer 
 minds should pity and support the depression of real 
 sensibility. 'Tis useless and cruel to irritate gentle- 
 ness by reproof, or to oppress infirmity, sinking under

 the pressure of calamity, by requiring from it exertions 
 to which it is unequal. 
 
 " Our young Avondel is a lively interesting boy. — 
 He resembles his father. Ah ! that father, Lady 
 Glenvorne, who that recollects him in the zenith of his 
 renown can hope to see his equal ? Our humbler views 
 are confined to the wish of seeing his clear child re- 
 semble him in the milder features of his character. — 
 * Splendid pnrts and vast acquirements, various, rich, 
 profound,' are the lot of few, and are oftener public 
 than private blessings. 
 
 " Your account of Lady Caddy is indeed diverting, 
 I remember when she was thought unequal to the fa- 
 brication of a rebus, and she is now you say a profes- 
 sor and patroness of the most recondite branches of 
 learning. You justly observe her school of philosophy 
 was the world, and being endowed by nature with a 
 good memory and volubility of language, she has pick- 
 ed up the opinions and new decorated the remarks, of 
 others, till the neglected wit and wisdom of her ac- 
 quaintance has furnished her with a well-looking war- 
 drobe, on which the reflected light of affluence casts 
 commanding splendour. Situation has a most power- 
 ful effect on mental as well as on natural objects, and 
 what on a mountain looks like a fortress is merelv a 
 sheep-cote if placed in a valley. Yet, as Lady Caddy 
 was not always thus conspicuous, I suspect the remem- 
 brance of her early mortifications, when she attempted 
 the character of a has-blcn in less favourable circum- 
 stances, must abate the zest of her present enjoyments. 
 The inebriety which vanity occasions sometimes sub- 
 sides, and then appear those mitigations of satisfaction 
 which ridiculous pursuits are sure to create. Lady 
 Caddy goes to sleep and dreams of chaplets and tro- 
 ?Tjhies, and she awakes to stimulate the ingenuity of her 
 cook and maitre d'hotel, whom she is forced to admit 
 as adjuncts to her literary renown. 
 
 " 1 am interrupted by receiving an account of Lady 
 Norlnn-y's death. Unhappy woman ! she had leisure 
 allowed her for repentance, but this, like all the other 
 mercies of Heaven was misapplied.

 When I consider what this woman was, and what 
 ^he was designed to be, I bitterly lament the striking 
 degradation which vice brings upon the intellect, as 
 well as on the moral value, of those who submit to its 
 tyranny. If ever (though she abandoned herself from 
 her early youth to excessive self-love, inordinate vani- 
 ty, and all the turmoil of unrestrained passions) Pauli- 
 na could so well counterfeit the sublime expressions of 
 real greatness and genuine honour, how must she have 
 instructed and delighted the world, had that holy flame 
 bten really kindled in her heart which would have gi- 
 ven vital energy to her personifications ? Her life has 
 been counted happy! I pity her even in her days of 
 comparative innocence and unruffled prosperity. 
 
 " You tell me, when you first knew her at Florence 
 she was the same character. She has then always been 
 a slave to tyrannical inclinations, and ever acting in 
 contradiction to the suggestions of her own enlighten- 
 ed mind. Her correct taste in literature and science, 
 must have originally resulted from moral feelings e- 
 qually strong and pure, and those acute perceptions of 
 whatever was sublime or beautiful, great or good, 
 which accompany genius, were intended as preserva- 
 tives from evil, not lures to sin. Her habits and feel- 
 ings, therefore, were at perpetual war, and whenever 
 she commended what was really noble and generous 
 she indirectly censured the baseness and littleness of 
 her own pursuits. For even the miser is not so nar- 
 row-minded as the voluptuary. The former only aims 
 to engross wealth, but there is not a species of enjoy- 
 ment which the latter does not endeavour to obtain, or 
 w hich they do not grudge when possessed by another. 
 How salutary to such would be the wholesome exer- 
 cise of self-denial, which would teach them, that happi- 
 ness does not consist in accumulating whatever a vitia- 
 ted fancy suggested as desirable, but in retaining a 
 lively relish of the pure peaceful pleasures, which are 
 lawfully our own, and in forbearing to desire those 
 which cannot be obtained without the forfeiture of in- 
 nocence.

 the advantages of affliction. Whoever has properly 
 passed through its purifying ordeiil vvili look with can- 
 dour and pit}-, instead of envy, on those bewildered 
 beings, who have ever walkrd in those paths irom 
 whence we are assured it is most diiiicult to find the 
 road to eternal rest. It is, indeed, hard for tliose Vvho 
 enjoy prosperity, though theort-ticallyconvinced of its 
 uncertainly, to avoid practically trusting in it, and thus 
 to fail of devoting a due share of attention to a better 
 world. And the livelier our satisfaction in terrene 
 enjo) ments the more necessary it is to have it abated 
 by some occasional rebukes of sorrow. For myself, 
 I can truly say, I would not exchange the temper of 
 mind which m.y early calamities inspired to be at this 
 moment the beloved and happy wi:e of him who de- 
 served and possessed my heart. My principles and 
 m\ attachment would have prevented my becoming a 
 Paulina, but I am persuaded I should have been so in- 
 toxicated with the present, as in ht.^rt and intention to 
 have pitched my tent in an earthly paradise, and I 
 could never so far have absiracted my thoughts from 
 my goodly heritage as to consider the origin, design, 
 and end of niy being. Death, which corrodes the en- 
 joyments of the happy, has to me long worn a smihng 
 aspect. I know not how long I shall be required to 
 act and to suffer. I feel that I am in a strange land, 
 and I know I have another country to which m my es- 
 timation this world acts like a long avenue leading to 
 some niiignificent palace. My path is alternately rug- 
 ged and smooth, it goes over flowery valleys and dan- 
 gerous quagmires. I ]rass under the palm and the cy- 
 press : I am sometimes shaded by evergreens, and 
 anon the winter's v.md howls \hrough the trees stripped 
 of their leaiy honours. Bi;t there is one advantage 
 in my road, my attention is diverted from other ob- 
 jects, and fixed on the glorious turrets which will ter- 
 minate my pilgrimage.
