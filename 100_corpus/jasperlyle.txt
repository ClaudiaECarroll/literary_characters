CHAPTER I.
THE
TRAVELLERS.
KAFIRLAND!
People are beginning now-a-days to know where
Kafirland is!
Verily they have paid dearly for their knowledge!
It is a beautiful land, with its open savannahs, its
wooded glens, its heathy mountains, its green and
undulating parks—nature's plantations! Pleasant to
the eye is the sight of the colonists' sheltered farms,
surrounded by waving cornfields, and backed by noble
mountains, ascending in the distance, one above
another, assuming every hue it is possible to imagine,
and finally blending their purple heights with clouds
all radiant with gold, or shaping themselves into
canopies of sombre colouring, and veiling the glories of
heaven from the upturned gaze of man.
But from these scenes the traveller may suddenly find
himself translated to the most sterile moors, stretch-
ing out in apparently illimitable space, or bounded
by bald rocks, which offer no “shadow from the heat,”
no“refuge from the storm.” In these tracts, the earth,
resembling lava, is bare of all but stones, except where
some bright-flowering bulb has struggled with its des-
tiny, only to waste its beauty on the desert. There is
nothing living to be seen in these inhospitable regions,

JASPER LYLE:
save when the hungry travellers pause to " to kill and
eat," and lo! as the scent of blood rises in the atmo-
sphere, a solitary speck hovers in the sky, another,
and another, and, like airy demons waiting for their
prey, the asphogels, the gigantic vultures of South
Africa, keep watch over the bivouac, in anticipation of
the feast for which their instinct has prepared them.
It was in the centre of an unsightly plain that three
travellers were arrested on their journey by one of
those appalling storms which, in the loveliest spots of
Southern Africa, disenchant the mind, impressed with
the beauty of the wooded tracts, or the grandeur of
even the solitary wastes, with the sweet influence of
balmy mornings, or the nights serene and clear, some-
times shining more brilliantly than day.
All the morning symptoms in the air had warned the
attendant of our travellers, a knowing little bushman,
of an approaching storm, and he had urged his masters
to advance with all the speed they could drive into
their patient and active steeds. But the lightning
soon played in all its horrible brightness, piles of
clouds like snow began to rise in front; to the unprac-
tised ear all was silent, but the bushman called a halt,
and dismounting, led the others with their horses
behind a heap of stones.
Thus partially screened, they awaited the mighty
tempest.
The giant of the storm advanced as with a trumpet-
blast from that part of the horizon whence the light-
ning had telegraphed his approach. He came with a
rushing sound resembling the passage of an invisible
but powerful host, the desert shook with the terror of
his presence, the clouds came slowly floating on,
growing darker and darker, till their hue was of a
leaden aspect, and in a few moments, as with a roar
of many waters, the rains poured down their torrents,
the winds whistled an unearthly chorus to the plash-
ing of the floods, the great stones rocked and moaned,
the thunder pealed, now muttering in ill-subdued

wrath, and now clattering overhead in ungovernable
fury, then passing by to burst its bolts on some
far mountain top, or on fair pasture lands, where
cattle stood huddled together in terror and dismay.
There was silence at length upon the plain. “The
earth trembled and was still,” the horses lifted their
heads and snuffed up the refreshing air; the little
bushman groom, whom I shall describe by-and-by,
drew the covers from the saddles, and the two young
men, his masters, shook themselves like dogs on reach-
ing land after a long swim.
Well," said the younger, a man of slender frame,
but not the less manly in his appearance for that,
“here is a precious specimen of an African climate!”.
“Yes, my good fellow; you are able to judge of it
now,” replied his companion, Major Frankfort, whose
darkened complexion and tanned gloveless hands
proved his experience in the country, and who solaced
himself and his friend moderately with a sopie (dram),
from the flask stuck in his leather waist-belt, to which
other appendages were fixed. Neither did he forget
the shivering but smiling bushman, May. The name
is not in keeping with this very original little groom,
but he had been so named not without reason.
These two travellers, Major Frankfort and Mr.
Ormsby, were officers of an English regiment employed
on the frontier of the British possessions in South
Africa, and had obtained leave of absence for the pur-
pose of journeying together on a shooting excursion
beyond the Orange River.
The younger one had never seen any sport beyond
his father's moors, and, albeit rather indolent and
luxurious of habit, he found himself tempted to accom-
pany Frankfort into the interior of the country, where
he was told that droves of large game, of manifold
species, were to be seen herding together on the
mountain slopes and spacious plains to the north-
east.
And now the sun burst forth, the clouds rolled

away in heavy masses, the plain stretched wider and
wider in the clear expanse, and in the distance the
hills loomed large, till at length the peaks and table-
land stood out strongly defined against the sky.
The horses were well rubbed down and re-saddled,
the travellers resumed their route, and in another
hour some signs of vegetation promised comfort and
repose.
Clumps of bush adorned either side of the road, the
Largestarry jessamine, the glowing geranium, the golden-
blossomed green mimosa, emitting a delightful odour
from the bowers formed by nature's graceful hand,
were doubly agreeable to the eye that ached with
gazing on a barren space, and ere long the ripple of
water sounded musically among the trees; in another
moment a clear stream delighted the eyes of men and
beasts.
Pleasant it was in that cool drift (ford) to feel the
gentle gale fanning the heated brow, pleasant to lift
even the light felt hat from the head, and halt beneath
the over-arching boughs of willows and trees of state-
lier growth, in which the monkeys chattered, frighten-
ing the poor guanos from their hiding-places among
the stones into the sanctuary of the tall grasses and
plants, prodigal of beauty in the deep solitude.
They crossed the stream, and after threading a defile
thickly studded with euphorbias and prickly-pear
bushes, the honey-bird hovering about them and striv-
ing to beguile them to those delicious nooks where
bees make their nests, and the coneys have colonies
in the cliffs, they found themselves upon another plain,
dotted like a park with clumps of trees. Here the
bushman guide halted, and placing the open palm of
his right hand above the left, he measured the space
between the sun and the horizon, and, announcing,
that “it wanted one hour to sunset,” gave his horse
the rein, and cantering on at a smarter pace than
before, was followed by his masters.
They soon came upon the track of waggon-wheels,

next they found the remains of fire and the débris of
a meal; at a little distance lay the carcase of a poor ox,
which had died probably from exhaustion, and round
it were assembled, in greedy conclave, what appeared
to Ormsby's unpractised eye a flock of sheep.
was a company of vultures, seated in a circle round
their prey, and while some still ate, the rest, unwilling
or unable to move from the scene of the repast, kept
close order, and dosingly watched their hungry com-
rades with a ludicrously stupified air.
Unwilling to disturb these scavengers of nature,
the three horsemen moved on, and soon looked down
upon a valley, the quiet of which was relieved by a
farm-house of regular proportions; but the shingle
roof, bare white walls, and ill-tended garden had
nothing picturesque about them, although the valley
was rich in corn, and a grove of fruit-trees proved the
capabilities of the soil; but these were planted without
taste or order.
Beyond, the scene was charmingly pastoral; a clear
stream, a branch of the river they had lately forded,
wound through the vale, and from the banks opposite
the settlement was a gently-sloping hill, thickly
wooded in some parts. On the open spaces cattle
were browsing, unmindful of the call of the Hottentot
herds, too indolent to climb the steep and drive them
down. The call was unheeded till it was accompanied
by the shrill whistle of a little Kafir boy, that whistle
which acts like magic on the cattle of South Africa ;
with one accord the creatures paused, lifted up
their
heads to listen, and then the largest ox of the herd
turning to descend the hill, the rest wended their
way after him to meet these impish guards, while
other herdsmen went to collect the great flocks of
sheep and goats, whose approach along the course of
the river was continuously audible enough to charm
the most Arcadian taste and ear. The lowing of the
cattle, the bleating of the smaller but more numerous
“ creatures of the fold,” the Kafir whistle, and the

mor-
song and laughter of the Hottentot girls, floated to-
gether in a sort of wild harmony along the vale, and
met the travellers in their descent; but not the least
agreeable part of the picture to the latter, was the
sight of their waggons drawn up upon a miniature
prairie, or flat on the margin of the stream, and the
smoke, curling upwards from the bush, announced the
preparation for cookery, to which they were disposed
to do ample justice. Their tents were pitched, they
were evidently expected, and the Hottentot courier,
who had preceded them by a day, had done his bid-
ding and made ready.”
The hospitable Dutchman, the owner of the farm,
was on the look-out for them, for he stood leaning
over his wicker gate and watching their advance.
They cantered up, and replied to his “
Good
row," —-Frankfort cordially, Ormsby with cold civility;
but the Dutchman invited them within, and Frankfort,
feeling himself indebted for the permission to outspan
(unyoke) on the farm land, accepted the proffered
attention, much to Ormsby's disgust, for he was
hungry, tired, and thoroughly uncomfortable from the
effects of the drenching he had got.
So was Major Frankfort; but these two men, though
friends and companions, were very different in habits
and opinions. Indeed, Ormsby, had it been practicable,
would gladly have faced about and given up that
expedition, so utterly annoyed was he with many
désagrémens en route; indeed, he had been first induced
to accompany Frankfort, because his brother-officers
had offended his manly pride by doubting his powers
of endurance on a trek (journey) through the depopu-
lated wilderness.
“ You lazy dog, Ormsby,” his colonel had observed
to him one morning,“ how can you talk of going up
the country with Frankfort ? he will never make a
sportsman of you,--you are always late for parade.”
“I am never last, sir," replied the youngster to his
commanding officer, who happened that very day to

have kept the parade waiting; a thing commanding
officers constantly do themselves, though they punish
their subordinates for the error.
“Humph !-You know nothing of sporting--you
talk of the moors; why, Frankfort has shot his five-and-
twenty lions; besides, you would be breakfasting at his
dinner-howr, and grumbling that you have no cream
for
your coffee as muddy as the water of the Fish River.
Tell us, now, what time you got up this morning.'
“I confess, that is rather a poser, sir; but I will
ask my servant, if you particularly desire to know,"
answered Ormsby, with a demure look, which set some
of the subs laughing.
Can you tell when the sun rose?" asked Colonel J—
“No, sir," replied the saucy. Ormsby, gravely; "he
was up before I was.”
It was the manner, not the matter, that made
every
one laugh, and Ormsby, running his hand through his
shining, but carelessly-arranged hair, called to his
servant to bring him his cigar-case, and the last new
novel he had received from England, in Hookham's
box; then, stretching himself at full length across a
window-sill of the mess-room, he took up a paper,
declaring it was too hot for billiards ; next he ordered
some pale ale, with which he solaced himself while he
waited for his novel and cigar, and having obtained
these, began to long for luncheon.
In great contrast to him was his friend Major Frank-
fort. Though possessed of attractions which would
render many a man yain, Frankfort was sadly insensible
to the charms of a society in which he would have been
flattered and caressed. The principal features in his
character were generosity, and its sister attribute,
bravery ; but there was withal a certain reserve in his
nature, which prevented him from being appreciated,
except by friends, and these were not numerous; for he
was neither a person to seek, or be sought-he was
one who could not be gratified by the common-places of
every-day life. His love of adventure had its impulses,

not in the excitement of the gay world, but in the
beauties, harmonies, and sublimities of nature.
The winter season had passed away without realizing
the expectation formed by the colonists of a war with
the savage tribes on their border, and the months suc-
ceeding the rains were looked forward to by sportsmen
as a season of relief and enjoyments, after the désagré-
mens of a life “under arms, without the excitement
an enemy
in sight."
How often it happens, especially in the naval and
military professions, that two men of totally opposite
natures will become the most intimate friends of the
community to which they belong. No two characters
could be more strongly contrasted than those of Edward
Frankfort and Charles Ormsby.
Characters may
differ where natures may have attributes in common.
Frankfort was generous and brave, so was Ormsby;
but the latter was often more generous than just,
for he had never been taught the value of money or
opinion, nor how to discriminate between the faults
arising from folly, or those originating in misfortune.
Equally brave with Frankfort, he was hasty in his
judgments and impetuous in his decisions, forgetting
that fool-hardiness is no proof of courage, and that
valour is not
thought the less of for being coupled with
discretion. But, unlike Frankfort, whose candour was
never obtrusive, Ormsby's openness of manner often
degenerated into egotism.
Frankfort was careless of appearances as far as mere
fashion went; nevertheless, his attire was always suited
to the occasion. Ormsby, while he affected to despise
those outward adornings which render men effemi-
nate, and consequently despicable in the eyes of those
they most seek to please, displayed a certain affecta-
tion in the tie of the loose cravat which showed to
advantage the beauty of his throat; the straw hat he
wore in the morning lounge was coarse, but of becom-
ing shape, and his shooting-coat, or loose jacket, hung
on his shoulders as they would have hung on no other’s.
Pretending to despise the uniform of the soldier, he

“sported” a costume as little like an officer's and as
much like a settler's as possible; but to see him enter
a ball-room in all the pride of scarlet and gold, it was
clear that he thought himself the finest there. So
Colonel J said; but Ormsby was perpetually vex-
ing Colonel J.
the most selfish of men, the most
exacting of commanding officers.
This dash of conceit, however, was rather becoming
to one so handsome, so agreeable, and so open-hearted;
and Major Frankfort found himself making allowances
for the young sub's faults, and at last taking sufficient
interest in him to endeavour to correct them. Early
indulgences made this a difficult matter; but Frank-
fort saw, that though the surface was overrun with
weeds and rubbish, there was something below worth
getting at. Little rays of light gleamed up at times,
and showed that there was good ore in the mine.
Unaccustomed to bestow his regard too readily,
Frankfort might never have yielded to the outward
attractions of this fine young man, but duty brought.
them together, and Major Frankfort began to like
Ormsby against his will. Happily for the latter, the in-
fluence of sucha character as Frankfort's was not thrown
away upon him ; for his nature, as I have shown, was
capable of excellent impulses. These, like goodly fruits
brought from shade to sunlight, soon ripened into sen-
timents, which might hereafter become principles; but
the future must not be forestalled.
And all this time we have kept them at the gate of
the
poor
Dutchman's desolate-looking garden.
Major Frankfort shook hands with Vanbloem, or
rather Vanbloem shook hands with Frankfort. Ormsby
did not understand such familiarity, but he suffered it
with a better grace than he would have done had some
of his brother-officers been by, and permitting May to
lead off his horse, followed the Dutchman to the
entrance of his neglected-looking abode.
Vanbloem's wife was a mild-tempered woman, too
indolent to scold the lazy Hottentot girls sitting in
the garden, or rather yard, of the dwelling, awaiting

the return of the herdsmen, and totally regardless of
their charges, the children, who, rejoicing in the dirt,
were busily employed, under the tuition of a little
Fingo* boy, in moulding most unclassical representa-
tions of elands, rhinoceroses, sea-cows, elephants, and
various other denizens of the hunting-grounds.
The aspect of the principal apartment and only
sitting-room of the house did not strike the travellers
as inviting, and to Ormsby, the slaughtered sheep
suspended from the roof, with his head downwards,
and drippling with blood, was particularly revolting;
turning his back to it in disgust, he found himself
face to face with two enormous people, the grand-
father and grandmother of the family. He might
have doubted their being alive, but for the pipe in the
patriarch's mouth. The ancient dame sat almost
immovable, but a slight tremor in the head indicated
palsy. A teapot stood on a little table beside her,
and with her feet turned backwards round the legs of
the chair, and her arms folded under her apron, she
looked as if she had dressed herself in the round-eared
cap and ample gown of voerchitz, a coarse print,
manufactured in England, for once and for aye, never
to be changed. A felt hat crowned the white head of
the old man, and with more courtesy than the Boer
usually exhibits, he lifted it from his brow, but re-
placed it ere he shook hands with Major Frankfort, who
offered his palm at once. Two or three heads of round-
faced Dutch girls, Vanbloem's elder daughters, peeped
in from a door leading to a back room; they vanished
with a giggle, and then one, less shy than the rest,
came forward and ventured to offer the “ tea-water.”
This was declined with thanks; but unwilling to treat
the civilities of these poor people with coldness, Frank-
fort promised to say “Good night" before he and his
friend retired for the night.
They then proceeded to the outspan, and gave

orders for the preparation of their repast, while they
bathed in the stream, yet warm from the effects of the
sun.
The pools under the alders were clear and deep.
How delicious it was to cast aside the heavy coat,
saturated as it had been with wet; how refreshing to
lave the weary limbs in the crystal bath!
Then what ample justice was done to the carbonatje
(broiled mutton steaks), and the stewed buck, and
the "remove" of quail, to say nothing of the glass of
warm stuff,” when the sun went down and the cool
breeze came up the river. Verily, our travellers en-
joyed their repose on that green bank with a greater
zest than they could have done in a well-appointed
room, after a more luxurious feast in this quiet-going,
“ very comfortable" England.
It must be owned they had not a very military ap-
pearance, albeit they were “ armed and accoutred” for
*the road.” Their jackets of drab duffle, reaching to
the hip, were rendered more useful than ornamental
by the capacious pockets; their felt hats were of that
description long since adopted by the patriarchal Boers
of Southern Africa, and of late become fashionable in
England under the designation of “ Jem Crows” and
" wide-awakes ;' and the ostrich plume, wound round
these, not only shaded their brows from the fervid
sun, but attracted the flies from their faces, somewhat
blistered by the alternations of heat and wind and
rain. Their trowsers of pliable brown leather stoutly
resisted the thorns, or rather spikes, of the mimosa
bushes; their veldt scoons (shoes) were of the same
material, but stronger, and fitted the foot as easily as
a glove; and their costume was rendered complete by
the belt buckled round the waist, from which was
slung, besides the flask, a small pouch of buckskin,
containing gun-caps, a clasp-knife with numerous
blades, and various other articles necessary for the
journey,-a pair of long-barrelled pistols completing
the equipment when starting for the trek. When

riding without their waggons, they moved with a change
of linen in a small sabretache of tiger-Skin, appended
to the saddle, while in a havresac was a good store of
dried meat, hard-boiled eggs when they were to be
had, and biscuit; in short, sufficient, on a pinch, for a
good day's meal.
They rose to pay their adieux to Vanbloem and his
family. Frankfort was unarmed, but Ormsby had by
chance stuck in his belt his six-barrelled pistol, then
a great novelty in that far country. Frankfort re-
marked this on entering Vanbloem's gateway ; but his
companion explained that it was not loaded, which
was satisfactory, for the Dutch, though kindly
disposed towards English settlers, were no great
friends to the government, and, alas ! there were not
wanting men of a bad faction to turn even a trifling
action of this nature to bad account.
The glory of the sun had departed, but there was
twilight, which makes the summer day of the Cape so
much longer and pleasanter than that of the tropics.
The door of the great room at Vanbloem's stood wide
open, and the coarse, flaring, home-made candles shed
their flickering rays on a group assembled to look at
the two Englishmen. To the family party were now
added three or four Hottentot servant-girls, their
woolly locks concealed beneath bright-coloured douks
(head-kerchiefs). They had a smart air, for they were
arrayed in flaunting colours. Scarlet or yellow bodices
set off a striped or elaborately-patched petticoat, ample
in width and scanty in length, displaying ankles that
fine ladies would have coveted and feet proportionally
minute. A bevy of children, very merry, very noisy,
and very dirty, were chattering together at play, and
looking in at an open window, with the strong light
falling on their dusky forms, round which, their
blankets loosely and gracefully draped, were two
Kafir herdsmen. Their crisp hair, thicker than that
of the Hottentots, was elaborately coiffé, being stiffened
with red clay; round their well-shaped throats were

necklaces of beads intermixed with wolves' teeth, and
sundry rude ornaments adopted as charms, having
been endued with certain magic powers by the witch
doctors or rain-makers of the tribe. Their wrists were
encircled by brazen bangles, and each carried his snuff-
box, a miniature tortoise-shell, with its long ivory
spoon appended by a brazen chain.
One of them was in the act of putting a spoonful
of the mixture into his mouth, when Ormsby walked
up to him, and with great deliberation began examin-
ing him with the same curiosity that a naturalist would
have evinced on seeing some newly-discovered animal.
Both Kafirs returned his survey with a steady gaze.
In strong contrast to these sculptured and digni-
fied-looking beings, rose the noise of chattering among
the other occupants of the house and stoep. *
The
old patriarch and his wife indeed maintained their
usual taciturnity, and sat just within the door, their
chairs having been moved there by their son, for the
filial deference of the Dutch is remarkable.
At last some of the Hottentots, who had retired to
a corner of the stoep, after a due examination of the
travellers, began singing in a soprano key; the men
coming from the farm-yards and joining them in deeper
tones, all in perfect harmony, and some of the voices
exceedingly pleasing.
It was an old but popular air, one which had found
its way, like an angel's voice, across the waters, into
the wilderness. It was a hymn sung to the tune of
'Home, sweet Home !"
The sopranos were a little tremulous, to be sure,
but true to time and tune, and the bass voices gave
solemnity to the chorus.
The associations it called up were strangely con-
trasted with the scene. A rude dwelling, oddly peo-
pled, standing in the midst of a wild garden, ill tended,
but perfumed by orange-trees, waving their scented

boughs in the still air, while beyond, in dreamy profile,
rose the boundary of hills with the spacious silent land-
scape between; but the far mountains, of brown and
purple and pale blue, had faded utterly away into the
clouds of night.
Home, sweet Home!” Ormsby listened only to
the air. He was not one accustomed to give way to
those emotions of the soul which soften its impulses
and direct its thoughts to the gentlest and most hal-
lowed ties of earth; it must, indeed be confessed that
he was too much inclined to discourage such emotions
in himself, and to quiz them, as it is called, in others;
but his heart, at this distance from the beloved and
remembered faces which had shone upon him at home,
was disturbed by its reminiscences.
The air was identified with a lost sister, the pet of
his boyhood. There was a sudden vision of a long,
narrow, day nursery, with many windows looking out
upon green uplands and rich waving woods, where the
fox-hounds used to meet; of another room, within,
where old nurse Hetty used to sit and sing to his con-
sumptive little sister, who died afterwards.
As he leaned against one of the rough pillars sup-
porting a gable of the building, his thoughts wandered
back to those early days; vividly he remembered that
one on which his little favourite sister had been carried
away dead ; with what terror had he watched the dark
and high-plumed hearse, with its fearful train of black
carriages, all drawn by solemn, heavy sable horses,
waiting for the small coffin, to bear it through the
snow of the churchyard. He remembered it was mid-
winter; the ground and the trees and the hills and
the roofs of the stables were all white with snow; it
powdered the harness of the coal-black horses, and
the carriages and hearse, as they wended their dreary
way down the long avenue of leafless trees, and
through the lodge-gates and along the road, till they
were lost sight of below the slopes at the boundary of
the park.

He remembered hearing his younger brother begin
to sing the familiar tune, and nurse Hetty's dismay
because she could not silence him, and his mother, in
her white dressing-gown, looking into the nursery with
eyes streaming with tears.
That air had long been forbidden in his father's
house, and he had not heard it for years till now.
Never had he been so nearly overcome by tender recol-
lections; he mastered his emotions by a strong effort, and
bowed civilly to Mrs. Vanbloem's invitation to sit down.
The Kafirs had eyed him with some admiration,
but were more attracted by the appearance of Frank-
fort. The Hottentot girls, having finished their hymn,
came in from the stoep and manifested their unquali-
fied admiration of his wavy chestnut hair, his brilliant
eyes, and the gold chain that peeped from the folds of
his dress. One gazed first at his glossy locks, then
felt her own scanty allowance of frizzled wool ; another
cried, "good," "pretty," as she walked round him
with a mixed expression of surprise and delight, and
the youngest of all laughed aloud, exhibiting teeth
finer than his own.
The Kafirs, having followed the Hottentot servants
into the house, seated themselves on the floor at a
respectful distance. Frankfort begged Vanbloem to
translate the remarks they were evidently making on
himself and his friend. The handsome countenance
and elegant figure of Ormsby did not make so strong
an impression on them as the more powerful form of
Frankfort, who was the taller of the two by some
inches. They were, however, neither loud nor demon-
strative, but eyeing him from head to foot, they passed
their deliberate commendations in their own peculiar
“ Ma-wo!” had been the first exclamation
of the younger and more excitable Kafir, as the tall
figure of Frankfort had cast its shadow upon the wall,
against which they leaned in indolent fashion,
travellers walked up the garden-path with Vanbloem-
Ma-wo implying astonishment.

The other had taken his observations at first in
silence; but now he observed to his companion, in a
low musical voice, " Inkosi enkulu !"-"That is a
great captain."
"Eurci!” was the reply, when the other had satis-
fied himself that his friend's judgment was correct.
Frankfort saw the eyes of both the Kafirs fixed
upon him, and returned their glances with such an
expression of good-will, that they with one accord
held out two pair of hands, uttering the old imperative
demand peculiar to Kafirs, “ Baseila,”—“Gift."
All savages are beggars, more or less; but the Kafir
does not beg, he demands.
Frankfort laughed, and took some sticks of tobacco
from the vast pockets of his duffle jacket, and would
doubtless have been besieged for more, but that the
light flashing on the six-barrelled weapon in Ormsby's
belt drew the dark and gleaming eyes of the Kafirs
upon him, and their exclamations brought the rest of
the household round him in a circle.
He drew the pistol from the belt to gratify the sur-
prise and curiosity of Vanbloem, who handed it to his
father. The patriarch had the pleasure of exhibiting
it to all, and so great was the astonishment and admira-
tion displayed, that Ormsby would have offered it to
the farmer, but Frankfort checked the generous in-
tention.
The dissertation between the old man and his son
was amusing; the patriarch remarking that where
the pistol might wound six, the roer, the long gun of
the Boers, must kill all it aimed at. The old man had
a hearty contempt for all new-fashioned implements
of war, but his son resigned the brilliantly-polished
weapon with a sigh, which so touched Frankfort, that
he promised to select a single-barrelled pistol from
his collection of small-arms, and send it from the
bivouac, as an offering of good-will to the good-
natured Boer.

kindly invitation to sit down to the homely but
plentiful table with the family of four generations,
beginning with the aged grandfather, and ending, for
the present, with the grandchild of Vanbloem, junior.
They found the waggons made snug for the night,
and the cattle safely fastened to the tressel-booms-
poor things ! they were liable to molestation from
wolves, close as they were to a thriving homestead.
May threw additional billets on the fire as his
masters drew near-the other attendants were fast
asleep beneath the store-waggon, and Frankfort and
Ormsby prepared to luxuriate on the karosses spread
within their sleeping-tent, a species of pavilion, affixed
to the ponderous vehicle, their dwelling-place in rude
weather, lined throughout with baize, furnished with
well-stuffed benches, and made complete with sundry
pockets, slings, straps, and thick curtains at either
end. Ormsby was sound asleep before Frankfort had
inspected the preparations for the start at dawn.
Having seen to the arrangements for replenishing the
fire for warming the coffee, having ascertained that
the curtains were closed against the invasion of an
unexpected storm, that the arms were secure—the
horses safely picqueted, and the oxen safely reimed
(fastened with thongs of hide), he was just about to
tie the last knot of the tent-flap, when he fancied he
heard some one breathing nearer to him than any of
the sleeping groups, as Ormsby had thoughtlessly
extinguished the light within the tent, and his low
and steady breathing proved his insensibility to sight
or sound—Frankfort stooped down, and, laying his ear
to the ground, distinguished the pressure rather than
the sound of a step upon the short turf.
Without rising, he whispered from the tent, "May."
“Does the sir call ?” asked the bushman, awakened
in a moment, and rolling himself down the mound, on
which the store-waggon stood, to the tent.
“ Hush!” said Frankfort softly; “some one breathed
close by."

May put his hand to his ear, but all was still, with
the exception of an occasional sigh from an over-tired
ox or a muttered growl from one of the dogs. The
ripple of the river tinkled pleasantly some yards off,
but not a breath of wind stirred the boughs. The
night was heavy, though the stars were coming out,
and it was impossible to say what chance of discord
existed
among
the elements.
May pricked up his ears like a little terrier, and
Frankfort and he made a reconnoitring tour round
the bivouac; but nothing was to be seen. The bush-
man retired to his mat and Major Frankfort to his
tent.
The Hottentots slept sound, the huge oxen uttered
their periodical sighs, the bats flitted about the tent,
through which the moonlight began to peep, and at
intervals the whine of the wolf came up the valley
marring the silence, but too far off to disturb the
sleepers and rouse the dogs. Frankfort gave a last
glance at the Dutchman's farm. It looked exceed-
ingly picturesque by that mellow light. The whole
scene had an air of peace, little in character with the
original possessors of so lovely a soil. Ah! there
came the jackal's cry again, destroying the illusion,
and a responsive laugh followed, like mocking echoes,
from the gibbering hyena.

CHAPTER II.
THE BUSHMAN.
THE little bushman, whom we have introduced as
the attendant of our English officers, must be more
particularly described ere we advance in a story in
which he will frequently make his appearance.
The reader will consider his name--May-rather a
misnomer for such a creature.
He is about three feet and a half high; his head
would be bald, but for a few bead-like tufts of hair,
scattered vaguely about the surface. His eyes are
long, black, twinkling, and very merry, but his expres .
sion is less cunning than that of the Hottentot phy-
siognomy. His nose! where is it? His mouth is wide,
but his white teeth redeem this feature from its ugli-
ness ; his skin is of the hue of pale gingerbread.
The countenance, however, is far from unpleasing;
his voice is odd, with occasional clicks in pronunciation,
which May chooses to introduce, notwithstanding his
education. The hands and feet are exquisitely small,
and the frame lithe and agile as a monkey's. His
costume is copied from his masters; the materials are
coarser, but the “wide-awake" hath on him a more
jaunty air, the feather a more “knowing" fall, and .
this is fastened to the hat with a gilt bugle, the gift
of some light infantry officer, and much prized by
May, who had managed to coax from the same source
an old red jacket, which he carries in the waggon-box,
and wears on Sundays when they halt in the wil-
derness.
May is a capital mimic, takes off various members of
the Graham's Town garrison, well known as oddities;

imitates with ludicrous gravity the imposing air of the
governor's brother, and elicits peals of laughter from
his Hottentot comrades, when, arrayed in Fitje's yellow
petticoat, he caricatures the dancing of an affected
young lady, whom he has watched through the win-
dows of a ball-room. But I must give you May's
origin, or you will wonder how this monkey came to
see the world.
Behold a chain of mountains rising abruptly and
with a bold sweep across a most lovely wilderness.
From the colonial border these mountains look exqui-
sitely, but faintly blue, in the haze which hangs about
them. In that busy colony how faint an idea can its in-
habitants have of the wild beings that dwell amid those
distant solitary fastnesses. In the shelving rocks, in
bowery nooks scented with the rich perfume of plants,
which in our land a queen would prize in her conser-
vatory, beside the clearest running waters, the little
bushmen find their rest among the coneys, the bright-
eyed lizards, and the treacherous snakes; brilliant
birds flit round them as they lie at ease beneath
umbrageous boughs or in cool shady caves, shrouded
by luxurious creepers; from the flexile branches of the
banian-trees the monkeys peer
down
upon
what
would consider almost their fellow-apes, and on the
plains thousands of noble animals in herds are enjoy-
ing the gifts of nature, “feeding in large pastures."
An
army of elephants is moving through the bush, on
a distant mountain ; you cannot see them, but you can
hear the loud trumpet-cry of their leader giving warn-
ing of some intruder's stealthy advance. In the valley
the lions are ranged like soldiers awaiting the return
of their scouts, and beyond, far beyond, just where
the sunset reveals a spot which has lain in the shade
all day, behold the advance-guard of the stately giraffe
-two of them : the one with neck outstretched and
eye and ear keenly intent, now upon the plain, now
on the mountain-side, while his companion crops the
fresh green herbage. A cloud crosses the sun, and

the giraffes are seen no more; their momentary appear-
ance has drawn the bushmen-hunters from their haunts,
to gaze upon
the shy and cautious animals.
There go the gnoos, tossing their manes, leaping,
plunging, half in play, yet dangerous even to their
fellows; see how they wheel round, advancing with eyes
glaring through their shaggy forelocks. Å herd of
zebras are comparatively tame to these eager, restless
things; but in greater contrast to the gnoos are the
heavy eilands, fat and sleek, fit mark for the hunter's
poisoned arrows. There are ostriches, too, stalking
about; and nearer the bushmen's haunts, but wary
of
her neighbours, the pauw, or the wild turkey of South
Africa, has her brood; far up in the air, between the
clear sky and the fertile plain, rises the secretary bird,
with the doomed snake in his beak. The serpent
writhes in its new element, swinging to and fro; up!
up! above the rocks and sea, the bird swoops higher
and higher to drop its prey upon a table-rock; its
back is broken. Lie there, powerless, terrible, and
fatal, and doomed wretch, till your tormentor returns
and finishes the deed begun!
Sunset. The plain is in a glow, except where the
mountains cast a shade, and this will deepen, as the
shield of gold dips behind them. The little honey-bird,
which has been wandering in search of travellers to coax
them to the sweet nest it dare not itself invade, goes
back disappointed to await the morning splendour; the
sprews, on wings of green and yellow, go glancing past
to their embowered rest; the homely brown-looking
canaries are silent in the golden-blossomed mimosa,
the English swallow trills her way back to the mission-
house on the other side the mountain range; the few
goats possessed by the poor bushmen return bleating
to their rude fold, and ere long the wild beasts of the
forest and the valley will come boldly forth; the tiger
from the dense bush in which he has lain stealthily all
day; then the jackal's cry will startle the children lying
on their miserable sheepskins, and the lion's roar will

answer it, rousing the echoes and terrifying the
horses and cattle of those who travel in the wilderness.
Such a scene as this presented itself one glowing
evening' many years ago to the eye of a wayfarer,
whose appearance with his pack-horse and saddle-bags,
and the somewhat lame condition of the animal he
led, gave proof that he had journeyed far and fast.
With home almost in sight, he had outspanned his
waggon in the valley, and ascending the hills had
found that darkness would overshadow his path ere
the object he had in view could be accomplished, if
indeed it could be accomplished at all. A mist was
rising in white wreaths over the plain, till the vapour
became concentrated in a hazy shroud floating between
the traveller and his people below; his beasts were
weary, and would probably fall if he attempted the
descent while yet it was light; besides, as I have said,
he had an object in view; so he sat down among the
shrubs and rocks, through which he had scrambled
with some difficulty and much fatigue, and began to
ponder on what steps he must take to insure a safe
bivouac for himself and his jaded cattle during the
night.
He was a good man, and would have had no per-
sonal fear even if he had not been acquainted with
the nature of the locality and its inhabitants; but he
had no mind to have his horses torn limb from limb
by wild beasts, and pitying them as their ears moved
nervously backwards and forwards, their eyeballs start-
ing from their sockets, he regretted that he had not
delayed his expedition till the following morning.
There was no help for it now; the sinking horses
looked piteously at him, and he longed to take their
saddles from their galled backs, but he needed
to look about him ere yet there was daylight: he
regretted he had not brought his waggon-driver with
him, but always thinking of others, he had overlooked
his own necessities. He grieved for his horses, not for
himself.

James Trail was the occupant of the mission-house,
whither our English swallow had trilled her contented
way. He was a childless widower, and, bent on con-
quering his sorrow for his lost Mary by earnest atten-
tion to his duties “in that path of life in which it had
pleased God to call him," he had made
way
for
married friend at his former station, and with a few
native herds, a faithful Hottentot servant, and a
distant relative, a trader in skins, ivory, horns, &c.,
had established a little location in the lovely but
uncivilized part of the country through which he
hoped to preach glad tidings of the Gospel ; but the
untameable race of bushmen, whom he longed to
attach to himself, looked at him from their coverts like
startled apes, and yelled, and shrieked, and chattered,
and once shot at him with their poisoned arrows,
happily without effect.
A trifling circumstance brought these mountain
sprites to better terms. One of a hunting-party was
severely bitten by a puff adder while lingering behind
his comrades, and Trail had discovered him, helpless
and terrified, and “ like to die,” by the side of a stream,
to which he had crawled with the vain wish to ford it.
The good Samaritan placed his neighbour on his own
beast, after applying a remedy he always carried with
him to the deadly wound; he took him home, and
would have kept him, but the wild creature had been
a rover all his life, and longed for liberty; as soon as
he recovered, he fled to the hills to join his fellows.
At times he would return, accompanied by a mate
of his own tribe. One day he brought his children
with him ; another, two or three wild hunters, clothed
in fitting skins, sat down in front of the mission-house,
but would not draw near. They waited for their
share of beads, their meal of mutton and bread and
milk, and then scurried off to their nooks to send down
others. Wretched creatures ! these came in the dead
of night as thieves, and Trail, wearied with their depre-
dations, and grieved at his want of success among

them, made such a compact as he could, by means of
signs, assisted by his knowledge of the Dutch and
Kafir languages. On condition that they would per-
mit his flocks to feed in peace, he agreed to furnish
them with game,Indian corn,and beads. The bushmen,
knowing that if after this compact the pastor's sheep
were lessened in number, mutilated, or poisoned,
their messengers would be sent empty-handed from
his door, each kept constant watch upon his neigh-
bour, and this sort of truce had been kept between
Trail and the pigmies up to the time when the former
was making arrangements for a journey on business
into the colony.
For a week previously to leaving his house to
the trader's care with two herds only, all, however,
well provided with arms, the missionary had seen
and heard nothing of his wild neighbours, and learn-
ing from his cousin, who had occasion to follow him,
that they had not come down from the mountains
since his departure, our good minister resolved, when
on his homeward route, on penetrating the fastnesses
which he had at first visited with pious intentions,
but from which he had been driven, in such a fashion
as would have made most men hesitate ere they set
foot on such dangerous ground again : he felt it was
his duty to seek these creatures.
He would have made a fine picture, seated on a
grey rock which jutted out in an angle from the
great mountain, which from base to summit, was seven
thousand feet above the level of the ocean. The plain
lay some hundred feet below, but the haze obscured it
from the view. Trail felt very solitary between the
sky and this shroud-like vapour;
he looked at the
poor
brutes still panting beside him, and deliberated, as
he took a survey from the rock on which he was
perched.
There was not a sound now; even that restless
caller, the whip-poor-will, was quiet. On each side of
the traveller was a comparatively clear space,

was a scarp of rock overhung with trees. Securing his
horses, he relieved them of their saddles and bridles,
laid his saddle-bags against the rock, and having seen
that the animals had length of reim (thong of leather)
to give them room to roll at full length upon the
moist grass, he determined to climb higher up in search
of the little colony, whose condition he had long
deplored.
Trail was a man of about three-and-thirty; the
features were homely, but the expression of the whole
was highly benevolent; the frame was thin, and could
not be called graceful, but it was neither ungainly nor
vulgarly awkward ; the eyes were large, and when
lifted up, shone with a pleasant, not a sparkling, light;
the hair was thinning on the temples, and the brow
alone showed that by nature he was a man of a clear
and fair complexion. The rest was bronzed by climate.
There he stood alone, alone in that magnificent
solitude; the purpose for which he had come faded
for a time from his memory, a gust of wind swept
the mist away from the side of the hill to which he
turned, and a part of the valley “lay smiling before
him ;" a stream of sunlight shot athwart it, and he
saw the wild tenants of the wilderness, disporting and
luxuriating as I have described ; another gust opened
the landscape wide, and as Trail's eye swept the
scene, his heart was lifted up in admiration. He
turned the angle of the hill again, but the plain was
hidden from his sight on that side, he could see
nothing of his people and the bivouac below. He
paused under a tall yellow-wood tree, and sat down
again, his heart melting at the thought of what ? his
loneliness! His head rested on his hands, and he went
back, back to his wedding-day at home in England, in
the old church. There he stood, hand in hand with
Mary (his old playmate) at the altar: by her side his
sister cried bitterly, behind him her mother sobbed
aloud, and the father's silence was most eloquent, for
the lips were firmly closed, and the eyes blinded with

tears. Younger children gazed sorrowfully on-and
then there came the last parting. A ship in full
sail, James and Mary Trail leaning over the side of
the vessel while she is lying-to at Spithead; a boat
below, from which many last gifts are handed up. A
little sister weeping heavily, the mother with her
face buried in her handkerchief, a young brother
hastily wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, an
elder sister trying to sooth the father, who “would
not be comforted.”
They are all again before him : the boat pushes off,
the old man stretches forth his hands, blessing the
voyagers; the sister waves her handkerchief, the
brother his hat, the mother tries to rise, but cannot,
as the boat is swayed between the white-crested waves,
which soon part the little vessel from the gallant ship;
the yards are swung round, the boat has faded to a
speck, the bows dash through the sparkling waters,
churches, forts, and towers of the old town Mary Trail
has never left before, glide away from her aching
sight, and she lies down like a child to cry in her
bridegroom's sheltering arms.
And lo! there is a grave, the first grave hollowed in
the mound on which a little chapel stands between
two hills in Africa. There are others near it now, and
a deep-toned bell sends out its hallowed call across the
river, and up the kloof, and on Sabbath days there is a
gathering from many homesteads ; but Trail has left
this peopled spot for another. He visits it some-
times, and sits by Mary's grave, but he can no longer
bear it as a dwelling: nevertheless, he would have
staid there had there not been one at hand to take
charge of the district.
He had not long left this spot when I introduced
him to the reader at the early part of this chapter.
He rises, but not without effort: his steeds are quietly
enjoying the crisp herbage, and above, the baboons
are looking out from their hiding-places, and shouting
aloud Trail began to fancy his " little people" had

caught sight of him, and were calling to him from the
rocks overhanging the platform on which he stood.
He determined on seeking at once for some shel-
tered corner, where he could kindle a fire, picquet his
horses near him, and eat such provision as he had
brought, deferring his further search till dawn. The
non-appearance of a single living being puzzled him
the more when he discovered the remains of a fire,
over which the wind had passed, scattering the ashes.
It was evident that a meal of locusts had been here
cooked and eaten, probably some three or four days
before. Some had been rejected, and some were
mingled with corn lying amid the ashes. A stray
arrow or two was also to be found, and a bow, un-
strung, rested against a stone. Whilst examining
these evidences of human existence, something rose
heavily from a stunted bush : a huge asphogel, scared
at last from its lethargy, flapped its wings, rose slowly
over Trail's head, and floated down the mountain side;
another and another followed, and our missionary felt
assured that, dead or dying, some members of the bar-
barian community were not far off. He discovered a
fearful group at last. It would be a sad task to
describe the scene as it was depictured by him to one
who related the circumstances to me.
bable that some part of the community had been
absent on a hunting expedition when the fatality
occurred, which had destroyed three aged bushmen,
four or five women, old and young, all inconceivably
hideous in death, and several children. One poor
baby lay across its miserable mother's bosom, appa-
rently the victim of a snake, for the creature lay coiled
up beside the dead body, and a wretched little object
had been mangled by vultures at the entrance to the
grot or cave into which the party had apparently
crawled to suffer and die together.
Trail had heard of whole families of bushmen dying
from a surfeit of a hearty meal of locusts,- from poi-
sonous roots being mingled in their cookery with the

larvæ of ants, -and of their sometimes falling victims
to the deadly enmity of some adverse tribes; but he
saw it would be dangerous as well as useless to pene-
trate the charnel-house further; indeed he had taken
as sharp a survey of the interior as the light falling
through a chasm would allow, and he shrunk from
ascertaining whether an inner cave existed.
Struck with horror, he had made up his mind to move
some distance down the mountain in spite of the coming
darkness, when a feeble moan drew his attention to a
cleft in the rock, just at the entrance or mouth of the
cavern.
He knew it was the moan of a living being, and
began to examine the corner whence it proceeded,
but all was in darkness; stretching out his arm, he
groped among the stones, and at length touched a
clammy hand, the fingers of which closed round his
with a cold convulsive grasp. He drew the creature
forth, and found it to be a little bush-boy, probably
five or six years old.
It was our friend May. He derived his name from
the month in which he had been brought into the
Christian world, as Trail said. Truly the good man's
laying his hand
upon
the little creature was a wondrous
and providential circumstance. Poor, degraded, bar-
barous imp, thou wert a frightful object; but the good
minister looked on thee with the deep anxiety and
affection that those only feel who love their neigh-
bour in the true spirit of a Christian, and helpless and
hideous as thou wert, doubtless there were angels
singing triumphantly through the golden aisles of
heaven as a herald on bright wings came among them
with glad tidings of a soul rescued from darkness. It
was thine, poor May, lying lonely and desolate, and
apparently forgotten, in that fearful darkness; the day-
star from on high was ready to shed its light upon thee,
and there was great rejoicing among the ministering
spirits of the upper world!
We cannot trace the melancholy facts of the deaths

alluded to to their sources; nine or ten unredeemed
souls had passed the outer threshold of this world, to
that mysterious region whence none return with a
record; but whether the cause arose from accidental
poison, or by the agency of vicious neighbours, Trail
never ascertained. How the imp May had escaped
appeared a miracle ; mayhap he had been absent
gathering honey or digging for roots; the goats had
disappeared, if there had ever been any; there was
sheep wool on the bushes, but there were no sheep,
and the missionary concluded that the hunters had
probably returned after the calamity had befallen
their fellows, and, in superstitious dread of the locality,
had hurried to change their quarters without any
closer examination of the spot than they had been
induced to make from curiosity or rapacity.
Speculation was fruitless, useless; May was rescued,
and Trail, carrying him to the bushes where the horses
were picqueted, gave him such nourishment as he
could. It revived him, and as soon as he could manage
it, our traveller descended with his steed and the child
to a convenient spot, where he lit a fire at the opening
of a natural alcove. Here he again fastened his
horse to a tree, happy in having found a spot watered
by a rill, which trickled down a channel among the
rocks, and spreading his veldt combass, a large rug
made of dressed sheepskins, upon the sward, he laid
his saddle beneath his head, and not far from him he
did not disdain to place the weary and frightened being,
whose sleep was soon as peaceful as a Christian child's
within “ a fair ancestral hall."
The night passed without further adventure, for
Trail's sleep was light, and he kept up the fire at
his feet, so as to prevent the intrusion of the wild
beasts of the neighbourhood. At dawn he found
his protégé still sleeping; and by the time he had
made further but unavailing search for some living
evidence of the sad spectacle he had beheld, the mist
had cleared away from the hill-side, and he descended

with his child of the wilderness to the bivouac, where:
he found his people in some alarm and uncertainty
about his safety.
To untravelled readers the idea of leaving the dead
unburied among the rocks and caves must appear
rather unseemly, to say the least of it; but, in the
first place, Trail's party could not have accomplished
such an undertaking by themselves; and, in the next,
leaving the waggon and its contents together with
the oxen, would have been madness. Add to this, the
chances were that a horde of bushmen might return to
the spot unexpectedly, and there was clearly no alter--
native but to make the best of the early part of the
day; for, although the mission-house was only nine
miles distant, the way lay between narrow and rocky
passes, wound up the steepest acclivities, and was at
times difficult to penetrate, owing to intervening
clumps of bush, connected by a tangled growth of
underwood.
So the child was called May, in memory of the
period of his rescue. The bewildered creature's lan--
guage was utterly untranslatable; but, with the
keenness of perception so peculiar to his race, he soon
learned to express his wants in a curiously-mixed dia--
lect of Hottentot, Dutch, Kafir, and English, and this
part of his education accomplished, Mr. Trail sent
him to his friends at the larger mission station to be
trained into something like civilization by good Mrs.
Cheslyn.
And now it may be told, in a few words, how May
progressed in his education ; how he learned to sing
hymns in a truer voice than the Kafir children, whose
notes, however, far surpassed his in melody; how he
loved to dance in the moonlight with the Fingo herds,
when Mrs. Cheslyn thought they were all fast asleep in
an old school-house, till their unearthly chant brought
Mr. Cheslyn out among them ; how when the truant
was punished, he would escape, stay away for days,
and come back afterwards with ostrich eggs; how he

would sulk sometimes with his lips out, and his eyes
almost hid by the low frowning brow, run away again,
and again return; how he stood in awe of no one but
Mr. Trail ; how, if he was saucy to Ellen Cheslyn, it
was for her sake he usually returned from his wander-
ings; how he would watch her in the doorway, looking
up the road on those days when Mr. Trail was expected;
then as he caught a glimpse of horse and rider, winding
down the hill, he would ask her, in Kafir,“ Úza kan-
gala nina ? Uza lunguzela nina apa ?"
“ What are
you looking for? What are you peeping there for ?”
Then, with a low chuckle, he would spring over the
stoep, topple head over heels down the garden walk
and through the gateway, and, with distorted limbs
and visage, hasten to give his friend and benefactor the
“ Good morrow," pointing back to the house to call
attention to the watchful Ellen, and then plunging
into the thicket, laughing and singing, and as merry
as a cricket.
May's life had been comparatively free from care.
True, an outburst from the savage tribes of Kafirs, to
whom Mr. Trail had been a gentle and a kind teacher,
laid his station, Wesleyfield, even with the dust. It
was burnt to ashes, and all his little property with it,
but his wife, Ellen, escaped with her husband and
infant to a Dutch lazar, or encampment. May accom-
panied them, sometimes as nurse, sometimes as caterer,
with a knob-kierrie (club), knocking down a buck or a
bird occasionally, and cooking the same as opportunity
offered. So they passed on afterwards to the colony;
but May, lingering behind one day, looking for corn,
which he believed to be buried in what appeared to
him a deserted kraal, or hamlet of huts, was pounced
upon by the enemy, who would have despatched him
at once, but that one, more humane than the rest, list-
ened to the poor bushman's appeal, that he might be
permitted to say his prayer. After a brutal laugh from
the wretches, who boasted that “God Almighty was
dead in their land,” they consented.

JASPER LYLE:
This circumstance saved his life. As May cast
himself prostrate on the earth, a little party of roed
batjes (red jackets), commanded by a sergeant, who
happened to be reconnoitring in the neighbourhood,
and who had crept along the banks of a river, sud-
denly reared their heads above the cliffs of the Keis-
kama. There lay poor May, praying aloud, while the
savages danced round him, declaiming on the greatness
of their leader, on his bravery, his prowess. Eight
or ten Kafirs leaped and howled about the helpless
bushman, flourishing their knob-kierries, shaking their
assegais, and varying their war-cries with imitations of
the wild beasts, to which they compared their leader:
“ Behold,” said one, “he is a tiger!” and there was
a chorus, accompanied by the vicious whispering growl
of the stealthy brute : “he is terrible as a lion, keen-
eyed as an eagle, wise as the serpent.” Then the
chorus-master roared and shook his assegai, while the
rest made their spears shiver like the wings of passing
birds, and the hiss of the serpent was followed by the
wild shout of attack upon their victim.
“The roed batjes !” cried the chorus-master, and
the soldiers sprung into the midst of the enemy with
a hearty English cheer: the Kafirs gave a yell of fear
and disappointment, and May jumped up to find him-
self surrounded by men he felt to be his friends,
though they were almost as strange to him, as re-
garded their appearance, as the foes from whom he was
rescued. He gave an answering yell of triumph in
imitation of the chorus-master, as he saw the latter,
with his kaross flying in the wind, stop, mount on a
stone, and fling back an assegai, which quivered
through the air, and fell within a few inches of the
sergeant's feet, who drew it up from the ground as a
trophy.
"Well,” said the sergeant, turning May round and
round,“ you are a nice little article, ain't you, to make
such a confounded row about: and where the
did you spring from, you small chap?” “From

Westleyfield, sir,” answered the bushboy, in a very
tolerable English accent.
To be brief, he related his story, and followed the
soldiers. An old officer of the corps placed him in
the service of his family; and, on their departure for
England, May was handed over to some one else, and
from his last master had been recommended to our
travellers, Frankfort and Ormsby, as an intelligent
guide and trusty servant.
He had never rested after his rescue till he traced
out the Trails, who had terrible misgivings about him;
but they could not prevail upon him to return to
Westleyfield; their settled mode of life was by no
means so agreeable to him as the one he led with the
troops. He could seldom be coaxed from head-quar-
ters, the band acted upon him as a spell; but he grew
attached to Captain Frankfort before he became his
servant, and hung about the stable with the groom,
who was happy to find his recommendation of May
confirmed in a way that satisfied the sportsman.
The English groom remained at head-quarters while
trusty May went up the country with Frankfort and
Ormsby.
He had married in the colony, and made a bridal
tour into the Winterberg mountains with his wife-
a Christian Hottentot girl with a dash of white blood
on her father's side, of which she was justly proud !—to
introduce her to his friends the Trails, and repeated
his visit on the birth of his child, when Mr. Trail
christened the creature Ellen, after his wife. They
did not return to Westleyfield; that station was
handed over to the charge of an older missionary,
whose tall sons made almost a garrison of defence
among
themselves.
May returned to the colony with Fitje and his
child. Fitje, like himself, had been brought up among
people from whom she had imbibed habits of civiliza-
tion,-would I could say, industry! but this would be
contrary to the nature of the Hottentot, however

utter idleness and vice may be overcome by good
example: but they worked when they were penniless,
and, in spite of indolent propensities, Fitje made a
good and tender mother, and à most kind wife. She
loved gossiping in the sunshine, she could not resist
a dance to the music of the drums and fifes; but she
did not smoke a pipe, she was an excellent washer-
woman, and she was a regular attendant at the Dutch
chapel. She had a Hottentot taste for smart douks,
but she never tasted Cape brandy; and when May
fell under Captain Frankfort's care, she was so proud,
that she would not associate with her earlier ac-
quaintance. She and May had a little Kafir hut to
themselves near Frankfort's garden, and the family of
the bushman, his merry-hearted wife and good-tem-
pered baby, presented a picture as agreeable to look at,
in a moral point of view, as that of any independent
gentleman on earth.
I think we left him retiring to his mat under the
store-waggon of the sportsmen. Fitje and the child
slept beside him soundly, albeit at midnight the
moon's
rays slanted right across their swarthy faces.
Morning in Kafirland! The air is filled with deli-
cious perfume. The toman is spinning about in the
hazy atmosphere, the jackals are quietly wending
their way across the plains, looking back at times, in
brute wonderment, perhaps at that great sun; the
spider has spread her silver tissue across the pathways
to ensnare the
unwary ;

and myrtle, and laurel boughs, in which the birds are
awaking to a world lovely to them !
Ah, what exquisite things hath Nature in her bounty
spread before the heathen! They cannot be counted,
they dazzle the eye and set the heart bounding in the
plenitude of a pure, inartificial enjoyment.
The Dutchman's settlement was beginning to teem
with signs of life. The gates of the kraals were thrown
open, and sheep and goats and oxen were blending
their voices with the incessant, uneasy chorus of the
dogs, while the herds divided the multitude to lead
them to their separate pastures.
The waggons of our party were already prepared to
start; the hot coffee had been thankfully enjoyed, the
Kafirs paid in tobacco for their offering of milk in
tightly-woven baskets ; and the Boer had come down
to say “thank you,” for the pistol he had duly re-
ceived.
Frankfort imparted to the Dutchman his suspi-
cions, that some one had been prowling about the
bivouac in the early part of the night, but he said it
was unlikely; it was probably some cunning jackal,
or a herdsman's dog. Frankfort could not help think-
ing it was some human being, but Van Bloem said
no. May was already in advance of the cavalcade,
turning back now and then, with an impatient gesture
at old Piet, the chief waggon-driver, and Fitje, with her
baby on her lap, and gaily attired, is seated on the
waggon-box of the largest vehicle, en grande dame, being
the only lady of the party. Happy Fitje! no rivals——the
men of all degrees turn to thee with deference, thank-
ful for the aid of thy womanly skill, and cheered by
thy merry laugh, albeit thy mouth be none of the
smallest.

above, around, behind the mountains and through the
kloofs (ravines). May is waiting at the turn of the
winding road, half a mile off. The train of men and
waggons, horses and dogs, moves slowly on, and the
sportsmen ride gently ahead. But May keeps steadily
in advance of all, and the dogs raise a cry of joy as
they catch sight of him when he pauses at the angle of
a hill, and stands there a minute or two, whistling as
gleefully as though he were “monarch of all he sur-
veyed."

CHAPTER III.
THE
SHIPWRECK.
WE must now turn from the inland valley, with its
homestead, its cornfields, and flocks, to a very different
scene,
-a scene at sea.
On the day when our friends Frankfort and Ormsby
were introduced to my reader with the tempest warring
round them, as they stood shelterless with May upon
the open plain, a solitary ship neared the south-
eastern coast of the great continent of Africa. The
hurricane blew there with frenzied violence; the fiends
of the storm were howling aloft among the shrouds,
the canvass cracked and rattled till it split into rib-
bons, and was whirled away to the winds; the rudder
had been torn from its place, the masts groaned and
shrieked, the waters frothed up in fountains of spray,
and at intervals the heavy surges swept the decks like
clouds, enveloping the vessel, and bearing it down with
a force it could ill resist.
The sailors were hanging about the ship, but there
were few on deck, and none in the shrouds, for there
they could not keep their footing.
There were troops on board; the dull roll of the
drum made itself audible at times, when there was a
lull, and volleys of musketry mingled their signals of
distress with the screams of affrighted women and
children,-and, alas! alas !-with the oaths of terrible
men,-for it was a convict ship.
There were but momentary glimpses of the shore as
the lightning flashes rent in twain the dark masses of
vapour hanging about the gloomy rock-bound coast.
The captain could only guess where he was, for the

racter of the cliffs was his only guide now.
there was no help for them if the ship continued to
lie with her head to the shore, and he believed that a
sand-bank at the yawning mouth of a river would
engulph them, unless the hand of Providence cast
them to the westward of this, where, as he supposed,
the sands sloped from the cliffs, on the summit of
which stood a small fortified barrack, occupied by a
slender garrison of British troops, who would render
such assistance as their means permitted in saving the
lives of such as might be fortunate enough to be cast
adrift upon the coast, or be enabled to reach it by rafts,
or in the launch.
The convicts had all been freed from their shackles
in the early part of the nightmas soon, in fact, as the
desperate situation of the ship was ascertained; but
they were kept between decks till some plan of pos-
sible relief could be devised. Some sat moodily in the
corners of the ship, awaiting the day, in sullen, gloomy
despondency. Some blasphemed; some laughed in
bitterness of heart, exulting in the idea, that man's
vengeance had been set at nought by a stronger power;
-whether for good or evil, they did not consider.
Some jeered at the soldiers, who bore the jeers with
unswerving spirit; and some of the women, God help
them! jeered the loudest! One, indeed, who had
deeply considered her position, and repented, -prayed
aloud, and some drew round her to listen, but these
were few; others cursed their doom. One soldier's
wife, a young creature with an infant in her arms,
leaned against a riven mast, crying bitterly, while her
husband tried in vain to comfort her. Immovable as
images were most of those iron soldiers, except as
they answered to the voice of command ; true, even in
the jaws of death, to their country and their profession,
they heard the blasphemy and the jeers and the
ribaldry of the wretched beings they guarded, without
evincing the slightest emotion. Between the volleys

of musketry, a heavy gun occasionally boomed out its
signal of distress, but it was only echoed back from
the gaping rocks of the dangerous coast; again the
small-arms awakened no answer.
Silence,
-a voice of command from the
роор, ,
and all
hands are called to lower the launch. The ship had
struck several times against the sand, shivering, as
though terrified at being so assailed. The gangways
were guarded, and the convicts not permitted to pass.
Few, indeed, attempted it, though all had been unma-
nacled; but discipline, in hours of difficulty and danger,
is generally more than a match for strength.
The launch was lowered with a will, by those who
would have no right to enter it. It was appropriated,
of course, to the women and children, and those who
were to have the charge of it were appointed by lot.
There was no confusion; those who drew blanks
turned calmly away, and went to other duties, while
the guardians of the launch marshalled its passengers in
funeral order, and they were cautiously lowered into it.
There were two officers in command of the convict
guard; the elder was married ; his wife looked quite
a child, she was barely eighteen. Melancholy it was
to see her clinging to her husband, and begging to be
left with him on that deck, which began already to open
its seams, and show the water boiling below. She threw
herself on her knees at last, and implored him to let
her die there with him.
"Marmaduke, my love, my husband, do not send
me from you ;” and, turning to the captain, who
gently implored her, for the sake of her unborn infant,
to endeavour to save herself, she replied, in a voice
of indescribable calmness, “Sir, those whom God has
joined, let no man put asunder; I will not leave my
husband.”
Then a boy midshipman came forward, and begged
the officer to take his place in the launch, but Cap-
tain Dorian would not leave his men; and now
everything was prepared to cut away the boat from

JASPER LILE:
the ship, and Mrs. Dorian stood firmly by her hus-
band.
I have alluded to the knowledge, such as
that the captain had of the coast they had been near-
ing for so considerable a time. He was not mistaken
in his conjectures that they were within gun-range of
a part of the shore guarded by a garrison of British
soldiers.
See a signal !-the clouds have been lifted by the
merciful hand of Providence; and, though the an-
swering gun from the tower of the little fort cannot
be heard, in consequence of the wind setting in-shore,
and the elements outvying each other in noise at sea,
the flash is distinctly visible. Captain Dorian per-
suades the poor young creature that there is help
close at hand; appeals to her in the character of a
soldier, who expects his wife to assist him in setting
an example of firmness; points out to her the selfish-
ness of her wish to remain thus unmanning him in his
military duties; and, passive, stupified, at last, she
suffers him to carry her to the ship's side, and she
takes her place in the launch.
Dorian looked at her as she lifted her eyes in a wild
way to him. She stretched out her hands, as if im-
ploring him to call her back. A white-crested wave
sweeps over her, and throws her down; she tries to
rise ; she sees her husband with clasped hands praying
for her; she waves hers in reply, and Dorian is called
away on duty.
He speaks coolly and decidedly; he gives the neces-
sary orders to an old sergeant, but is stopped by the
screams of the unhappy women on the deck, who are
hoping that the launch may come back for them.
A strong rope had been affixed to the ship, and it had
been decided that this, being also connected with the
launch, should be fastened ashore by any means that
the will of Providence might offer. The
strong, but the rottenness of the ship's timbers was
proved in a sudden and appalling manner. The poor
rope was

soldiers had congregated in that part of the vessel to
which the rope had been made fast. I have already
said that the seams of the deck had opened, leaving
here and there a large space; still the captain,
officers, and crew were in hopes that she would hold
together till she was driven on the sands, and by that
time they anticipated further help by means of the
launch, the rope, and perhaps some surf-boats, if the
detachment possessed any, as was probable, from the
garrison being a depôt for stores brought thither by
coasters.
An awful crash took place; the great ship parted,
and the poor anxious watchers of the launch were
precipitated into the foaming ocean.
The miserable convicts rushed upon what remained
of the deck. They shouted, they sang, they chat-
tered, they uttered ribald jests; they climbed the
rigging, and swung aloft. It gave way under their
feet. Some seemed to revel in the freedom of the
unchained air; they clustered along the yards like
bees. Now the ship’s bows are drawn into the surge;
now the shattered poop sinks beneath the waves ;
now the sea overwhelms the decks, sweeping living
and inanimate things in its vortex; and now, oh God!
the great beams gape and yawn and part asunder,
and see the wretches are jammed in between; a mast
is shivered, a block falls, and strikes an old man
down; his eyes burst from their sockets, his head is
bruised and battered, his limbs quiver, and his fingers
are convulsed. The deck opens again; the bounding
sea bursts up, and draws into its relentless jaws more
than one victim !
The ship was fairly breaking up. Some rushed to
the forecastle, some looked despairingly from the poop.
Between the fore and after part there was soon an
impassable gulf.
At the scream, which drew the attention of Dorian
and his sergeant from the arrangements they were
making, the former rushed to the poop. He saw the

JASPER LYLE :
brave fellows who had been swept off struggling in the
waters, trying to regain the shattered vessel. They
perished every one of them! At any other time he
would have been stunned by the sight, but his eyes
are strained beyond it; fixed in an aching gaze upon
the launch, he can distinguish no one in her now;
her passengers seem all huddled together: he turns
round on hearing the mast crashing over the ship's
side ; he is shocked at the sight of the mutilated old
man. Again he turns; his eyes seek the rocks, above
which he has seen the flash of the signal-gun; he
fancies he hears the echoes rolling along the cliffs ; he
distinguishes another momentary light; the launch
is hidden between two watery mountains, but she
rises; he would give worlds to use a spy-glass, but
it is impossible, but he needs it not; he sees the
launch again with terrible distinctness. She has
turned over, she goes down! He sees no more; many
of his gallant soldiers have perished in the boiling
element beneath him, and he springs forward in his
despair to join his fair and child-like wife.
They were found afterwards cast ashore, strange to
say, not far from each other; and the captain of the
detachment, as commandant of the fortress, read the
funeral service over them with a faltering voice; they
sleep together in a grove of oaks. The spot was chosen
because the trees that flourished there reminded
passers-by of England.
Signals were now distinctly heard from the heights,
and soldiers were gathered on the cliffs watching the
ill-starred convict-ship. Oh, to see the arms of the
maddened wretches stretched towards the shore !
Some, like Captain Dorian, cast themselves in a frenzy
upon
the angry waters; some strive to lash themselves
to spars; another boat is lowered, with provisions
hastily thrown into it; three or four bold spirits tempt
the surges in the fragile bark, and it is swept towards
the river's mouth, is whirled round in the sparkling
eddies, and disappears.

It is of one of these “bold spirits I have to speak.
I have said that the convicts were relieved from
their fetters as soon as the vessel became unman-
ageable.
Sternly awaiting his fate in a dark corner of the
labouring and bursting ship, sat a man of some eight-
and-twenty years of age; his arms were clasped round
a gun, and thus he steadied himself as well as he
could.
Strangely indifferent he seemed to the howling of
the winds, the rattling of the cordage, the falling of
spars, the crash of timbers, and the imprecations of his
fellow-convicts amid the scream of frightened women.
At times he sneered at the frantic gestures of a soldier's
wife, who was sitting on the deck, with a baby on
her lap, rocking herself to and fro and bemoaning her
hard fate, and that of her family, most bitterly, at the
same time directing her husband and children in
certain preparations for leaving the ship, if they should
be so fortunate as to succeed in doing so. Her advice
and admonitions were interlarded with various
expres-
sions of terror, sorrow, affection, and anxiety.
“Oh, Micky O'Toole! Och, wirasthrue, my darlint;
sure when we played at the same door-step as childer,
I didn't think we'd come to this. Och, Larry, my
child, the mother that owns you is breakin' her heart.
Alice, say your prayers, fast--say them fast, allannan ;
true for ye, my darlints, this day we'll be in glory;
pray up, Ally, pray up, Larry, the saints be wid us.
Micky O'Toole, what did you do wid the little bundle
of cloth I put up to go ashore wid? Oh, the vanity of
me ; sure didn't the priest tell me I'd be punished for
setting myself up wid a sunshade (parasol), when you
were made a corpular. Ochon a rhee, my heart is
broke!
They'll be missing us at the harvest, Micky;
they'll be dancing widout us, and we drowned
drowned. Oh, Micky!” A wailing cry from the baby
made its mother weep more bitterly, but still she

occasionally recalled her scattered wits to console
her children.
Not far from Lee, the convict, was stretched, in a
listless attitude, a young man, who seemed little more
than twenty years of age. He also was one of the
condemned; but no one could have recognized him
as a criminal by his appearance, which was exceed-
ingly prepossessing. His thoughts were apparently
wandering; for though his countenance expressed
awe, there was resignation also. He was looking for
a better life than the career mapped out before him as
a felon. In the great crisis taking place, there was
hope for him somewhere. The wretched welcome any
change. He awaited it passively.
But his heart was touched at sight of a penitent
creature, who bewailed her past errors in an agony of
self-reproach, as she uttered the names of father,
mother, brothers, and sisters ; at times exclaiming,
“Oh Jamie, Jamie, ye'll be sorry when ye hear of
poor Jessie's end.” Mother, mother!” was the last
appeal of the unhappy young woman, as she was
washed away by the booming waves through a gap in
the wreck.
But Lee saw not this; he was smiling at the scene
between Mrs. O'Toole and her family.
Ere long he had unlashed the boat, assisted in
throwing in provisions, and, casting himself into the
frail vessel with two other comrades, committed him-
self to what he called chance.
At length the muskets ceased their roll, the drum
its sullen round. The ship had struggled bravely;
the fore and after parts sometimes jamming each
other, and then parting. Both were now engulphed.
The death-cry rose above the roar of the foam, and the
noise of falling spars and blocks; and sea-chests, ship
furniture, all that had been carefully gathered toge-
ther by the hand of man, were cast into the ocean.
Now a man, lifted on the crest of a wave, saw his
wife, and struggled to reach her; but she was swept.

past him with her eyes glaring madly. Now a woman,
with features all convulsed, snatched up some passing
child, and cast it from her when she found it was not
her own.
Now the prow neared the shore, and
a young officer sprang from the bowsprit into the sea;
dizzy with the leap, he closed his eyes
and opened
them-oh, blessed hour !in a tent pitched on the
cliff for the reception of those cast on the strand.
The detachment of English soldiers had assembled
on the cliff at the first signal of distress fired from
the convict-ship. They had waited there from mid-
night until dawn, knowing by the nearer sound of the
guns and small-arms that she must be driving towards
the shore; but they could give no aid; they could only
abide the issue patiently, and meanwhile make such
preparations as might possibly be useful.
The barrack they occupied was situated on the
western bank of a river, the entrance to which, in the
present agitated state of the open ocean, formed almost
a Maelstrom. As day dawned, and the convict-ship
was seen driven in-shore, it was evident to the lookers-
on that she must go to pieces; for fringing the
shore was a narrow line of sharp and jagged rock,
and at the very edge of this the ship's bows were
already beating. Still it was doubtful on which side
of the river she might be cast ashore, or whether,
indeed, she might pass the whirlpool foaming at its
mouth; for the ledge or shelf, over which the breakers
burst with increased violence every hour, extended
across the opening, and made a bar, which rendered it
unnavigable. On either side of the stream the sands
stretched for miles, and the ocean washed the shore
with a hoarse and endless roar; but not with such
destructive powers as it did above or below the river's
mouth. On the western side, especially, there was
more chance for the poor creatures struggling for
their lives, inasmuch as the sands beneath the cliffs
were not of that shifting nature which rendered
anchorage impossible on the eastern limits; besides

which, whoever escaped drowning, by being flung upon
the eastern bank, stood a chance of having his brains
dashed out by detached masses of rock that had rolled
from the cliffs, and were embedded in the shore.
Near the mouth of the stream, indeed, many an in-
cautious rider, on his way from Kafirland, had been
well-nigh overwhelmed by the quicksands.
Fortunately for those who had outlived the storm
so far, the tide drew the two divisions of the wreck,
partially submerged as they were, on the safer bank
of the stream; the colonial side, in fact, of a river
dividing the territory of the British settlers from the
“ neutral ground” of the savage inhabitants of the
north-east. It was found afterwards that the two por-
tions of the ill-fated ship had been connected by means
of various spars and cordage interlaced beneath the
waters; but she had not been many minutes fairly
among the breakers ere she literally crumbled to
pieces, and scattered her timbers on the waters.
Out of three hundred souls, not more than eighty
were saved. Some swam till their strength was ex-
hausted, some gave themselves up to their fate like
the young soldier, who spread out this arms, closed
his eyes, and plunged from the poop to the sea; some
clung to spars, boxes, tables, hencoops, anything that
came in their way.
All who reached the shore re-
ceived the hospitable care of the kind soldiers of the
fort, and afterwards pursued their different routes and
destinies as Providence directed, after preserving them
for the fulfilment of its own wise and grand purposes.
The boat which had been disengaged almost unper-
ceived by Lee, and the two other convicts, continued
to buffet the waves most gallantly. It reached the
entrance of the river-here the rowers used their
strong arms for a time in vain, and there seemed no
other prospect than that of being engulphed, when
suddenly the boat rose, as if lifted in air, over the
bar of rocks I have described, and, shot into the
stream, was sucked into a kind of whirlpool, where

it spun round like a top, filled and went down for a
few minutes, but came back to the surface empty.
Lee was drawn down with his fellows; his
eyes
and
ears filled, and his senses failed him : he had an indis-
tinct vision of the convulsed features of the other two
struggling below him, and of a gurgling sound from
one who tried to scream ; but all afterwards was blank
till he came to his recollection stretched on a bed of
sand, which ran inland from a creek overhung with
bush.
It was a considerable time before he could bring
himself to understand the reality of his position; but
at length he rallied his intellect, and sat up to look
around him.
The storm still raged---not a vestige of the wreck
was to be seen, and the boat, broken in pieces, was
lying high and dry between the rocks, with which the
bush was intersected; the body of one poor drowned
wretch was floating, all swollen and disfigured, in the
creek. Jasper Lee rose by a sudden impulse, and
scrambled as far from the sight as his cramped and
aching limbs would allow him; the stunted bush or
scrub, by which he tried to climb the cliffs, gave way
in his hands, his feet slipped on the streaming and
slippery weeds; but he reached a ledge at last, and
taking“ heart of grace,” he scanned the prospect
before him.
Evening was advancing, though as to when the
sun was likely to withdraw his influence from that
hemisphere, it was impossible to say. Sky and ocean
were blended together in a hue of lead, and the glanc-
ing wings of sea-birds looked like gleams of silver
light between the angry heavens and the warring sea.
His eye fell only on the void expanse. He had cast
himself down on an angle of the cliffs which jutted
far out, and during a momentary lull, the wind brought
the sound of drums from the garrison on the opposite
shore. He looked down immediately below, he per-
ceived some rotten pieces of timber floating by; he

expected to see some human creature still living, for
many had lashed themselves to spars and masts, and
might yet be tossing about at the mercy of the waves.
He stretched himself as far forward as he could, and
looking to the westward, where the light of day was
lingering longer than elsewhere, he distinctly saw
groups of soldiers, engaged in assisting those who
had been cast ashore below the fort.
He fancied he heard voices, he looked down. Im-
mediately under his feet there were, as it seemed,
phantoms floating by; some dead, some with agonized
faces and beseeching hands lifted out of the white
foam, and one saw him—she was young and fair, with
long tresses, all unbound, clinging round her white
throat and bosom; she seemed to give a gasp of hope;
he leaned over; hardened man as he was, he would
have given much to have saved her; the swell brought
her nearer, she saw him ; still she herself tried with
desperate energy to catch a ridge of rocks,-she reached
it, the heavy waters swung her forward with terrific
violence, the sweet face was lifted up again. Lee was
about to cast himself at all hazards from his position,
when a stream of blood darkened the white spray,
and the head of a shark came up, its huge jaws
were filled with the mangled and bleeding limbs
of its victim, and the horrible sea-monster drew its
prey into an inlet where it had been driven by the
storm.
He buried his face in his hands, turned sick, and
almost fainted; after this he looked no more towards
the sea, and ere long found himself obliged, for safety's
sake, to reconnoitre the locality in which he had awoke
to consciousness after so narrow an escape.
His condition was forlorn enough; his clothes hung
in shreds upon him, his hair was matted with brine,
his body was sorely bruised, his hands and feet
lacerated; but it must be confessed, that, in spite of
the horrors he had witnessed, his spirits rose fresh and
buoyant, as he remembered that he was at liberty ;

49
though houseless, naked, cold, hungry, and bleeding,
it was not in his nature to despair.
He turned his eyes again to the westward, and on
climbing higher, he discovered the wall of the fort,
with its tower in the angle and its looped parapet.
Soldiers were still straggling up and down the Cliff,
intent, as they had been for hours, on their humane
efforts in saving life, and the remnant of property
which had been thrown ashore with the tide.
“ Ha!” muttered the convict, “I am on the right
side of the river; they've had their glasses out at the
fort, no doubt; but they cannot pass this, frothing
as it does at the mouth, like a wild beast, for a
week to come. Well, some will fancy themselves in
luck when they get within those four tall walls, and
some may have their chains dangling about their
heels again; but this way of escaping
death is not to
my taste. I have work before me, I know; but what
would life be without any difficulties! What a stupid
life would Adam and Eve have led without sin ! "A
true woman, Eve; disobedience.gave the flavour to the
fruit! Well, I have no objection to difficulties, and
although I don't abide by the trash that gives chapter
and verse about first causes, I know I have not been
planted on this continent again for nothing. It must
be owned, though, that I have had a precious welcome;":
and, wiping the blood from his temple, he sat down
again, for he was somewhat exhausted in body, though
untiring in spirit.
The clouds fell lower and lower, and shed no more
reflected light; a pitchy darkness followed. Lee
gathered himself up between the bush and the
wet and slippery bank, and lay down to dream of a
surging sea, of pale beseeching faces and mangled
bodies of young and beautiful women. The tide was
again rising, and he dared not descend, so he deter-
mined on waiting till the dawn, and then commencing
a search for the provisions which had been put into
the boat, and which he hoped he might find attached

to some fragment of her wreck, for they had been
securely lashed to one of the seats.
Towards midnight, as the tide receded, the fury of
the tempest seemed to abate, and just as day peeped
with affrighted eye from the east, our convict ven-
tured from the shelf on which he had been uneasily
stretched during the hours of darkness.
A dense fog hung over the river; the wind came in
gusts from the ocean, and some of the trees above
the cliffs were torn up by the roots and cast midway
among the stones and scrub. The solitude was per-
fect to a man in Lee's position, and the tide having
left a spacious strand, he let himself down from his
covert, and began to make a search for the necessaries
of life.
The wreck of the boat was lying where he had seen
it the preceding evening, and, after a patient search,
the hungry man discovered the bundle of provisions.
It was saturated with wet, the rain fell around in
torrents, there was not a spot of ground on which real
repose could be sought; but Lee sat down and satis-
fied his wants with a relish indescribably keen.
Let us take a view of him, resting on the dreary
strand, having refreshed himself with a moderate meal
of biscuit and salt pork, the latter, of course, uncooked,
but to him most savoury.
In the prime of life, highly favoured in personal
appearance, with the spirit of intelligence lighting
his clear grey eye, and with the stamp of the better
class upon his frame and countenance, how came he
there—a convict ?
At this moment he was intent chiefly on one point:
he was determined to avoid all chance of further cap-
tivity or restraint.
As the fog was lifted from the river by the evening
breeze, he felt the necessity of keeping out of sight of
any stragglers about the opposite heights. He in-
spected the bulky package of provisions : a bag of
damaged biscuits, some lumps of salt pork, a case

of dried fruit-cabin property—a canister of cocoa,
and various other articles, which had been hastily
thrown into a bundle, and now adhered together like
glue.
These stores were exceedingly precious to one in
our adventurer's condition.
But the clouds began to gather again; floods of
rain poured their torrents down the channels in the
cliffs, and he determined without delay, and unmindful
of his fatigue, which he felt the more after his meal,
to seek a hiding-place which would be secure from
intruders, although there appeared little chance of any
one intruding on his territory.
All along that river-side deep indentations had been
made below the cliffs by the encroachments of the sea,
and Lee was not long in discovering a cave which
penetrated far under them. There was not much
time to lose in conveying the provisions to this covert
ere the path was rendered soft, and therefore danger-
ous, by the swell of the tide as it turned again, and
Lee was beginning to doubt the safety of the shelter,
when, on drawing his bag of provisions to seek stowage
for it at the furthest limits of the recess, he discovered
that the chasm was deep and wide, and lighted
slantwise by an aperture many feet above the level
of the river. His thirst had been heretofore allayed by
the channel of rain-water rippling down the face of the
cliffs, and he was beginning to doubt how he should
be supplied in his retreat if compelled to remain there
any time after such supplies should cease; when, to his
satisfaction, he convinced himself that a little stream,
which trickled into the cave through a crevice, had its
source in one of those bountiful and sweet springs so
often discovered near the sea-shore, and which, in spite
of their brackish taste, are so exquisitely refreshing
to the exhausted traveller.
This was just one of those pieces of luck which
often seem to rise in aid of the vicious,—but we may
not question the decrees of Providence. God has his
E 2

JASPER LYLE:
own reasons for letting the tares thrive for a time,
though the harvest of wheat be thin.
On the whole, Lee had reason to rejoice in having
discovered such a retreat for the present. He had
sufficient stores to support life for some days; he was
free, after his own ideas of freedom; space before
him, above, around, with nothing to guide him but his
own free will; he thought not of check or hazard, for
no man held authority over him.
Misty, vague, dark, dreary, was his future; but it
was not so utterly lost in the darkness as it would
have been to a stranger on that great continent of
Africa.
Contented at first with the comparative shelter he
had so opportunely discovered, he had seated himself
on a stone, and surveyed the interior of his domicile;
but the various plans which floated about his busy
brain wanted gathering together and arranging, and
he found himself ere long overshadowed by the gloom
of night. Though his wits were sharp, his body
was weary, and growing stiff with cold." The river
murmured hoarsely past the cave; the wind came in
gusts through the crevices of the rocks, and pene-
trated to the very marrow of his bones. The outline
of the opposite bluff looked like the frowning profile
of a giant, when at intervals the clouds were parted
by the broad flashes of lightning; for the storm at
times still wreaked its fury against the rugged coast.
Having collected the damp leaves of fallen trees
together in a heap, the convict made a very tolerable
bed, throwing over them a long strip of green baize,
the table-cover of the cuddy, which had been appro-
priated as a wrapper to the provisions.
The wind still kept up its “sound of mournful
wailing," and whistled through the gaps in the cave;
the spray foamed within fifty yards of the entrance;
the thunder came back at times with a mutter full of
wrath, and his clothes were still wet; but our convict
was lulled to sleep by the roaring of the mighty ele-

ments, which held their strife around his place of
refuge.
Now and then he started up, as livid faces rose
before him in his sleep; and at last the excessive
cold roused him, and he was thoroughly awakened.
Darkness was around him, and the stream, flowing
down channel, dripped over on to the stones, and
plashed upon his almost benumbed feet. He crawled
towards the aperture ; there was a little light, just
enough to watch the tide, till, by its retrograde move-
ment, he was able to make a random guess at the
“ time o'night," or rather morning. Shivering and
melancholy, he crouched, with his head upon his
knees, and, as his eye got accustomed to the outer
atmosphere, he began to see stars. A body of
clouds floated seawards, the wind veered about, and
he again perambulated the shore in search of some-
thing for fuel. Day advanced, and he stumbled over
a few cask-hoops; they were soaked with wet; but
with the help of a remnant of a well-pitched spar
from the wrecked boat, he determined on trying to
kindle a fire. Flints were searched for, and again
Providence provided for his present wants.
He re-entered the recess; but, on consideration,
deemed it prudent to take some further steps for
insuring his concealment.
The rocks had been so washed, while the tide was up,
by the spray of the surging river, that some of those
which hung over the cave were loosened. It was a
matter of skill and difficulty to separate even the
smaller ones from the earth in which they had been
imbedded; but Lee was a man of great personal
strength, and, one block giving way, it bore down
with it a heap of sand and a tree, which had been
uprooted, thus underinining all that immediately sur-
rounded it. The whole mass fell in front of the
cavern.
There was not much time to lose, as the daylight
might betray the refugee; so making a passage for

himself through the stones and rubbish forming his
barrier of defence, he re-entered his hiding-place, and
set to work to light a fire.
This was not easy; at one moment a stick would
catch the flame, blaze up, and disappoint him by
dying so gradually away as to keep him hoping to the
last; at length the pitch grew hot. He had uttered
oaths enough to bring the spirits of fire to his aid.
The smoke rose in little columns, and made his eyes
smart with pain; but he persevered till the light
danced upon the steaming and jagged walls, showing
him his shadow, monstrous and undefined. The
vapour found vent in the aperture opening to seaward,
through which the spray had ceased to drift; and ere
long some slices of ship’s pork hissed on the glowing
billets. A soldier's tin served as a kettle and drink-
ing-cup, and Lee contrived to make something like
a cup of cocoa. After such refreshment his blood
flowed more freely in his veins, and he once more lay
down to rest, intending to keep his wits about him
though sleeping, and to replenish his fire, with a
cautious observance of the outer atmosphere from
time to time; for, although a turbid and swollen river
intervened between him and the colonial side of the
country, he had no mind to be tracked, by the smoke
of his bivouac, by any wanderers, whether Europeans
or natives.
He felt, indeed, tolerably secure; rightly judging
that the Europeans on the western bank would have
enough to do on their own ground, and that the few
whom he knew to be scattered to the north-eastward
would be as unlikely as the natives to hear of the
wreck while the heavy rains filled the rivers to over-
flowing and rendered the ground dangerous and toil-
some alike to riders and pedestrians. If Kafirs did
venture out on foot, he knew enough of them to
satisfy himself that their journeys would be under-
taken to some better purpose than loitering on the
coast without sure prospects of plunder.

He again lay down, and enjoyed that species of
repose which gives ease to the body without com-
pletely deadening the powers of the mind; and it
must be owned that his conscience was by no means
so harassed by trouble or remorse, as from his out-
ward position one would think it must be. In his
own estimation Lee was an ill-used, unfortunate man;
and, as to the latter, truth to tell, his reasons for
thinking so were not altogether fallacious.
He is a felon; but the circumstances which have
brought him to his present condition have met with
extenuation from some: of this, by-and-by.
Hush! the earth is loosened without; Lee hears it
falling about the entrance. Some small stones come
clattering down, and then there is silence.
The strong man's heart beats, and he clutches the
clasp-knife hanging round his neck, and tries to open
it, but his hand trembles; a strong current of air
rushes in, the fire flickers up, and the shadow of a
man's face is for an instant traced on the rocky side
of the cave.
It is suddenly withdrawn.
Lee revolved the circumstances of his case in a few
seconds. He felt sure it was a white man's shadow,
even at that momentary glance; the outline of the
loose cap and prominent nose was unmistakeable.
It might be a friend—a fellow convict-a sailor; if
the latter, Jack would die rather than betray the
fugitive. But if it were any who might, after all,
turn informer, he would doubtless report that the
cave was tenanted, and bring down a file of soldiers
upon him, unless the clasp-knife settled the question,
which it was not likely to do in its rusty condition.
Lee's powers of body were a little impaired by the
perils he had undergone, and the exertions he had
been obliged to make in screening his hiding-place, as
he hoped, from all observers.
But he was discovered, that was certain.
“Who comes there ?” he cried, in a voice that shook

more than he wished to confess to himself. · Enter,
I am armed.”
“Lee,” hoarsely whispered a voice, issuing from
lips within which the teeth chattered audibly, -"It is
I, Martin Gray."
6 And where the did
from?"
asked Lee, in no very gracious voice, and sitting up
with
open.
"I am starved, and miserable, and hungry," was
Gray's reply, as he scrambled through all impediments
in his path, and crawling into the cave, began un-
ceremoniously to draw together the embers of the
fire.
“Are there any more of you ?” inquired Lee,
hastily.
“ Not I have been skewered
ир
in a hole ever
since I was flung ashore. I got hitched on to the rudder
of the boat when it broke away, and except a few bumps,
I was all right when I got driven in between the
rocks, and there I have been wedged for hours, for I
dared not stir, except in the dark, when I could
find nothing. I had no mind to be caught by the
soldiers up there on the hill, so I have been creeping
along under the rocks looking for luck in some shape
or another, and what should I see, but a glimpse of
light from this quarter ? Friend or foe, it was all the
same to me; I resolved to take my chance, and here
I am.”
Martin Gray was the young man I have alluded to
as lying passively on the deck of the staggering ship
-he had, like others, sprung into the sea, to take his
chance, and clinging to a spar, had been providentially
washed ashore.
Lee had had much opportunity of judging of Gray's
character, which, though not without good, wanted
strength and resolution; he was less wicked than un-
fortunate. There was this difference between the two:
Lee would most probably, under any circumstances,
have been ambitious, selfish, and unsound in principle,

while Gray, with better fortunes, would have made a
respectable member of society : warm of temperament,
he was docile of disposition; he was, in fact, the very
person to be influenced by a strong and determined
mind, under circumstances like those in which he was
now cast.
In Lee's forlorn condition, he felt there was com-
fort in fellowship, with
66 safe a fellow as poor
Gray," and he therefore set about proffering hospi-
tality to his guest with a good grace, especially con-
sidering the limited extent of his larder. The meat
again hissed upon the coals, the batch of damp biscuits
was re-toasted, and Gray brewed another

-what a treat it was !
If you have been shipwrecked, reader, as I have
been, you will understand this.
Gray having dried his torn clothes, and satisfied the
inward cravings of nature, not without warnings from
Lee on the dangers of indigestion from too hurried a
meal after a long fast, which warnings were entirely
self-interested, recommended that the fire should be
extinguished, lest its smoke should betray their hiding-
place at sunrise; “though, to tell the truth," the young
man added, “I am much more inclined to surrender
myself, than to take my chance ; for what is to become
of us?"
“Surrender!” cried Lee; "what, with such a country
before us as I know this to be ? No, no, my lad, you'll
not surrender ; trust to me, there is nothing to lose
by taking our freedom, and what prospects are there
before us, if we give ourselves up ? You, for one,
would be packed off to New South Wales by the first
opportunity. As for me-I have said it before--I had
rather fall into the hands of God than those of man :
here is space enough for even my free spirit, and with
a little caution, and patience, and perseverance, I will
take you into safe quarters for life?”

sion, and the two convicts stretching themselves side

by side, the former was soon dead asleep, while Lee
lay meditating an infinite variety of plans.
“This youth is safe," soliloquized the host of the
cave;" he must be taught to keep my counsel and his
own, for although hereafter he may be rather an
incumbrance to me than of use, it will not do to let
him go,-he would betray me, to a certainty. He has
roughed it and seen service; though he is not clever,
he has lots of pluck; on the whole, perhaps, I may
make him useful, and it would be deuced lonely work
to find my way across the country without any help.
We must look about for arms; I saw large pieces of
the wreck drifting this way after the crazy old craft
went to pieces.
“I wish I had not seen that girl, though. I cannot
forget her ; how the blood bubbled up with the foam!
“ The wind has changed, I suspect, but the river
will be impassable to those red-jackets for days to
come ; we must collect our traps together without
loss of time, and make ready for a start; I must do
the amiable to this lad; he is a soft-hearted youth,
I know. * * *
That fellow Tanner, I wonder if he
is still trafficking up there in the kloof; he is an
infernal rogue; I hope he won't turn informer-I
think not, though, for I could betray him, and he
knows it."
He rapidly chalked out in his mind's eye a map of
his plans, and as he heard the wind again veering
about to all points of the compass, and at last return
to its deadly quarter, from which it had breathed
its fury on the hapless ship, he rubbed his hands
cheerfully together. “Blow, gentle gales," said he,
and as Gray answered the apostrophe with a loud
snore, Lee laughed and lay down, taking care to
appropriate to himself a goodly portion of the green
baize coverlet. Ere long he, too, was in a dreamless
sleep.

CHAPTER IV.
THE
DESERTER.
It is time to give our reader some further insight
into the circumstances which had brought these two
sleepers to their present condition, for they will
occupy a prominent and peculiar part in the narrative.
Although Gray is the last adventurer on the scene,
I will give him the precedence, since all that is neces-
sary to relate concerning his previous history may be
comprised in the following sketch.
He was the foremost boy of the village school of
M-, industrious, high-spirited, and well-looking ;
he made slow but steady progress in his education,
and his pastor entertained fair hopes touching his
future prospects ; but these hopes were suddenly over-
clouded by Gray's enlisting into a company of artillery
quartered at a neighbouring town.
Thus it fell out. Let us go back to his earliest
days, when he had been accustomed to stop at his
uncle's garden-gate to call for his cousin Katy on his
way to school. She would come with her school-bag
hanging on her arm and singing down the walk as
merry as a bird, and hand in hand they would wend
their way along the lane to the school-house, where
they parted at the porch with a tender but most
innocent farewell, she for the girls' class, he for the
boys'. On Sundays they stood side by side round the
pulpit to recite their catechism-often, however,
threatened with a separation, because Martin Gray
would prompt Katy.
evenings in the summer prime they sat
beneath the apple-trees in the garden belonging to
On Sund

JASPER LYLE:
Martin's bereaved father, and on winter nights it was
cheering to see the light glowing on the walls and
shining through the cottage casements; for there were
the three assembled round the fire, Martin reading to
earnest auditors.
A sorrowful evening hour it was for Katy, when
her cousin parted with her at her own door. Love,
and joy, and peace, all departed with him, and she ex-
changed happiness for the misery of finding her father
and mother quarrelling after their return from the
alehouse. Morning would chase away the sad thoughts
the darkness had brought. Morning brought healing
on its wings, for then Katy and Martin were again
hand in hand, singing through the lanes, and gather-
ing primroses or crocuses on their way to the school-
house.
Then Katy “got a place;" her mother thought it a
very fine thing indeed, to have her daughter admitted
as under-housemaid at the Hall. Katy and her cousin
met at church on alternate Sundays, Katy growing
smarter and prettier in Martin's eyes every time he
saw her ; but he began to find out that the dashing
valets, who accompanied their showy masters to the
Hall, were freely permitted to join him and Katy
in their summer evening strolls. He remonstrated.
Katy was clever and self-opinionated. She replied
that she was not a school-girl; he quizzed the valets ;
she observed they were gentlemen to him, adding that
Mrs. White, the housekeeper, thought she demeaned
herself by keeping company with such as he; he grew
angry, Katy laughed at him, and one of her admirers,
passing by, hearing the laugh, paused, stepped up to
her, learned the cause of the merry peal, and walked
off with her in triumph.
She looked in vain for Martin at church on the fol-
lowing Sunday; she dawdled through the church-yard,
and her friend, "My Lord Wellor's valet,” overtook
her : he thought she was lingering for him. She did
not drive him away, as she had discarded poor Martin

Gray, with a laugh, but she was evidently thinking
of some one else. With all his vanity, he guessed as
much, and quitted her to join some gay ladies’-maids,
who were flaunting along the meadow path. Katy
never noticed them, though they watched her all
across the meadow, out at the gate, up the lane to the
turnstile, where she stood for a while, but turned back,
and so met the giddy party again.
It was now her turn to feel the bitterness of
laughter, when directed against herself; for the
prettiest of the party, a rival of hers in the affections
of Lewis the valet, cried out, “Well, Mistress Kate,
were you looking for your sweetheart, Martin Gray ?
It is all of no use, my dear; he is gone for a sol-
dier."
“ Gone for a soldier!” Katy passed the giddy
waiting-women and their obsequious attendant, and
hastened to the nursery garden of Martin's father.
He was sitting alone beneath the apple boughs. The
pathway was unswept, the clove pinks streeling
over the neat box borders. He looked very sad, in-
deed. “Uncle," said Katy, with white lips, “where
is Martin ?"
“ Gone for a soldier; Katy,” replied the old gar-
dener, striking his gnarled oaken stick angrily on the
gravel path.
“Oh, uncle !” Katy burst into a passionate fit of
weeping.
“ It is no use crying now, Katy,” said Gray, “it is
too late;' and rising, but not without difficulty, for
he was an infirm man,
6 well stricken in years,
walked towards the cottage, Katy following him like a
culprit.
The elder Gray did not close his door upon his
pretty niece; in truth, he could only suspect her as
being the cause of his boy's departure, for Martin had
formed some military acquaintances latterly; but one of
his son's last acts had been to collect some gifts, which
his father knew to be "keepsakes from Katy," and
;, he

these were lying on the window-sill, packed up and
addressed to
"Miss Katharine,
at the Hall."
Martin had left the cottage two days before with a
sergeant of artillery, who had long had designs of enlist-
ing so fine a young man, and from the adjoining town
had addressed a few lines to his father. He spoke of his
wish for other countries, of the Artillery service being
one of a superior character, as he considered, to the
Line, and anticipated great satisfaction at speedily
embarking for Gibraltar; not a word was said of Katy,
not a single regret was expressed at the idea of
leaving his native village, and from the style of the
letter, it was very evident that it was written as a
matter of duty to the old man-all sorrow at quitting
him was superseded by the anticipation of visiting
far lands. The father laid the letter on the table, and
observing, for the first time, the parcel on the window-
sill, he wiped the mist from his spectacles, read the
direction, and formed his opinion of Martin's reasons
for leaving home.
“Don't open it here, if you please,” said old Gray,
as he put the parcel into his niece's hands.
He sat down in his accustomed corner; Katy placed
herself in the tall, old-fashioned arm-chair in front of
the window, and Martin's dog, a long-haired shaggy
terrier, lay with its nose to the ground in an attitude
of expectation, which had doubtless been increased by
the entrance of Katy; as she had come, he thought
his master must soon follow.
There were various trifles belonging to the lad
scattered about the room and its walls. The whip he
used when he drove his father's cart into town
Katy had often heard it whish close to her ear as the
tip of the lash touched the smart blue ribbons of her
bonnet, causing her to turn round sooner than she
had intended, though she had recognized the steady
“trot, trot,” of the rough-coated aged pony long

before. A starling hopped up and down its perch in
a cage manufactured by young Gray, and made its
alternate appeals to “ Katy” and “Martin.” Fes-
toons of birds' eggs hung over the neatly-carved
wooden mantel-shelf, also the handiwork of Martin
Gray; and a few of his pencil sketches, of much pro-
mise, were wafered against the clean white-washed
walls. His books were all in their usual places on
the shelves he had made for them; and the cat-un-
grateful creature-purred with unaltered complacency,
as she sat on the door-mat woven by the ready fingers
of her young master, to whom Katy had given her
three years before.
Heartless Tibby!—she nodded and dozed, and
blinked her green eyes at the sunset, and washed her
face with her white fore paws, just as she had done
two Sundays before, when Martin was calling to her
in vain from his seat beside his father under the
apple-trees; but poor Grip was ill at ease, whining
from time to time as he looked at Katy, then at the
old man, at the open door, at puss—the selfish, the
luxurious, the apathetic, the antipodes of Grip him-
self.
Katy found, after sitting there some minutes, that
her uncle could not speak. The very clock was
silent, for it had not been wound up on Saturday
night; it had always been Martin's task to see to
that. She went up to the old man, kissed him, and
wished him good-bye. He suffered all this, and at
last faltered out a few words intended to be kind.
She looked back as she went out, but he said no more.
She never saw him again.
Next day the cottage door was closed. Evening
came, the old man was not under the apple boughs as
usual; the door was still closed. Some neighbours
opened it, and entered the chamber; old Gray lay on
his bed, as if in a calm sleep—he was dead.
Deep in the night a step came up the gravel-walk of
the garden; Grip gave a low whine, the latch of the

door was lifted, and Martin Gray entered. The un-
usual sight of a light at that still hour of village
repose had prepared him for sickness, and he trem-
bled exceedingly as he crossed the threshold. Friends
were sitting there; he gazed at them with a bewil.
dered stare, walked up to the bed, whither he was
followed by the watchers. One of them, a kind old
woman, laid her hand upon the sheet that covered the
body, but Martin whispered, in an unnatural tone,
“ Lift it."
She uncovered the face of the dead, and Martin
Gray fell fainting on his father's breast. They drew
him into the garden, the soft summer air revived
him, and he sat down upon the door-step of his home
overwhelmed with grief. In vain poor Grip licked
the tears that fell through his trembling fingers; in
vain the faithful beast whined, and thrust his nose
into his young master's bosom; his sympathy was un-
heeded.
The youth got up, walked again into the house,
looked once more at his father, felt his brow, on
which a few bright silver hairs were smoothly and
decently parted, kissed it, and, saying to the old
woman, Margaret Wilson, “You will take care of
all," he gave a glance round the room, his eye resting
for a moment on his father's vacant seat and Katy's
high-backed chair, and then, shaking hands with two
other kind-hearted watchers, he passed out again;
Grip watching him, and waiting vainly for the
whistle with which it had always been his master's
wont to summon him.
The door closed, the latch fell, the step upon the
gravel walk receded quickly, and Martin Gray was
never seen again in M
save by one person.
He paid it one more visit though, after his return
from Gibraltar. His journey to his native place was
made sometimes on foot, sometimes by a lift from a
waggoner, or good-natured stage-coachman, who felt
for the weary traveller, with his knapsack on his back,

and sometimes in those barges which slip so lazily and
pleasantly along the deep-winding streams of England.
It was in one of the last conveyances that he found
himself sailing slowly up the river in which he had so
often fished when a boy; it looked narrower to him
than it had done in his youth, but the over-arching
trees were taller and thicker than of old. He recog-
nised a pool where he and Katy had drawn their
pumpkin boats together; the alder bushes shaded it
now, and it looked cold and gloomy, for the sunlight
could not penetrate it. As the barge neared the
bank, he offered payment to the bargemen, but they
refused it-he sprung ashore, and plunged into the
thick coppice that formed part of the grounds of the
Hall where Katy used to be. He came to an open
space, near which stood the ruins of an old keep, part
of the ancient castle residence of the first owners of
the soil. In early days, it appeared to him as some-
thing grand and stupendous; now he was surprised to
find the windows and door-ways so near him as he
stood beneath the mound.
Having no mind to be recognized at once, he with-
drew from the open ground to the shrubberies, and
choosing a sequestered spot where the rooks were con-
gregating in the old beeches, he sat down upon the
leaves which the winds of autumn had gathered
together in a bank.
It was a lonely place, but from the hawthorn hedge
which bounded it there was a view of the meadows
and farm-buildings belonging to the landlord of the
Hall; and he lay contemplating, with something of
pleasurable feelings, the variegated landscape of corn-
fields and green uplands—the sweet scent of beans
reminded him of those autumn meetings, when the
corn was carrying. There was a cart, loaded with
golden sheaves, standing under the elms of the great
meadow, and another coming down an opposite hill,
with laughing children on the top-their voices rang
distinctly across the fields; the sun was glittering

on the bright weather-cock of the church spire, and
Martin Gray took up his knapsack, which he had
unstrapped from his tired shoulders, and resolved on
yielding to the impulse which tempted him, to join
Voices in the lane close by!
There was a laugh, prolonged, and rather loud, but
musical and merry, if not cheerful, and two people
advanced arm-in-arm. The forage-cap with its gold
band, the blue surtout and glittering scales upon the
shoulders, bespoke the officer of artillery, as Martin
rightly concluded from the company quartered in the
town; but the other, the lady
The lady !-a bonnet with bright-coloured ribbons
ah, Gray thought of Katy's garish taste !--placed far
back on the head, revealed a face encircled with hair
of that rich wavy brown only seen in England. The
curls fell heavily upon the swelling bosom--the large
dark and shining eyes, the red lips, the brilliant cheek,
were all of a character too full and decided for Katy ;
and yet-Martin stole along the hedge, keeping pace
with these two people; the gentleman, young and
showy, with his cap set jauntily on his shapely head,
and she, the woman-for girlhood was passed, face
and form were in their prime-was arrayed in attire
that ill agreed with Katy's condition.
But it was herm-her large shawl slipped from her
shoulders, and she turned to gather up its gaudy folds ;
she spoke, laughed again, the white teeth parted the
scarlet lips, and Martin knew her.
He stopped, breathed shorter, and she passed on,
after the shawl had been adjusted, and the lover, or
husband, had put aside the sunny hair and kissed the
smooth forehead of that laughing, beaming face.
Whether wife or mistress, Gray felt she was lost
to him, and he sat down again upon the bank of leaves,
till the shadows of the old elms stretched themselves
out like giants on the meadow-grass, and the song of
the
reapers mingled with the hum of voices in the
village; then he rose, buckled on his knapsack, and

made his way through many well-remembered paths,
past the old school-house, to the garden gate opening
upon his father's little property.
Again he trod the well-remembered path, again he
lifted up the latch, and, as he had hoped and expected,
found old Margaret by the fire; age made her feel the
cold, though the glow of autumn was in the sky.
She recognized him at once, in spite of growing
infirmities; perhaps it was because, as she said, she had
been expecting him, for she had saved what rent she
could afford to pay out of earnings from the garden, and
had it ready for him ; but he set aside all questions of
finance and property, and sat down beside the old
woman's spinning-wheel.
Something whined and moaned at the back-door.
Margaret rose, opened it, and Grip crawled in.
had waited, as it were, till his master came before he
could die. He dragged himself as well as he could
along the sanded floor, lay down at Martin's feet,
licked his shoes, tried to reach his hands, fell back,
uttered a long,
low whine of joy, and died upon the cot-
tage hearth. Dame Margaret gave the history of Katy
in a few words. She had been encouraged in her insa-
tiable love of dress by the housekeeper at the Hall,
who had her own ends to gain by the setting off of
Katy's beauty; father and mother, brought to the
lowest ebb of vice by drink, quarrelled between them-
selves about unholy profits, and their daughter finally
exchanged her place at the Hall for a dwelling in the
town, close to the barracks. She had no shame now,
Dame Margaret said, and Martin listened in bitter
silence to the tale, and that night departed.
He turned and looked at his old home from the
garden gate. The light shone through the casement
and streamed in a glittering line along the gravel path;
the gentle breeze of autumn lifted the boughs of the
trees and murmured through the neighbouring woods ;
the hum of voices in the village had died away,
the
watch-dog's honest bark” breaking the silence now
F 2

JASPER LILE:
and then, and there was but small stir in the long
irregular street as Martin passed through it.
No one observed him, though some were lingering
about the old coach-inn, expecting the one-pair-horse
vehicle that travelled through it “up to London.”
He went on his way, avoiding all the pleasant lanes
and paths, through which he had walked in youth and
sunshine, and reached a spot where four cross-roads
met. He remembered the time when he and Katy
would tremble if benighted here, for the place was said
to be haunted: there was some old tradition of a
suicide being buried beneath the tall white hand-post,
with a stake through his body, and not a villager
would
pass
this
way
alone after sunset.
But now Martin Gray sat down at the foot of the
hand-post, in the twilight, and hailed the coachman
when he came up, much to the old driver's surprise,
as he drove along the road, whistling in solitude, for
not a creature was on the top of the vehicle.
Gray climbed up beside the coachman, and, looking
back upon the village from the summit of a hill, dis-
tinguished only a few twinkling lights; but beyond it
the windows of the great house shone resplendent:
doubtless it was filled with company, and poor Martin
turned from such a view with a heavy sigh.
The coachman tried, without success, to engage
him in conversation, and then lit his cigar, leaving his
passenger to his own melancholy thoughts.
I must give one or two more scenes in the life of
Martin Gray ere I again bring him forward in com-
panionship with his fellow-convict.
One fair summer's day, a body of troops was em-
barking for foreign service. Among the rest was the
company of Royal Artillery to which Gray belonged,
and the officer who had just assumed the command
was no other than the same Captain Trafford, whom
he had seen walking with his old love, Katy. Three
years had elapsed since that memorable evening when
Martin quitted his native village ; but had he not then

learned the name of this officer, he would have recog-
nized him at once.
The steamer which was to convey the detachments
to the transport lay alongside the quay of a great
mercantile town in England. There were crowds
standing alongside to wish their friends farewell. A
gay regimental band had accompanied the troops, and
they passed through the throng, cheering as they
marched. There was not much delay in getting the
steamer underweigh ; all the poor property the men
possessed was strapped upon their backs, and they
were not long on board ere they turned their faces to
the shore to give a parting hurra! There was a
struggle between the policemen and some of the crowd
at the gangway, but it was soon over, the people
giving way. The cheers rose from the deck, there
was an answering hearty shout, and the steamer
dropped slowly down along the quay side.
A woman had pressed onwards to take a last look ;
her cloak was dropping from her shoulders, her bonnet
hung at the back of her head; the rich hair was cast
back from her wan, thin face; her dress was torn, dis-
orderly, and soiled, but Martin Gray recognized her
instantly. It was his lost love_his once bright-faced
cousin Katy
But she did not see him ; and as he gazed with
aching eyes and beating heart upon her, he heard a
comrade say, “ That is the girl that followed Captain
Trafford all the way from London. I heard him last
night, when I took the orderly-book to the inn,
swearing at her, and telling her not to follow him. Í
was sorry for the poor thing, for she was so tired she
could hardly stand, and leaned against the wall, staring
at him and crying terribly; but he sent for a waiter
and had her turned out. She gave me such a wild look
as she passed me by, I shall never forget it; but I
could not help her, you
know."
The crowd dispersed, but Gray saw a single figure
standing alone at the end of the quay, watching the

steamer to the last. She stretched out her arms,
leaned forward, and plunged into the water.
His involuntary scream brought others to his side,
and the news soon spread along the deck that a
woman had drowned herself. Some women had ap-
proached nearer the after-part of the packet than was
consistent with the regulations, and openly coupled
her name with Captain Trafford's. He came forward,
and, in a furious tone, sent them forward, and placed
a sentry on the spot they had invaded.
Some humane ladies of the party requested the
captain of the steamer to let them know the fate of
the unfortunate young woman, and late at night, as
the ship's bows began to ruffle the waters, and her
sails to fill, a fisher wherry hailed her, and a note was
sent on board.
It was speedily whispered about that Captain Traf-
ford had been the cause of the poor young creature's
death, but there were no outward signs of regret on
his part; he was as brusque as ever among the women
and children when on duty between decks, and as
intolerant and overbearing as usual towards the men
of his company;
They hated him cordially—they had always done
80 ; but after the sad incident I have recorded, their
dislike increased.
Martin Gray buried his sorrow in his own breast.
None ever knew that the unhappy girl who had
cast herself despairingly into the waters was his cousin.
Some trifling dereliction from duty on Gray's part
brought a violent reprimand from Captain Trafford.
The young soldier responded in a strain equally
excited, and the result was the imprisonment of Gray
in a solitary cell.
Some days after, Captain Trafford, being the officer
on duty, visited the prisoner. The sentry at the ad-
joining guard awaited the officer's return, and the
sergeant, at length growing uneasy at the delay, pro-
ceeded to the cell.

Trafford lay on the ground at Gray's feet. He had
evidently been stunned by a blow, for he was insen-
sible.
Gray made no defence, merely remarking, that he
“had paid an old debt.”
Had Captain Trafford died, the young soldier must
have been hung; but the former lived to give his evi-
dence at the court-martial, the sergeant's corroborated
the captain's, and the prisoner pleaded guilty.
But ere the sentence of the court was ascertained,
Gray, through some sailor friends, managed to escape
from prison, got on board a merchant ship where
hands were wanting, and worked his passage
home.
He was easily traced, was seized as a deserter, and
the result of another trial was transportation for life.
The convicts who had been rescued from the wreck
by the soldiers of the fort were of course handed over
to the proper authorities in South Africa.
Some met with a merciful destiny, some continued
their evil practices—these were sent on their way.
The wreck of the Trafalgar became matter of his-
tory in an age when philanthropy, or the affectation of
it, takes the lead in public.
“Ha!” said Lee to his companion, when they
heard, some months after, of the fate of felons like
themselves, “what a fool you would have made of
yourself if you had given yourself up as you
wished.”
Poor Martin Gray would at the moment this was
said have gladly changed places with the hardest-
worked convict in Norfolk Island.
But I must not anticipate my tale.
I have said that Lee had “rapidly chalked out in
his mind's eye a map of his plans." These were
rather facilitated in prospect by the unexpected ad-
vent of a companion; and on rising the following
morning, he drew out such a sketch of his intended

operations as induced Gray, of necessity, to assent to
them.
In the first place, he, Gray, knew Lee to be a des-
perate man, albeit certain indulgences, the result of a
morbid spirit of philanthropy-an endemic peculiar
to England—had been granted to the latter on board
the convict-ship; and he had thus, comparatively
with the other voyagers, been placed beyond com-
plaint. Secondly, there was only the alternative of
giving himself up as a deserter. On the one hand,
was infinite space in a fine country, with strange pro-
mises from his comrade, a daring and clever man; on
the other, at best, a renewal of servitude under a
yoke he had been taught by a miserable fatality ta
dislike.
Their resolution once taken, they determined, with
wise precaution, on leaving no traces of concealment
in a locality so dangerous by its proximity to the mili-
tary post; for, although the river to the westward
still remained impassable, and there was no likelihood
of an invasion from the eastward, it was not to be
doubted that ere long the scene of the wreck would
prove
of sufficient interest to bring some to the spot
in search of such plunder as the tide might cast up.
This territory, held, in Kafir parlance, by " the sons of
Congo," contained, besides the kraals and pasture-
lands of its chiefs and their people, a few traders'
huts, and three or four mission stations, all widely
separated from each other.

CHAPTER V.
THE FLIGHT INTO KAFIRLAND.
PERSEVERANCE and the instinct of self-preserva-
tion will effect much that, under ordinary circum-
stances, would be abandoned as impossible. By
working at night within the cave, and at dawn at the
outer entrance, they contrived to loosen heavy stones,
and piled them together so cleverly, that they felt sure
that in a day or two all traces of their hiding-
place would be obliterated, especially if the surf
increased.
Starting in the depth of a stormy night along the
coast, at the imminent risk of their lives, they re-
sorted by day to the rocks, where they ate such a
portion of the provision they carried as served to
keep up their strength. There was no scarcity of
water, the heavens still poured forth their floods, at
times they were almost blinded by the rain, and had
not the heavy fogs occasionally rolled themselves up,
they might have perished. For his own wise pur-
poses, God chose to lead these two men in safety
through the storm, and on the third day of their
journey they entered a dense bush, crept along
the bank of a stream, the Inzonzana, forded it in
safety, and, having waited till night-fall to cross the
open plains northwards, they about midnight entered
a narrow gorge or kloof, and lay down to sleep; nor
did they wake till the sun, for the first time since
their entrée upon this stage of their existence, came
from his chambers unveiled, and rejoicing as a giant
to run his glorious course.
“ We are all right now," said Lee, “and we may light

up there,"
a fire in this dip under the cliff; we may wait again
till night-time to pay a visit to my friend
pointing to a mud hut on the slope of a mountain,
which Gray would not of himself have discovered.
“And so now to dinner; there is a scrap of pork left;
our smoke will not attract attention here, so we may
make ourselves comfortable; you will see fires in all
directions by-and-by."
And so it proved. The swollen rivers had detained
many a Kafir from a thieving or hunting expedition ;
but Lee knew he was some distance from any kraal of
importance. However, in case of any unexpected
visit from rovers, he selected the densest part of a
thicket for their bivouac till evening.
The sun went down, and the cool breeze, which
stirred the surface of the stream, fanned the travel-
stained faces of the wanderers. The sprews and
smaller finches, the canaries, the titmouses, and the
blue birds and the Cape chlories—a whole airy colony,
in fact, of bright-winged creatures-began to fit about
the bush preparatory to taking their pleasant rest
among the myrtle boughs and dwarf lilacs, and soon
woke the adventurers, who had sought repose in that
small Eden.
Gray sat up, and the scene had its influence on his
mind, which was not yet as a garden utterly laid
waste and tare-sown. Gentle thoughts stole over
him, and he longed for the wings of the doves croon-
ing near him to fly away and be at rest; but such
thoughts became as a bottle in the smoke when his
companion awoke himself, and, rousing Gray by a
rough shake, bid him get up from the bed of dry
leaves on which they had reposed themselves with a
comfort rare to their wearied frames.
Lee's mind was wide awake. Now that he had
reached a place of comparative security, for he knew
well where he was, which was more than Gray did,
he, Lee, ost wished that the latter had been
drowned with the other victims of the storm ; but the

75
wish was idle there he was -his fellow-convict, his
comrade. It would not do to lose sight of him; he
was at his mercy, for the deserter might earn his
pardon by betraying his companion.
As Lee considered these points, he did not by any
means contemplate getting rid of Gray by violent
means. How many men, from whose misdeeds origi-
nate death and misfortune, shudder at the abstract
idea of slaughter in cold blood.
" The breeze that stirs the stream,
It knows not the depth below,"
and the little bubbling spring, that rises with
diamond brightness amid the flowery turf, wots not
of the desolation it may spread in its course if unre-
strained.
But Lee's career had been little checked in its evil
nature; and I question if Gray had been thoroughly
disabled by rheumatism or fatigue, whether his compa-
nion would have had any compunction in leaving him
to the mercy of stray Kafirs or wild beasts.
But, as matters stood, it was clear he must not be
lost sight of; so Lee, on hearing his companion com-
plain of cramped limbs, made a virtue of necessity,
and bid him take courage, and follow him to the
trader's hut.
With some little difficulty they scrambled across
the stones lying in the bed of the gorge, through
which a swift rivulet was rushing. Had there been
water enough to drown Gray, and had he fallen into
it by accident, I know not how he might have fared.
But they reached the opposite slope dotted with
granite heaps and mimosa clumps, climbed the moun-
tain steep, and traversed another path. The moon,
like a blazing shield, rising above the distant moun-
tains, lit the plains, but the nearer hills were yet in
deep shadow; and it was not till the wanderers were
in full advance upon the ill-tended garden fronting
the hut indicated by Lee, that they discovered, some

JASPER LYLE:
paces from them, what appeared a herd of cattle.
They drew back stealthily, for Lee's experience of the
country made him cautious, and sunk down in a hol-
low beneath the thickest bush at hand. Each held
the other by the arm; they scarcely breathed, and
paused with fixed eyes and rigid limbs for many
minutes.
At length a rustling sound arose among that
mysterious crowd, the shivering noise of assegais
announced its warlike calling, and a Fingo chief
marshalled his phalanx with their shields of bullock
hides, beneath which they had been resting till the
rising of the moon. Keen watchers of their great
mother, Nature, they had calculated to a nicety the
darkest nook for a shelter to rest beneath their shields
preparatory to their march at night.
It was clear they were on a mission of vengeance,
for the few Kafirs, whose fires had appeared during
the day, were either too terrified to leave their lairs,
and give warning of an enemy's approach; or, what
was more probable, the band of warriors had inoved
unnoticed to the spot.
In perfect silence, and within the shadow of the
hill, the chief put his force in order; ere long they.
were on their march.
Not a sound was now heard
upon the hill side, but
a measured tread of distant feet was distinctly audible
to the convicts, as, impatient of delay, and, it must
be owned, rather disheartened, they lay with their
ears to the ground listening to the receding footsteps
of the Fingoes along the edge of the ravine.
“ What a life we are to lead in this savage coun-
try!" murmured Gray, who, ill, weary, and unhappy,
would have given worlds to have been at his duty as
a soldier again.
"Silence, fool! and follow me,” was Lee's reply.
There was nothing for it but to obey. They crept
cautiously into the garden fronting the trader's hut;
it was a desolate piece of ground; such plants as had

was torn from its hinges, and there was light enough
from the moon to see that the interior had been rifled
of some, if not all, of its contents.
The two men sat down upon the earthen floor of
the despoiled abode; the one cursing, the other
moaning in the anguish of pain and weariness of
heart.
A man's form suddenly came between them and the
moonlight that "shone upon the opposite mountain.
A pistol clicked in their ears.
Who have we here?” said a stern voice in
English. The convicts rose to their feet, and in a
moment all three men stood together in the clear and
radiant atmosphere.
But, to Lee's disappointment, the man, who had
just issued from some place of concealment near
them, was not the person he had expected to see, and
on whose co-operation in his plans he relied, inas-
much as he, Lee, had some claims on the trader's
good-will; and, compelled by circumstances to be
prompt and truthful, he plainly admitted his surprise
and regret. Then, without satisfying his interrogator
as to his identity, or his comrade's, he inquired
abruptly, "Where is Tanner?”
To this he received, instead of a reply, the unsatis-
factory answer of
“ What's that to you ? and who the
?"
The pistol was again elevated, but Lee coolly put it
aside; and, sensible that his desperate position could
only be defended by hardy measures-seeing, too, that
the peremptory tone of his opponent was that of a
man whose privacy was not to be further invaded
against his will, answered in a steady tone:
“I am not a spy, you may trust us both; lead us
into your cabin, or we must climb higher up the hill
to the hut where Tanner kept his powder in old
days. If it is not standing now, there is a cave near
it, and we can light a fire there in safety. My com-
are you

panion must have an hour's rest and food, and we
shall be secure enough there. To tell you the truth,
we are both hungry, and have travelled far.”
It was clear that the speaker knew the ground on
which he stood and the calling of the trader, who, to
outward observers travelling the country, carried on
a harmless traffic in ostrich-feathers, skins, horns,
tobacco, snuff, and such comforts as civilization in her
slow march through Kafirland had taught the use of
to the natives. Puzzled, and rather disconcerted, he
led the way to the hut.
It had a counter, shelves, weights and scales-all
the accompaniments of legitimate trade; but on
striking a light, and holding it up, both visitors and
host were soon made aware of the devastated state of
the stores. The shelves had been cleared of their
blankets, the walls were bare of all but the nails to
which beads and bugles had been suspended in
tempting array; the tobacco had been swept from the
counter, the remnant of tobacco-pipes lay broken on
the trampled floor, and scarce a vestige remained of
any portable wares. A bunch of common candles
hanging in a corner had escaped the notice of the
thieves. One of these the host took down, and, going
into an inner room, returned with the welcome intel-
ligence that there was something yet left in the
locker.
Either overlooking the entrance to this inner apart-
ment, or having found sufficient plunder to satisfy
themselves, the thieves had here left all intact. The
marauders had been Kafirs, who, not aware of the
Fingoes' proximity, had swept off all the property
they could readily dislodge.
The Fingoes bore the odium of the theft, but they
were only intent on repossessing themselves of their
own property.
A bed covered with skins stood at one end, a
chest, a bench, and a common table of yellow wood at
the other; a few household utensils completed the

furniture ; the window was darkened by a rude
shutter, and the ashes of a wood fire were on the
hearth.
Drawing a few sticks together from the scattered
embers, the host, a man of determined aspect, re-lit
the fire, replenishing it with a billet of wood, and in
a short time the three men were seated together on
the ground with closed doors. A repast of dried
buck and some mouldy bread, which did not look par-
ticularly inviting even to wayworn travellers, was
spread before them; and the large chest being re-
moved, some clay, which had been spread to give the
surface the same appearance as the floor, was cleared
away, a heavy stone was lifted, and the master of the
hut, descending an aperture, brought up a tiny keg of
Cape brandy, filled the flask he carried in his huge
pocket, and, replacing the keg, the stone, the trap-
door, and the chest, handed a tin cup-ful of the burn-
ing liquid first to Lee and then to Gray.
All this, of course, had not been done in silence.
The host, who called himself Brennard, recounted
how he had been absent on a trading excursion for
some days to Fort Beaufort, a garrison in the
northern part of the colony; how, on his return, his
horses and oxen had fallen lame, and he had left
them at a brother-trader's station; how he had
walked homewards with a pack-ox carrying some of
his stores-the ox was now fastened to a stout oak far
down the adjoining kloof; how he had advanced to
reconnoitre, having heard the Fingoes were on march
against Umgee's people, who had stolen Fingo cattle ;
and how, after watching the phalanx advance upon
their silent path to his own property, which they de-
spoiled and left, he had been astonished to meet
two white men on his ground, one of whom was evi-
dently no stranger there.
Gray remained contented as an auditor to a con-
versation begun by Brennard in Dutch, and carried on
by Lee, who admitted in English that he had been in

the country before, and that he had known Tanner, the
first trader on the station; but the dialogue was soon
wholly carried on in Dutch, which was incompre-
hensible to the deserter. He learned, however, that
Tanner had been shot on the other side of the Kei
in a conflict with the tribes there. Brennard, who
had been his agent beyond the Bashee, knowing
that the head-quarters of the business needed look-
ing after, left à deputy on the coast, near the Um-
tata river, and removed himself to the hut in the
hills.
In a word, Brennard was a dealer in gunpowder,
which he sold secretly to the tribes on the English
frontier; and the men on the coast were the esta-
blished consignees of arms from British artificers.
Lee, of course, soon enlightened Brennard on
the subject of his former acquaintance with Tanner;
but how it first came about was a mystery to the
trader. He was beginning to consider how he might
sift this out, and both convicts were on the point of
reminding him that they should be glad of some
change of raiment, when a long low whistle, from the
side of the hut nearest the hill, interrupted their plan
of operations, and the trader, rising, prepared to leave
the hut.
His pistol lay on the bench, Gray seized it.
“Put it down, Gray,” said Lee; “I know my man
now; besides, you fool, do you suppose he would have
left a loaded weapon behind him if he was bringing
an enemy upon us ? Put it down, I say," and he
took it out of the hand of the deserter, who, as his
prospects opened before him, began to deplore his
state, and longed, with thoughts half-bewildered, to
free himself from the net he felt gradually closing
round him.
Lee read mistrust, and what he called fear, in the
face of his unfortunate companion. The mistrust
was unmistakable, but the fear was that which a
heart, born as honest as human nature can be, feels

when involved in wrong-doing, from which there is no
escape.
“Stay, Brennard,” said Lee, with a sudden assump-
tion of confidence in Gray. “I suspect I know what
that whistle means. I have no secret from my friend
here,” laying his hand on the shoulder of the de-
serter as he spoke. I have told you as much as
need be of my tale, and now let us make a bargain-
there is nothing like plain speaking in great emer-
gencies; and as I have a pretty strong notion that
through your information we might be handed over to
the authorities, I do not mind reminding you that we
might do the same by you; and that while our fate
would only be re-transportation--for we have escaped
from the wreck of the Trafalgar-perhaps yours
would be a dance in the air. Whether the hut in the
kloof is still in its old place, I cannot tell; but a
commando out here would soon rout out your stores,
and either take you prisoner, or set a price on your
head. At any rate, the game would be up
with
you
as a respectable British trader,”—Lee laughed hear-
tily—“and you would be at the mercy of the Kafirs
or the Dutch, into whatever territory you might
wander.”
He whom the convict so addressed was a man of
powerful frame-deep-chested, and rather short-armed,
every limb proved strength; backed by a couple of
Kafirs, he might have despatched his visitors; but,
although a dealer in contraband stores, and accus-
tomed to danger, and at times to scenes of warfare,
in which he was supposed to take a part against the
very population he helped to arm,-although, in fact,
he, like Lee, was traitor, he would have hesitated at
a deed of cold-blooded murder on his own hearth.
In a word, no two men could have better understood
each other than Lee, the convict, and John Brennard,
the trader of the Witches' Krantz (Cliff). As for Gray,
he might truly be considered, what a late ruffian was
described to be, “the victim of circumstances,”-with

wearied body and aching heart, he sat by, a passive
listener ; passive, because he could not help himself.
The low whistle was repeated, and Brennard, open-
ing the window-shutter, responded in the tone of a
wandering, hungry wolf: then the signal came clear
but slow, and with evident caution, and moving in an
upward direction, died away in some hollow of the
hill. Then Brennard, closing the aperture carefully,
proposed entering on a solemn compact with his new
acquaintances, to which they agreed.
Strange indeed is that species of oath, which binds
bad men together, and which may truly be considered
as founded on a superstition, of which the devil is the
founder. There are many to whom the nature of such
an oath is sacred, who will rob, murder, desolate the
home of the industrious and virtuous, and commit
every crime which by that oath they are bound to
enter upon, in partnership with others as 6 blind of
heart” as themselves. In these compacts, they swear
by the Bible, thus blasphemously making the word of
God a witness and a guarantee for sin. Aye, and
such compacts have been kept inviolate, even at the
gibbet’s foot, and beneath the bloody guillotine.
And, after all, what is an oath, in the opinion of a
truly honest man ? A seal set upon the word of a
villain, who only tells the truth because the fear of
punishment on earth compels him to do it. He who
lies to God daily, would hardly hesitate to lie to man,
but that he lets
“ I dare, not wait upon I would,”
and trembles, like the Chinese and the Kafir, not at
commission of crime, but at the disgrace and punish-
ment which must follow its discovery.
They stood up, did those three desperate men, in the
low and narrow room; the owner of the wild domicile
held the book in his hand, for there was a Bible in
the chest. They opened the unholy compact with the

83
words “ I swear.” As they spoke, their eyes were
fixed distrustingly on each other, not on Heaven, the
witness they invoked, and Brennard was proceeding to
dictate a certain form, with its set phrases of“ betrayal
of brotherhood," "rights of partnership," &c., when the
whistle came back from the krantz above, descended
gradually down the hill side, paused, chirruped like
a bird, a gay, innocent bird, and a low tap at the door
was followed by a voice of most musical sweetness.
“Vuka u zishukumise”—“Awake and be stirring,”
said the voice. It was a woman's.
“Urga lungenalake ? "_"Are you ready?” asked
Brennard.
“Ewa-urga kuza ni nina ?”—“Yes when are
e you
coming P”
“ Dirge za”—“Iam coming now," replied the trader.
On which another voice added, “ Lexesha kaloku”.
“ Now is the time."
A quick but gentle sound of unshod feet patted
past the window, there was silence again in the outer
air, and the three Englishmen resumed their attitude ;
Brennard in the centre with the Bible--it had the
names of brothers and sisters beneath his own in the
fly-leaf-he had kept it by him in the wilderness-
and the two others with their palms spread open on
the cover. They went through the formula again,
the oath was sealed by a kiss
upon
the sacred record,
and it was restored to its resting-place, whence it
never emerged but on extreme occasions like the
present. The fire was extinguished, and once more
refreshing themselves with a sip from the flask, the
light was extinguished, and all three passed out from
the hut, the door was drawn to, as well as its dilapi-
dated condition would allow, and passing through the
garden and advancing a few yards to the right, they
turned the profile of a hill, descended a steep path-
way leading to a dense bush, and in a few minutes
distinguished the hurried tread of naked feet upon
the crisp leaves and underwood; a group of women

pattered through a narrow glade, and, passing our
adventurers in silence, led the way into the kloof.
Lee recognized the locality as he advanced, step by
step, down a declivity intersected with blocks of
granite and tufts of scrub, or low bush; the murmur
of a rivulet making its way over the stones was audible,
and the distant cry of the jackal hailed the coming
of the night. Here Lee remembered well to have
rested on shooting excursions in former days; here he
had listened to many a tale of Tanner's, and he could
guess the exact spot for which they were bound-the
three men in advance, the Kafir girls in Indian file
following. So they proceeded, till the darkness of the
glen deepened, and putting aside a large alder, they
bent their heads, and found themselves beneath a
magnificent oak tree, to a branch of which was fast-
ened a large ox, black as Erebus.
Motionless and patient he stood with his heavy load
upon his broad back, for Brennard had intended
returning to the spot sooner than circumstances even-
tually permitted him, and he bent his head in loving
recognition of Amayeka, whose sweet voice welcomed
her favourite. The unusual roughness of the weather
had detained Brennard longer on his expedition than
usual, and Amayeka and her companions had kept
their watch day by day in the hills.
I know not a more perfect model of obedience and
endurance than a Kafir woman. With the white
man, she is never thoroughly tamed. You
may
take
her under your care in childhood—you may accustom
her to English habits, dress, and religion; but once let
her taste of freedom, and she is like a bird on the
wing again. True, however, to the instincts of her
nature, she bows to the thraldom of her race, wields
the pickaxe and the hoe, submits cheerfully to her
occupation of “hewer of wood and drawer of water,"
yields obedience to her task-masters, abjures her
European costume, albeit she delights in a broidery
of many-coloured beads, and sits meekly silent when

bartered for by a lover, who, as a husband, makes her

of many
one
Such was Amayeka, who had been reared from the
age of six years at a missionary station, near the
Caledon river; but from this she had been withdrawn
by her father Doda when she was fourteen, and during
the year—for she was now but fifteen, the prime of a
Kafir maiden's life--she had thrown off her European
habits in every sense, retaining only the language,
which she spoke with the grace so peculiar to her
nation when educated.
I specify her age from general calculation; her
father could only count her years by connecting her
birth with a period of great drought.
She and her companions, all older than herself, had
been sent by Umlala, a petty chief, to convoy the
treasonable stores brought from the colony in Bren-
nard's wagon, and transferred to Zwartz's back, at a
secret station on the banks of Somerset River. This
done, a sagacious old Kafir had led Zwartz through
an intricate defile to Witches' Krantz, and fastening
him to the “trysting tree," returned as herdsman to
the trading wagon, with its span of draught oxen, on
the banks of Somerset River. For days these poor
girls of Kafirland had sat watching the changes of
the atmosphere from the mountain slopes. Their
food was parched corn and strips of biltongue (meat
dried in the sun), supplied by a cleft in the rock,
where they had long ago established a simple
larder. Apples, from the banks of the Kei and the
Gonube rivers, varied their repast occasionally, and
a large light basket of sour milk, brought to
them from a distant kraal, was a delicious addition.
They were very merry; they laughed, they sang,
sometimes hymns, taught them by Amayeka; they
danced, ate their frugal meals, and slept soundly, pil-
lowed on flowery turf, with heaven's own canopy of
blue and gold above them. If the clouds rose, they
withdrew to the caves in the mountain side, and these

recesses were their shelter, when a scout came to tell
them that Jocqueenis' Fingoes were on a march into
Dushani's country, to “eat up” the son of Ixexa. For,
however quiet and unpeopled the hills of Kafirland
may appear, there are always scouts on the look-out.
These tribes carry out the prophecy against the sons
of Ishmael, “their hand shall be against every man,
and every man's hand against them,” hence they
are ever on the watch. But all this time our adven-
turous group are waiting together in the glen. Here
Brennard unslung his havresac from Zwartz's yoke,
and taking out of it such articles of raiment as he
chose to retain for his own use, bestowed it, with some
acceptable gear, on the convicts. The flask of Cape
brandy was added to the stores, and to each was given
a small double-barrelled pistol. Thus partially pro-
vided for, the three bade each other farewell, for it was
necessary to make as much way as they could before
morning, and the defile being threaded, some hours of
repose might be obtained in a place of security, to
which their female guides would direct them.
Brennard, having watched the party as far as the
rays of the moon flickering through the tracery of the
trees permitted, returned to his domicile, there to
accomplish such repairs as he could single-handed;
and this done, to return to Somerset River for his
wagon, and forward information to the authorities
of the delinquency of the Fingo marauders; but long
before the trader had noted the outrage on paper,
the warriors had stalked through the enemy's kraal,
and possessed themselves of the cattle they called
theirs, and crossing a stream about nine miles to the
north, soon chanted their song of triumph and defiance
from their own territory.
As the reader will readily infer, the compact to
which I have alluded involved a treaty of partnership
between Brennard, Lee, and Gray, in the secret traffic
of arms and ammunition with the tribes to the north-
cast of the Cape colony. The deputies left by Bren-

nard near the coast held a situation of little danger,
since there was no legal restriction on the sale of arms;
nevertheless, a certain caution was necessarily observed
in the transmission of such stores from Cape Town,
lest the eyes of the authorities should be opened to a
fact, at present only suspected by the non-commercial
settlers." The powder traffic, demanding greater care
and secrecy, was not so easily carried on, and it had
long been obvious to Brennard that it would be highly
advantageous to establish an intermediate agent be-
tween the Gonube and the Witches' Krantz, for the
disposal of the gunpowder, and the surer interchange
of Kafir goods in return.
This offer Lee readily accepted, with a reservation
that, if it suited his purpose hereafter, he should pro-
ceed to the locations lately established to the eastward
by the disaffected Dutch. As to Gray, a spell seemed
to bind him to such measures as Lee chose to propose.
I have shown that Lee had given Brennard only such
details of his early acquaintance with Tanner as he
thought necessary, and the trader, as he climbed the
hill again, wondered, within himself, at the mysterious
influence which had thus suddenly been imposed upon
him. Who Lee was, or what his position had been in
Southern Africa in former days, he could not tell. All
he knew was, that he was a runaway convict, that he
had been acquainted with Tanner, and that he had a
thorough knowledge of that part of the country, and
of all the secret nooks for keeping contraband stores.
Brennard also felt quite certain that Lee would not
have admitted his real condition as a runaway convict
of the wreck of the Trafalgar, had it not been an event
of publicity which would elicit close inquiries; and as
there would, probably, be some survivors who had
witnessed Lee's escape in the boat, it would at least be
conjectured that he had reached terra firma and made
his way into the interior, where he might become a
dangerous assistant to the Dutch, who were known to
welcome such desperadoes to their gloomy councils.

JASPER LYLE :
In a word, Lee knew himself to be a marked man, and,
in such an exigency, there was nothing like binding a
useful coadjutor, like Brennard, by ties which, if broken
by one, must be the ruin of both.
When in the cave, after his preservation from ship-
wreck, Lee had shaped out a somewhat crude plan for the
future; he certainly entertained a vision of self-aggran-
dizement, of leadership among the malcontent Boers, of
founding a settlement, and opening a career of rule ;
but a new incentive to be “ up and doing" presented
itself unexpectedly before him, and a fresh impetus
was at once given to his desires of organizing a party
among a people ripe for rebellion, by the perusal of a
paragraph in an English newspaper, of a comparatively
Iate date, which Brennard had brought with him from
the interior, and given to Lee to beguile him on the
stealthy march, in company with the unwilling and
melancholy Gray, and the dusky maiden guides of
Kafirland.
It was on the evening of the first day's march that
the instincts of ambition within the convict's breast
assumed a new direction.
Through what deep and tangled footpaths did those
patient maidens lead the party! A curious sight it
was to Gray, a stranger in that far country, as, linger-
ing behind the rest, he watched the group wending its
slow way, now under the shadow of the great krantzes,
now waiting for him, beside some tiny stream, that
shone like steel under the
“Green willows with the hanging boughs."
He could not run, and had he been able to do so, he
knew not his way. He could only guess by certain
constellations, known in both hemispheres, that he was
journeying eastward, and he wandered on like a man
dreaming that a fiend has fixed an evil eye upon him,
and beckons him to a doom he cannot resist. Gray
felt that Lee never lost sight of him.
It was at night that their longest marches were

made; but when the sun came fairly up, the girls were
generally able to point out the established resting-
places, where a commissariat of biltongue and Kafir
corn lay hid in some rocky storehouse.
In these halting-places all slept through the golden
hours of noon, the women at a prescribed distance.
There had been five at first starting, and the party had
been increased by three more joining them in a kloof,
almost impassable from the density of the bush.
Zwartz lay like a guardian in the centre of his female
friends ; they petted and talked to him at times, calling
him all manner of endearing names, but Amayeka
was his best friend; and Gray, sorrowful and rest-
less, reclined always within arm's length of the wary
Lee.
The latter was the first stirring. It was a sultry
afternoon on the first day's march, and Lee took from
the havresac the paper Brennard had slipped into
it at the Witches' Krantz. The paragraph I have
alluded to was as follows :-
“ We regret to learn that the indisposition of our
governor, Sir Marmaduke Faulkner, still detains him
in England, and that General Sir John Manvers has
been requested to take command of the frontier forces
at this critical period, when it is pretty well under-
stood, by such as choose to open their eyes to the fact,
that the Kafirs are rife for war, and that the Boers to
the eastward are only waiting a favourable opportunity
to proclaim their disaffection. Sir John may be daily
expected from Cape Town.”
“So,” said Lee, his chest heaving, his eye dilating,
“he is here! Well, there will come a day when we
shall stand face to face, openly, as foes; I may fail of
success, I may be beaten for want of a regular force,
but I may be revenged-revenged ;” and the tone in
which he uttered this aroused the sleeping deserter.
Lee held a parley with Gray, but did not enlighten
him fully on the subject of his enmity to the man
who would soon be first in authority over the wide

territory through which they were roaming. He gave
him to understand, however, that his final object was
not to join a tribe of savages in a fight against his
countrymen; once well on the north-eastward, there
would be no difficulty in proceeding by degrees to
those settlements where many Dutch farmers lay
bivouacked, with all their poor household and farm
property about them.
The character Lee had assumed for himself and
friend was one which quite suited his disposition, and
would greatly facilitate his movements; the Kafirs
would welcome him as a trader, and pass him safely
on as such; while the Dutch would receive him as
a confederate, and hail with satisfaction so able an
assistant as Gray, a deserter from the Royal Artillery.
Night fell. The Kafir girls re-adjusted Zwartz's
burden; they frequently lightened it by carrying skins
of gunpowder on their heads, which they did with
perfect ease and grace, and Amayeka, uttering the
simple warning, “ It is time," passed on, lingered on
the hill side to point out the smoothest cattle-tracks
to Gray, who, as his limbs recovered their elasticity,
tried to reconcile himself to his fate by admitting the
pleasant influence which the glittering eyes and bril-
liant smile of Amayeka shed on his moody moments.
Having passed through many intricate defiles and
glens of indescribable beauty, they emerged, in about
a fortnight from the first night march, upon a more
open country. These plains were dotted with kraals,
from each of which some Great man
came forth;
Amayeka acted as interpreter. A day was fixed for
meeting in a secret spot, where a due exchange of
goods was to be made. The wagons sent by the agent
from the Gonube were already, with hides and horns,
waiting there, and these were to be despatched by
trusty convoy to the Witches' Krantz ; Doda, the great
councillor of the principal chief, firmly believing that
unless the tribes kept to their agreement with Bren-
nard, the latter would withhold the supplies and betray

the storehouses, or rather storehuts, which held the
arms and ammunition of Kafirland.
A stranger would not have distinguished these huts
from others of the hamlet, but day and night three
dusky guards kept watch and ward around them, for
fear of treachery or fire. These guards wove baskets, or
shaped out bullet-moulds, or bound the assegai blades
to the slender shafts; they did anything apparently
but keep sentry over the domicile they so cautiously
protected.
On the twelfth day of the journey, having headed
the Imkwali river and traversed a plain, our travellers
suddenly dipped between two hills, and on ascending
the last, found themselves in front of an amphitheatre,
over which Umlala's kraal and pasture lands were
spread. It was the chief residence of Umlala and his
hemraaden, or councillors.
Behind this green space rose a range of purple
heights; nearer to it, and sheltering the village from the
north, was a chain of low hills, and the sides of these
were dotted with thousands of beautiful cattle. The
whole population of this territory was astir. Over one
slope a hunting party wound its way, below were
children riding races on the backs of oxen, far too sleek
for such an exertion; girls were laughing and talking
together under the noble groups of trees, but the
great mass of Kafirs had gathered in a crowd in an
angle of the kraal. Amayeka, on perceiving this,
bid the convoy await till her father should be sent
for.
Doda came, he having, as I have shown, already
held communication with Lee on the road, and he
now invited him to the front of his hut until Umlala
should be ready to receive him. Ere long, a sum-
mons arrived, and Lee proceeded to a conference with
Umlala.
The chief was seated on the ground, surrounded
by several of his hemraaden. The subject of con-
versation had for many days touched upon the pre-

it was
parations for war, which for months had been secretly
progressing in Kafirland; and the intelligence which
Amayeka brought, and which Lee confirmed, was soon
conveyed by Doda: he told Umlala that the white
men were making ready for battle. Even now,
said, the white chiefs were beginning to count their red
men by tens, for they were many.
No immediate or noisy demonstration followed this
announcement. Umlala sat, to all appearance, in
deep thought, Doda waiting at his right hand till it
should please his chief to address him.
At last, having matured his thought, Umlala said,
in a low and distinct voice,
“ Amakosa noburoti bona”. “The Amakosa are
brave."
The crowd testified their satisfaction by a murmur
of assent that rolled through the assembly like the
swell of an ocean wave.
“Our chief is wise,” said Doda; "without him we
are as the land in drought—as a bundle of sticks scat-
tered for want of a cord-as people journeying on
vast plains without a purpose, without landmarks.
It is he who leads us from dark places, and sets our
feet on open ground we are his children - hear
him.”
“Umlala," answered Amani, " is my mouth, let him
speak.”
“Our ears are open,” said Doda, and sat down with
an uneasy glance at Amani.
For Doda was peacefully inclined—that is to say,
though war was in his heart, he had tasted of the
blessings of civilization. He had seen his daughter,
"sitting in the sun and eating honey,” living under
virtuous influences, in peace and plenty, at the mission
station, and it was with inward reluctance that he
had obeyed his chief in withdrawing her from thence.
It would have been useless, as well as impolitic, to
oppose his sentiments openly to Umlala's inclinations,
especially as of late the malcontent Dutch had been

tampering with the chiefs, and some mercenary and
unprincipled traders had profited by the aspect of
affairs to increase their traffic.
Amani rose He was the rain-maker, or witch doc-
tor, of the tribe-one of those wicked magicians of the
country, who, taking advantage of the Kafir belief in
evil agency, manage, with extraordinary tact, to turn
the very changes of the elements to bad account.
By his cunning and audacity, he had made such pre-
dictions and revelations as had obtained for him para-
mount ascendancy over his chief, and consequently
the whole tribe. Doda both despised and dreaded him.
He had missed him lately for several days. Amani
was supposed to be in the retirement of the hills,
preparing charms and incantations for the ceremony
they had assembled to witness, the induction of the
young warriors into their calling. But Doda, who
had his scouts ever on the watch, felt sure that the
wizard had made a hurried march to some secret place
of meeting with Brennard, who would have given
him the last colonial news; and, armed with this, he
could easily forestall Amayeka and her white con-
federates, since Amani could travel faster and by
nearer paths than they could traverse in a body,
and with Zwartz, encumbered with their contraband
stores.
It was soon clear that such was the case.
Amani began his address by saying, that Umlala's
eyes were open.
Amani himself had predicted mis-
chief. He had told his chief that the great white
captains were coming to speak to them with guns;
but as for the red men they had now on the borders
of the colony, they could be counted in a day, they
were not many. He called on the sons of Congo to
sound the war-cry from the highest mountain-top.
"Swear,” said he," by the bones of Congo's fore-
fathers, to drive the Amglezi to the sea which spits
them up. Behold, we will turn the hail-storm of
their fire to water-it shall be as water poured

through a broken calabash. What right has the
white man to put his foot before us on our war-paths,
when we choose to quarrel with the Gaikas about
grass ? The bad people of Gaika steal from us
he shares the plunder-then we take up arms against
him—the white man comes, and tramples down our
corn; he begins the war, and will not let us rest in
our huts, though our fight with Gaika is no business
of his. Gaika calls himself the white man's friend ;
he is a liar-he hates the white man--but likes to sit
where he will in the colony with his eyes open.
He stretches out his hand, and the Amglezi fill it.
The Amglezi are fools, and believe him. He does not
steal their cattle himself, but sits still upon the hills,
and sees it go by to the kloofs in the Amatolas; and
quarrels with us when he finds us there waiting to
share the plunder that belongs to all the land-our
land-a land that will soon be dead to us, for shall we
reap the corn we have planted ? Gaika is a woman-
he will not fight us himself, but lifts up his voice, and
cries aloud to the white men, who come among us
like locusts, and eat us up, and then pay
Gaika in
beads and buttons for his treachery to his brothers.
Let the Amglezi come--let them kill the last man of
us—but let not Umlala's children put their necks
under the foot of Gaika. Better to be dead lions in
our own kraals, than live dogs in the Amglezi's terri-
tory. The white man calls himself the protector of the
Kafir tribes dwelling on the borders of the country
he has made his own; but we are oppressed by his pro-
tection, and we will not have it; and we know, too,
that some of the Amglezi are with us in heart; for
they tell us we are wronged, and bring us arms and
powder wherewith to regain our rights.
Doda thought within himself, we pay for such
stores;" but the thought rested in his breast, for he
it.
Amani proceeded, waving aloft an assegai, which
quivered in the grasp of his muscular palm:

“ Awake, sons of Congo ! shout from the mountain
tops ! the valleys are waiting to reply-we have sat
still long enough. Behold the children of the foam
will multiply, and come and drive us like monkeys
into the rocks. Shall we consent to sit there in
darkness ? Shall our young warriors be mown down
like early grass, or be driven into the sea like ashes
before the wind ? Shall our cattle be taken from us,
to languish in new pastures ? Shout, young warriors
of Kafirland! shout, for the elders of the tribe are
women-their hearts grow white. Our old women
would laugh at the old men, whose eyes are unclosed,
but that their hearts tremble as they think of the
strong hand of the Umburghi. Hark! the young
women of Kafirland, the daughters of Congo, call to
us in our sleep. Answer them, and let the war-cry
be echoed back from the Kei to the Amatolas. Let
Gaika know that we are men. Then shall he be
ashamed—then shall he uncover his face, and turn it
towards
us, and we shall have light.”
The Kafir girls, armed with assegais, and ranged in
a double semicircle behind the councillors, responded
to this appeal with a shrill chorus, their weapons
rattling like the leaves of a forest in a gale of wind.
Amani ceased speaking, but they took up the strain.
“ Busa Abantu u ba hlanganise" - Sound the
alarm! gather the people together,”-they chanted
over and over again in a tone of triumph and defiance.
“Uya biswa go yithlo”—“You are called by your
father."
“ You are called, you are called," was repeated
many times, till the young hunters paused on the
hill paths, and, looking down, waved their muskets,
for most of them were thus armed. Some threw
their assegais and knob kierries into the air, and cried,
• Izapa, izapa”
“ Come on!” Six or seven women, the
mothers of the kraal, stood round a skin stretched
on sticks to the tightness of a drum; this they began
to beat, now loud, now low, now in slow time, and

now in quick, accompanying the measure with their
feet, and repeating the cry, “Sound the alarm”-
“Silathtekile”_"We are lost!”—the strange chorus
rising, swelling, dying away into a cry of wailing and
despair, and again filling the amphitheatre as it was
taken up by the whole population of the valley.
Suddenly some of the newly-elected young war-
riors, twenty in number, stalked from a hut set a
little apart from the others of the kraal, and Lee was
thoroughly startled by their appearance. Whitened
from head to foot with a preparation of ashes and
chalk, their ghastly hue contrasted in a most extra-
ordinary manner with the dusky colour of the rest of
the tribe, some of whom drew as near as custom per-
mitted, and united in a shout of welcome.
The faces of the youths were almost concealed by
a thatched head-dress of reeds, surmounted by two
tall and slender leaves of the palmeet plant; round
their waists, and depending to their knees, were kilts
of the same texture as the head-gear; brass bangles
shone upon their arms and ancles, marking the ex.
quisite contour of their limbs; and, shaking a reed
in his hand, for as yet they were not permitted to
wield the assegai, a youth advanced in pantomimic
fashion. At one moment he would spring forward
with a bound like a tiger's, the next he would glide
onward as a bird skims the surface of the earth;
then rising suddenly, he would execute a pirouette in
a style that would establish the fame of an opera
dancer. Anon he would balance himself on tiptoe
like a Mercury, then wheeling round, and again
springing into the air, would come down with an
aplomb that stirred the spectators to loud ap-
plause, the men crying “ It is good,” the old women
drumming loud and sharp in the back-ground, the
younger ones advancing, retreating, and chanting
shrilly to their accompaniment of rattling assegais ;
the spectators in the distance adding their meed of
admiration, their cries of applause and encourage-

ment echoing along the hills, and dying on the air, till
taken up and repeated by the herdsmen in the
valleys.
Umlala had been too much excited to hold a
parley even on the important question of gunpowder
traffic.
The chief and his councillors ceased to speak.
Doda led the white men away, Amayeka following at
a distance. A hut was set apart for their accommoda-
tion, and a huge steak, cut from an ox slaughtered in
honour of the young warriors' installation, was sent
to them by Umlala, together with some baskets of
sour milk, and a good store of Indian corn. The
bearer closed his message with the usual demand of
baseila, which Lee answered with an English oath,
and Gray responded to by sending the chief some
tobacco.
As the night fell, the dark but shapely arm of
Amayeka pushed aside the wicker door of the hut,
and set within it a small English saucepan containing
some fresh eggs, a little pipkin of clear water, a few
grains of salt-a great prize--and a cake made of
coarsely-ground flour. Gray would have followed her
to offer her thanks, but Lee restrained him at the
door-way.
Ere closing it for the night, they looked out.
The hills were silent, but, between the summits and
the sky, a scout at times appeared, moving here and
there in communication with others. The watch-fires
began to glimmer, the cattle were settling in the
kraals for the night, but the hamlet was still astir, and
the dull beating of the great primitive drum went on.
The stars came out, the Southern Cross shed its light
upon the wild scene, and the young warriors still
kept up their ghost-like dance upon the dewy turf,
one party relieving the other, as did the singing-girls
and elder women.
Long after the fire in the centre of the convicts'
hut had been extinguished, did both the inmates,

stretched on karosses, try to collect their somewhat
scattered senses together. Still the weary drum beat
on-still the shrill chorus rose and fell upon the clear
night wind, and at times the shout of some excited
dancer pierced the air. Lee, in wish, sent them to
the infernal regions -- whence, indeed, a stranger
might infer they came—and tried to frame plans con-
nected with the insurgent operations of the Dutch.
Gray strove to pray, but knew not how
poor
wretch!
“Ah," thought he, with a heavy sigh, “would I
were once more a soldier, and an honest man!"
And with this vain wish he fell asleep, and dreamed
he was a little child again, kneeling on the hearth
beside his mother, and repeating to her the simple
prayer
she used to teach him at eventide.

CHAPTER VI.
THE KAFIR SPY.
WE left Frankfort and Ormsby with their cavalcade
of wagons, horses, and attendants, pursuing their way
to the north-east.
I have no intention of giving you a detailed ac-
count of this part of their expedition, since they are
not presented to the reader in the character of mere
sportsmen-indeed such narratives belong to more
experienced hands than mine, albeit, ere their able
works appeared, I had collected a few anecdotes, which
would now present no novelty.
May, the bushman guide, still headed the caval-
cade, a unique advance-guard, closely followed by two
or three of the queerest-looking mongrels possible, of
which his favourite was a species of water-spaniel.
A fine bloodhound kept close to Ormsby's horse's
heels, never condescending to join May and his
scratch-pack, and scorning all offers from the bush-
man's cuisine; the only symptom of toleration of
inferior caste shown by the aristocratic dog was a pas-
sive endurance of the infant Ellen's caresses, when
she crawled through the grass to Major Frank-
fort's tent, into which the yellow face of the little imp
no sooner peered, than she was snatched up by her
father, and carried back to Fitje with a gentle re-
buke. “ The sir was kind,” May said, “and he would
not have him imposed upon.'
In many ways this stunted creature of the wilder-
ness displayed a refinement of feeling not always met
with among worldly beings, jealous of infringing on

the conventionalism of society-people who meet you
with

97
and measure their civilities by the length of your
purse, or your position in fashionable life.
And are these less treacherous than the savage ?
Verily, I believe that, in spirit, they are just as de-
ceitful.
But let us leave them, and return to our party.
There they go up the hill- May in advance with Spry
and Punch, and Floss. The sun is blazing out, and
our bushman winds his bright-coloured douk round
his head, and tramps round the angle of a jutting
rock, staff in hand. Before he does so, he looks back
to see how the cavalcade gets on, lights his pipe, and
alternately smoking, and singing, and whistling to his
dogs, he proceeds leisurely along: At last, even he,
of the active limbs and bronzed skin, begins to pant-
his shadow shows like a frog beneath his feet; tired as
he is, he laughs at it, spreads out his hands, whistles
an opera air he has picked up from some military
band, and capers in the glowing light, till wearied,
he sits down on a block of granite, beneath a stunted
bush, unslings his three-string fiddle from his neck,
and plays with great skill, considering the means at
hand, the rattling, saucy air of “Rory O'More.”
And he was at it right merrily, when the first wagon,
with its oxen smoking and breathing heavily, reached
the spot he had chosen as the outspan, where a more
solid breakfast was to be prepared than the one that
had been bastily snatched at dawn.
The country, although only about nine miles distant
from the picturesque locality on which our party had
rested during the night, was now of a totally different
character; great plains, only relieved here and there
by low bush, or huge masses of stone, stretched out
for miles before the traveller's eye, and the noble
natural parks through which they had journeyed the

preceding day were hidden from their view by the undu-
lations they had traversed. In the distance, between
the arid earth and the glowing sky, at the edge of the
horizon, stalked a company of ostriches, apparently
the only tenants of this great solitude.
There was something very grand, and even affecting,
in the contemplation of such a scene; at least, so
thought Frankfort, whose heart expanded under the
impression produced by Nature in her state of lonely
majesty. Here she was not lovely, but sublime; the
infinity of space, the shadowless land, the unclouded
sky-too dazzling for mortal eye to dwell upon-the
awful silence, all seemed more fully to betoken the
eternal presence of God, than in green places where
shelter was at hand, and where, therefore, the solitude
was not so apparent, so vast. The very cries of wild
beasts give life to the jungle-but here the uman
voice broke abruptly on the stillness of the plains, as if
it had no business there, and Frankfort was thoroughly
disenchanted of his sublime mood in contemplating the
almost awful expanse, as May scraped his fiddle ere
he laid it down to attend to Ormsby's inquiry as to
6 where his cigars had been packed.”
It must be owned, that Ormsby had no taste for the
sublime or the romantic; indeed, there are not many
men in the world who would have found food for con-
templation in the desert scene before them; and as
for our young sub, I am forced to admit, that by the
time he had smoked three cigars, he began to wonder
what he should do with himself when breakfast was
over.
Frankfort had stocked the
wagon
with
many more
luxuries on Ormsby's account, than he would have
thought of providing for himself; and the meal, spread
out on the shady side of the wagon, was by no
means despicable. Excellent tea, devilled biscuits,
cold tongue and honey, an offering from Vanbloem,
and added to these were savoury slices of porcupines,
a viand from which, in its raw state, Ormsby had

turned away in disgust, but to which, when cooked,
he addressed himself with a keen relish.
The panting oxen had been turned loose to seek
what provender they could among the tufts of grass
on the sandy plain — the sun shone upon a vley
(pool), about a hundred yards from the outspan ; the
place had been selected by May, because he knew
there was no better bivouac for miles in advance.
Like many other bright things, the pool shone with
a delusive lustre; it offered but a muddy draught to
the thirsty traveller-but drivers, foreloupers (leaders
of the draught cattle), guides and oxen, plunged
therein their parched lips, and drank thankfully of the
slimy waters.
“ There is certainly nothing like judging of things by
comparison," observed Frankfort, as, after a thorough
enjoyment of his breakfast, he laid his head on his
saddle under a stunted bush, and, taking out a book,
prepared to indulge himself, as he called it, till it was
time to assist May in re-packing and preparing for
advancing
May trudged on with the dogs, and halted again in
due time, in a similar locality, where the solace Ormsby
sought was another meal, combining dinner and
supper. An omelette from the egg of an ostrich,
whose nest had been raked out of the sand by the
keen and persevering May, was not a bad wind-up to
a refection of game; a cigar and coffee followed,
and while the ostriches were still stalking in the light,
the wearied party were glad to make ready for the
night, and lay their limbs at rest.
For two succeeding days nothing occurred to dis-
tinguish the one from the other; there were the same
arid tracts, the same glaring bivouacs, the chilly mid-
nights and dewy dawns—the same porcupine break-
fasts, venison dinners, and omelette remove.
On the third day they found themselves on the
borders of a river, rapid and circuitous in its course,
and fringed with bush, and here Ormsby, in a fit of

103
ennui, determined that May should get up a regular
porcupine hunt by moonlight-midnight was the
time
chosen.
Their tents were pitched on the river side in expec-
tation of remaining there some days, for, calm as
looked the current, May, from certain indications,
expected it to rise and swell beyond its bounds.
Besides, here was shelter and pasturage for the tired
cattle.
“So much for things by comparison again," said
Frankfort, as he sat down under a fine willow.
“ Those i who sleep in well-curtained beds this night
will hardly enjoy their rest as we shall do for the next
three hours.”
Ormsby's thoughts had been floating about in the
clouds of his cigar, the fifteenth since the morning;
but as he cast the remainder of it from his lips, he said,
“Ah, all this may be very fine and sublime, as you
call it; but, for my part, I wish I were going to take
my rest in the orange-room at Ormsby Park."
The contrast of the orange-room at Ormsby Park
with the willow drapery, the starry roof, and the silver
moon walking demurely in the sky, at once dragged
Major Frankfort from the sublime to the ridiculous,
and he burst out laughing; but his mirth was checked
by Ormsby whispering, “ Hush, there is some one in
the bush near us; I heard a branch crack—it can be
none of our own people—they are all sitting together
over the fire, listening to that three-stringed lute of
May's."
“Hush, there it is again !-some restless baboon,
probably,” remarked Ormsby.
“No, the bush here is not thick enough for them."
At this instant, May came from the fireside circle.
The night was so clear that he recommended attack-
ing the porcupine in his haunt at once, and sleeping
after the sport. On being told that some one was
hovering about, he laid his ear to the ground, but
could detect nothing. Ormsby reminded him that he

JASPER LYLE :
had been under the impression, ever since they left
the Dutchman's valley, that some one was hovering
about. Had Frankfort stated this opinion, May would
have put some faith in it; but he did not like Ormsby.
The latter was perpetually scolding and ridiculing the
poor little bushman; and so, as the idea of the stealthy
risitant originated with the young subaltern, May
chose to ignore it; but he determined, nevertheless,
on keeping a sharp look-out, and was as much puzzled
as his masters as to who the
spy
could be.
They were a tolerably large party; and, knowing
the character of the locality, and the tribes near it, he
felt sure that the enemy, if enemy it was, mustered in
no force: so they set out on the porcupine hunt.
The bushman had already tracked out his victim for
the sport. The poor little creature had set the dogs at
defiance on being first discovered, and kept them at bay
till it managed to retreat to its hole. So there he was,
poor fellow, with his ears, almost like a man's, stretched
wide open, listening for his expected besiegers ; for,
once disturbed, he was thoroughly uneasy, and all his
quills, though lying close to his body, were ready to
shoot out into a panoply for his defence when his
castle should be attacked.
May tried to get a peep at him in his hole, but he
could only hear him panting ; so he fastened the bayo-
net, with which he had taken care to provide himself,
to the long bamboo of old Piet's wagon whip. It was
very sharp at the point; our bushman had taken care
to cleanse it from the rust it had imbibed in the damp
ground, in which Ormsby had occasionally planted it
as a candlestick by his bedside. Armed with this
weapon, and followed closely by the dogs, whom he
encouraged and exhorted in the queerest jargon that
can be imagined, Frankfort and Ormsby carrying
sticks, he led the way along the banks of the river,
and soon reached the hiding-place of the poor little
beast. The dogs gave tongue at once. May, as I

said, tried to get a peep at him, but he could only hear
him panting
Floss soon got pricked in the nose, and retreated-
only, however, to return to the charge, and scratch
and yelp in vain. Spry and Punch kept steady sen-
try, warily taking their opportunities of making an
entrance. At last the earth gave way, and the “
beastie” emerged from his den, with all his darts pre-
pared for the charge. His mouth was but a mockery;
he could not bite; so he turned his back again upon
the foe, and as they approached, opened out the wea-
pons that nature had given him to save himself. These
Ormsby believed would be shot out like arrows; but,
as May said, the schelm (rogue) was too slim (know-
ing) to part with his arms entirely, adding, that “Eng-
lish man" was “ too fond of making stories, and," with
a sly smile, “ too ready to believe them.”
The creature, however, made his backward charge,
again and again rolled himself into a ball, with all his
quills“ on end,” and after gaining strength for an-
other battle, fought his foes gallantly, till May, fear-
ing the dogs would make a meal of him, drove his
bayonet into the soft part of his body, and laid him
the threshold of his home.
Ormsby was delighted with the novelty of the por-
cupine hunt on the edge of that winding river, its
waters flashing in the moonlight, and clamouring
along between the stones, or gurgling in little creeks
of
mossy
rock. Here a bank stretched out into the
stream, with a group of willows hanging their tresses
over their own inverted shadows; there the
grey
cliffs
were broadly reflected in the waters, and the frogs
kept up a perpetual though most unmusical chorus
from the pools in the drift. Up the stream the murmur
was beginning to increase to a roar; and, in some dread
of the torrent suddenly swelling, May scrambled up the
bank, and shortened the way to the bivouac, where the
wagons were drawn up in great precision, and where
dead upon

all were sound asleep save Marmion, who“ bayed the
moon" loudly at the approach of his master.
Ormsby, in horror of “ creeping things,” had latterly
taken it into his head to sleep in the wagon, instead
of sharing the tent with Frankfort ; and, still con-
vinced that some one was hanging about the neigh-
bourhood, he determined to keep watch till dawn; but
fatigued by his midnight sport, he was soon overcome
with drowsiness, and the bright African sun was shin-
ing on his face, and May laughing quietly over him,
as he woke with a start, and seizing the bushman's
hand, examined it intently, to May's great amuse-
ment. Frankfort, too, was looking in upon him, and
Marmion, with his fore paws on his master's chest,
had his great eyes fixed upon him lovingly.
“I have had the oddest dream,” said Ormsby. “I
felt, as I fancied, a hand clutch mine: I grasped it
tightly; and when I thought I had got it quite safe, I
found the arm was gone, and only the hand, hard and
cold, was left in mine."
“ And here it is, I suppose," said Frankfort,
laughing, and taking up the six-barrelled pistol, which
Ormsby always placed beside him when lying down at
night.
May shook his head very solemnly, and then begged
the “Masters” to follow him, and he would show
them who had lifted the pistol.
The bushman led them through a mass of tangled
underwood, to a copse all interlaced with wreaths of
starry jessamine and wild convolvulus, and softly put-
ting aside a geranium-bush, entered the covert, fol-
lowed by the others.
Bending low, and creeping after him, they found
themselves soon in the centre of the thicket, surprised
to see scattered about fragments of bread and meat,
and some broken bottles ; in short, these were the
débris of a meal eaten on the spot.
Lifting up a bough, May showed them a young Kafir
stretched on the grass, and wrapped in profound re-

pose; near him were three assegais. He lay with his
head supported by his dusky arm, his dark and finely-
moulded limbs offering a study for the sculptor.
But the frame looked worn, and his hair, long nega
lected, was of its natural hue, instead of a dull red,
from the clay usually employed in adorning it.
Frankfort and Ormsby did not at once recognize
the young Kafir servant, Zoonah, whom they had
seen at the Dutchman's farm; but May informed
them who the sleeper was.
Frankfort, surprised at the bushman's want of
caution, placed his forefinger on his lips to enjoin
silence.
May pointed to an empty bottle near the Kafir,
and, taking it up, turned it upside down with a know-
ing wink, as he proved that it was empty.
“But," said "Ormsby, “when the rascal wakes he
will be off; and, as he has been lurking about for no
good, we had better secure him; he would soon out-
run the dogs. Some fellows would shoot him, and
serve him right; he would murder us if he dare.'
“No, master, no," replied May; "a Kafir won't
kill you to get nothing by you; he would, if he could,
sell your skin; but he don't want to make a row for
nothing; it's all different when his blood is up. The
dog has been hanging about our spoor (track) ready to
steal all he can get, and he's making his way
to his
own people to tell them, perhaps, that there ain't red
men enough in the country to keep it. Master
Ormsby said this himself to Vanbloem, and I heard
this fellow tell the other Kafir, who does not under-

“ By George !" exclaimed Ormsby, “ who would
have thought the rascal was 'so wide awake;' but
will his people believe him ?”
“He's been sent into the country,” said May,
as a spy, to take service, and find out all he can by
lurking about the towns, and picking up news at
canteens or shop-doors; and then he has come to the

farm to keep his eye upon the cattle, and listen to
every word that passes between the farmers and mis-
sionaries and travellers. His people will believe him
fast enough, for they've been making ready for war
these six months. Vanbloem's Hottentots told me
they had lost cattle lately, but could not account
for it. This vagabond has been at the bottom of it,
depend upon it.”
And May contemplated the sleeper as he would
a mischievous animal; shaking his fist and making
hideous grimaces over him.
“He will be up and at you, you little fool,” whis-
pered Frankfort, surprised at the death-like repose
of the Kafir, who scarcely seemed to breathe.
“He can't rise, master,” replied May, with a low
laugh; “ first of all, he's drunk, for I left some
brandy in the bottle I pretended to throw away; and
next, see the snake-bite in his leg: 'No need to tie
him up,' said I, when I saw that. Ah, the schelm!
here's the top joint of his finger chopped off–he
belongs to some of old Mawani's people. Mawani
wouldn't let the Gaika Nazelu marry his daughter, so
Nazelu attacked his kraal ten years ago, and marked
all the boys this way, after killing the men, or cutting
off their ears and hands.”
Frankfort and Ormsby shuddered as they disco--
vered the snake bite in the bend of Zoonah's knee,
who, all unconscious and stupified, still slept on, in
spite of May's chattering and caperings round him.
Ormsby drew back with a start as the bushman
lifted the reptile, which he had discovered, with its
back broken, but with some remains of life, for it
reared itself
up,
and fixed its filmy eyes on the young
officer's face; but Frankfort stepped briskly forward,
and crushed its head.
Instinct roused the Kafir from his heavy slumber
as May waved his assegai over him; but stupified,
and sensible only of intense pain, he sunk back with
a sullen air, keeping, however, a steady gaze on May.

“Poor wretch !” said Frankfort," he may die; he
must not, if we can help him. I have a mixture for
the cure of snake bites; May, fetch it from the
medicine-chest in my wagon.”
May took the proffered key, from which he elicited
a shrill whistle ere he went in search of an elixir, in
which, however, he put less faith than in one of
Fitje's coctions of herbs, which she had begun to pre-
pare as soon as she, good-hearted little woman, heard
that the young Kafir had been wounded by the rep-
tile. Plenty of healing roots and herbs grew about
the spot-for God often plants the antidote where
snakes most abound—and very soon the little man
and his wife were at their task of humanity in dress-
ing Zoonah's wound; May, while so employed,
bestowing on his patient a variety of epithets in the
Hottentot, Dutch, English, and Kafir languages.
The savage understood the reality of kindness,
though it was not in his nature to trace its motives,
or respond to its sympathies by gratitude. A sullen
gloom was on his countenance at having been caught
thus, like a wild beast, in the hunters' toils, but he
submitted to the surgery; and, the tumour being
dressed, raised himself against the trunk of a tree,
and stared from one to the other of the group
before
him.
May,” said Ormsby, who held a cigar in his
hand, so what has made the rascal follow us ?-ask
him.'
Zoonah, who understood English, as May well
knew, cast his eyes upon the turf, and waited for the
bushman's translation of the question.
After duly considering the answer he should give,
and accepting the cigar, he answered in his own lan-
guage
“Zoonah is the white man's dog, and likes to
journey in the same path."
To which assertion May added in English, “he

upon a liar.
“ Ask him,” said Frankfort, “why he followed
stealthily.”
“Because I was alone, and thought the Hottentots
would kill me," said Zoonah.
“ He lies," added May.
Where are you going ?”
“ To my people I left my heart in the bush”.
meaning his wife.
“ Why did you leave Vanbloem ?"
“He sent me away.”
Why did you try to steal arms from the master's
“I do not understand you."
Zoonah's stolid air convinced Frankfort, too, that
it was of no use to question him. It was evident
that May was right-he was a spy on his way
to his
own chief's kraal, and, as the bushman observed, it
was useless to waste words
“He's born liar—he'll die liar; he's born black-
guard, and he'll die blackguard."
And, with this last truly English vituperative,
May left the thicket, and went to
prepare
his master's
breakfast.
He had tied up the dogs and kept watch himself all
night, lying in the long grass between Frankfort's
tent and Ormsby's wagon, and had seen Zoonah, just
as the moon was waning, winding himself along in
snake fashion, till he reached the young officer's sleep-
ing-place, in which he was wont to spend part of the
day, reading and smoking, with “pistol, sword, and
carbine," slung above him.
Doubtless, Zoonah had long had his attention fixed
on these particular objects, and allowing the caval-
cade to
pass
the open plains, had come up
with it as
soon as it was fairly bivouacked in the embowered
nook selected by May. Here he awaited his oppor-
tunity to plunder.
But Kafirs have a dread of what they cannot see-
a house, a tent, or a wagon, may always, they believe,

contain some mysterious agency of evil, and hence,
on Ormsby's instinctively clutching the pistol, the
Kafir dropped it in terror, which was increased by a
movement of May's. The wily bushman, though,
had no mind to throw the Kafir off his guard ; the
roar of the river proved that it was impassable; in the
rear were the inhospitable plains of sand, the Kafir
must ere this have exhausted such provision as he
could have carried from Vanbloem's, and would there-
fore not go far; and, in a word, May resolved not to
alarm the little camp until obliged to do so.
The result was, that Zoonah traced his way to the
thicket where the bushman had left a decoy, in the
shape of scattered bread and meat, and an apparently
empty bottle.
"I watched that bush yesterday evening," said May,
when explaining his devices to Frankfort; "for though
I laughed at Master Ormsby, it's always right to be
primed and loaded.' Well, I watched that bush
closely, because, whenever the birds lighted on it,
they flew away and would not stop a minute. Some
came there to roost in their nests—but no, off they
went, came back again, and then away— Ah!' says
May, some one spenning (lurking, hiding) there, I
know;' so I was glad to see Master Ormsby tie Mar-
mion to his wagon, while we were hunting the porcupine,
and I told old Piet to lie between that and the tent,
where I made a good fire. This schelm little thought
we went off so far; but I gave Fitje the long pistol ready
loaded, and told her to fire it, if she was frightened
but she was not," added May quietly, "and lay down
as soon as she heard the dogs coming home with us.
I tied them up as soon as I had fed them, and so now,
if the sir pleases, I'll reim the prisoner."
“ Reim the prisoner ?” said Ormsby; “what does he
mean ?"
" Tie him to the wagon wheel, master,” answered
May, “and keep him there, till we can get rid of him
handsomely."

JASPER LYLE:
soon
Probably, May's ideas about getting handsomely
rid of Zoonah were rather vague; at any rate, he had
no idea of trusting him in the smallest degree, and he
was greatly astonished when Frankfort observed,
“Nay, nay, we won't bind him; he looks half-starved,
poor wretch; we may make him earn his living by
being useful—it is no business of ours if he chooses
to leave Vanbloem, we cannot send him back-he is
but a savage, and we must be kind to him.”
“Right, master,” replied May, after grave consider-
ation ; “but he's a thief, as well as a liar, so take care."
So saying, they left Zoonah in the leafy covert.
May put no trust in Zoonah, and such was Fitje's
dread of him, that she would not lie down to rest,
unless her husband laid his gun beside him.
The sportsmen decided on crossing the river as
as it was fordable ; and Zoonah, rejoicing in
contributions of tobacco, cigars, and provisions, was
happy, after Kafir fashion, lying on the soft turf, and
contemplating, with a longing eye, the cattle he pro-
fessed to guard, but hoped to steal from the men who
had saved his life, and now fed him, and treated him
with kindness.
Although May heartily despised Zoonah, he was
always in good humour with him ; for there is nothing
in nature more cheery and good-humoured, though
hot-tempered and keenly alive to injury, than a bush-
man, caught young, and tamed and educated by real
Christian people.
Three or four evenings after the incident described,
as Frankfort and Ormsby sat by the river, after the
last meal of the day, anxiously comparing the depth
of water with a certain mark they had drawn on a
jutting rock, their attention was diverted by an earnest
" talk” going on between May and Zoonah.
The latter was deriding May's idea of Umtiko (God).
Zoonah, finding disguise was useless, now conversed
in excellent English. May's suppositions were right.
He had been educated at Shiloh ; but the care bestowed

on a Kafir seldom answers the humane purpose in-
tended. Savage he is, and savage he will be, unless,
indeed, the age of miracles is not past and gone.
“ You
say that Umtiko is good," said Zoonah ; “ how
do
you
know it?"
May pointed out the benefits we derive from God.
“How do you know they come from him ? Did you
ever see him "
“ He is invisible.”
“ If he is so good and so glorious, why does he not
show himself ? The teachers are always telling us
about God; but first, a Kafir never believes what he
does not see, and next, the teachers say that all men
are liars ; how, then, can they expect us to believe
then?"
“ But the teachers do not tell you this without
proof."
“Where is the proof?”
“In the beautiful world, where all things are given
for our good, and where the wicked are unhappy.
“Who do you call wicked ?”
“Those who commit sin," replied May.
“Sin!” said Zoonah, after examining the ground,
-“ sin means pleasing one's self.”
Before May could answer, Zoonah went on:
cannot believe in the existence of what you cannot
" You do not see the wind," interposed May.
Zoonah went on in his own language, May translating
sentence by sentence.
“ You cannot take the word of one man, whom you
have never seen nor heard," answered the cunning
Kafir, "against the wishes of all men. The invisible
God you talk of says, 'Obey me, and do nothing that
pleases yourself. The visible man says, 'Enjoy earth,
and all that belongs to it, and be happy.' On one
side is a chance of another world if we punish our-
selves in this; on the other is pleasure, ease, and our
own will, under laws made for man by man. You

JASPER LYLE:
English have a woman chief; even she never sees the
God you speak of. You know not even whether he
is black or white."
At this point, Ormsby, who had drawn near, burst
into a thoughtless and irreverent laugh, and Zoonah,
at this, satisfied that he had the best of the
argu-
ment, rose, and wrapping his kaross around him,
ascended the bank, and followed the cattle to the
outspan.
The east was faintly streaked with a crimson line
next day, when May came to rouse the sleeping
Ormsby, and call him to an early breakfast, which he
had prepared, that the sportsmen might cross the
river, which at last was fordable for men and horses,
although the depth of mud in its bed rendered it im-
passable for wagons. It was possible to carry over
such provisions as would last them till they reached
the Orange River, where final arrangements would be
made for treking at once into the depths of the long-
desired hunting-grounds.
The idea of change pleased Ormsby, and he readily
assisted in the necessary preparations. With his
usual want of foresight and discretion, he had begun
to make a pet of Zoonah; and, forgetting how depen-
dent he and Frankfort were on the integrity and
sagacity of May, amused himself with the idea that
the latter was jealous ; but the kind-hearted bushman
was utterly unconscious of this, and worked away with
his usual aptitude and good humour, keeping, too, a
close eye on Zoonah's movements when the cattle came
in at sunset.
And now, to Frankfort's surprise, May permitted
the Kafir to assist him in making up sundry packages
for the trek over the river, soon to be carried on their
own heads as they swam the stream; for May was ever
humane, and strove to lighten the weights on the pack-
horses.
Two leather bags were soon filled. Zoonah's dark
eyes glistened at the goodly store scattered about the

115
ground,-canisters of powder, a pocket looking-glass,
bundles of cigars, and manifold articles delightful to
a Kafir's sight; he gladly helped in the task of tying
up the bags, and after adjusting one on May's head,
and lifting one to his own, he proceeded with the
bushman to the edge of the stream. The rest of the
cavalcade were to cross the river whenever they could
do so with safety ; and Frankfort, ascertaining that all
was ready, took his horse well in hand, and plunged
into the clear and rapid current, Ormsby following.
By Frankfort's desire, May was to attend as guide
and groom, and on second thoughts, he consented to
let Zoonah follow, deeming it unwise to leave him with
the cattle.
Both sportsmen's horses breasted the torrent gal-
lantly. Ormsby, despising May's injunctions, had
nearly floundered in a sea-cow's hole ; but the oppo-
site bank was safely reached, and both gentlemen, dis-
mounting to rest their panting steeds, sat down to
watch the transit of May, Zoonah, and the dogs.
The bushman and Kafir, side by side, were already
midway between the banks, and, in thorough good-
fellowship, exhibited their skill and daring in buffeting
the element through which the horses had passed with
less ease.
Frankfort watched the race for such it seemed-
with some anxiety, for it called forth equal strength
and courage on the part of both the swimmers. Ormsby
laughed heartily at the “ dodges" each took to cir-
cumvent the other, when suddenly, as if caught by
the current, Zoonah was whirled round and round,
sunk, rose again, keeping his burden safe supported
by one hand, and in another moment struck boldly
out with the right arm and vanished, to the horror of
Frankfort, who gave him up for lost, and the dismay
of Ormsby, who had seen Zoonah pack many
articles
of which he stood in need.
May swam gravely on, paying little heed, beyond a
grin, at Zoonah's disappearance; and even Frankfort

reproached him severely for triumphing, as he believed,
in his own sagacity, at Ormsby's expense.
"I told the sir," said the bushman, when he
recovered breath on landing, “that Zoonah was thief
as well as liar, but Master Ormsby only laughed.”
“You should not have intrusted him with a pack-
age of such value to us just now,” said Frankfort.
I obey Master Ormsby," answered May, beginning
to shiver.
“Go and get some dry clothing on you,” said Frank-
fort; and May rose to do as he was bid, first-laying
the package, untouched by wet, at Ormsby's feet.
The latter kicked it from him with an oath.
" It is all right, sir,” said the bushman, patiently
lifting it up again; "all your powder and other things
quite safe." I let Zoonah pack 'em up, but changed
the bags, while Fitje gave him his sopie; he's got a
lot of rubbish packed up in the other. I thought it
best to let him go. I knew he would, as soon as he
thought he had got something worth taking. Ah!
the schelm, he'll swim for the next hour. I should
like to see him open his prize;" and Frankfort and
Ormsby laughed as heartily as May himself.

lers far from the settlements of the English coloniste,

ing to our sportsmen, to whom the scene was as new
as agreeable
The Orange River forded, our sportsmen at length
looked down upon the “happy hunting-grounds."
But it was not now as in the time when Mr. Trail
rescued May from the dwellings in the rocks.
As the white man's foot-prints had advanced, the
game had retreated to the deeper solitudes of the
wilderness. Herds of gnoos and bucks occasionally
swept across the plains, and May pointed out a drift
where lions sometimes came down to drink ; but
there were no companies of these kings of the de-
sert-no sentinel giraffes-no midnight echoes from
the trumpet-signal of wandering elephants.
It was a grand panorama, and as, while May off-
saddled, our sportsmen cast themselves on the grass of
a natural platform overhanging the scene, a fine buck
started out of a bush, and passed them by with head
erect, eyeballs strained, and limbs quivering with terror
and dismay. The rifles of both sportsmen were
brought to the shoulder at one instant, and in another,
the beautiful animal was stretched upon the turf,
dying the plants, which enamelled it, in blood.
The horses secured, away went May-greedy fel-
low-to kindle a fire; Frankfort and Ormsby took out
their couteaux de chasse, and the former, ere he drew
his blade across the neck of the creature, paused
with some compunction at having killed his game
with so little credit to himself as a sportsman, two
rifle-balls having lodged in the head of the buck when
only a few feet from his destroyers.
He paused, I say, and, casting his eyes upon the
valley, drew Ormsby's attention to various species of
smaller game, which, roused from their coverts by the
crack of the rifles, were speeding in hot haste across
the plain; gnoos, zebras, and bucks of manifold kind,
all at once gave life to the green valley far below the

travellers' reach ; and Frankfort had scarcely had time
to point them out, when a noble lion, with eyeballs of
flame and mane erect, sprung at a single bound from
his covert in the cliff above, and, in silent majesty,
placed his huge paw upon the neck of the slaugh-
tered deer, his gleaming orbs fixed in steady gaze on
the astonished countenance of Frankfort.
He uttered no sound—the lashing of his tail against
his sides was the only proof this magnificent lord of
the manor gave of his displeasure at the intrusion of
poachers on his territory. His frown was terrific,
and said plainly, “ This is my property by royal right,
and here I stand to defend it."
How long this scene lasted was never computed by
the sportsmen--Frankfort always admitted that they
left the lion master of the field, and declared that
Ormsby was as ready as he to dive into a bush and
climb a path they would not have attempted “under
ordinary circumstances.”
Not long after this adventure their plans and pro-
spects assumed a totally different aspect to what they
had anticipated; a simple incident proved the straw
that turned the balance, and caused them to turn
their backs upon an expedition to which one, at least,
had looked forward with the prospect of a year's
sport and travel.
At dawn, one roseate morning, a yell from the dogs
awoke May in time to discover a poor little porcupine
scuffling back to his hole. Up jumped Ormsby, who
would not wait for May's attack with a short assegai,
which he had at hand; lifting his foot, he laid the
quarry sprawling on the ground, but not before the
animal had driven one of his natural weapons into
the thoughtless young man's foot; darting the quill,
sharp as a needle, with all his force, the creature left
it two inches deep in the instep, and would have re-
turned to the attack, but that May, with a stirrup-
leather, laid the enemy dead.
Ormsby sat down upon a block of granite, in great

agony, and the bushman, after a deliberate survey of
the jeopardized limb, remarking, with a gravity that
startled even Frankfort, that “the sir must lose either
his leg or his boot,” opened his clasp knife, and
skilfully and deliberately cut the boot open, then ap-
plying his fine but useful teeth to the quill, he tugged
at it bravely, and drew it out with a jerk. A clear jet
of blood bubbled up from the wound, and Ormsby
fainted with the pain.
The inflammation which followed was so great as to
preclude the possibility of riding far, and as, fortu-
nately, the wagons were only five miles in the rear,
Frankfort deemed it wisest to return to them at once,
as he well knew Piet would not move in haste.
Everything was as they had left it two days pre-
viously, although the obstinate old wagoner had been
told to follow as soon as the sore-footed oxen had
recovered, and they were now fit for their work.
There sat Fitje, stitching at her patchwork petticoat;
there lay the herd-boys beside the green-bordered
vley; and there sat old Piet, in the glow of sunlight,
smoking his pipe.

JASPER LYLE:
CHAPTER VII.
LIGHT IN THE
WILDERNESS,
ORMSBY was thoroughly discomfited by his accident,
and his impatience, and unwillingness to apply the
remedies prescribed by Fitje, duly aggravated the
inflammation: he would walk, he would bathe, and at
last was fairly laid prostrate for two or three days.
Utterly disgusted, and intensely pained by the
jolting of the wagon, he listened one morning with
complacency to May's information, that there was a
Dutchman's farm at the foot of a long, low hill in
front. The sun shone down upon the settlement, which
at that distance looked fair and pleasant; but May
said it was but a desolate place within, for the
master was heart-sore. He had lost five sons in
the last war; he had but few cattle left; and whenever
he began to till the land, he was told by his neigh-
bours—there were none within twelve miles--that it
was not safe to stay. The bushman had heard this
two months ago from the Boer self at Beaufort,
when he came there, in his perplexity, to consult his
fellow-colonists.
Frankfort immediately thought of helping this poor
man in some way, and the cavalcade directed its pro-
gress towards the farm; but on reaching it, they
found it abandoned—“Silent all and lone." The
house was empty, the doors and windows open, the
garden desolate.
Both sportsmen agreed, that if this abandonment of
the location was the result of a rumour of war,
it
high time for them to think of rejoining their regi-
was

121
ment instead of pursuing their expedition. Ormsby
would fain have had the cavalcade halt here for the
night; but May informing them that, if they would
consent to advance three miles further, they would
find a halting-place within only two hours' distance of
the settlement of Annerley, a property belonging to a
retired British officer, Frankfort decided on moving on.
The party proceeded slowly forward, the character of
the country changing at every step. The bush grew
thinner; wide undulating plains, dotted with ant-heaps,
and here and there a clump of dwarf mimosas, were
spread before the traveller's eye; and as the last rays
of light gleamed in dying glory on the waste, several
dark objects were descried moving in a body at speed.
Frankfort, by the aid of the telescope he carried,
fancied he recognized European horsemen. A slight
indentation of the ground hid them from his sight for
a minute or two, and as they reached the elevation,
the wide hat, ostrich feather, long roer (gun)-in
short, the whole guerilla air, bespoke the Dutch border
colonists of South-Eastern Africa.
At sight of the wagons, the party came galloping
down the slope, and approaching Frankfort in breath-
less haste, announced that the new British commander
of the forces, Sir John Manvers, had issued a mani-
festo desiring the chiefs of the Gaika and T'Slambie
tribes to meet him in the neighbourhood of the garri-
son of Fort Beaufort, on the Kat River, on a certain
day; that the chiefs had hesitated, asking for more
time, to consult their councillors, which time was, of
course, to be employed in making ready ; that the war-
cry had already faintly issued from the Gaikas, who
only waited for the gathering of the tribes to shout it
aloud from the Amatola mountains; and that, as soon
as the warriors could be organized, an attack would be
made upon the colonists.
This mounted troop of stout and determined
Burghers had been despatched, by the commandant of
a frontier outpost, to warn the farmers in the north-

eastern districts of their danger; and, being loyal to
the Government, were proceeding, as far as they dared,
to sound the alarm among all the landholders who
were considered to be discontented, but as yet were
not avowedly disaffected. These were expected to
join a Burgher force, ready for action, if called upon;
while the farmers near the colony were advised to put
their homesteads in a state of defence; and if this was
difficult, from want of hands, or faulty position, to
establish lagers (bivouacs), and bring their families
together, for the sake of security.
It was further stated, that the rivers were rising,
and the enemy congregating along the bush-lined
banks of the Fish River, ready to pounce on stray
cattle or hapless travellers ; the troops were mustering
in the different garrisons, the new commander-in-
chief was at Graham's Town, ships with stores and
reinforcements were daily expected at Algoa Bay, and
the greatest cause for anxiety was the uncertain state
of affairs among the Dutch beyond the Orange River.
These, it was supposed, had been fully conciliated by
the visit of the late governor, whose health had suf-
fered from his fatiguing exertions in negotiating with
the rebellious Boers in person. By these able nego-
tiations peace had been established, and redress offi-
cially promised; but, strange to say, the arrival of Sir
John Manvers had been the signal for another out-
break, and while Kafirland was up on one side of the
Orange River, the Boers were inspanning their oxen
on the other, and preparing sullenly to trek, roer in
hand, and with wives, children, and all their property
in a train, headed by one Vander Roy, a clever fellow,
and as ambitious as he was determined and persevering.
Having delivered this news, and refreshed themselves
with sopies of French brandy, the young Burghers
touched their hats, the officers bent over their horses'
neeks, and were off at a hand-gallop.
Ormsby had laid aside his novel at the approach of
the riders, and leaped out of the wagon to hear the

news. At the prospect of war he sent up his hat into
the air with a shout, and telling May to "upsaddle,"
would have mounted his horse, and insisted on at once
riding forward to Graham's Town.
He made no allowance for difficulties ; he thought
not of swelling rivers, of a lurking enemy, ready to
seize upon the horses of unprotected travellers ; he
would have taken May and one of the wagon-drivers
with him, and left Frankfort on the instant; for the
latter, though brave, was not rash, and had no idea of
such a mad project as leaving the cavalcade behind,
and starting headlong on a journey of two hundred
miles, with horses quite unfit for it. Besides, he did
not expect May to leave both wife and child to the
tender mercies of the dogged Piet; and in short, to
Ormsby's infinite disgust, he was told that haste was
out of the question: they must make what way they
could to Annerley, and there act upon the intelligence
with such means as circumstances afforded. If fresh
horses could be procured, a couple of armed guides
would be sufficient, and the cavalcade of wagons and
attendants could, for the present, remain behind;
besides which difficulties, Ormsby's foot was too much
inflamed to permit him to ride. On what small hinges
do great doors turn !
Evening fell, heavy and gloomy; the atmosphere
was loaded with an unpleasant vapour. As night
drew on, the exhalations floated above the earth in
thin white mist, and as this increased, the travellers
could scarcely see a foot in advance. The road, or
rather track, was grass-grown, the wheels sunk into
the sward, and moved noiselessly along; there was no
echo of the horses' feet upon the turf, and as if the
stillness of nature had effect upon the party, not a
word was uttered. Altogether, the vehicles, with
their white canvass coverings, the impish foreloupers,
the attendant guides, and the riders, who kept close to

encum-
the two foremost wagons for fear of losing their way,
all gliding silently through the shroud-like vapour,
inight have served as an illustration of one of the
scenes in that delicious romance of “ Undine.” They
looked as if they must vanish and melt in the snow-
white cloud, wreathing itself closer and closer round
them at every step. .
May was wide awake; his keen eyes were riveted to
the ground, watching the slight undulations made by
occasional wanderers in the wilderness, and if his eye
failed him, he knelt down, groped about the path, and
having found it, led the way beside the foremost fore-
louper. Poor, patient, honest May! how Ormsby
muttered his discontent at thee for being
bered" with thy wife and child! How unthinking
was he of thy daily aid !
The dwelling for which they were bound, and to which
May was so carefully guiding them through the mist,
along the almost trackless waste, had been and was,
for aught the bushman knew to the contrary, the resi-
dence of an Englishman, who had been an officer.
If still there, they would ascertain from him, “whose
word,” May said,“ was true," the real condition of
the country. If war had been openly proclaimed by
the English general, Frankfort admitted it would be
madness to proceed, and run the risk of being detained
upon the banks of those densely-wooded streams.
Ormsby, like all self-opinionated, inexperienced men,
would not admit the necessity of bending to cir-
cumstances; he was for advancing“ in the teeth of
the enemy. They would know better than shoot
down, like dogs, à couple of English officers. He
should like to bag a leash of Kafirs amazingly. He
should send home a skull for his oldo governor's
library. He hoped there would be war with all his
heart. He longed to knock over some of those black
tinkers."
Frankfort listened quietly, smiling inwardly at the
idea of Ormsby in the bush in the rainy season, sleep-

by the “
ing with his head in a pool of water, and breakfasting
on a hard biscuit and a cup of muddy coffee, without
milk or sugar; but he kept his communings to him-
self, and was not sorry when he saw lights twinkling
through the mist. They looked distant; he put his
horse into a canter, and in a few minutes was greeted
deep-mouthed welcome” of the dogs of the
settlement.
Presently a door opened, but the lights were with-
drawn; the butt-end of a musket rang on the stone
step, and a gentlemanly voice uttered the words “ Who
comes here?
“Friends," said Frankfort.
Friends," repeated the voice aloud; the lights
re-appeared, a group of people filled the open door-way,
and the owner of the mansion -for it was a substantial
building of stone—descended the steps, and advancing
to the gate, a Hottentot servant following with a
lantern, held out both his hands, saying, “Welcome;
excuse our caution, friends and countrymen, but it
behoves us to be wary; for although the open plains
are stretched before us, we have à suspicious kloof
to our right, and a chain of hills to our left, which
may contain some objectionable neighbours. The
mistiness of the night prevented our discovering the
character of your cavalcade, nor could we distinguish
the usual crack of wagon-whips."
And no wonder; for the driver of the foremost
vehicle was sound asleep, though sitting bolt-upright
upon his box, and to Frankfort's discomfiture, and
May's terror, Piet had not come up. May had col-
lected the whole party together at a great vley some
two miles off, and then finding that Piet would not be
foremost in the van, had moved to the front as guide.
As it was supposed, however, that he would arrive
ere long, though poor May had certain misgivings on
the subject, Frankfort and Ormsby gladly accepted
Mr. Daveney's welcome, and followed him through,
what appeared to them, a garden, for trees bent over

the pathway, and the air was burdened with per-
fume.
Ascending the steps of the house, their host stood
at the threshold, and welcomed them again, ushering
them, as he did so, into a large sitting-room, which,
though dimly lighted, was evidently furnished with
some attention to taste and comfort.
“ We are cau-
tious, you see, in the wilderness," said the host, and
ringing a small hand-bell, he bade an old Griqua, who
answered the summons, bring more light, desiring him
further to inform the ladies, that the visitors were
friends, and to “send Erasmus for the gentlemen's
saddle-bags."
Frankfort and Ormsby surveyed their host with
that interest which only travellers in the desert can
feel on opening communion with a countryman and
brother-soldier, for Mr. Daveney stood avowed “
soldier every inch of him.” The erect carriage, and
the kindly, but decided, tone of voice in which he
issued his simple orders, proclaimed his profession at
Of the middle height, of strong but slender
frame, his life had doubtless been one of activity and
observation: the high, thoughtful brow was divested
of its early curls, but the well-shaped head was still
partially adorned with crisp grey locks; the eye was
blue as heaven, and shone with an honest light; the
teeth were perfect, and of that hue indicating a sound
constitution; a grey moustache shaded the upper lip,
but, smiling as he spoke, a most agreeable impression
was conveyed by the contrast of these white and even
teeth with the sun-burnt face, marked not so much by
care, as with those lines which evince a deep sense of
man's duties to himself and others. The close ob-
server will often recognize the difference between the
restless attributes of anxiety and the calm thought-
fulness of a mind sensible of its powers and intent on
its responsibilities. He makes the discrimination
almost imperceptibly to himself, but is not the less
guided by the impulse arising from it; and thus Frank-
once.

fort took the proffered hand of his host with a feeling
of interest he seldom accorded to strangers, and re-
sponding to the light of the honest eye and hospitable
smile, said, as he lifted his hat with the grace of a soldier
and a gentleman, yet with his own frank and unaffected
manner, “We are officers of the Eighty-th regiment;
this is my friend Ormsby, and I am Captain Frankfort."
A door leading to an inner apartment opened, and
a lady, followed by the Griqua servant, bearing lights,
entered, and admitting that she had been somewhat
agitated, “not alarmed,” by the unexpected arrival of
the party, added, that supper would be served up with
as little delay as possible.
There followed soon a young lady-yes, a young
lady in the wilderness, and the stamp of a gentle-
woman was on her and on her mother. No adventi-
tious ornaments of dress, or the absence of them, can
give or take away this stamp; be it in the desert, or
the court, the English gentlewoman, in humble garb
or courtly robe, needs no herald to proclaim her
position.
Mother and daughter, in their simple costume of
sober hue, were received by our two wanderers with all
the courtesy they would have paid
“ To high-born dames in old ancestral halls.”
Ormsby was most agreeably surprised. Miss Daveney
was of a charming height, had fine hair, a gentle voice
and winning manner, with a little dash of coquetry,
which in girlhood, as the result of innocence, is so
bewitching. She admitted, that her alarm had been
great, for the news from the colony was startling; her
father, as the magistrate of the district, held a situation
of difficulty and responsibility; the Kafirs had long
been anxious for war, and within a few days, Mr.
Daveney had been informed, on good authority, that
the Dutch in the upper part of the colony would not
respond to the manifesto calling on them to assist in
the defence of the colony: “in short,” said she-

clasping her pretty hands together, in an attitude of
thankfulness, as she lifted her clear eyes, honest as
her father's, to Ormsby—“we really have been in
some perplexity, and nothing could be more opportune
than your arrival. I confess, I had some dread of
remaining in the wilderness-yet, what are we to do?
My father must not desert his post; never were visitors
more welcome.”
And Ormsby fancied—vain Ormsby!—that though
the welcome was intended for both travellers, the
smile was especially bestowed on him, and a very pi-
quant smile it was.
But, dear reader, this pretty, animated Marion
Daveney is not my heroine; she is a fair, ingenuous
creature, with sunny hair, and shining eyes, and fawn-
like step; but methinks you will be more interested
in Eleanor, who has not yet descended to meet the
guests.
Seated at the window of her little bed-room, she
had sat looking out upon the misty night, forgetting
that she was alone, and that darkness had fallen
round her. It suited the mood of her stricken heart,
veiled within the shadows that had been cast upon it,
and doomed to remain there, as it seemed to her, for
ever. Dim visions of childhood free from care, passed
bird-like among flowers and sunlight, rose at times,
and, like blue specks in a stormy sky, only made the
clouds look heavier and nearer for the contrast.
She rose, paced the chamber, reseated herself,
strove to gain courage to join the family group-for
she loved to please her father—but sunk down at the
idea of encountering strange faces.

She heard a step approaching, and, hurrying to the
window-sill, appeared to be looking out. The step was
her father's, and, recognizing that, she opened the door.
By the light he held, he looked sorrowfully at that
young pale face.
“My love," he said, "strangers have arrived, who
will probably be with us some days; do you think you
can summon resolution to come among us?”
“My dear father, I will do anything you wish,”'
said the daughter; but, as she spoke, she burst into a
passion of tears.
The father closed the door, and sat down with his
arm round his weeping child.
Her youth-she was barely twenty-her sable
garb, her beautiful hair bound simply round her head,
in token of mourning, instead of falling on her
bosom in its natural heavy ringlets-her sobs, emanat-
ing from the depths of an aching heart, presented
such a picture of desolation as would have moved a
stranger. Her father could only take her to his
breast, and clasp her there, as though he would say,
“ Lie here, my stricken one, and be at peace.”
She understood him, for she loved him, she re-
spected him, and she was anxious, as she said, to do
anything he wished. The overburdened heart gained
relief after this outburst of sorrow, and, rising, she
said
“Give me half an hour, father, and I will be with
you.
I am not selfish, as you know."
She kissed him, lit the candle on her dressing-table,
and began to make such preparations for her appear.
ance as would prevent any remarks on her agitated
face and trembling frame, except in so far as might
arise from the arrival of the strangers under circum-
stances of excitement and alarm.
Some idea of Mrs. Daveney's character in early life
may be gathered from a letter written to a friend in
England some five or six years after she had settled
with her husband at Annerley--so, from certain asso-

ciations, she had named the residence-which, once
but a mere farm, was now a capacious and picturesque
dwelling.
“You will remember," says she in this letter,
“my resolution to marry for love; you ignored my
principle of matrimonial life being all the happier for
mutual struggles, helpfulness one towards another;
you laughed at the idea of care and trouble being
stronger ties between man and wife than hours linked
with flowers. Do you remember quizzing my fanciful
notion of the evergreen cypress-wreath and the faded
rose-garland ? Nay, you often said I was too anxious
for distinction, for any kind of éclat, to marry only for
love. You know my story, my orphaned state, my

revolving and re-revolving-Dinner-parties, where the
host and hostess sat revelling, not in the society of
friends, but in the display of plate, and cookery,
and servants-Morning drives through interminable
streets, or between tali hedges, or monotonous parks
-Evening visits among crowds, where mothers came
anxious to outdo their auctioneering compeers in dis-
playing their daughters tricked out for conquest, and
where daughters vied with each other in deceiving the
world, by trying to look as if they cared nothing
about it, and where men sneered at women, and
boasted of being too knowing to be caught even with
a gilded hook. My world, I told you, should be where
self was not upon the surface, as in yours; where
Nature reigned supreme, and where earth was peo-
pled with men and women in whom thought was
brought into action by necessity.

Africa ! how you laughed at that, though in all good
humour, because you were prosperous at the time.

her husband, who had begun by being soldier, and
turned merchant in prosperous times; how pleased
were they at introducing their niece, fresh from Eng.
land, while to me, life in Southern Africa seemed
delicious after the thraldom of school in murky old
London. Bands of military music, young and gallant
gentlemen, all struggling for the ladies' favour, a horse
to ride, the prettiest that money could buy, and Captain
Daveney beside me, who would teach me. Ah, what
a day that was! I remember it well, Emily—the re-
past spread on the green sward beneath a spreading
oak; the champagne cooling in a nook, where clear
waters rippled over the stonés; conversation by the
river's side; then the saddling our steeds by the care-
ful hands of courteous cavaliers ; the canter home by
moonlight, Daveney keeping his place beside ine all
the time. We assembled at my uncle's house, and
refreshed ourselves with coffee; then we danced, rest-

then we strolled under the quince hedge in the bright
garden, and parted with smiles, gaily anticipating the

CHAPTER VIII.
THE WAR-CRY IN THE MOUNTAINS.
THE kind uncle referred to by Mrs. Daveney was
imprudent enough to speculate, and lost a large sum ;
but, wiser or better-principled than most men who
gamble, he forswore speculation for ever, and retired
to England, to live on the residue of his property. It
had been his intention to apportion his wife's niece
on winding up his affairs ; but ready money in colonial
commerce was at that time a dream, and as he had
fine available land in one of the most flourishing dis-
tricts of the colony, he proposed that Captain Daveney
should leave the army, and take possession of the land,
which was excellent. A magistracy fell vacant at this
time, and, by Mr. Morland's influence, was offered to
Daveney.
Thus the alternative was offered the soldier, of a
plentiful estate, with an excellent house, built indeed
on the ashes of a former homestead, and to be held by
force of arms, but all preferable, as it appeared to Mr.
Morland, to life with a regiment at home. The corps
was on the eve of embarkation, his wife on the eve of
her confinement, and, within a month of the offer,
Daveney had “ made his book” in his corps, and, with
a goodly stock of furniture from the kind merchant's
store, he bade adieu to his brother-officers, and treked
from the town to the wilderness.
He promised his soldier friends he would see them
all again before they marched, and so he did, but from
a distance. On the morning that the Forty-

looking the green parade-ground at Fort England. The

men were hurrying from quarters, oxen were yoking to
the baggage-wagons
men and officers were fully
accoutred—they fell into the ranks—he could see some
of them looking up the road—were they watching for
him ?_The regiment formed column, the band struck
up “The girl I left behind me," and Daveney's old
comrades turned their backs
upon
him.
He sat motionless on his horse, watching, with a
swelling heart, the long cavalcade of troops and bag-
gage. He could see it all passing through the wide
streets of the great straggling African town. People
came running from their houses, waving their hands
in token of farewell ; Daveney heard the soldiers cheer,
and then, with something more like a sob than a sigh,
he turned his horse's head homewards, led it slowly
down the steep irregular pathway, let it browse upon
the sweet green pasturage, and sat down to shed a
flood of tears,
Still he felt he had acted, as far as he could judge,
for the best. A career of trust and command was
before him. He was to think for others as well as
himself. He was in possession of house, land, and
cattle. He was to be umpire, in a large district, be-
tween the great powers of might and right. He stood
with ten talents in his hand, for which he was to be
responsible.
À certain spasm shot through his wife's heart, as
well as his own, when the old uniform was laid aside
for ever--the sword hung up, the number cut from
the forage-cap; but within her mind lay, deeper than
in his, the germ and elements of an unrecognized
ambition. Had she been born to power at home, she
would have exercised it with the same lofty bearing
with which, on one occasion, in her husband's absence
on duty, she had set her house in array to receive a
troop of savages, who had been seen stalking, brand
and assegai in hand, through the passes of the district.
The letter we have quoted
was but a girlish effusion.

Duchess, read her friend and playmate aright when,
on laying down this epistle from a soldier's wife, she
remarked to a friend who had heard its contents,
“ Africa will suit Eleanor Daveney. In England she
could neither be seen nor heard above her compeers.
I know her better than she knows herself. She is
just one of those who profess self-abnegation in their
desire to be placed in a sphere of usefulness, but
whose enthusiasm would fall to the ground without
the excitement of success or applause.
“There is some good sense, though, and much good
feeling," observed the other lady,“ in all Eleanor says,
and, without intending it, she has placed her husband
in a pleasant light. I should think he was just the
man to appreciate the good sense, and turn the warmth
of heart to wise account.”
“ Yes, I dare say,” replied Eleanor's friend, with an
absent air, as she walked to the window, overlooking
Piccadilly, and watehed the restless thoroughfare
through her eye-glass. Then a carriage, in most per-
fect taste, drove up, a portly man, with a hook nose
and rubicund visage, descended, and the Duchess-elect
forgot Mrs. Daveney's existence for many years, till
her cousin Frankfort, by a letter, revived for a short
time the old association.
But let future events develop the characters I
have faintly sketched. Supper is ready in the eating-
room, and Mr.
aveney, as we shall for the future
style him, having introduced his guests to his tiny
dressing-room, where they refreshed themselves with
clean water and a slight change of dress, taps at the
door and waits to usher them to his hospitable board.
The sportsmen gladly acceded, and followed him
to the dining-room, where Mrs. Daveney and two
daughters awaited them.
Frankfort's eye rested at once upon the pale face of
Eleanor, the elder of these daughters. He recog-
nized the high thoughtful forehead of the father, but
the long grey eye, with dark lashes, resembled her

mother's, so did the lip, that had narrowly escaped
being scornful; and, though strongly resembling her
mother, the features of the youthful face were soft.
But much older than that young fair face was the ex-
pression it wore,—wore, for it was not natural to it.
Was it the result of mournful experiences ? Yes,
surely so, thought Frankfort, as Mr. Daveney took his
daughter's hand, and placing her beside himself, intro-
duced her to his guests.
She looked up, and bending gracefully to both
gentlemen, her eyes and Frankfort's met. Oh, the
mysterious charm cast on the traveller from the
depths of those earnest, melancholy orbs!
Ormsby soon found that both sisters had been in
Cape Town, Marion within the last twelve months,
visiting some friends of her father, who were enjoying
the Cape climate after the sultry sun of India.
He
was fully prepared to admire his fair neighbour's
bright eyes, and at the same time enjoy the repast
spread before him ; it was plentiful, savoury, and far
from inelegant. Before the host was that first-rate
Irish dish, a cold shoulder of corned mutton, garnished
with fresh, green, crisp parsley ; on lifting the cover
from the side-dishes, a fragrant steam arose, that
warmed a hungry man's heart as he inhaled it. In
one was a fine cucumber, scooped hollow, and then
stuffed with seasoned meat, and stewed in rich sauce.
In another smoked a famous Dutch plat, called La
partje, square inches of mutton, skewered on little
sticks, dipped in sauce, made of tomatas and capsicums
and eschalots if none better offers, and toasted over
a wood fire. A third contained a pile of rice, white as
snow; the next a rechauffé of ox-tail currie ; added to
these were potatoes, baked with their jackets on in the
ashes, roasted meeties (Indian corn), so delicious when
young, grated biltongue, excellent butter, some deli-
cious rolls, a household loaf on a trencher, with a knife
beside it, whereof the handle was of polished horn
from the head of the African gemsbok; then there

was such preserved quince, and marmalade, as a
Scotchman's soul would have delighted in, to say
nothing of poached eggs, brought in hot after all had
sat down. It was all like magic to the travellers, and
had they seen the old Malay in the kitchen, with his
mysterious contrivances, which no European cook would
condescend to understand, they would have been still
more astonished. He was an old creature, who had lived
with the Morlands, and then followed the Daveneys
to the wilderness, where he had his own way, and sent
forth all manner of savoury dishes from a huge fire-
place, without a grate, before which he was seated all
day, issuing his orders to an assistant imp, something
like May
There were no fine wines, no foaming English ale,
but the Cape Madeira made good beverage, mixed with
water; and there was an old-fashioned silver service
before Mrs. Daveney, from which she distilled coffee
clear as amber, and steaming milk ; the table-linen was
white as an African sun can bleach it, and the light from
two tall wax candles, mantled in the cherry-patterned
delf. The ladies took some coffee, in compliment to
their guests—what trifles place people at ease with
one another. Their light supper was long since over ;
but Mr. Daveney, who had been busy about his farm
defences all day, enjoyed his meal the more for the
companionship of brother-soldiers.
At the sound of Eleanor's voice, Ormsby, who had
paid no attention to her appearance beyond a bow,
glanced across the table, and, with his usual air of non-
chalance, put aside the light on his left hand, that he
might have a better view of the speaker; and having
satisfied himself that the pale cheek and braided hair
of the one sister was less attractive to him than the
radiant smile and sunny ringlets of the other, he
helped himself to the smoking La partje, and prepared
to do full justice to the good cheer he so little expected
to find in the wilderness.

group, entered with deep interest into Mr. Daveney's
anecdotes of sport and peril—his anxieties for the
present, his projects for the future. They went back
together to the crowded homes of England, its pallid
manufacturing children, its cities with dark build-
ings jammed together, its thronged populace, toiling,
toiling on, with heaven's sunlight bricked out; its
gigantic schemes,—some successful, blazing up and
illuminating the world ; some, like rockets, aiming at
the sky, and falling in smoke upon the great ocean of
eternity; some lying in gloom, with hopeless projectors,
whose thoughts were to be seized and worked out by
men who could and would be heard. They talked,
too, of the struggle of the better classes to “ keep
up appearances,” to “ get their sons on,” and their
daughters" settled;" they, who had scarcely where-
withal to buy food and raiment,—while here was a
fair, plentiful country lying wastema savage hunting-
ground - space for thousands a wild and lovely
country, awaiting the hand of civilization to make it
prosperous and peaceful for all.
Frankfort could see that to touch on domestic
questions was tender ground. His host turned the
tide of conversation to the troubles of the colony, its
grand resources; and Mrs. Daveney, as she listened
to the conversation, at times joining in it, said earnestly
to Frankfort, how she wished that such as he might
stand up in the council-chambers of England, and
plead the cause of the colonist of Southern Africa. But
Eleanor only joined in the discussion with a smile or a
sigh, as her father's reference to past events demanded.
Still, Frankfort read the heart, as he looked into those
deep eyes, and pondered afterwards on trifling things,
which would have escaped a man not enthralled with
their expression of deep melancholy.
The meal ended, the ladies retired to a table, on
which books and work had been scattered in some con-
fusion on the arrival of the 'sportsmen and their
wagons. The cloth was withdrawn from the polished

oaken table; a little kettle, with its spirit-lamp, was
glowing beside Mr. Daveney, and he was about to
brew some mulled Pontac, the rich red wine of the
Cape, when Frankfort begged to withdraw, in order to
make inquiries concerning the absent Piet.
Some unusual sounds without had already caught
the ear of the master of the dwelling. The dogs were
growing restless in the yards; the people were astir
in the out-buildings; and at the moment that Daveney
and Frankfort rose together to go out and reconnoitre,
Ormsby comfortably establishing himself in a camp
arm-chair, brought from his wagon, the door was
thrown open, and May rushed in; terror was in his
face, the passage behind him was filled with se
servants,
and, gasping for breath, he exclaimed—“Master, good
Master Frankfort, come out and see, come out and
listen ;
the fires are lighted on the hills ; but that is not
all-open your ears, and hear the war-cry on the
mountains. Oh! master,” cried the poor bushman,
in a voice of despair, “what shall I do?-my wife !
my little child !”
Mrs. Daveney stood up, silent, but appalled;
Marion's cheek faded to the hue of death ; Eleanor
went up to her father, and put her arm through his.
“My dear,” said he, “you must summon all your
presence of mind, for I must go.”
“I know it, father, but tell us what you would have
us do; the house is already defensible”-the windows
had been partially bricked up for some days, in conse-
quence of intelligence from the towns" but you must
appoint us our places, if you are obliged to leave us."
* Your mother," said Mr. Daveney, “has had my
instructions these three days; she has an able coad-
jutor in you; but Marion is faint-hearted, I am afraid.”.
Excellent arrangements had indeed been made, in
preparation for defence, if besieged by the savages,
which Mr. Daveney could not think was probable, from
various circumstances.
The enemy had got so much plunder lately, that he

considered they could scarcely have disposed of it with
sufficient security to enable them to go openly to war.
He had many other arguments against a sudden attack;
but he was an old soldier, who knew that there is
nothing so likely to keep a foe away as to be always
ready to receive him. Furthermore, he never disdained
advice, or scoffed at information, and he had lately
heard of immense stores of ammunition finding their
way into Kafirland in a manner incredible to him, but
perfectly intelligible to the reader.
The house, then, had been duly set in order. Arms
and ammunition were stored in a large closet ad-
joining the dining-room; small bags, filled with sand,
were ready to be placed against all apertures left to
give light; a room had been prepared by Mrs. Daveney
for the wounded, a table spread
with lint, tourniquets,
and various salves and styptics; provisions had been
collected together in a store-room, where also stood
several barrels of water; and, in short, it would be quite
possible to hold out against assailants for many days.
Unfortunately, the cattle, horses, and sheep were
unprotected; the stone wall and blockhouses, begun
some weeks back, were yet unfinished. The plan was
admirable, but, owing to want of hands, required much
time to carry it out.
But I must defer my description of these buildings
till a future occasion. May disappeared in the same
frantic way he had entered, and the master of the
house having, with quiet decision, repeated his instruc-
tions to his principal servants, and succeeded in calm-
ing his younger daughter's terrors, proceeded to the
stoep of the house, cautioning the inmates about dis-
playing lights, and followed by his daughter Eleanor.
On emerging from the house, a scene was presented,
so brilliant, yet so terrific, as to mock the efforts of
my poor pen in describing it. In a few minutes the
whole household were drawn together by one impulse
in the verandah; all the servants clustered in a group
at the foot of the steps.

The plains which the travellers had journeyed
over had to them been invisible till now, that they
were fairly lit up for miles round. The mountains,
stretching, as I have observed, from the left of the
homestead, and extending in a south-westerly direc-
tion, were enwreathed with fire, clearly defining their
shape and altitude against the glowing sky. Some
rose proudly to the heavens; some formed a dark but
distinct foreground; some were covered, others only
dotted with burning bush, and, from the most distant
peak, crowned with its diadem of basaltic rock, to
the nearest acclivity, sloping seawards, these wreaths
of vivid flame blazed with steady splendour, illumi-
nating acres of trackless country. From the mountain-
tops in the back-ground, great tongues of flame shot
up from time to time, lit the air for a few minutes, and
faded into darkness; anon, some answering light
gleamed out from a distant height, and so disappeared ;
thus, in all directions, these luminous telegraphs
sparkled and died away, while on the plains, at no
great distance from the settlement, a shimmer here
and there proved that the savages were astir in all
directions.
Mr. and Mrs. Daveney stood together, and held a
parley; their guests surprised at the steady reasoning
of the lady, no less than at the close calculations of
the host.
“These fires,” said Mrs. Daveney, “are the fore-
runners of an open declaration of war; but I doubt
their attacking the settlement, especially to-night, for
the scouts 'ere this will have told the tale of a re-
inforcement at Annerley; you have been tracked
hither.”
“ The drought of this year has been nothing consi-
derable,” remarked her husband, “and therefore I am
inclined to attach some importance to these illumina-
tions, which are common at this period, when the earth
is parched, and the Kafirs improve the vegetation by
burning the old grass out of the pasture. Still, as

there has been no public proclamation of war-I, as
a magistrate, must have received notice of it if there
had been—I can scarcely believe these to be signals of
open defiance to our authorities, however the enemy
may translate them between themselves.”
“Ah! father," interposed Eleanor Daveney, who
had wound her arm round the trembling Marion's
waist, “the rivers may have risen, the post-riders may
be shot, or their despatches seized.”
“Right, Eleanor--we know not what intelligence
these luminous telegraphs may convey from the Fish
River to the Kei, while our poor heralds lie dead in
the bush. We may be thankful,” continued the
host, bowing to Frankfort and Ormsby, “for our
gallant reinforcement. Marion, are you a soldier's
daughter, and afraid ?”
The light-for it was clear as day beyond the
house, the verandah shading the group but partially-
fell on the upturned face of the frightened girl.
“Not only for myself,” said his daughter; “what
would become of hundreds in the district if
you
fell
in a conflict with these savages
?”
Her father put aside the ringlets from her brow and
kissed her. "Let us hope for the best," said he.
“If these demonstrations be hostile, troops from the
garrisons must be on the march; the colony is
ill prepared for war, and the Dutch farmers, to say
the least, are uncertain ; but, if once the word to
arm is given, thousands of brave and ready burghers
will be up and stirring; for, however incredulous
the authorities may have been, the settler has slept
with arms in hand: and now, let us hold a council of
war."
So saying, he opened a door leading from the stoep
to the eating-room, and, desiring Griqua Adam to arm
the trustiest herds, and place them as sentinels in the
kraals and angles of the outbuildings, he sat down
with his family and guests to confer as speedily as
might be on the present emergency.

What it was immediately necessary to guard against
was the stealthy advance of the enemy on the right;
certain duties were also assigned to the ladies ; poor
Marion's white lips sadly belied the readiness with
which she obeyed her father in telling off percussion-
caps by dozens. To be sure, Ormsby seated himself
beside her to assist her in the task, and the calmness
of her mother and elder sister was her best incentive
to courage.
A strange sight it would have been to English eyes
to see Mrs. Daveney and her elder daughter bringing
the muskets from the store-room, Mr. Daveney and
Frankfort piling them in readiness for those whom
Griqua Adam had summoned to receive them in a
trellised passage at the back of the dining-room.
In a few minutes a very fair plan of operations-
was sketched out for the instruction especially of the
two officers, each having a particular post allotted
him.
Poor May, who had been patiently sitting on the
stoep awaiting his master's decision, at last tapped in
despair at the door, which Mr. Daveney, a little dis-
concerted by the interruption, opened.
“Ah! sir," said the poor bushman, “ I am heart-
sore for my wife and child; they must be in danger,
for these schelms are all round us. Come out, sir,
Oh! master," observing Frankfort ad-
vancing, “the vrouw and the kiut will be murdered ;"
and thereupon poor May--merry-hearted, honest,
hopeful, keen-witted May- sat down upon the ground,
and cried like a child.
“Something must be done, certainly, for this poor
fellow,” said Mr. Daveney; “let us at once arm the
people, and steal out cautiously to reconnoitre.”
Advancing to the right of the mansion, the two
gentlemen looked up towards the kloof; it was in
profound darkness; but, on the krantz above it, the
dark figures of Kafirs, looking more like demons
than human beings, were seen flitting about, and
once more.

leaping from ledge to ledge of the rocky precipices
with firebrands in their hands. Below the stoep some
of the Hottentots and Fingo servants of the farm
stood watching these creatures, and calculating the
meaning of every movement with a coolness that
gave Frankfort great confidence in their courage and
sagacity
The distant signals still shot up at intervals like
sky-rockets, and, as May affirmed, were evidently
questions and answers passing between the Gaika and
I''Slambie tribes.
“See there," observed Mr. Daveney ; " at the very
farthest ridge is a gleam like a star; this is but a
link in the chain which began in some far valley within
the frontier line, and is passing from hill to hill to the
distant bluffs overhanging the sea near the Kei.”
The servants were assembling in the trellised pas-
sage to wait their master's orders, the ladies and
Ormsby were still busied in the dining-room, and
Frankfort was intent on May's entreaties that a party
might be sent under his guidance in search of Piet's
wagon, when the deep stillness of the night was
broken by a cry so unearthly, so shrill, yet so
strangely prolonged, that all stood still to listen.
It was the war-cry of Kafirland!
It came from the farthest mountain-tops, advanced
as though a voice, trumpet-tongued, passed over the
hills, descended to the plains, rose again, the echoes
following it. Fainter, fainter, it dies away at last
into a wailing cry, only to be repeated at the starting-
point, taken up, passed on as before, and sent again
wailing through the great solitudes from the Amatolas
to the ocean.
Silence, dread and profound, fell upon many tenants
of the mansion in that appalling hour. Mr. Daveney
and his guest re-entered the dining-room-Eleanor
had sunk upon a chair to receive her falling sister in
her
arms, Marion's face was buried in her sister's lap;
Mrs, Daveney, in the act of giving a musket to the

Griqua, stood transfixed with awe, for she well knew
what that unearthly cry portended, and Ormsby had
opened the door leading to the trellised passage, and
stood there with the servants drawn up awaiting the
orders of their master.
We read of the heroines of old, who armed their
heroes for the battle, or went forth commanding
armies; but it is not to such as these our hearts yield
the tribute of earnest admiration : that calm forti-
tude, which stands in better stead than the daring
elicited by excitement that dignified resignation,
which prepares itself to meet danger that self-abne-
gation, which sets aside all difference of opinion, and
unites with all ranks of life in the common cause of
defence, is worth all the sudden impulses of bravery
which history has immortalized. The records of our
colonies would furnish forth subject-matter for many
a bard; but they want, so to speak, dramatic colouring,
though one would think the terrific scenes of blazing
homesteads and blood-stained hearths were not with-
out what reporters would call “effect.” Verily, our
English settlers' wives, with their patient, work-a-day
endurance, would need the pen of a Goldsmith or a
Crabbe to set them in their proper light.
Eleanor Daveney would have made a charming fore-
ground for such a picture as men like these have loved
to draw.
Mrs. Daveney issued orders in conjunction with
her husband, apportioned to each man his store of
ammunition, looked to the priming of the muskets in
the hands of the herd-boys, who were more accus-
tomed to the assegai and the knob kierrie than to our
firearms; but Eleanor, while she soothed her more
excitable sister's fears, had a word of encouragement
for every one; and, rousing Marion, bid her accom-
pany her to the stoep, and comfort the women, who
were there huddled together in mute terror.
Poor May, who, in the extremity of danger to the
household, could not obtain a hearing, now rushed

so

past the sisters like a madman, and, springing over
the gateway, sped out into the wilderness. They could
hear the terrier yelping at his heels ever so far, and
Frankfort, thoroughly dismayed at the idea, at once
gave his faithful bushman up for lost.
Eleanor had some comfort for him.
“ These defiances from the hills,” said she,
decided, that there is no doubt the assegai hangs over
our heads by a single hair; still the object of these
creatures is plunder. When they attack the settle-
ment, it will be in a quiet guise. If May keeps his
wits about him as he used-as he used to do—he will
find his way uninterrupted——"
“Ah!” said Frankfort, “ you have seen my friend
May before ?"
Eleanor hesitated, but only for a moment, and re-
plied-
Yes, we remember him when quite a boy.”
Candour evidently prevailed over a seeming reluc-
tance to refer to the past; and yet there was nothing
singular in Eleanor Daveney's remembrance of May,
who had been employed from childhood about the
English quarters and locations. It was simply her
sudden pause, hesitation, and hurried tone in ad-
mitting the truth, which had attracted Frankfort's
notice.
Ormsby, on hearing the bushman had sped into the
wilderness, grew furious with Piet, and wished Frank-
fort had taken his advice in forbidding Fitje's accom-
panying her husband. Frankfort reproached himself
for not riding in the rear of the cavalcade, and keep-
ing the party together, but time was too precious for
unavailing regret; it was deemed prudent to close
and secure the front of the dwelling, Eleanor con-
soling Marion by reminding her that, for the present,
the
war-cry
of Kafirland was their best personal
security, since "you know,” said she, “that unlike
the honest faces of civilized lands, the Kafir comes
rot with beating drum and flying standard; and the

147
settler of South Africa is safest when face to face
with his wicked neighbour. Yet," added Eleanor,
why should I call the Kafir wicked ?-it is not for
me to judge."
Again there arose that shrill
, terrific war-cry.
Marion shuddered, and wound her arms round her
sister's slender waist.
“Poor wretches !” said Eleanor, lifting her mourn-
ful eyes to heaven—“poor misguided beings !” and,
clasping her hands, her lips moved in inaudible
prayer.
Frankfort watched her as she implored Heaven in
behalf of the unhappy savages, and could not help
contrasting her mild courage with her mother's autho-
ritative air of resolution and her sister's utter help-
lessness and terror.
All night long the little garrison of Annerley stood
to its arms, the sentinels immovable at the outposts,
Daveney and Frankfort going the rounds at intervals,
Ormsby in command of the party guarding the rear-
ward premises, his head-quarters being the trellised
passage, from which he occasionally looked in upon
the ladies. He had been particularly requested by his
host to act under the directions of the old Griqua, who
had been a soldier in the Cape Corps, and whose expe-
rience was invaluable; and, what was more than
Frankfort had expected, Ormsby had the good sense
to see this, and acknowledge it.
Daveney, albeit far from easy as to the safety of his
family, would not permit his domestic troubles to in-
terfere with his duties as master of a household.
Once, when on his rounds with Frankfort, he looked
in upon the group, and asked how all went on.
Marmion had made his way into the sitting-room, and
stretched himself at Eleanor's feet, with his black
muzzle to the ground, and ears and eyes
wide
open,
keeping watch and ward over the group. Marion lay
on a couch, her head pillowed on her sister's arm, and
fast asleep, her ringlets hanging, all dishevelled, round
L 2

her, and Mrs. Daveney's anxious gaze was riveted on
a loophole looking eastward, watching with weary
heart the long-coming of the dawn.
So wore on the night. The fires on the hills died
away; the gorgeous sun, opening his gates of glory,
came forth to dispel the smoke and vapours that ob-
scured the distant mountains and floated over the
plains; the night sentinels were relieved, and other
watches set; the house was put in order for the morn-
ing refreshment, so much needed; the herdsmen, well
armed, led the cattle to the open ground fronting the
settlement, and the ladies retired to their own apart-
ments for a while.
Frankfort then expressed his deep anxiety about
the missing members of his train; but as it was con-
sidered by his host highly imprudent to reduce the
force of the garrison under present circumstances,
there was nothing for it but to leave May to his known
sagacity, and hope that old Piet had not brought him-
self and others into danger through his obstinacy and
imprudence ; for there was no denying that the vley
indicated by May as the outspan was flanked on one
side by a dense bush, a notorious haunt of Kafirs.
Our two sportsmen were ushered by Mr. Daveney
into a tolerably-sized apartment, divided by a wooden
partition running little more than half way to the roof.
Everything was in the most homely style, but ex-
quisitely neat. In each domicile was a small camp
bedstead, table, chair, and chest of drawers, all manu-
factured by their ingenious host. Sheepskin mats
were spread on the earthen floor, and the walls, origi-
nally white-washed, were gaily papered with manifold
prints and engravings from some of those publications
which, for the last fifteen years, have taken England
and her customs through the length and breadth of
the earth. The windows were, of course, partially
screened by brickwork ; but the sun pierced one of
the loops, and shed its rays on the picture of a popular
danseuse. Frankfort would have smiled at the asso-

149
ciations called forth by such an anomaly, but his heart
misgave him about his faithful servant, and though
he lay down, he could not rest, and he longed to start
in search of May ; but that would have been absurdly
imprudent.
At noon the cattle herds came running in, to say
that horsemen were in sight; and Daveney, on ex-
amining the defile behind the settlement, descried, to
his great satisfaction, a party of burghers, headed by
an escort of Cape cavalry.
In five minutes they were at the gate, the state of
their steeds indicating sharp riding. Daveney stood
with
open doors ready to receive them, and the officer in
command dismounted, and presented an official packet.
It announced that the Commander-in-Chief, Sir
John Manvers, had reached the frontier; that, deem-
ing it prudent to await his reinforcements, he had
projected a meeting with the Kafir chiefs at the base
of the Amatola range; that, for the present, open
hostilities were suspended; that the Eighty-th had
been selected, as the weaker corps, for garrison duty.
Daveney was instructed to put the district under his
authority on the qui vive, and to send the General
such intelligence as he could gather. It was antici-
pated that the meeting in Kafirland would not tend to
a peaceful result, as Sir John had to propose terms most
distasteful to the tribes, who had long been bent on war.
“And so,” said Captain Ledyard, coolly dusting his
boots on the steps, and looking round on the unfinished
defences, “the sooner you throw up your outworks,
Daveney, the better.” Captain Ledyard had, from
his bivouac at night, witnessed the warlike demonstra-
tions on the hills, and pronounced them as evincing
the resolution of the war party in Kafirland. It was
very natural to believe that the Kafir scouts had seen
his fires, and carried the intelligence to the chiefs, that
troops were on the march. The warriors had there-
fore evidently delayed offensive operations till it was
ascertained whether more were following.

rear.
“ You are too well accustomed,” said Ledyard, “to
guard against stealthy attacks, to require any caution
on that head; but it is amazing to think how these
devils have supplied themselves with ammunition.
Within six or seven months, they must have com-
pletely stored their magazines afresh. I see, too"
and here the colonial soldier's experienced eye scanned
the defences of the homestead—“ that your house is
roofed with zinc; but I do not like the glen in the
It is well named the Devil's Kloof.' How-
ever, you did not choose the site of your farm yourself,
my good brother-soldier, and you will make the best
of it, and give your enemy a good peppering from the
loops."
So saying, he entered the house, where he was
introduced to the two officers, who, on hearing that
their regiment was the one selected for garrison duty,
resolved on not rejoining it at present. It was clear
they could be useful to their host, and had more
chance of smelling gunpowder where they were than
if they returned to their corps.
Such refreshment as the times allowed was spread
in the darkened eating-room for Captain Ledyard,
while his followers bivouacked in front, and a sheep
was killed, skinned, cut up, and eaten, within half an
hour after the arrival of these welcome visitors.
As they were to halt till the cool of the evening,
Mr. Daveney proposed that poor May's footsteps
should be traced, while the sturdy burghers, resting
on their arms, kept guard over his
people; so, with a
knowing old Hottentot, and two Fingoes, the latter
on foot, the host and Frankfort well mounted, pistols
in their belts, and rifles slung handy for immediate
use, started for the vley, where Piet had lingered on
the midnight march.

CHAPTER IX.
THE GATHERING OF THE SETTLERS.
ANXIOUS as Frankfort was concerning the fate of
his attendants, thoughts of his host's daughter
Eleanor would rise as he rode silently beside
Mr. Daveney on the expedition in search of Piet
the obstinate.
Within the last twenty-four hours of his existence
a new chapter, had been opened before him in his
book of fate-it was not his own inditing: Frank-
fort, although not the man to he attracted
by a mere
pretty, interesting face, had been taken by surprise in
the desert. He had never been a trifler in those
showy circles in which Ormsby was wont to flutter;
he loved books, reflection, and but for his sporting
tastes and military talent might have been considered
by his brother-officers a 66 slow man.” Albeit cour-
teous by nature and education to the gentler sex, and
less uncharitable towards its failings than many more
favoured than himself, he never could bring himself
to philander," as Ormsby designated flirting, for
which the latter had a cruel capacity.
But this sorrowful, gentle-looking being would have
drawn Frankfort to her side anywhere-so he thought.
Certainly, the circumstances attending the intro-
duction of our travellers to this family had brought
out features in the character of all, which placed them
in a strong light before the young men, who naturally
yielded to the influence of the fair daughters of the
wilderness. Ormsby was attracted at once by the
merry-eyed Marion; Frankfort's contemplative mind
dwelt on the care-worn face and dignified calmness in
the midst of dangers displayed by Eleanor; and now,

JASPER LYLE:
as he rode beside her father, he found himself going
back to the first moment of meeting, and counting, as
it were, every link in the chain that he felt had been
silently, but surely, cast around him.
Her quiet courage, her steady reasoning, her un-
consciousness of display as she stood amid the clatter
of arms, the centre of a group of uncouth creatures,
so strongly contrasted with herself
, as they received
the weapons of death from her hands ; the mysterious
sadness
that superseded all other feeling, clouding her
young brow, and influencing the very tones of her
voice as she addressed words of comfort and encou-
ragement to her sister, who, like all volatile people,
had been struck down at once by terror-all those
attributes, so rare in woman, or so seldom developed
(perhaps for want of opportunity--that is a mighty
word, though all men may not know it)—would have
impressed Frankfort, had the possessor of them been
the plainest woman in the world.
So he fancied. But was any man ever yet at-
tracted at once by a plain woman, simply because she
displayed courage, tenderness, or was visibly un-
happy?
Trace the cause to what source you please, our re-
flective, reasonable Frankfort could not banish Elea-
nor from his thoughts; and he found himself replying
vaguely to some of her father's remarks, till the latter,
as he put his horse into a canter, observed-
“ This creature, you see, is perfectly trained; he is
seldom ridden by any one but my daughter Eleanor,
who is an excellent horsewoman.'
“Ah! he is Miss Daveney's favourite, is he?” said
Frankfort, struck for the first time with the graceful
action of the animal.
“My daughter Eleanor's," said Mr. Daveney-
“ Mrs. Lyle's.”
“Mrs. Lyle! I was not aware”—and a sudden
glow suffused the manly face unused to blushing-
“that-that the young lady was married.”

153
“She is a widow," answered Mr. Daveney; and
then he abruptly changed the subject, as, settling his
reins, be directed Frankfort's attention to a wild pass
on the left, in which he had once had an adventure
with Kafirs.
Married! a widow! so young! Frankfort was asto-
nished-yet what was it to him ?-His host evidently
thought so too; for, having set him right as to his
daughter's position, he began talking on other matters.
Mr. Daveney pointed out many a covert, whence,
he said, probably some dark spirits were looking down
on them, but unwilling to show themselves on the
open plains. They soon sighted the vley; but it was
necessary to be cautious in approaching it, in conse-
quence of the dense bush with which it was partially
bordered.
The keen-eyed old Hottentot gave it as his opinion,
that no body of Kafirs was concealed within, as the
birds were swaying in the branches of the taller trees,
and the ground showed no sign of fresh spoor (track,
footmarks). From the spot at which the party halted,
only a portion of the vley was visible, and Mr. Daveney
was beginning to consider at which point they were
to commence their reconnoitring operations, when
Ormsby's bloodhound dashed into the copse, and came
back whining and importunate.
Both gentlemen dismounted, gave their horses to
the Fingoes, and, despite the caution of the Hot-
tentot, followed the beast into the bush, their arms
ready. Klaas, seeing this, entered it with them ; the
dog leaped in, and the three creeping after him on
hands and knees, Mr. Daveney put aside a bough, and
within a yard discovered Piet lying on his face dead.
They turned him over; he had been stabbed in the
chest by an assegai, and had doubtless crawled into
the thicket to die for a bloody track crimsoned the
green leaves beyond him.
But where were May and Fitje and the child ?
Klaas scrambled through the copse as fast as he

could, and the others, shocked at the sight, drew back
instinctively.
On emerging from the bush, they found one Fingo
with their horses, who informed them that his com-
rade had discovered the wagon, or rather the remains
of it, for it had been set fire to. On reaching the
side of the vley where the shattered vehicle lay, they
were all greatly relieved at hearing May's voice issu-
ing, apparently, from the depths of the earth, and
next his head appeared above ground, then Fitje's,
and, at last, the impish, roguish, yellow countenance
of the child.
Kafirs had been concealed in the bush beside the
vley the preceding night. Piet owed his death to his
obstinacy. Jealous of May's authority, he had daw-
dled behind in spite of Fitje's entreaties to keep close
to the other wagons; the more anxious she became,
the more dogged was he; and, laying the long whip
across the roof of the wagon, he folded his arms, and
left the oxen to crawl as they liked along the pathless
waste. Fitje resigned herself to circumstances with
true Hottentot philosophy, and, tying down her douk,
wrapped her patchwork petticoat over her child, and
lay down within the vehicle to sleep. All at once she
heard a groan; something rolled off the box and
obstructed the fore-wheel, she looked out into the
waste, and three dark figures gibbered at her in the
mist. She thought she was dreaming, but she soon felt
she was not; a strong arm dragged her out, and flung
her on the ground, and she saw her child lifted up,
about to be impaled most likely, when one of the
men, whom she discovered to be Kafirs, flung it from
him, remarking, “it was a girl, and not worth killing."
Poor Fitje snatched it up, and remembering that,
while outspanning at the vley, May had indicated a
certain spot as a pit-fall for wild beasts, she crawled
thither with all speed, while the savages were intent
on rifling the wagon. She crept into the welcome
covert there was the skeleton of a wolf in the pit;

but “misery makes us acquainted with strange bed-
fellows,” and so poor Fitje thought little of her ghastly
neighbour, but lay in dread of being dragged out,
stifling poor Ellen's screams as well as she could, till
the glad sound of Spry's shrill bark told her help was
She sat up, listened in agony, lest the enemy should
still be lurking about; the wagon was yet burning, and
her fears increased as she remembered that one of the
packages especially commended to her care was a case
of gunpowder. Careful May, however, always in
doubt or dudgeon about Piet the obstinate, had that
very morning removed it to safer keeping; but for
this precaution, it would have fallen into the hands of
the enemy, or, by exploding, destroyed the lives of all
She took heart on hearing May's low whistle near
her, for he soon guessed the hiding-place of his keen-
witted vrouw, and, descending beside her, set her fears
at rest.
The ladies of the household were standing at the
gateway, watching for the return of the party with no
little anxiety. The distance was short, the plains open,
and commanded by a mound behind the settlement,
on which a vidette had been placed; but still, after
the shock their nerves had sustained the night before,
they trembled for the safety of the reconnoitring
party as soon as it was out of sight. No reason will
subdue a woman's fears for others, and Captain
Ledyard talked in vain. They listened anxiously for
shots, and felt certain the vidette could not reach Mr.
Daveney's people in time, if attacked, never thinking of
their own critical position in such a case.
Marion-
bright-eyed Marion—saw them first. “Safe, mother,
safe ; and there is a little creature on foot with the Fin-
goes, and a woman, and—” she gazed intently on the
coming horsemen, whose pace was slackened for poor
Fitje's sake—“oh, mother! Eleanor! some one is
leading a horse, and—” she clasped her hands to-

gether in a convulsion of terror"something is slung
across it—a human creature-a man-he must be
dead!"
Captain Ledyard shaded his eyes from the sun, and
said nothing; Mrs. Daveney stood tranquil, but with
lips white and quivering; Eleanor opened the gateway,
and stepped out to have a clearer view across the
plains.
"I see my father," said she, “in advance-I know
the horse's pace.”
“Thank God!” exclaimed Mrs. Daveney; Marion
burst into an hysterical fit of weeping upon Eleanor's
bosom ; and, this great terror removed from their over-
charged hearts, there was space for more rational
thoughts.
“ It may be the unhappy driver Piet,” said Eleanor,
and as she looked again, she recognized Frankfort
with her father. He took a handkerchief from his
breast, and waved it. It was a good sign, she felt,
and as soon as the pedestrians were within safe range
of the settlement--for they had to pass the mouth of
the kloof-Daveney and his guests galloped forward.
Eleanor's conjecture, as the reader guesses, was right.
The old Hottentot had laid the body of the murdered
man across his horse, and brought it to the settlement.
Frankfort was still in some doubt as to the fate of
one of the foreloupers, but May had a notion“ the little
bavian (monkey) had escaped ;” and, on taking the
horses to their stables, sure enough there was the imp,
leaning idly and unconcernedly against a gate, with a
hunch of bread in his hand, and a broad grin on his
black shining face.
At sunset, the herdsmen having dug a grave, May
and Griqua Adam buried the miserable old Piet, and
piled some stones above him, to save his remains from
the wolves; but when the farm-servants ventured out
next morning, they found the grave had been rifled,
and, by chance, casting their eyes, in the course of the
day, on a jutting krantz, lit by the sun, they dis-

covered the wretched creature's body impaled on a
scathed oak, round which the asphogels were sweep-
ing, eager for their hateful meal.
In a day or two, some of the farmers of the district
arrived, bringing with them their families, and pro-
posing to establish a bivouac on the plains. This Mr.
Daveney at once acceded to; but, deprecating the
system of leaving the homesteads as lurking-places for
the
enemy, he laid his own plans of defence before the
colonists, who, satisfied that their women and children
would be under safe guardianship with the little force
the magistrate could organize, consented to return to
the principal farms, and garrison them at once.
“Hurrah ! cried a sturdy young settler, with a com-
plexion bronzed from its original English hue to the
swarthy colour of the Hottentot; " I said we ought
to make a stand for the credit of Old England. I never
saw the mother country, as you call her, but I have a
respect for her, and I take it, the crack of a few Brum-
magem rifles will stop the mouths of these yelling
devils long before she takes the trouble to send us
soldiers. Well, I suppose she intends it for a com-
pliment, and thinks we are able to take care of our-
selves; and so we are.” He stooped from his saddle
to receive a parting token from a pretty creature, who
had been making her toilette, after the trek, in a cum-
brous but cozey old wagon, and who, though sunburnt,
looked as fresh as any girl on a fair-day in England.
There were tears gathering in her eyes, but she brushed
them away, and bidding “God speed him," with an
attempt at a smile, dropped the curtains of the vehicle,
as he galloped in hot haste after his companions, far
in front, with Mr. Daveney at their head.
For Frankfort, well instructed by his host, and
tolerably experienced in the warlike character of the
enemy he had to guard against, was left in command
of the settlement for the present ; in a week Daveney's
magisterial duties in the district would terminate, and
he would return with safe escort.

JASPER LYLE:
These had scarcely departed, ere the good mis-
sionary, Mr. Trail, arrived with his wife and children,
and begged for room to outspan; but Mr. Daveney's
dwelling was of India-rubber quality, for a room was
offered to the Trails, and they accepted it; but, occupy,
ing the wagon by night, this apartment was appropriated
by Mr. Trail for school purposes; and the night after
the magistrate's departure, as Frankfort and Ormsby
were returning from their superintendence of the
outworks, they were taken by surprise at the sound
of the Evening Hymn chanted in good harmony by
some thirty voices.
Frankfort instinctively lifted his hat from his head;
Ormsby remained covered; there was silence, then
the door opened, and a motley assemblage walked
forth decorously: there was the broad-chested, square-
faced Dutch vrouw, and her children, sturdy as her-
self; the Hottentot and Bechuana serving-girls, in
flaunting douks; two or three Kafir children, who
said their fathers were in the bush; some English-
women, wives of the district farmers, and their chil-
dren, blue-eyed and fair-haired, like their Saxon ances-
tors. Then came Eleanor, Marion, and Mrs. Trail;
and lastly Mr. Trail, with two little bright-faced crea-
tures hanging at his skirts. No, not lastly, for May
and Fitje,
and their merry-eyed infant, brought up the
As the ladies stepped into the trellised passage,
Ormsby raised his hat and bowed—Frankfort said
nothing; but he thought how one-half the world did
homage to the creature, forgetting the Creator.
Ormsby followed Marion into the house. Frankfort
waited to address Mr. Trail, with whose reputation he
was well acquainted; but he was prevented in his
purpose by hearing Eleanor say to the missionary,
T. You will come to me, then, in five minutes. I have
much to tell you. You can scarcely feel sorrow; but
you will certainly be shocked.”
She stopped suddenly, seeing Frankfort standing at
rear.

her side ; a glow, like sunset upon snow, mantled on
her marble cheek, her eyes fell to the ground, and
her embarrassment was only relieved by the sound of
Mrs. Daveney's voice calling to her to come and assist
in some household concerns.
Mr. Trail apparently did not notice what I have
related ;
he
gave
his attention at once to Frankfort,
who was desirous of having all the defences completed
before the host's return.
It was no easy matter to enclose hastily a number
of scattered outbuildings, occupying nearly two acres
of ground. The wagons formed a capital breastwork
for the front of the dwelling, already tolerably
secure; the orchard and garden-ground flanking the
rear were surrounded by hedgework of the prickly
mimosa, forming a kind of abati,* in which picked
men were to be placed as checks on the enemy's
advance; the stables, cattle, and sheep kraals, sepa-
rated from the dwelling by a miniature vineyard, were
as yet scarcely defensible—the stone wall, as I have
before related, being stopped in its progress for want
of hands. But now a redoubt was in speedy progress,
the entrances being protected at night by piles of
thorn-bushes; and the vineyard having in peaceful
days been irrigated by a mountain riil, there was
abundance of water; there was a chance of the supply
being cut off by the cunning foe, but tanks and barrels
were to be filled, which Mr. Trail doubted not would
last as long as water was required; for the plan of
the defence was so admirable, that it was scarcely
probable the Kafirs would make an open assault; still
the cattle were a great temptation, and foraging parties
were daily bringing in fresh captures.
" But,” said Mr. Trail, pulling out his watch, "I
must leave you now, sir, and at nine o'clock I propose
assembling the family, and closing the day with thanks-
* Abati consists of trees with their branches shortened and
sharpened at the ends, and they serve as a chevaux-de-frize on an
emergency.

giving to the Almighty for the mercies with which He
surrounds us. We shall meet again then, I trust;'
and leaving Frankfort in the vineyard, the missionary
returned to the house.
What could this interview between Eleanor and
Mr. Trail mean? “Pshaw," thought Frankfort, “what
is it to me ?” and then the mantling cheek, the quiver-
ing lip, the trembling hand, on which he had disco-
vered the mystic ring guarded by a circlet-a gilded
snake -came between him and his reason, and he paced
the green retreat, regardless of the fading day, till the
moon rose high and clear, and the path was traced
with the graceful pattern of the vine foliage.
Something glittered in the path, he picked it up;
the moonlit atmosphere of South Africa is so bril-
liant that the smallest handwriting is legible; but
what he lifted was a miniature of a lovely child.
There was nothing but the head, bending, as it were,
from orient clouds; the face was angelic, the lips rosy
and smiling, the waving hair like threads of gold in
sunlight, the eyes with the pencilled brow unmis-
takable. Was it a brother, sister, or child of Eleanor ?
He looked at the back, and on an enamel ground
was inscribed : “My Harry, born April 18-died
March 18."
“Eheu! Eheu! Eheu!"
He put it carefully up. The bell, hanging in a large
mulberry tree, under which the household assembled
on Sundays to worship that God whose presence
lights the desert, was now struck by Griqua Adam,
who, on returning through the vineyard, reminded“ the
Sir," that “prayer-time was come ;” and Frankfort,
re-entering the trellised passage, joined the family and
household servants on their way to what Ormsby
already nicknamed the conventicle, where Mr. Trail
awaited them with the Bible open at the thirty-
seventh Psalm.
Frankfort was quite accustomed to hear men like
Mr. Trail called “swaddlers," "humbugs," nay, terms

161
were applied to them such as no woman's pen can
record; but though he felt what sorry representatives
of their societies some of these teachers of God's
solemn will had been, he was not one to censure the
mass for the misdoings of the few; and therefore,
soldier though he was, his heart was moved as he
looked on the reader's calm, benevolent face, and heard
him proclaim, in mild but fervent tones, that “the
meek-spirited shall possess the earth ;" and even
Ormsby's eye glowed with something of enthusiasm
as the missionary lifted up his voice at the closing
verse, “And the Lord shall help them, and deliver
them;
he shall deliver them from the wicked, and
save them, because they put their trust in him."
Frankfort could not help glancing towards Eleanor.
She seemed unconscious of any one's presence: verily,
if by nature she was intended for loftier purposes,
some deep sorrow had stricken her, and she was of a
surety belonging to the “meek-spirited of the earth."
Large tears were stealing slowly and silently down
that young and faded face, and fell in diamond drops
unheeded on her sable garb; there were others weeping
in that place of prayer besides herself, but these sor-
rowed not without hope. If she had hope, it was
evidently not of this earth; and Frankfort was more
convinced of this every hour he passed in her presence,
presence felt more than he liked to acknowledge to
himself, for she had evidently not a thought to bestow
on him.
Her mother's eyes were fixed upon her ; Mrs. Da-
veney was seated beside the reader, Eleanor in a corner
where there fell but little light. Still the watchful
gaze seemed to pierce the mourner's very soul, and
Frankfort, a keen observer of countenance, read in
that mother's eye anxiety, tenderness, yet something
of reproach.
“ Let us join in prayer,” said the teacher, and, for
the first time since he had left England, Ormsby
found himself kneeling in a home congregation.

He could not follow the teacher, he was back
again in the old dim library, a little boy, at his
mother's side, with his hand clasped in hers. Perhaps
at this very hour* they were all assembled there,
master, mistress, children, servants on whose heads
Time had shed his snow, even where they had then
stood --while the soldier son was wandering in distant
countries.
But Frankfort forgot even Eleanor as he listened to
the eloquent voice of Mr. Trail. The prayer opened
with that fine verse from the ninth Psalm, Arise,
O Lord, let not man prevail ; let the heathen be judged
in thy sight. Put them in fear, O Lord, that the
nations
may
know themselves to be but men ;' and at
the close of it he added, “ And it is for you too, my
friends, to know yourselves to be but men. It is the
arm of the Lord that shall prevail
, and not an arm of
flesh. We know, O God, that thou wilt help us; but
in His name who commands us to love our enemies, to
do good to them that despitefully entreat us, we be-
seech thee to remove these blinded heathen from the
blackness and the darkness with which it has pleased
thee to surround them. We know that they would
have our blood poured out like water, but do thou of
thy mercy
teach us to subdue our hearts, as well as
our enemies, and in the spirit that bids us turn our
cheek to the smiter, teach us charity to our benighted
brethren. Would, O Lord, that it might please thee
to quench the burning brand, and bury the war-spear
in the earth for ever; but if such be not thy will, go
forth with our armies, Lord; make them strong in
faith, that in the name of the Lord they may do vali-
antly. We know that thy cause must prevail; that
the banner of the Cross, though it be dyed in blood,
must be planted wheresoever thy gospel shall be carried.
Help us then in this fierce strife, this mortal conflict
for God and for the right; and, even as thou wert a

cloud by day and a fire by night to the Israelites of old,
be with us in this wilderness. Once more, O Lord,
once more, have mercy on our foes, and teach us from
the depths of our hearts to say in the words of Him
who died that we might live, Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.”
It was the sentiment, the tone, the fervency, and
the simplicity, which gave eloquence to this appeal,
and Frankfort loved to join in the hymn that closed
the service, all standing; but, alas ! habit has more to
do with human nature than the theory of right. The
solemn song rose from lips accustomed to the holy
duty, and if Ormsby had little heed of what was
passing, his friend at least felt that there were things
to be searched for and known, whereof his philosophy
had not yet dreamt,-those mysteries of good and evil
which all the metaphysics in the world can never
penetrate, if the true light be wanting on the path that
leads to them.
The blessing was invoked, the little congregation
rose, and Frankfort's thoughts were earthwards again
as he remembered the miniature.
There was no doubt in his mind to whom it be-
longed. But to whom should he restore it? He
was following Mrs. Daveney into the sitting-room,
intending to place it in her hands, when Mr. Trail
drew him back.
“A little accident has happened," said the mis-
sionary ; " one of my wagon-boxes broke in the hurry
of our rough journey, and in transferring the contents
through the vineyard to the house
Frankfort drew the miniature forth, and said, “Is
this your property ?”
“ It is one of the articles I have missed,” replied
Mr. Trail ; "I am truly glad it is found.” As he
spoke, Eleanor approached, and seeing the miniature
handed from one gentleman to the other, looked eagerly

in the missionary's face, as though inquiring the
meaning of what was passing. Mr. Trail drew her
arm through his, and led her away, leaving Frankfort
mystified.
He had been told this fair, melancholy creature was
a widow. It was clear she had been a mother, and
she was now probably mourning the recent death of
her child; but why were these, apparently, secret or
forbidden themes ?
Then he reasoned as usual,—what was it to him ? He
was a stranger,--and yet he could not be considered
entirely such under present circumstances, and how
much, too, Mr. Daveney had intrusted to him!
He waited for some minutes, hoping Mr. Trail
would return, and accompany him in his night
rounds. He stepped into the verandah: the plains were
bathed in moonlight.
The inmates of the wagons
were retiring to their rest; only here and there a light
glimmered, or the feeble voice of an infant and some
mother's murmured lullaby wailed through the stillness
of the night; but Mr. Trail and Eleanor were pacing
the stoep in such earnest conversation, that they did
not perceive Frankfort, who withdrew to his nightly
duty.
The cattle had been secured by Griqua Adam, the
gates were closed, the sentinels posted, and the out-
works were nearly completed. Mr. Daveney was ex-
pected home on the morrow.

CHAPTER X.
MYSTERY.
NOONTIDE in Kafirland! what a glow! A bold but
popular authoress was severely rated lately for the
passage, “made twilight undulate.” Truly, in an
African noon the atmosphere flickers like water.
Not a sound, save the great bee, as large as a beetle,
going whooming, whooming, among the doricas and
convolvuluses screening the verandah. The locusts,
all emerald and scarlet and gold, lie motionless in the
pomegranate hedges. The cattle stand panting in the
plains, too much exhausted to feed. The Hottentots
are enjoying the sun in their own way, either fast
asleep, with their yellow faces turned upward to the
dazzling sky, or sitting smoking in the glare; and the
dogs seek shady corners, and breathe fast and hard,
with their pink tongues hanging out of their parched
mouths.
On the reinforcement of the Annerley garrison, the
Kafirs had deemed it prudent to “sit still ” in the
hills. Doubtless, too, they were awaiting the issue of
the grand meeting in the Amatola valley. A certain
feeling of security for the present drew the inmates of
the dwelling-house together in various occupations.
The ladies resumed their feminine employments, and
the mornings were passed in the entrance-hall, which,
like those of most South African residences, was fitted
up as a family sitting-room.
It was a pretty cool retreat in general, but this
morning the air was so sultry, that every one felt list-
less—every one but Mr. Trail, and he was busy, as usual,
in his school. The hum of the children's voices was

audible in the hall. Marion said it made her quite
sleepy to listen to it; she threw down her pencil.
Ormsby sat looking at her over his book, as he pre-
tended to read, lounging in his camp chair. Mrs. Da-
veney was writing; but now and then she would raise
her eyes to her youngest daughter, and glance from
her to Ormsby. It was evident that the young
officer's attentions to Marion were observed by the
mother. Eleanor and Mrs. Trail were sorting books
and work for the school, the Bechuana teacher
standing by, looking, as Ormsby said, provokingly
cool.
Frankfort sat with a book in his hand also, but
attentively noting all that was passing.
He was beginning to feel a little uneasy respecting
Marion, and the thoughtless flirt, Ormsby-the girl
so innocent, so fair, and barely seventeen. He ob-
served, too, that her sister, at times, looked anxiously
towards these young people, who always contrived to
be side by side, interested in some particular object
or topic.
Mrs. Daveney finished her despatch, closed her desk,
and begging Marion to follow her, left the room.
Marion pouted, but obeyed; Ormsby retreated to
solace himself with a cigar. Mrs. Trail was sent for
by her husband, the Bechuana girl carried off the
books and work, and Frankfort and Eleanor were left
alone.
Frankfort was a man unaccustomed to violent
emotions, and, as we have shown, not usually suscep-
tible of sudden impressions ; besides which, he had
acquired a habit of reasoning with himself, when other
men would have been too selfish to see the necessity
of it; but all the reasoning in the world now would
not subdue the throbbing of his pulses as the young
widow's
dress swept past him on her way to the door.
Mr. Daveney was expected that night; the anxious
daughter was dreading a storm.
“ Ah!” said she, shading her eyes as she looked

towards the hills, “ this bright day portends mischief,
I fear. God grant my father may reach home by
sunset."
A hot blast of air poured through the door-way.
She closed it, and sat down within a few feet of Frank-
fort. He felt she was on the point of addressing him,
and saw, by her embarrassed air, that what she was
going to say was not mere common-place.
Major Frankfort,” said she, after a short pause,
“I am glad to have this opportunity of addressing a
few words to you on a matter of deep concern to me.
I am not going to speak of myself—my history cannot
interest you, although it must be clear to you that I
am a joyless creature-but I, claiming a right to judge
and act for those I love, because sorrowful experience
has aged me more than years beyond them--I ven-
ture to ask for a proof of your friendship, albeit we
have been acquainted little more than one week-
She hesitated-Frankfort looked at her, her eyes
were cast down, the tears were beginning to steal from
under the drooping lids; he could not speak, his heart
was so full of pity, and yet there were doubts mingled
with this pity-was there any self-reproach added to
the bitterness of the anguish that oppressed that
stricken heart ?
He was thinking only of Eleanor, while she was
intent on interesting him in her sister's welfare--she
brushed
away
the tears.
“Ah!” said she, “how self stands between us and
the impulses of good! Here I have come, with the
resolution to do my duty to my sister, and I am allud-
ing to my own vain regrets for what can never be
amended—it is of Marion I would speak, Major
Frankfort. Your friend Mr. Ormsby is evidently a
man of the world, who sees no harm in devoting him-
self to any young creature who may take his fancy
for the time. Will you pardon my reminding you,
that if you have observed this, it must suggest
itself to you-it must clearly be your--your duty, to

speak to him? Alas, alas !” added she, “I scarcely
know how to address you on this most painful subject;
men are so apt to impute evil motives to women, whose
principles are honest, whose minds would be pure, but
for the heavy lessons learned from the other sex. Ah!”
continued she, covering her face with her hands to
hide the blushes that crimsoned it, “ can I trust you
will you help me ? Save my sister, my darling
Marion,--save her from the misery of a blighted heart.
Oh, think, Major Frankfort, how terrible à doom it is
to dwell in the desert, with but the record of a dream !
You would understand me better if you
knew all---you would appreciate my earnestness, my
anxiety to shield my sister from a deadly sorrow, ere
it be too late. Ah!” she cried, clasping her hands,
and speaking with more energy than she had hitherto
displayed, "if you should set down what I say to
wrong
account if
you
should misunderstand me!-
“ Believe me, Mrs. Lyle,” answered Frankfort, with
great emotion,—" believe me, when I say that, from
the depths of my soul, I understand you.
He lifted his eyes to her face as he spoke. At the
mention of her name, "Mrs. Lyle," something like a
spasm passed across her features, and he saw her
slender fingers close convulsively together. His words
admitted of opposite interpretations, but the deep
sympathy expressed in that frank and earnest face
was too manifest to be doubted for an instant.
Eleanor's eyes drooped beneath the melting gaze that
fixed itself
upon them. It was long since she had
received such silent but expressive homage. She
thought but little of it after the first instant of sur-
prise. She put no trust in man.
The deep blush passed away, and left the cheek as
cold and statue-like as ever. She went on speaking of
her sister. “It may seem,” she continued, “that I am
assuming my mother's prerogative in opening this sub-
ject; but I wish to spare both her and my father pain
and anxiety during this period of public harass and

169
responsibility, and therefore, relying on, or rather
trusting to, your generosity, I hope I may depend on
you to remonstrate with Mr. Ormsby on his show of
devotion to my sister, since it can mean nothing.”.
“But," said Frankfort, “is it fair to speak of it as
a show of devotion? Your sister is one who would
command admiration in any circle. She is so charm-
ingly fresh and innocent--so unlike the young ladies
who, as you say, would be pure in heart but for the
heavy lessons taught them by our sex, that, putting
beauty out of the question, my friend would be happy
indeed in winning the affections of such a being as she
appears to be.”
“ As she appears to be! Oh, wise and cautious that
you are !—more merciful though than he, you would
not seek at first sight to win a prize, believing it to be
pure gold, and then reject it, because, on nearer view,
you discovered the dross of human weakness!” She
spoke with a bitterness which Frankfort felt was
foreign to her gentle nature. He had not been for
ten days domesticated with this sorrow-laden woman
without discovering, in those trifles which mark the
character, how tender, how feininine she was! She
ceased to speak-but he could not withdraw his gaze
from her earnest, mournful face. Every word, every
look, betokened the strangest associations of worldly
experience with the simplicity of a naturally trusting
heart. The nervous trepidation, the modest blush,
the sweet, faltering voice, how deeply were they con-
trasted with the resolute way in which she urged her
right of sisterly guardianship, and the opinions she
permitted to escape her lips, albeit unused to rebuke,
or to the expression of ungentle thoughts!
By what silver cords are we often drawn uncon-
sciously towards each other! Frankfort, for aught
Eleanor considered, might have been one of those who
thought ill of the female sex because he had received
its favours; Eleanor, for aught Frankfort knew, might
be playing a part. A mere man of the world would

have suspected her of laying a scheme to ensnare
Ormsby for her sister's sake, whilst willing to attract
himself; but both were single-minded, honest-hearted
people. The woman's heart was full of anxiety, and
she longed for help from a strong and steady hand ;
she met with an open palm, and she accepted its
assistance in all confidence and security.
They parted, Frankfort promising to put the matter
in a serious light before his thoughtless friend, Eleanor
thanking him for her sister's sake, and totally uncon-
scious of the spell she was gradually weaving round
the hitherto untouched heart of the thoughtful, high-
souled soldier.
He knew the weight of his influence with Ormsby.
That night, after Mr. Daveney's return, Eleanor
looked from her window into the avenue between the
mansion and the gateway. Two figures were pacing
beneath the over-arching trees. Now they stopped
and talked; now the slighter of the two left the other,
with an angry gesture, then returned; now they were
linked, arm in arm, and approached nearer the house.
Eleanor had left her light in her sister's room, and
Marion was calling to her to say “ Good night;" she
was full of a ride next day. “How charming, after
being shut up so long! Papa even thought there
might be peace with Kafirland, after all. Some of the
chiefs had sent him messengers, with flags of truce,
and at any rate the open plains would be safe, and
they should have a gallant escort, and-
Marion was rattling on, as she sat before her glass,
brushing her bright hair, which hung in great luxuri-
ance over her white dressing-gown; but hearing no
reply from Eleanor, she turned round, and saw her
sister, with her head leaning on her hand, in her old
abstracted way: jumping up, she ran to her, and cast-
ing her arms—how dazzlingly fair they looked against
that sable robe !-round Eleanor's
neck, she exclaimed,
“Sweet sister mine, how selfish I must seem; but I
am so happy !-and you-ah! you only answer me.

refuse to be comforted—you must not." And she
kissed the high, thoughtful brow of the pale, sad face
she loved.
“Comfort, Marion ! dear, bright-faced, light-hearted
sister !—earth can give me no comfort, no consolation;
but I love you, I love you ;' and she took Marion to
her bosom, and kissed her tenderly. ** Consolation
and comfort are yet to come. Doubtless they will
come, but they have not been granted me yet. Ah!

Kafir chieftain had applied to Marion—w.Sunbeam,'

She longed-oh! how she longed-to warn Marion
of the thorns and rugged ways of the path which looked
so fair, with Love beckoning in the distance, and
smiling at the feet that stumbled in striving to reach
his temple, in which were many altars some of
triumph, most of sacrifice; but she had not the heart
to rend aside the veil.
She gathered up her sister's radiant tressés, kissed
again the rosy cheek, and withdrew to her own little

Frankfort and Ormsby were still there. On the right
and left were the wagons: the lager consisted of some
twenty people on either side, but all was noiseless,
save the pacing of a solitary sentinel, who waited for
Frankfort to go the midnight rounds. The latter
hurried up the avenue, and bid the man proceed, say-
ing he would follow; and then she heard the two
officers exchange a friendly “Good night.”

"I will,” replied Ormsby; “you are right, and I
am wrong, my good fellow." The rest was lost to

Another blazing day! Mrs. Daveney established
herself with Marion and Mrs. Trail in the cool
dining-room; Eleanor was assisting Mr. Trail in the
school; Frankfort was displaying his success in engi-
neering to his host, and was planning work for Ormsby
and himself.
Marion was more listless than usual, laying down her
work—sad, stupid work it was--coarse frock-making
for those “wretched little Hottentots”—and lifting up
the dark moreen blinds to see if thunder-clouds were
gathering. “No; there were streaks in the sky like
great white plumes, there would be a breeze in the
evening, and she should have her ride."
“Sit down, Marion,” said Mrs. Daveney, rather
impatiently; "how restless you are! it is impossible
to write while you are wandering about the room.
Marion sat down, her cheeks in a glow, and stitched
away in nervous haste. Her mother noted all this.
At the early dinner all the party met again. There
was some change of seats, in consequence of Mr.
Daveney resuming his accustomed place at his table.
Mrs. Daveney's keen eye remarked that Ormsby was
not at Marion's side as usual, and then, to her sur-
prise, she saw a glance of intelligence pass between
Frankfort and Eleanor.
She recognized the meaning of this at once.
The ride was again talked of, and Mr. Daveney
yielded to Marion's entreaty “only for an hour's
canter in the cool of the day.” Eleanor consented to
go; that decided her father.

inclined to like my reader—that Mrs. Daveney was a
woman likely to be a little jealous of her own autho-
rity. It was fortunate that her husband was content
to share his with her, otherwise there would have
been struggles for the real and the fancied preroga-
tive, in which the high-spirited woman would have
surely conquered. She was certain that Eleanor had
opened her mind to Frankfort on the subject of

Ormsby's devotion to Marion, and she felt angry at
being, as she considered, forestalled in her preroga-
tive; and Eleanor, you know, had some compunction
in the matter too.
You will have discovered, too, that between the
mother and elder daughter there was not that tender-
ness, of manner at least, which existed between Mrs.
Daveney and Marion. Eleanor had been born during
the illness of that best-beloved being, who had entered
the world when dangers beset his parents-poor little
quiet thing! she was set aside at once, that this fragile
creature might, if possible, be saved. He died; and
then there came, as consolation, the bright-eyed, rosy-
lipped Marion.
But with the father, the gentle, dark-haired Eleanor
had made her steady way, and kept it. She grew up,
to use a trite simile, like a violet in the shade. No
one thought anything of that colourless oval face,
those dove-like eyes, that intelligent brow shaded by
heavy curls. There was no promise in the thin, small
figure; the gentle voice was seldom heard ; the smile
not often seen; and it was with considerable satisfac-
tion that Mrs. Daveney consented to let the delicate,
drooping girl accompany her father on a visit to the
Governor's wife at Cape Town.
The said Governor's wife, Lady Annabel Fairfax,
was a relative of Mr. Daveney's. She had loved him
in her youth, but he had never known that; and now
she welcomed his gentle daughter with that deep ten-
derness which pure-hearted women feel for the chil-
dren of those on whom their first affections have been
bestowed.
But we shall have to refer to this part of Eleanor's
history by-and-by.
While she rides, her mother is pacing the verandah
with Mr. Trail. Good Mr. Trail, he is soothing that
ruffled spirit, deprecating its jealousy of authority in
trifles; he analyzes Mrs. Daveney's motives, he sifts
them like wheat before her very face, and he con-

denses, in the “ half-hour's talk,” almost the history of
her moral life since her marriage. He is a very old
friend; he has been associated with her in ber hus-
band's district for years ; he has seen her children
grow up, and he loves them.
He loves Eleanor best, though: we naturally feel
most for those we pity.
And Eleanor-she is riding side-by-side with Major
Frankfort. Ah, take heed, Frankfort-she has, as yet,
no thought of thee!
It was like a picture of a hunting-party in old
times. Eleanor revived to new life on horseback, and
her bright bay steed rejoiced in the precious burden
he bore. She took the lead with Frankfort, leaving her
father with Marion and Ormsby. Poor Ormsby, he
deserved some credit for letting Frankfort arrange
the
reins for Marion; but the rosy lips were pouting, the
eyes reproachfully turned towards him, and he could
not resist the temptation of joining her in the avenue
when her father fell back to see that the escort fol-
lowing them was well armed.
Start not, reader, at the notion of ladies riding for
pleasure with armed escorts in a heathen land. Many
à time and oft have I traversed these enamelled plains,
too much exhilarated with the grandeur of the scene
to think of danger.
Eleanor, in her dark riding-habit, fitting 80 as
admirably to display the graceful shape and easy
attitude of the rider, a large, simple straw hat shad-
ing the face, over which, under the influence of the
refreshing breeze, a hue like the inside of a delicate
shell was stealing, was a delightful picture to Frank-
fort, who had often longed to draw her from the shade
she always sought; and Marion, in a riding-dress like
her sister's, but with an ostrich plume wound round her
hat, resembled one of those saucy dames, who “ went

a hunting” in the merry days of vicious, pleasant,
witty Charles the Second.
They scarce drew rein for four miles. There was
no spoor of Kafirs, the hills were silent, and there
were herds of bucks gathered on the plains. The
tribes were evidently sitting ominously still.
The Trails and Mrs. Daveney were watching at the
gateway when the riders came in sight. Those left
behind were always anxious till the wanderers came
back again, in these uncertain days.
The time of truce was passed by the settlers in the
district in “ making ready for the expectant foe-in
Kafirland the people were collecting cattle, arms, and
ammunition. It was the lull that precedes the storm,
and the community at Annerley knew it. All there
.calmly but resolutely awaited the crisis. The women,
children, and old men, occupying the wagon bivouac,
were fain to be content with the news they received
occasionally from their friends at their homesteads;
the Trails kept the even tenor of their way in the
school, and among the humble people of the set-
tlement; and Ormsby, unable to restrain his passion
for Marion, was in a serious dilemma between his
wish to remain and Frankfort's advice to him to rejoin.
his regiment at once, if he was not in earnest.
“ In earnest, my good fellow!” exclaimed the incor-
rigible flirt ; "you don't suppose I am in earnest, do
you
?"
“Then, if you are not in earnest, according to the
world's acceptance of the term,” replied Frankfort,
“you should go. If
you
remain under such circum-
stances, I can neither consider you as a man of honour
nor an honourable man.”
Ormsby was selfish, as you know; but he had a great
respect for Frankfort, who, without making a fuss
about being a “man of honour,” was an honourable
man. Ah, reader! there is a wide difference between
the two, as perhaps you have found before now.

JASPER LYLE:
That evening Ormsby went to Mr. Daveney, and
solicited leave to pay his addresses to his daughter
Marion.
Mr. Daveney desired time to think ; but, at any
rate, refused to hear of a definite engagement until
the
young
soldier had reconsidered the subject, and
written home to his father for "consent and approba-
tion.”. Nay, the honest-hearted settler-Mr. Daveney
and his wife often referred to themselves as settlers-
would have had the young man return to his regi-
ment without delay, that he might try the test of time
and absence, before Marion was even consulted ; but
despatches suddenly arrived, bringing accounts of the
result of the great meeting with the chiefs, who, con-
trary to their usual practice, breathed nothing but
war and defiance in the very teeth of the authorities.
It was clear, the borders of the colony could not be
passed with any chance of safety. There seemed no
alternative now but to await the reiteration of the
war-cry, and stand to arms from Port Elizabeth to
Natal. The Dutch in the upper districts refused
their aid in the Colonial cause, and the Kafirs chuckled
at hearing that the Amahulu and the Amaglezi
(the Boers and the English)—were “barking at each
other like dogs."
The little episode of which Marion was the heroine
had been the means of bringing Eleanor and Frankfort
into nearer communion than during the first week of
their acquaintance. The young widow's gravity of man-
ner was little changed, but the deep melancholy was
gradually giving way before the influence of a mind
that opened its stores chiefly for her. She did not
talk more than usual, but she listened, and Frankfort
felt he had gained a vantage-ground,
He kept it, too. Like Scheherazade in the “Arabian
Nights,” he always contrived, when he quitted this fair,
sad creature's side, to leave something for her mind
to rest upon; some subject which she would wish
regumed. I am wrong in using the word "contrived”

--that was not Frankfort's “way”—but the interest
Eleanor took in all that he so pleasantly and intelli-,
gently discussed invested it with an additional charm
to himself.
Meanwhile, father, mother, friends, looked on, and
hoped that a light was dawning on the horizon of
Eleanor's clouded life, and they rejoiced. They had
no doubt of Frankfort's honesty of purpose. His
bearing and his sentiments were alike frank, just, kind,
manly, and single-minded. He was not blindly, pas-
sionately in love with the soft voice and mournful eyes
that had certainly at first enchained his attention-
bewitched him, as some would have it-but he was
most deeply interested in the young widow; anxious
to penetrate the cloud of sorrow that even in his
presence shaded her brow, and, as he reluctantly ad-
mitted to himself, created a gulf between her and
him, which he only hoped to remove or pass over.
Every night, as he paced the avenue after the sentinels
were posted, did he resolve on openly addressing Mr.
Daveney on the subject of his widowed daughter's
position; but the resolve faded into air, when he recon-
sidered what had passed between himself and Eleanor
in the day. He had two weighty reasons for pausing.
He was by no means sure of Eleanor's sentiments
towards himself, and he had a dread, though this he
was unwilling to acknowledge, in his own mind, of
lifting the veil of mystery with which he felt more
than he knew she was invested.
But as soon as he did gain courage to sound the
depths of his own heart, he recognized the duty he owed
to her, to her family, especially his gracious, generous
host, and to himself; and he resolved that another sun
should not set till the question, on which he felt whole
years of happiness must depend, was decided.
The dew was on the leaves and the sun high in the
east, when Eleanor Lyle came through the cool hall
into the glowing verandah on the morning when

Frankfort had at last resolved on requesting an inter-
view with her father.
He had a very strong idea that she liked him.
She was
one who had evidently suffered from the
treachery or the evil humour of man; everything she
said or did was tinged with some fatal remembrancė.
She shrunk from the sound of the name she bore;
she could not believe in Ormsby's faith; she did not
openly ignore all honourable feelings in the other
sex, but she clearly set no store by men's promises
to women. She did not volunteer these strong opi-
nions--they were drawn from her; but Frankfort
soon discovered that it was he only who could elicit
them. Yes, she most certainly liked him-she had
a good opinion of him, too, he fancied; he had tested
it at times in his own quiet way.
They met together in the verandah this fine, warm,
balmy, dewy morning, while the world was pleasantly
astir. Children creeping out of the wagon bivouacs.
with "shining morning faces;" herd-boys coming by
the house with baskets of meelies and fine burnished
English tins of milk; graceful Fingo girls, with fresh-
gathered pumpkins and cool green water-melons on
their heads; Mrs. Trail's Bechuana nursemaid and
ruddy children—such contrasts to their dusky Abigail
- loaded with heather, lilac, pink, and white, and
purple ; and then there swung out from the old mul-
berry-tree in the vineyard the call to prayers in the
school. The people from the wagons hurried off; the
front garden and avenue were deserted; there was not
a sound but the whooming of a great bee that was
always rifling the doricas and invading the roses and
convolvuluses, till the “morning hymn” swelled on
the warm, still air in solemn chorus, and true, though
unstudied, harmony.
They descended the steps, and sought the shade of
the avenue.
It was flanked on either side by a little
nursery of trees; there was a good deal of low bram-
ble and brushwood, which made almost a labyrinth of

the ground; but there was a shady spot beside a
silver thread of water that stole from the rill irrigat-
ing the vineyard, and Frankfort and Eleanor were
bent on gathering water-cresses for breakfast. I doubt
if people not interested in each other would have
thought of taking all this trouble for a few green
leaves; but these two went about it as if they had
laid out for themselves a serious employment.
It was a delicious nook. Eleanor had even laughed
at the scramble she had had in reaching it, and sat
down heated and fatigued with her descent of the
bank, down which Frankfort might have made an
excuse to lift her if he had so pleased—he would have
been pleased to do som
but he did not; there was
such a divine purity about this young and graceful
and subdued being, that, had he been in a desert
with her, he would have felt that it was she who
drew the barrier between them, which he dared not
pass.
All this may seem very anomalous when you
think
how Frankfort dreaded to lift the veil between them;
but, remember, his doubts were the issue of lonely
reflective hours in Eleanor's presence. He grieved
at the secret sorrow that oppressed her, and bound
with its heavy fetters the joyous impulses of youth.
How handsome he looked as he cast himself on the
green-sward beside the little rill, his hat laid aside,
his open, honest countenance brightened with enjoy-
ment at the radiance of the morning and the fragrant
beauty of this green retreat, with the shy retiring Elea-
nor actually smiling in his face, as he fanned her with
the broad green leaves of arums growing in the
shining watercourse. Ah, it was the honesty of that
face that made it so handsome! Eleanor was not one
to be attracted by mere statuesque beauty-she had
forsworn love for ever-she was anticipating peace
in this abjuration of love, when the kindly eyes and
approving smile of this true-hearted soldier beamed
on her with an effect like sunlight on the hills in Kafir-

land, scathed by the lightning. There are patches on
which no green grass will ever again grow—desolate
spots in the great oasis; but these are overlooked as
the herald of a new day touches them with his glory,
and casts all that is unsightly into shade.
Gems of dew glittered on the mossy bank-flowers,
rainbow-hued, were opening their chalices to the
genial influence of day—a magnificent corallodendrum
spread its scarlet-tufted boughs over a low rustic
bench, and they seated themselves together under
this fine canopy. Eleanor had desired a little Fingo
boy to follow her with a basket for the cresses-
Frankfort thought he obeyed his mistress much too
soon.
She had taken off the large straw hat-Frankfort
held it for her; her fine hair was slightly disordered ;
there was a light in her eye, a colour in her cheek, her
lover-we must call him such now-had never seen
before. That young face, that candid smile-nay,
the smile sometimes broke into a low musical laugh.
Ah! could the demon of self-reproach be lurking
beneath all this bewitching feminine charm ?
Frankfort felt that the time must soon come when
he should ask her for her history. He had resolved to
learn it from herself. He longed to pour balm into
the wounded heart; he was growing hourly less afraid
of hearing the truth. He was just, too,-he felt that
no offer of confidence could be made to him till he
solicited it.
He would do so now. She sent her little dusky page
to the rill and rose to follow him. She was tying on
her hat, when a slender chain encircling her throat
caught in the strings, and she unwittingly drew it
from her bosom. Frankfort saw suspended to it the
miniature he had found in the vineyard.
He felt emboldened, -he ventured to touch it.
She made no remonstrance, but with a deep sigh
would have replaced it.

Frankfort held it fast. His hand did not shake, but
his heart beat.
How often does a sudden impulse bring to a crisis
what has cost us many hours of forethought ! and how
often-oh! how often !-does the one great event of a
life hinge upon some trifle unforeseen! A look, a
word, an unexpected meeting, will often remove the
doubts and agonies of years, when but for what we call
accident, there might have been no meeting, no blessed
exchange of look or word.
Frankfort felt that this was a crisis in his life.
“Eleanor," said he, “whose child was this ?”
Mine, Major Frankfort,” she replied, " mine ; he
died, and she broke into a passion of tears. He
drew close to her she suffered him to take her hand.
All his doubts faded at sight of those fast-falling tears,
-those sobs of agony.
Not now, not yet,” said she; “the bitterness of
death is past ; but you have touched a chord which
has vibrated through my soul, and I must have time
to recover my trembling senses.”
She took the arm offered her; they returned by an
open pathway to the house, the little Fingo following,
carrying his basket piled full of fresh and glittering
leaves, and in his arms a quantity of arums, the large
water-lilies of South Africa.
Mrs. Daveney and Marion were in the entrance-
Since Ormsby's avowal of his attachment,
Marion was more constantly at her mother's side. I

revived her best impulses, and removed the tares of
false pride and self-glorification from her heart. Ah,
kind, useful man, there be many that the world calls
as good as thee;" but there are ways of ministering
God's word, “the small rain upon the tender herb,

away in the torrent of over-zeal and self-righteousness.
It is such as Mr. Trail who pioneer the way for the
timid, and keep the ground for the weak. Verily, it is
the meek-spirited who possess the earth; they consider
the evil of their own nature in reproving others, and
obtain concessions to their humility which would be
denied to their assumption of supremacy.
How dark and unfathomable are the depths of our
own hearts, till the Day-star from on high sheds its
divine ray on our souls, and teaches us to guide others
by conquering ourselves !
But it strikes me you may think me prosy,—too
fond of dissecting people's motives. Pardon me, it is
my way, my fault, my habit,-excuse it if it does not
suit
you,
and
“Ah!” cries the worldly-minded reader,
Eleanor's tact and candour, a very delicate point has
been settled; confidence has been established among
all; Ormsby declares he never should have known his
own mind if he had not been brought to the point; he
was never so happy in his life.”
In a word, you will exclaim, “All's well that ends
well.” Certainly, that is one of the secrets of self-
gratulation and content in this work-a-day world.
But do not jump at conclusions--we are not near
the end of our story yet.
Mrs. Daveney saw traces of tears in Eleanor's eyes.
She glanced at Frankfort, and observed that his face
was full of serious thought; but, albeit Marion had
always been the favourite, so to speak, the mother had
every confidence in Eleanor. How often mothers love
one child best, but trust another most!
Mr. Trail had brought this mother and eldest
daughter nearer to each other than they had been for
years; and Mrs. Daveney anticipated Eleanor's con-
fidence ere the morning passed. The latter did not
appear at the breakfast-table, and the kind, anxious
father went to satisfy himself that she was not ill.
There was a shade of anxiety on his brow, and as he

passed his wife, on leaving the table at the call of some
farm-servant, he whispered to her that Eleanor wished
to see her.
The result of their conference was the resolution on
Eleanor's part, with the sanction of father and mother,
to "tell Major Frankfort the history of the miniature,
and more if he desired it."
Light broke on Eleanor as her mother reminded her
of many trifling incidents, plainly manifesting Frank-
fort's partiality for her. These, connected with what
had lately passed between the young widow and the
generous, candid soldier, left no doubt on her mind of
the nature of his regard for her. She began to weigh
every look; she suddenly remembered he had ad-
dressed her as “Eleanor," she had been too much
startled by the unexpected allusion to her lost darling
to think of anything
but the revival of the bitter
pang.
Then Frankfort's violent emotion was so at variance
with his usual delicacy. She was half-frightened to
believe that he loved her. They had spent three weeks
together under the same roof. It might truly be said
that the light of a new day had dawned upon her, so
insensibly had Frankfort's influence stolen over her,
and sweetened an existence, of late so wretched and
forlorn.

To have seen the settlement of Annerley, in the early

you known nothing of the terrible elements gathering
silently around, that Mercy and Peace had met
together, that Righteousness and Truth had kissed
each other.
“ In the deep noontide, in the sunset's hush,"
the children's voices chimed together in the busy

shady, trellised passage; the cattle herds grew care-
less, and dozed away the dreamy day; the ladies of the
family party suffered themselves to hope that the dove

with the olive branch was winging her from the
mountain haunts of the unhappy heathen. Ormsby
was hourly profiting by his association with his ener-
getic, intelligent, active-minded host. The “ maxims"
he had been accustomed to laugh at as “Frankfort's
platitudes” were household words here. The fresh,
innocent mind of Marion was a new and beautiful
study, and he was a little, a very little, afraid of Mrs.
Daveney. He was not quite sure that he liked her
she was evidently inclined to keep him in order, and
then she was "dreadfully clever.”
So complete was the quiet reigning in this beautiful
wilderness, that even Mr. Daveney began to think the
chiefs had held council, and determined on prolonging
the truce, owing to the lateness of the season, the
corn being yet unripe in the districts between the
Buffalo and Keiskama rivers. The two officers were
awaiting his expected despatch to rejoin their regi-
ments, if ordered to do so, as they had considered it
right, on so long and unforeseen detention, to “report”
their whereabouts to their commanding officer.
You will think it all very novel-like and romantic
to have brought these delightful, handsome, intelligent
officers into the wilderness, and established them there
with an obliging mamma, and a soldierlike host, and
two charming daughters—you will consider it all
perfectly correct in romance, but not quite so true to
nature. Ah! if you had seen the world at home and
abroad as I have done, dear reader, you would have
discovered that romance and reality are much more
nearly allied than untravelled folks imagine. I as-
sure you, the picture of the Annerley settlement is
not exaggerated, though I admit that the family I
have selected to introduce to you is not of common
stamp, even in England; but there is plenty of space
for more of them in Southern Africa, and there is so
little room in England, that vice jostles against virtue,
and often has the best of it.

Frankfort and Eleanor were again seated on the
rustic bench, beneath the scarlet-tufted coralloden-
drum. He could not doubt any longer that he had
at least touched her heart-how deep the impression
was, he could not tell. In her manner to him she was
like a child, all joyousness ; at times smiling, almost
gay, and occasionally confiding, but as yet not so in
matters connected with herself. Sometimes she would
half promise to “talk of herself” to him; then the
time came, and something would intervene. If he
had shrunk from asking her previous history, she
dreaded to tell it. She said so, but added, for his com-
fort—“Fear not, dear Major Frankfort; you may pity
me as unfortunate, and contemn me as weak, but you
will not have occasion to condemn. I am only a wronged,
deceived, and, for a long time, most unhappy woman;
and if you should despise me for my misfortunes,
which you may do”—she put her hand on his lips, as
he was about to interrupt her—"you will not love me
less, though you may not choose me for
your
wife.”
He took her hand in his, and pressed it with a fer-
vency, eloquent but silent.
“Ah!" said she, shuddering, “it is so long since I
was happy, that, albeit you present the cup, Ì hold it
to my lips, trembling lest it fall.”
She took the miniature of her boy from her bosom.
Frankfort bent over her, and gazed upon the angel
face, dimmed with the young mother's tears ; but
though she wept, it was not with that passionate
anguish he had witnessed before. He drew her to
him—he ventured to kiss away those slow-falling
tears he had told her that morning that he loved her.
“ Tell me," at last whispered Frankfort, trembling and
cold with
suspense, 6 who was this child's father "
“I could not nerve myself to tell you my
sad story,"
replied Eleanor. “I have written it. My father will

already suspected, that I have loved and been deceived;
but you have yet to decide whether I am a fitting

Frankfort withdrew his hand from Eleanor's. He
paced the walk in great agitation.
She waited till he approached her again. “Pity
me,” said she, rising. "Ah! it has been a terrible
task to make this revelation to you. Do me justice

He drew her back. “Shall we meet again, Eleanor ?”

“Alas !" she answered, “I fear you will decide

JASPER LYLE:
CHAPTER XI.
THE
TORTURE.
It was in the month of December, 184, that Lee
and Martin Gray established themselves as traders at
Umlala's kraal, 'in Kafirland. The reader has been
given to understand that Lee had no intention of
domesticating himself with the savages, albeit he
adapted himself at once to the customs of the tribe,
persuading the chief and his councillors that he had
been induced to join them from a desire to better his
condition, as well as aid and advise them in their plans
and erations against the colony. He was too well
acquainted with the Kafir character to attempt to
impose on them by professing disinterested motives,
for on these he knew they would place no reliance; but
by fixing himself as a trader among them, he could in
the first place bide his time for carrying out his inten-
tions of joining the Dutch ; and while doing so, lay up
a fund for future pecuniary wants or emergencies. To
Brennard it was his interest to be a faithful agent.
To do Lee justice, he had no thought of fraud in
money matters, and from the traders to the eastward
he easily gathered intelligence of the Dutch farmers'
movements, from the districts of Natal, and beyond
the Draakberg, to an appointed spot between the
branches of the Orange River, where a general gather-
ing of emigrant Boers was to take place previous to
treking in a body to Orichstad, a settlement beyond the
25th degree of south latitude, and therefore considered
by them as not subject to the British Government.
With an air of good faith, he opened a correspond-
ence in cipher with Brennard, who, at his suggestion,

189
placed an agent on the Stormberg mountains, and
thus increased his contraband traffic by disposing of
arms and ammunition to the Boers, who, assisted by
these traitors, grew sanguine in their hopes and deter-
mined in their preparations. So blind, indeed, was the
colonial government to the real state of affairs, that
wagons containing guns actually passed the outskirts
of the frontier garrisons, on their way to the Modder
and Bilt River settlements, while smaller arms were
landed at the Umtata, and conveyed to a depôt at the
foot of the northern extremity of the Stormberg moun-
tains.
The Dutch soon felt the influence of a master mind
at work. A secret communication was set on foot
between Lee and the rebel leader; but Lee was cau-
tious in his policy, since, to be suspected by the Kafirs
as anything but a trader, would be to draw down
attention from the missionaries, who were, when per-
mitted, in communication with the tribes most distant
from the colony. Those within the border were be-
coming every day more lawless. It was said by some
of these teachers, in after times, that they had had an
idea of some men of suspicious character living among
Umlala's people; but having no tangible proof of their
existence, having only the word of Kafir spies to
depend on, they
could take no steps in the matter,
either by offering advice to the Kafirs, near whom the
poor missionaries and their families were living in
dread and peril of their lives, or by giving information
to the authorities, who were too remote to act.
Lee liked the life he led; the form of government so
favourable to the doctrine that "might is right,"
though tempered in some measure by general opinion,
in which he succeeded in gaining a voice; the total
absence of all moral discipline except as regarded
women, with whom Lee, as he said, had no mind to
trouble himself-a life of ease, yet of excitement, the
spacious and beautiful country, all conspired to render
his temporary location desirable; but while he thus

rested on his arms, his mind was ceaselessly at
work.
With that shrewdness which stands bad men in stead
of deeper knowledge, Lee had long penetrated the
weaker outworks, so to speak, of Gray's heart; keenly
susceptible, of facile mind, and imbued with a vanity as
natural to men as to women, he had easily yielded to
the gentle influences and watchful solicitude of Ama-
yeka. Lee at once profited by this “fancy,” as he
called it, to turn it to his own account, and used every
means to encourage it.
Desirous of personal conference with the Dutch
agent at the station in the Stormberg, he had no mind
to be attended in such expeditions by Gray ; yet he
knew well that without some counter-charm, the de-
serter, on being left to himself, would at once appeal,
through the missionaries, to the mercy of the British
Government. True, there was the oath which had
bound the three traders together in solemn compact ;
but paramount to all other considerations was Gray's
horror of his own treachery and disloyalty as a soldier.
However desirous he might be of keeping the compact,
as regarded Brennard and Lee, inviolate, the issue of
Gray's surrender would be keen inquiry, and conse-
quently a fatal result to the chief convict's schemes.
Like a good man's neglected garden, the surface of the
young deserter's character presented a wilderness of
weeds and briers, but below were seeds long sown,
some dead, but some struggling, with every capability
of fruition, when the soil should fall under the hand
of the labourer. All considerations, Lee felt, would
vanish before the wish to retrieve the past, to become,
in Gray's own words, “ an honest man again.”
Evening time in Kafirland! The sun has all day
long been glowing on the river, lighting it up like
burnished steel; the trees motionless, the birds on list-
less wing, screening themselves within the shady

boughs. Now the mountain peaks are blending their
purple summits with a crimson sky, and the last rays
of light deck the clouds in the west as with a glory!
Lo! it fades, and the heavens are veiled with a mantle
of pale grey ; the stream begins to murmur, responsive
to the breeze that stirs its waters; the birds congregate
in the balmy air before seeking their rest; the count-
less herds move slowly homeward, panting for the re-
freshment of cool water brooks; and the women, some
singly, some in parties in single file, trip across the
plains to draw water, as is their custom at eventide.
The picture reminds one of what one reads of in the
patriarchal days.
Lee and Gray sat upon a bank that sloped to the
river, a tributary of the Great Kei-would you had a
map, dear reader, to trace the country I would fain
describe. Peals of laughter stirred the air. Beneath
the over-arching boughs a crowd of dusky Nereides
were taking their evening
bath, swimming, diving, pull-
ing each other in sport below the surface of the stream,
swinging from branch to branch with amazing activity
and grace, and tossing up fountains of spray on the
elder women, who stood silently filling their calabashes
at the clear pools between the stones at the drift.
“Amayeka, Amayeka, izapa, izapa (come hither),”
cried two or three of the younger girls, as Amayeka,
apparently unconscious of the gathering below, and
with slow step, vacant air, and pitcher on her head,
moved along the opposite bank, followed by her little
attendant, a tiny meercat, which I have hitherto for-
gotten to mention.
It is the wisest-looking little thing you can imagine,
is this meercat of South Africa. Its keen, restless
black eye looks right into your own, and asks ques-
tions as plainly almost as speech could do. It has a
way of setting itself up bolt-upright, and turning its
head from one object to another with the most in-
quisitive air, and adapts itself to the habits of its
owners in a manner perfectly marvellous. I remember

JASPER LYLE:
one which, though not very young when taken near
the Orange River, became domesticated like a dog,
and was far more sociable than a cat. I think I see
it now, sitting at a garden-gate facing a parade ground,
on which, at stated hours of the day, troops were wont
to exercise. As the warning bugle sounded, it took
up its position; when the regiment fell in, the meer-
cat placed itself in front of the line; when the men
marched, the little beast advanced in front of the
column, halted with the troops, and when they were
again in line, sat down before them, and watched the
commanding officer with a knowing air quite inde-
scribable. At the close of a drill it would head the
band to the limits of the ground; and when all were
dismissed, would return to the house. In the cold
weather, if suspicious of any visitors, it would roll
itself into a ball, and squeeze itself into some corner,
where it could not easily be reached; but it loved
best to sit before the fire, with its paws on the fender,
surveying the family group, of which it was the pet,
with its sharp twinkling eyes, and bending its ears
knowingly to every unaccustomed sound.
Such too was the creature that trotted beside
Amayeka, now and then seating itself before her, and
glancing from its mistress to the nymphs in the river,
as if to remind her she was called; but she went
on, deaf to the cry “ Izapa;” and Gray watched her
till she disappeared behind a tuft of trees overhanging
the upper drift. Soon afterwards Lee joined some
young warriors, with whom he had been engaged all
the morning in firing at a mark, and who now sum-
moned him to their employment of casting bullets at a
fire under the rocks; Gray rose also, and descended
by the bank.
Amayeka was seated by the river's brink, with the
meercat at her feet; twilight lingered long, and the
young moon shed its first ray of silver on the water,
when a loose stone rolled past her; there was a light

tread, a rustle in the branches of a long-tressed weep-
ing willow, and Gray's hand fell on her shoulder.
But in a copse above lay the wizard Amani, with
his elements of witchcraft gathered round him---strips
of skin from the golden back of the deadly puff-adder,
the hood of a cobra capello, some poisonous roots
steeped in gall, the forefinger of a dead Fingo herds-
man, and the skull of a Hottentot, in which last he
was busily mixing up these ghastly charms with a
cement of blood and clay.
He had long had some notion of Amayeka's inter-
course with the younger convict, or trader, as Amani,
like the rest of his tribe, supposed the deserter to be,
and he now gloated at his discovery.
Of the two, he hated Lee the most, for he could
discriminate between the energy of the one and the
passive sorrow_stamped on the countenance of the
other. Then Doda was an object of special abhor-
rence; for Doda, when he could, pleaded the white
man's cause. Amayeka, from her acquirements, in-
vested her father with a power he would not otherwise
have possessed ; by her intelligence the wizard often
found his plans forestalled, his prophecies doubted;
but he had besides a deeper source of hatred against
her, for a true Kafir she was not. Through her veins
ran the blood of white forefathers; her ancestress was
one of those unfortunates who had been stranded at
the Umbeesam River when the Grosvenor was wrecked.
To her lineage Amayeka owed her soft, though short,
and wavy hair, her complexion of fairer hue than is
usual among the Amakosa race, her delicately-chiselled
outline of feature, and her falling shoulders. Her
limbs I have described as exquisitely moulded, and the
voice musically sweet.
But although pleased to refer to her white ances-
tress, whom she faintly remembered, shrunk, bronzed,
withered with age, and degraded to the state of a
savage, Amayeka’s habits were those of the wild
tribe to which she belonged; but tender-hearted,

JASPER LYLE:
with something about her of the English attribute
gratitude, unknown amongst Kafirs, some of those
old associations, whose roots lie deepest in the human
heart, had led her to take an interest in Lee and
Gray when she first heard their voices in the midnight
solitude of the Witches' Krantz. Lee's ungracious
manner soon repelled her; but Gray's dependence on
her good offices as guide drew her towards him; and
now, kindred, tribe, allegiance, all were forgotten in
her passion for her white lover.
They sat together in silence for some moments,
Amayeka resting her head on Gray's shoulder, her
dusky locks mingling with his brown hair, which had
grown long during his exile, and would have given to
his countenance an air of effeminacy, but for the
moustache shading his upper lip.
Horrible wizard! what a contrast to these youthful
beings must thou have presented, leaning thy clay-
painted face from its green covert! Gall-bladders,
jackals' tails, and the polished teeth of monkeys,
wolves, and tigers, made the head inconceivably hide-
ous; and the great eyes glittering in the dusk would
have startled the lovers had they looked up.
But they had no thought beyond their own vague des-
tinies. The shades of night deepened, they could hear
the girls and children chanting monotonously on their
way to the kraals, the stream rippled past them un-
heeded, the guanas plashing merrily among the little
pools, and the meercat nestled closer to Amayeka's feet.
“They say, Amayeka," whispered Gray," that war
is proclaimed in the colony, and that soldiers are
marching towards the Kei.'
“Oute!” (“ Hear!”) said Amayeka, who often used
this Kafir prefix. " The white man's word to kill has
not yet gone forth. The red soldiers are scattered
through the bush. The Amakosas sleep with an open
eye, but are not yet up. Soon a voice will be heard
on the mountains, and answered from the valleys, and
the war-cry will fill the land.”

childish way:
There was a pause.
“Amayeka," said Gray, “what will you do when
your tribe is roused ?. You cannot stay here. You
must fly.”
“And leave you ?" asked Amayeka, in a tone in-
describably mournful.
“I love you, Amayeka ; you must fly with me.”
“You love me, Martin, you love me?" repeated the
Kafir girl, in distinct and sweetly-toned English, as if
she had just acquired a knowledge of the value at-
tached to the language, because her lover understood
her at once; and then she went on in an innocent,
Ukutanda, diyatanda, diyatandiva,
diyakutanda”-“To love, I love, I am loved, I will love;"
and laughing gleefully at applying an old lesson to a
purpose hitherto unthought of, she forgot the war-cry
-the red soldiers--she began to teach Gray the lesson,
and when he had repeated it over and over again, to
her infinite satisfaction, she tried to look into his
countenance by the dusky light, and laughed softly.
“But, Amayeka," said Gray again, tell me, will
you go with me from this wild tribe of yours ?”
“ Go!" said Amayeka, her low laugh turned into a
sigh-" And whither ? Leave the land, and my
people to sit in the ashes ! Cowards only fly from a
burning kraal; the brave stand by to quench the
flame, and help the ruined."
“ But the red soldiers are my countrymen,” said
Gray; “you would not have me fight them !"
Amayeka tried to understand her lover's notions of
treachery; but the question resolved itself into these
simple words“ Ah! you must not go ; you belong to
us now."
The deserter groaned.
She took his hand, bent her head upon it, and kissed
it with mute tenderness.
They sat in silence till night fell, and a pale shim-
mer on the stream only served to make the darkness
more palpable. But Amani's eyes still glared upon

them fiercely, and he hated them with a deeper bitter-
ness than ever.
They rose together, and walked leisurely by the
waterside.
The wizard left his covert, and, gliding along the
bank above, peeped over it occasionally to watch them.
Sometimes they stopped on their way and whispered.
He could hear Amayeka's voice falter, and he cursed
her knowledge of the white man's language. Once,
just where the moon's rays glinted, they stood, and
Amani could see in Amayeka's hands something glitter-
ing. He recognized it as a steel chain, which he had
observed round Gray's neck, with a knife of many
blades suspended by it. How often he had coveted
it! He heard the knife drop; Gray was unconscious
of its fall. The Kafir girl picked it up, and gave it to
her lover. Little thought Amayeka of the great need
in which that knife would help her within a few hours.
At the lower drift Amayeka crossed the stream.
Gray watched her over; took a keen glance up and
down, little dreaming that Amani was watching him
from a wolf-hole ten yards off; and then a low chirrup,
like the
cry of the quail, announced that all was safe
in the copse Amayeka had entered. Gray then tra-
versed the stones of the ford.
Ere long, Amani could see them emerge singly from
the covert, Amayeka taking one path, for it was not
too dark for Kafir eyes to distinguish the outline
of a woman's form, with the little meercat trotting
after her; her lover went another way, and then the
wizard, profiting by a cloud which overshadowed the
moon's silver rim for a minute or two, stepped
stealthily across; and, biding his time, sought his hut,
and retiring therein, closed the matted entrance, and
began to chant his demoniacal incantations, to the
great awe of the people assembled round their fires at
the doors of their dwellings.
Gray found Lee supping on broiled meat, and one of
poor Amayeka's coarse, sweet cakes; and Lee, after
rallying the deserter on his passion, informed him

197
that he proposed next day to start for the foot of the
mountains with Doda, who had got leave from Umlala
to guide the “ White Brother” to the trading station.
Gray was passive in the strong man's hand. If he
ever attempted remonstrance with his master-for such
he felt the elder convict to be—the latter invariably
denounced him as too weak to be vicious, swearing he
would be a knave if he dared. As to escape from such
thraldom, he could see none; and on the other side of
the picture was Amayeka, the only creature on earth
whom he loved, or who loved him. Honourable
servitude was beyond his reach at present, and in the
mean time he was pledged to Amayeka-vaguely—but
still pledged. To her he owed all the comforts of his
present sad existence, and she had many ways and
means of ministering to them ; he was bound to her
by the ties of gratitude as well as of affection ; he
pitied her, and he believed, moreover, that if he left
her, she must die-die perhaps by torture !
He sat down in the hut among the ashes of the
dying fire. Lee could not see his comrade's face, for
it was buried in his hands, bowed upon his knees ; but
the
young
man's frame shook like an aspen-tree; and
oh! the bitter agony of the voice that cried aloud,
“ God have mercy on me!”
Surely the good angels then shedding their influ-
ence on the desolate being dictated that solemn and
heart-rending appeal, and then heralded the cry to
heaven!
Lee looked at the deserter with some contempt,
but uttered no harsh word. He contented himself
with sketching out a plan for Gray's guidance on the
arrival of trading messengers between the Umzimvoo-
boo and the Witches' Krantz ; delivered to his charge
a letter in cipher, to be forwarded to Brennard, ex-
plaining the necessity of his visit to the Stormberg,
on trading "thoughts intent," and transmitting a
receipt connected with certain monetary transactions.
He also mentioned his intention of returning to
Umlala's kraal within a given time, and then, in

serio-comic phraseology, proceeded to inform Gray
that, on rejoining him, he should make a barter with
the chief for a few Kafir wives.”
"Don't be frightened, my lad," continued the reck-
less convict; “I assure you I have no intention of
interfering with you, though I must own to a little
regard for your girl on account of her white blood.
Not that I owe the country I came from anything but
a curse ; but she is a deuced deal better-looking for
her straight nose and smooth hair. The girl has good
points, and I have shared the luck if I have not the
love, for she makes good cakes, and can wash and
mend my clothes as well as any Englishwoman. I
should think, too, she was not to be had cheap; but
you can afford to give a good lot of cattle for her, eh!”
and Lee went on jeering, and puffing dagha* out of a
long wooden pipe, till Gray was too stupified with the
vapour to resent the brutality of his companion, who
having, at the opening of the conversation, drawn
from the deserter all that he could touching his posi-
tion with Amayeka, suggested finally, with apparent
good faith, that in the event of any great crisis sud-
denly taking place among Umlala's people, the lovers
should make their way to a spot, to be selected by Doda,
in the road to the Stormberg. Doda, however, was to
imagine the rendezvous was only for Lee and Gray,
and under no circumstances to be enlightened as to
the part Amayeka was to take in this episode of the
young deserter's life.
Gray was awoke the next morning by the light
streaming in through the hut door, which was ajar.
He had been late in falling asleep, and was heavy, and
disinclined to rise for the day ; but he looked out,--
the huts were yet closed, the cattle still in the kraals ;
there was profound silence on the plain,--the sun had
just gilded the eastern heights.
Gray closed the door, which had not been carefully

drawn to by Lee, who had evidently, without rousing
his comrade, departed on his journey; for the “traps
he had set in order to take with him had disappeared.
Gray cast himself down in a sort of sullen despair,
and weary thoughts of past and future disturbed his
aching brain.
Ere long the whole hamlet woke up; the cattle
came lowing from the folds, the dogs were giving
tongue, the women and girls were astir, preparing for
the hard labours of the day, building huts, hewing
wood, and tilling the ground. Several youths were
assembled on the plain, some to start on a hunting
expedition, some on marauding parties, for much fine
cattle had been brought in the preceding evening by a
foraging band, and was being paraded before Umlála,
that he might feast his eyes on the prize. The sight
was a strong temptation to the young men to try their
luck in an adjoining kloof, where it was expected some
colonial cattle had been driven by a neighbouring tribe,
ready to swear to the British authorities that they
were alike guiltless and ignorant in the matter, though
in treaty with Umlala to share the stolen property
with him if he would shelter it.
But all these preparations were brought to a stand-
szill by the unexpected appearance of the
wizard Amani,
whose great clay-painted face first emerged from the
low entrance of his hut; he crawled out of it, and
stood upright, waving an assegai with his brawny arm.
The people stood still at sight of this awful apparition,
for he was arrayed in the hideous costume peculiar to
these wretches when it is their will and pleasure to
call a solemn assembly of the tribe for the purpose of
publicly denouncing some unhappy creature, whom it
is their interest, or their inclination, to bring to a
fearful punishment, by death or torture.
The cattle-drivers went on leisurely with their herds
towards the pasture-grounds, but sat down on a near
hill-side, to see what would follow. They were mostly
boys, and were not of sufficient importance to have in-

curred the wizard's displeasure. The women laid their
implements of labour at their feet, and their children
clung to them with vague dread; the old men trem-
bled as Amani stalked past them, and the youths parted
right and left to let him go by. Amayeka, who had been
up and out before the rest, and had half-crossed the
plain with a bundle of sticks on her head, dropped her
burden in great terror, and stood paralyzed, for she
had her misgivings. The meercat seated himself
beside her, and glanced his keen black eyes rapidly to
and fro; hers were fixed on Amani, who, advancing
to Umlala’s hut, the largest in the Kraal,* drew the
chief's attention to him by a frightful yell.
I have already given you some notion of his aspect,
with its savage head-gear. A kaross of lion's skin was
slung about his short but powerful frame, the mane
forming a ruff round his huge bull-neck. The kaross
was fastened on the right shoulder, leaving the arm
free. With this he continued to wave the assegai, its
tip of highly-polished iron, and the brazen bangles on
the wrist, glinting in the morning sunshine, so bri-
liant in the Kafir summer-time. The drapery was
short enough to display the legs, which, unlike the
limbs of a Kafir, were thick and unshapely, and orna
mented, like the arms, with bangles of burnished
brass; strings of beads, of various colours, and mingled
with necklaces of animals' teeth, garnished his throat,
and round his waist, where the kaross opened,
discernible an elastic brazen belt, from which dangled
a catskin pouch, a small tortoise-shell and spoon ap-
pended for taking snuff
, a pipe of tambootie wood,
ħard almost as iron, and a variety of other articles, an
English coin, an old buckle, &c.
To the head-dress I have before described, were now
added two long feathers of the beautiful Kafir crane ;

horns, and gave the wizard an appearance more demo-
niacal than can be conceived.
He had doubtless been smoking dagha all the
night. His eyes glared with unnatural light, his
lips were parted, his white teeth gleaming between
when he uttered his unearthly cry; and as he advanced,
his movements became more excited; and finally, with
a tremendous leap in the air, he dropped as from a
height before Umlala, and writhed and gibbered like
some wretch possessed of a devil.
The chief councillors gathered the people of the
Kraal in a great circle fronting Umlala's dwelling,
which was distinguished from the rest by its size.
Most of the principal members of the tribe had gone
towards the colony as plunderers or spies, or were
scattered through the hills and valleys as scouts and
messengers ; the circle, therefore, was less extensive
than usual, -still there was a gathering of some three
hundred human beings.
There were none among these startled creatures
who would not willingly have fled had they dared, but
they knew flight or resistance were alike useless, and
they maintained an impressive silence, while Umlala
took his seat on the ground in the space within the
circle, Amani on his right hand, though slightly in the
rear, and a chief councillor on his left, preserving the
same respectful distance.
This dread silence of the crowd was only broken by
an occasional bitter laugh or wrathful exclamation
from the wizard, who, having some days before been
summoned by Umlala to prescribe for some trifling
ailment, had taken care that the medicine given, a
preparation of herbs, should not remedy the disease,
but increase it. Umlala, however, had almost for-
gotten his ailment in his exultation over the cattle
brought him by his foraging party. The wizard was
determined on reminding him of it, and came to tell
him now who had bewitched him, first as regarded his
health, and secondly his judgment, which Amani pro-

nounced at fault, from Umlala having permitted Doda
to attend the white man on a journey. 6 Whither
was the white man going? Did Umlala know his
purpose ? The white man's face was white, but his
heart was black, and what but a spy could be the boy
left behind ?
Gray, on hearing an unusual stir, crept from his
domicile, which bordered a ravine, and, plunging into a
tangled copse, made his
way
unnoticed to a little tuft
of orange-trees on the site of an old missionary station,
whence he determined on reconnoitring what was
going on. He had a just horror of Amani as an
impostor, but he had no conception of the power he
derived from his misdirected abilities, for Amani was
one of the shrewdest of his race, and possessed an evil
influence over his chief.
Gray could see the whole face of the plain, and
every figure in the semicircle spread out at his feet.
He scanned it rapidly and uneasily, and, to his infinite
dismay, discovered Amayeka. The grove in which he
sat was one of the lovers' trysting-places; and,
though the early morning was not a safe time for
meeting, he had hoped to find her there, or within
a short distance from it.
An undefinable feeling of horror stole over him;
but he had sufficient presence of mind to pause and
watch the proceedings. Whatever might be the
result, he mourned his wretched position, not en-
tirely for his own sake-indeed at this moment self
was farthest from his thoughts. But what could this
strange meeting portend? Mischief, he knew; but
who was to be the victim ? Naturally his alarm was
connected with the unhappy girl, who had been his
only friend of late. Her father was absent, her
mother had years before vanished from the face of the
earth, that is, perished in the bush, whither she had
been carried in severe sickness, and left there to die
or be devoured by the wild beasts roaming there, it
was never ascertained which. After a lapse of time,

some scattered bones were found, but these were left
to whiten and fall to dust.
Gray climbed the tallest orange-tree, and looked
down from its clustering boughs. He could not dis-
tinguish Amayeka's features, but her head drooped,
her arms hung listlessly down, and at her side, in the
begging attitude so peculiar to these tiny brutes, sat
the meercat, as if beseeching pity.
She looked so friendless, so helpless, yet so far
above the other girls, who, forgetting their terror
in excitement, were chattering and whirling about
near her, that Gray could hardly resist his im-
pulse to descend the hill, cross the glen, and
hurry
to the scene of action; but he had had sufficient
experience of Kafir habits to feel that he could do no
good by rushing into the midst of the excited assembly.
Indistinct sounds reached him, and he could see the
people were every moment becoming more earnest
as they watched the wizard, who continued to rock
himself to and fro, gibbering and screeching. At
length Amani suddenly sprung up, and rolled his fierce
orbs round the circle.
Miserable victims of a power, which owns no law,
a superstition based on cruelty and vice! How many
quailed before the assegai as it was again waved aloft!
Unhappy wretch !! who risked thy life to bring the
poor settlers' cattle to thy selfish chieftain's kraal,
dost thou think thou art discovered-doomed-be-
cause thou hast secreted in a wooded glen part of the
plunder for thyself wherewith to buy thy wife?
Thou boy warrior, of the strong arm and supple
limbs, in form like a young Apollo, does the fearful
wizard know, too, that thou hast fixed thy will
upon the child of one of his foes, for he has many ?
Thou girl of a laughing eye and merry voice, does
thy blood turn cold as thou rememberest the day
when, resting from thy tillage in the meelie garden,
thou didst. mock the wizard, forgetting those were
near thee who would seek his favour by betraying

thee? Aged woman, with palsied head and shrivelled
features, almost blind, too, but not deaf, art thou
dreading his vengeance, because thou call'st to mind
that he, by whose rude couch thou hast been watching all
the night, and striving to aid in pain and sickness with
thy poor herbal medicines, is one whom Amani hates ?
Thou mother, with a baby on thy shoulder, why are
thy lips compressed, thy brow with anguish stamped ?
Dost thou quail at thought of thy tall son, who is
betrothed to Umlala's daughter, the child of that
Gaika wife, whose feet the great chief gashed and
crippled, searing the gory wounds with red-hot
assegais, because Amani, the wizard, denounced her
as untrue ?
Such scenes as these had at times been partially
detailed to Gray, but he had had no evidence of their
reality.
The crowd, in their eager fear, spread out like a fan,
as though each member meditated an escape ; but a
loud summons from the principal councillor drew
them round their chief, and all doubts were soon dis-
pelled as to the real victim of the day.
Amani, having held his incantations over the Hot-
tentot's skull and its contents, dipped the assegai
therein, and, drawing it out dripping with the fiendish
potion, began to wave it slowly before him. Tor-
mentor that he was ! he pointed it for a minute or
two at the trembling girlish mimic. Did he know of
her delinquency ? She bore the ordeal with the insen-
sibility of a statue, and the wizard passed her by.
Some, utterly unconscious of offence, were inwardly
startled when they found the sharp-bladed weapon
within an inch of their breasts; but their dignity
never forsook them. Each awaited his fate with out-
wardly unshaken nerves, and then watched the
weapon
as it passed them by to tantalize or condemn another
victim.

All this could be distinctly seen by Gray. He was
breathless-cold dews poured down his face—his teeth
cbattered with horror and suspense—he covered his
face with his hands.
A shout !—was it of exultation ?-pierced the air,
and penetrated his very brain. He looked again,
shuddering.
Amayeka was in the hands of two fiendish women,
witch-doctresses, confederates with Amani. The circle
was broken-the throng were gathered closely together.
Amani was standing up, gibbering and declaiming to
the nearest listeners. Gray could distinguish a shrill
scream from Amayeka.
Once again he bent his gaze upon the frightful
picture.
Amani's glittering wand was again in motion, the
witches were tearing open Amayeka's dress, the bead
bodice, of which she had been so proud, was scat-
tered in shreds on the ground; and oh, unhappy
Gray! behold the proof—the witness in Amani's accu-
sation. They draw from the depths of her bosom,
appended to a bit of reim secured round her waist,
the steel chain thou gavest her last night!
He comprehended all instantly, dropped from his
leafy covert, leaped into the ravine, and, scrambling
through bush and brier, rushed across the plain, and
overtook the hags as they were bearing off their
victim to a fire in a hollow behind Umlala's great hut.
Shocked, frightened, bewildered, unarmed, still he
followed with the crowd. He could hear Amayeka's
cries of agony, and the poor meercat seeing him,
stopped, awaiting his white friend's approach with an
eye of wonderment and fear.
Once only the eye of Gray met Amayeka's; as
the unhappy girl was dragged to the bottom of the
hollow, she caught a glin.pse of her lover on the
mound above. She made à desperate struggle to
shake off her persecutors; but had she succeeded, not
one of the tribe-partly from superstition, partly from

dread of the consequences to themselves—dared have
lifted a finger to assist her.
Gray was frantic. He rushed back to Umlala,
and the white man threw himself at the feet of the
brutal savage. He lifted up his hands in humble
supplication.
Umlala sat motionless. Not even his eye gave
sign that he saw the supplicator; and Amani grinned
silently like a demon at his fallen foe. No response,
no token of regret; all was stolid indifference on the
chief's part; and, ere long, he rose. The wizard
shook his assegai in Gray's face, and crying, in a loud
voice, “ Y-enzainhlela i be banzie ”-“Make a path :
let it be wide,” the throng in front parted to the
right and left, the chief moved deliberately onward,
Amani at his ear talking rapidly, and to Gray almost
incoherently, although he had acquired enough of the
language to know that the wizard was intent on
keeping Umlala to the dreadful purpose for which the
tribe had been summoned together.
All at once two strong women seized Gray from
behind, and held him tight. Amayeka saw that, for
he heard her shriek. Had they no mercy, these
wretches ? Were they women ? Was he to be im-
molated with Amayeka ? They dragged him down the
green slope, slippery with dew, that shone in diamond
flowers of rainbow hues. He heard the
fire roaring, and saw boy devils at their impish work.
They had bound poor Amayeka's slender wrists with
hard thongs of hide, and were trying to get the bangles
over her hands. Had they not succeeded, they would
have hacked off the limbs in their impatience to pos-
sess themselves of these gauds, so precious to them.
She ceased her cries, poor thing, and lay exhausted
on the green-sward, while some of the women, who
were foremost in the horrible work, prepared to
stretch her out with the soles of her feet towards the
flames, already greedy of their
prey.
Gray called to her; she made a violent attempt to

release herself, but in vain ; and he, in his fury,
shaking off the Amazons who held him, sprang for-
ward, and would have either attempted to rescue the
victim, or insisted on sharing her fearful death; when
screams of affright and gestures indicative of warning
drew the attention of the people on the plain to the
herdsmen on the nearest hiſl. Some were hastily
gathering the cattle together, while others pointed in
the direction of Eiland's glen, an outlet of the ravine
which almost encircled the Kraal.
Some alarming object was evidently in sight; but
what it was could not be distinguished by the people
in the hollow,
They were soon enlightened. A group of Europeans
on horseback emerged from a wooded glen, a branch
of the ravine running between two hills to the north-
west. As they reached the summit of the gorge, and
halted between earth and sky, the shining morning
light showed them to be heavily armed, and fully ac-
coutred for a trek; but their horses, though rough,
were fresh ; and if they were from a distance, they had
evidently been resting somewhere within an easy ride
of the Kraal. The party swept down the hill at a
brisk pace, plunged into the ravine, and were out of
sight for a moment. The next, with arms unslung
and ready poised, they galloped in close column, in
number about thirty, across the open space, to the
mound overlooking the hollow, in which the fire had
been lit, and where Gray now knelt, releasing, with
his good English knife, poor Amayeka from her
dreadful fate.
Yet, white men though they were, the unexpected
visitants of the Kraal did not pause in their course
to notice the unfortunate lovers, but dashed on to-
wards the ravine, where they perceived the cattle and
their drivers. The Kafirs, on first observing the
farmers approach, had whistled off their plunder to-
wards this dense bush, but had not succeeded in col-
lecting the herd sufficiently close to the only gap

through which such a body of men and beasts could
pass in haste.
Women and children fled into nooks and corners;
some found their way to their huts, and the herdsmen
on the hills rushed into the adjacent kloofs and val-
leys. The tribe being, as I have observed, much re-
duced in numbers, the thirty stout farmers were more
than a match for the thieves who had cleared their
homesteads. Umlala, paralyzed with fear and sur-
prise--for visits from the settlers were, on account of
his remote position from the colony, very unusual,-
had hastened to conceal himself in a mimosa thicket;
and Amani was quaking in a wolf-hole, his favourite
retreat in intrigue or danger.
The Kafirs were unprovided with their fire-arms,
some were even without their assegais. A volley of
musketry from the settlers sent them screeching into
the glen ; and a Hottentot guide, catching a glimpse
of Amani's head-gear, recognized him as a wizard, and
shot him like a wild beast in his hole.
The cattle, responding to the call of their rightful
owners, soon fell quietly into order, and were driven
off with no further opposition than a few assegais
thrown at random; the enemy calling out to the in-
vaders, from the safe side of the ravine, " Take care of
them; we will come for them before the hills grow
white,”—alluding to the snow on the mountain ridges.
To this the colonists turned an indifferent ear, and,
forbidding the guide to fire again, put their horses to
speed, galloped round and round the herd of cattle,
whistling, hallooing, and encouraging them forward,
for no time was to be lost, as it was not unlikely that
the armed Kafir scouts in the valleys might pounce
upon them, unawares, by certain short cuts between
the hills.
In the bustle and excitement attending the recovery
of their property, the farmers had, as I have shown,
paid but little attention to the singular situation of
the young deserter and the Kafir girl; but, after

securing the cattle en masse, five or six of the most
daring cantered to the little eminence in rear of
Umlala's hut, and discovered Amayeka stretched on
the grass alone. She had fainted, and Gray had left
her to procure some water to moisten her parched
lips, and was hastening at full speed from a vley in the
hollow to tell his miserable tale to the white men.
He could see them from the vley, but they, wholly
intent on rescuing the girl whom, indeed, they were
inclined to consider one of the Griqua race, from her
soft hair and regular features--were in too great haste
and too much excited to await the appearance of a
white man, who had vanished, as they supposed, with
the rest of the throng, leaving the wretched victim of
superstition and fraud to escape as she could, or lie
powerless till her tormentors returned.
At the impulse of the moment, a young
Boer-the
party consisted of Dutch farmers from the Stormberg,
who, worn out in trying to obtain redress for accumu-
lated grievances, had taken the law in their own hands
-bent from his horse, and, lifting the light, insensible
form of Amayeka to his saddle, bore her off.
Another, reckless of danger, lingered to seize a
brand from the still burning embers, and, following
his comrade with the flaming stick, cast it at random
on the roof of a particularly well-built hut, and joined
his companions. They sped on, their cheers and
laughter rousing the mocking echoes as they retraced
their steps up to the mouth of the gorge, whence they
had descended on the Kraal.
What made Gray draw back, and fly with extraor-
dinary speed towards the river ? What made him
shout the Kafir cry “Izapa! Izapa!” to the women
and children still occupying the ground?
They looked out from the low doors of their huts,
and saw in an instant the cause of his warning.
It was one of the huts containing ammunition which
had caught fire from the random brand.
They tried to fly, but some were too late !

JASPER LYLE:
The cattle herds on the hills set up a terrific yell,
which made the colonists look back from the eleva-
tion they had just reached. Gray had crossed the
stream, and was at a safe distance from the scene ere
the fire touched the flooring of the hut in which the
gunpowder was buried. He turned to take a last look
of the plain ; the poor little meercat was sitting, in its
old posture, at the door of Amayeka's hut, just where
the sunlight fell brightest,--a rumbling noise, like the
muttering of distant thunder, woke the neighbouring
echoes; the wind, which was beginning to gather from
all quarters, caught the burning embers, and scattered
them in all directions-several huts took fire-the
unhappy women and children scoured over the plain,
hardly knowing where to go in their blind terror.
Some, as I have said, lingering about their dwellings to
save their miserable property, and unconscious of the
imminence of the peril, paid the penalty of their igno-
rance; for finally a great tongue of flame shot upwards,
a loud explosion shook the earth, and from the moun-
tain ridge Gray beheld the whole Kraal on fire.
He could not help feeling, since he had every hope
of Amayeka's safety, a glow of exultation, as he beheld
the destruction of the scene of his late sorrows, and
waved his hand in token of a glad farewell to some
people huddled together and watching him from the
upper
drift: horrified as he was at the issue of the
day's events, he was so utterly disgusted at the part
both women and children had taken in the torture
scene, that he could not pity them as he might have
done before it took place.
He resolved at all hazards on delivering himself into
the hands of the colonists, and pressed forward to a
tuft of trees crowning the apex of the hill.
Shading his eyes from the glare of the sun, he gazed
intently into the valley on the other side.
It was a
scene of perfect repose. There were no groups of
cattle to give life to the picture, these had long van-
ished from the open locations to the dark ravines of

Kafirland; the Kraal filling the centre of the valley was
deserted, and not even a pauw, or secretary-bird, was
to be seen stalking solemnly along in the glow.
It was useless to descend the steep at random; he
continued to scan the paths with careful eye. Sud-
denly he thought he saw the little band of horsemen,
with the cattle in front, wending their way on the side
of a hill, beneath a krantz of granite. He was not
sure of this till they reached the sharp bluff or angle of
the mountain range ; they turned it, and he was left
alone in the wilderness.

ELEANOR'S
STORY.
But Frankfort is sitting in the hush of midnight-
before him lies the manuscript. It is addressed to
“Major Frankfort."
When the heart is very full, it is difficult to know
how or where to begin a recital, which it is due to
you as well as to myself to lay before you. It would
harass you, nay, I think it would make your heart
ache, were you to know, before reading it, all the pangs
it has cost me to write this.
An old diary lies before me-old to me, who have
lived through so much since I penned the first page,
three years ago.
I remember that I opened it to
begin my task of journalist at a little road-side inn at
the close of the first day's journey from home. I was
going, with my father, to visit Lady Amabel Fairfax,
at Cape Town. I was sorry to leave home and my
young sister. I was sorry to think that, for the first
time in my life, I should not say “ Good night” to
mother.
On the other hand, I was pleased at the prospect
of staying with Lady Amabel ; and, although my
mother had made the most careful arrangements for
me, I fancied she cared less at my leaving her than I
did. At that time, I think she loved Marion best.

Yet, I need not dwell on this point-I turn to
another leaf.
Lady Amabel! I see her now-graceful, handsome,
and so kind-awaiting our arrival in a large, luxuriant
drawing-room at Government House.
It was night when I met her for the first time.
Tired with a voyage of many days along the coast, I
received her cordial embrace with a comparatively cold
return, as she came forward in the hall. A gong was
sounding in the garden. Through an open door, we
beheld a vista of rooms, and servants lighting them.
Lady Amabel desired her maid to conduct me to my
apartment. She had contrived many little elegancies
of dress for me, and my toilette was soon made. I was.
late, and had to descend the wide staircase alone. My
feet trembled as I heard some one following, and a
young man, in the dress of an aide-de-camp, came clat-
tering past me; he had the grace to wait at the foot of
the stairs and bow.
His face was as honest in its expression as yours. He
apologized for “rattling by me," with the most grace-
ful air of humility. He was quite sure I must be

was to encounter. The hall was brilliantly lighted,
and filled with servants. A door was thrown open
I shook from head to foot with nervous
agitation. Clarence Fairfax pressed my arm, to re-

assure me; he declared his alarm lest I should fall. I
own I was dazzled. The chandeliers, blazing with the
light of myriads of wax candles, the tall mirrors re-
flecting them again and again ; the variety of uniforms
-staff, infantry, cavalry, engineers, artillery ; officers
in the costume of the French, Spanish, American, and
Portuguese navies; the magnificent-looking General
from India, his empty sleeve looped at his breast, that
breast covered with orders; the young, bashful, sailor-
Prince, fair-haired, blushing like a girl, yet with a cer-
tain lofty consciousness of rank about him that would
have marked him from the rest of the officers had he
been without the ribbon and the star ; the buzz of voices
of various nations; the ladies in brilliant dresses ; the
air redolent of perfumes, breathing through the win-
dows opening to the garden ;-all appeared to me
beautiful, but unreal, after my desert life. I felt as
Cinderella must have done when she found herself
transported by the fairy into the lighted palace; and
truly he, on whose arm I rested trembling, was like a
prince of fairy tale to me!
A tall
, slight figure, in the uniform of a general
officer, with many decorations, advanced. His piercing
eye flashed for an instant on his nephew, who had
delayed his appearance beyond the hour of reception;
but the expression changed on seeing me. He took
me from Clarence, observing, with a slight asperity of
tone, that he was, as usual, very late;" and led me to
Lady Amabel, who stood in the centre of the apart-
ment, the blaze of the chandelier illuminating her
elegant form robed in white, her graceful head en-
circled with an emerald wreath of shamrock-leaves.
To add to the illusion of the scene, the music of an
exquisite band came, blended with the perfume of
roses, through the open windows. A beautiful arm
was extended to me; Lady Amabel pressed my palm
between her soft jewelled fingers; and Clarence Fair-
fax came up with clasped hands, and in mock despair
at his uncle's reprimand, at being “late, as usual."

There was a little stir, a rustle of silks and plumes,
and I, in my innocence, was looking about, longing to
see my father, that I might be near him at the dinner-
table. The sailor-Prince advanced, and gave his
arm to Lady Amabel; she looked round ere dropping
mine; a spur was entangled in my dress; there was
a little laugh; Clarence Fairfax disengaged himself
from "my tails,” he said, and then, with a somewhat
saucy ease of manner for first acquaintainceship, he
drew
my
hand under his arm, and led me after the
crowd, already half-way through the ante-room.
So, Lady Amabel is a relation of Mr. Daveney's!"
said he—“ that is charming—there is a kind of cousin-
ship between us. Nay, don't look so demure, you
chill
me,
and I intend that we shall be the best friends
in the world. Let us make that bargain.”
He was so tall, he had to bend low to look into my
face, which was covered with confusion; for I was un-
accustomed to such familiarity. It took me by sur-
prise; but, ah! the fatal air which men assume when
they would please—those earnest looks, those low-
pleading whispers. I forgot to look for my father,
and seated myself on Clarence's right hand at the foot
of the table. A magnificent bouquet of flowers almost
hid Lady Amabel from my view, my eyes were bewil-
dered with the blaze of candelabra and silver covers,
gled with the lighter of women's dresses; but, at
length, I met the eye of Lady Amabel : she smiled,
nodded, indicated by a gesture to my father that I
was in my proper place, and by one to me that she
was satisfied; and, indeed, so was I.
Sir Adrian Fairfax's attention was thus called to
us-he looked at his nephew and laughed; we were
the last to be seated. “Incorrigible Clarence," cried
the General, shaking his head ; “lingering behind-
again late. Too bad, too bad."

uncle?" whispered Clarence Fairfax to me.

smiling; he knows why I lingered; he excuses me, of
You are my apology.
“I must take Major Fairfax's part,” said the Indian
Governor : "he may be late for dinner, General, but
he is always first in the field, you know.”
" And the last,” replied Sir Adrian, laughing; "you
see I have the best of the argument after all. Fairfax,
the
soup
will be cold.”
Everything that passed at the dinner-table on that
memorable day is noted in my diary. I have not
looked over it for three years. I need scarcely do so
now; for, as I write, the tide of memory swells high,
and trifles rise to the surface.
There was a ball that evening at Government House.
Sir Adrian brought the young sailor-Prince to me.
Clarence Fairfax stepped aside with a look of despair,
which I took to be real. The first dance over, he
came to claim me in right of “ cousinship,” he said.
His countenance was radiant with smiles as he led me
away.
We whirled off in a valse, talking gaily all the
time; he looking down into my eyes, and I forgetful
of the crowd around me, till I heard some one re-
mark, “What a perfect dancer! so airy—so un-
studied !” “A relation of Lady Amabel's ?"_“Yes."
“ From England ?”—“Oh, no!-an officer's daughter.”
"Not pretty, is she?"_“Rather."
“ Good gracious,
do you think so?"_“Interesting-Fairfax is taken
-then a laugh. Giddy with the exercise, I stopped
unwittingly close to the speakers-two or three showy
girls and their partners. The band changed the air to
rapid measure, and I was again borne off as on
wings. Breathless and exhilarated, we reached the
door of an ante-room; Clarence thought it was un-
occupied, and led me in.

Ah, conscience! The bloom of a youthful heart
once touched, it sees evil in what it once deemed
innocent!
I was accustomed to dance, to valse, to be associ-
ated occasionally with gentlemen, so why did my
heart bound as I met my father and Lady Amabel?
—and why was it relieved on seeing them pass by
with only a smile of pleased recognition ?
The Governor from India fell into conversation at
the doorway; Lady Amabel looked back, and said,
“ Take care, Clarence, of the draught from that win-
dow;" and left us sitting on a couch alone. Her shawl
was thrown across it. Fairfax drew it round me.
I had been prepared to admire this gallant young
soldier_first and last in battle.” He had lately
been wounded in a pirate fight while cruising with
naval friends off the western coast of Africa ; his
sleeve, open from the wrist to the shoulder, showed
that his sword-arm had been disabled. It was a stir-
ring tale—a young captain struck down; the next in
command weakened by fever; the ships lashed yard-
arm and yard-arm; a swarm of frantic beings, who
knew that to yield was to die; and a band of British
sailors with a boy lieutenant at their head.
The rover's crew cheered the boarders as they ad-
vanced, the boy lieutenant fell, but Clarence sprang
into his place, and led the sailors on. He had ob-
served the battened hatchways, had heard the yells of
the miserable captives in the forecastle of the brig,
and whilst the battle raged, had directed the carpenter
how to release the crowd of victims. His coolness
turned the fortune of the day; the hatchway burst
open, the wretched slaves, emaciated, starving as they
were, mingled with the English crew, and, elated with
the hope of liberty, sprang upon the pirates, and cast
them into the sea. The victory was decided in a
moment. Clarence Fairfax shared the honours of
the day, and gave his prize-money to the rescued
slaves.

I begged him to tell me this tale himself. He did
:50, with apparent reluctance; but the relation dazzled
and enchanted me. I was bewildered with his beauty,
his air, his charmed words.
While thus happily engaged, he talking and I lis-
tening, the servants entered, and throwing open a
large window, an exquisite coup-d'oil was presented.
A marquee, lined with brilliant flags, and lighted with
transparent lamps, stretched away into the spacious
gardens. Tables were scattered about covered with
refreshments, all arranged with exquisite taste; tropical
fruits and flowers decorating the feast in elegant pro-
fusion and variety. He started up. “I am forgetting
my duty,” said he, “in lingering so pleasantly with
you. Ah! here comes your father. See, he is follow-
ing Sir Adrian and Lady Westerhaven, and is escort-
ing the official lady who always falls to my lot. You
have yet to learn, you sweet innocent lily of the
desert, that the conventional forms of colonial society
are even more absurd than those of England. Ah,
thank heaven! your father has passed us by.”
But he was mistaken; the showy, shining woman
leaning on my father, who had been darting keen and
earnest glances into every corner of the room, sud-
denly exclaimed, with a touch of bitterness I could
not then understand, "Now, Mr. Daveney, who would
have thought to have found your daughter here? Quite
safe, you see; but shy, very shy, on this her first ap-
pearance in public—thank you, but I believe it will
be etiquette to resign your arm. Captain Fairfax, it
may not be your pleasure, but I believe it is your
duty, to take me to the supper-room to night."
He looked at me, at this remark, and smiled; but
evidently feared the scrutiny of the lady, for he as-
sumed a demure look, which, in spite of my vexation,
made me
laugh, as he led the offended one to the
marquee.
I followed with my father, who expressed his un-
easiness at my long absence from the ball-room. I

dare say some fathers would have been angry; but he
had been so long a stranger to the “conventionalities,"
as Clarence called the forms of society, that he did
not see any impropriety in my lingering with my
partner in an empty ante-room, and only feared I
might have felt overcome with the heat and the
crowd.
How often men strive to argue women out of a due
observation of 6 conventionalities' which militate
against their schemes, and next contemn their vic-
tims for ignoring what they, the men, have taught
them to despise !
I think I see that bold, bad woman, Mrs. Rashleigh,
Her black eyes and hair contrasted strongly
with her brilliant cheeks and lips. Beside me, she
was tall, and as she looked down upon me, she seemed
to sneer. Jewels glittered on her unveiled bosom,
her handsome hands and arms were covered with orna-
ments, a tiara of diamonds crowned her brow, from
which the hair was widely parted, giving her face an
unwomanly look; her voice was loud and dauntless,
her laugh rung unpleasantly upon the ear.
And yet this bold, meretricious woman evidently
held sway over the young and graceful aide-de-camp on
whose arm she rested, looking into his eyes with that
audacious stare, from which some men,-you, for in-
stance, would shrink.
Mrs. Rashleigh was evidently rallying him about
Then Lady Amabel came up to her. What a
contrast between the two, -Lady Amabel was fair,
gentle, feminine, and not what the world calls clever;
but the pure mind shone out of her soft eyes, and
made her low voice musical. She said something civil
to her guest, and took my father and myself away
with her to a little room, where a few choice friends
were gathered round Sir Adrian.
I saw no more of Clarence that night, but retired
to bed to dream of fairy halls, and diamond palaces,
and enchanted princes; and throughout the dream

there hung about me an odious female genius, whose
wand turned all I touched to ashes. I awoke, terrified
at the thunder she had invoked upon my head in her
jealous anger.
I could not help laughing, as, in the
bad fairy's thunder, I recognized the parting salute of
the young foreign sailor-Prince.
Idescended next morning, listless, unrested.
Adrian, my father, and Clarence Fairfax, were at the
breafast-table, and an aide-de-camp came in at an
opposite door, as I entered. Lady Amabel was in her
I took my seat by my father. The usual salu-
tations passed; Clarence recognized me by one of his
brilliant smiles.
“Oh! Miss Daveney," observed Sir Adrian, “ you
were the envy of all the women last night.”.
The colour rushed into
my
face.
Why so, sir ?" I asked.
“ You monopolized the young Prince for the first
dance. Mrs. Vanderlacken expected to be taken
out."
“And,” remarked Captain W., the other aide-de-
camp, “ Mrs. Rashleigh was taken in; for she has esta-
blished Fairfax as her cavalier scrvant, and he hung
back last night."
Involuntarily I looked at Clarence.
"Ah!" remarked Sir Adrian, who was a thorough
man of the world, “she is a little too old for you,
Fairfax; she owns to three-and-thirty.”
I thought,” said I, surprised into volunteering a
remark, “ that Mrs. Rashleigh's husband was alive.”
They burst into a fit of laughter at my naïveté.

I believe my father had every hope, from my inno-
cence of character, that my séjour at Cape Town would
do me no harm. Lady Amabel was, as he knew, one
of the most amiable of human beings; it was you who
remarked that my father is one who has made the

most of human experiences, but is unlearned in those
of society;" thus, he had been accustomed to see me
associated with those young men who visited at our
house whenever a commando brought them near An-
nerley ; but society gathered within the home circle is
widely different from that of a gay official residence,
especially where the host is a man of the world, and
the hostess facile, attractive, and unused to exercise
her judgment.
My father returned home, and I was left especially
under Lady Amabel's care. I spent my mornings with
her. At luncheon the arrangements were made for
riding or driving in the afternoon.
Clarence Fairfax trained a beautiful Arab of Sir
Adrian's for me; it was he who taught me to ride!
You have been at Cape Town. Do you recollect
that dusty road to Newlands, and the delicious change
from that space to those long avenues,—those shady
aisles ?
It seems but yesterday that Clarence and I were
sauntering there—he with his hand upon my rein,
laughing at my conscious dread of Lady Amabel’s dis-
pleasure at our lingering, while the General and herself
were far ahead, fading in the vista.
We spent the summer months at Newlands. Do
you remember one of those shaded paths between the
quince and pomegranate hedges ? the tall mountain
rising like a giant between the sun and this quiet
retreat. Here Lady Amabel and I used to bring our
work, and sketch-books; and here Sir Adrian protested
he always found Fairfax half an hour after the horses
were ordered for the business visit to the town. The
General complained that his aide-de-camp was more idle
than ever; and Lady Amabel would shake her head at
me, and then at Clarence, with a gentle smile of depre-
cation at us all.
She had set her heart upon marrying
me to Clarence
Fairfax. She did not tell me so, but I discovered it,

albeit her tact veiled her intentions from all but one
besides myself
. This was not Clarence; it was Mrs.
Rashleigh
The moment Lady Amabel had formed this “pretty
plan,” as she afterwards called it, she did just what a
woman of refined mind would do. She took care, lest
the world should sully my fair name with the breath of
scandal. Had she been a manouvrer, she could not
have done more to draw Clarence nearer to me. She
kept me more by her side than she had done; she drew
back when we sauntered in the ride ; she made excuses
to separate us if we sat too long together; and, in short,
often disturbed Clarence's equanimity. He was of a
passionate temper, though not rough in disposition;
but I had never seen his disposition tried in essen-
tials. I had yet to discover in him the foundation of
selfishness-vanity. Ah! why am I anticipating ?
Major Frankfort, I did not anticipate or reason,
while
writing the first pages of the journal to which I have
to refer in addressing this hurried scrawl to you.
Not far from the house at Newlands is a beautiful
grove. You approach it by a labyrinth of lemon
glades and silver trees—you remember those silver
trees, always whispering on the scented air that per-
vades those Arcadian woods. The grove crowns a
natural mound within a miniature forest, a clear
stream ripples below, and falls musically over the
rocks, making a natural cascade. In the hottest days
of December a soft breeze murmurs through this
grove, and stirs this shining stream. Lady Amabel
would retire here with me in the blazing hours of
noon, and Clarence would follow us, with servants
bearing baskets of fruit and the light wines of Con-
stantia.
Lady Amabel was always happy with us in this
lovely spot. Clarence and I named it the Fountain
of Egeria; he had been there, and said it resembled it.
I think I hear Lady Amabel's gentle laugh at my
unsteady steps in descending, assisted by her nephew,

to cool the wine in the stream, and gather lemon and
pomegranate blossoms to decorate the sylvan feast;
and then my frightened air at being left below, unable
to return without his help, which he so loved to give !
I recollect one day a large party “ tracking us out,
as Clarence said, and Lady Amabel's vexation at our
nook being invaded. She was the chaperone again,
and drew my arm under hers at once.
We could hear the voices of the party before they
reached us. I recognized one, Mrs. Rashleigh's; she
was in advance of all, dressed with extravagant taste,
painted, veiled, and redolent of perfumes.
There was the old bitter tone in her mode of rally-
ing “ Fairfax," on being “ Lady Amabel's aide-de-
camp ;” and, having paid her compliments with what
I thought an impertinent air, she led off Clarence.
I could see them strolling together between the tall
pomegranate hedges. Unlike the conversations be-
tween Clarence and myself, it seemed that she was
the talker, and he the listener; for the sun falling
where they stopped for many minutes in the walk,
I could distinctly perceive her gestures, while he ap-
peared silent and grave.
But, while remarking this curious proceeding,
I heard young Dutch lady say to another,
“Mrs. Rashleigh and Captain Fairfax are quarrel-
ling-did you hear that she was enraged with him at
the last ball ?"
Oh, yes; and they say he has not been at her
house since the Governor has been at Newlands-hush!”
They discovered I was near them, and were silent.
I heard remarks of the same nature from others of
the party; but Lady Amabel was engaged with a
group of children round the fruit-table. She had
released me from her kind surveillance on seeing
Mrs. Rashleigh lead off her nephew. She had only
designated Clarence as “ her nephew" since my advent
at Government House.

Frankfort. I will turn over three or four leaves of
this childish journal.

One day, Lady Amabel was slightly indisposed;
I carried my work-frame to her morning-room.
The General and all his staff had ridden to Cape
Town to meet some foreign official. She begged me
to take my walk in the grounds, and I left her.
It was one of those dreamy days, such as we have
lately had here. The birds and insects dropped their
wings in the boughs. I hastened through the path-
ways, glowing with the sun, and sought the “ Grove
of Egeria." I went, singing to myself that pretty bit
of Handel,
“ Where'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade;
Trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade."
It was in harmony with the scene-all was calm—the
glare of the heavens could not penetrate there--and
I sauntered leisurely on, enjoying the solitude, and
sat down beneath the branches of a noble plane-tree.
Suddenly I heard a sound of horses' feet; I thought
it was some one passing along the high road hidden
by the plantations; the sound drew nearer; I looked
through a long green vista-it was Clarence Fairfax,
followed by his groom; he looked up as he approached.
I was standing in a natural arch, with the light
streaming down through an opening above. I never
thought of drawing back, as I ought to have done, for
Lady Amabel would have objected to our meeting in
this retired spot. Clarence saw me, waved his forage-
cap, and, springing from his horse, threw the reins
to
the groom.
He was in the grove in an instant, and at my feet,
as I reclined, trembling with emotion, under the plane-
tree boughs.
*
Ah! Major Frankfort, had you heard his gentle
words, his expressions of pleasure at meeting me
alone—the contrasts he drew between other girls and

had you seen his smile, as he held
my
hand in
his, and looked upon me!-you would not have
doubted that he loved me.
But he terrified me by desiring—ah! he was very
imperative—that I would say nothing to Lady Amabel
of this meeting
I would have retreated from the grove, but he seized
me by the hand, and entreated me to listen to his
reasons for delay.
Woe is me! I did listen this once -only this once.
One might write volumes on such a text;
but I was
firm in not consenting to another meeting. I had
been brought up in the fear of doing wrong.
I trembled when I met Lady Amabel in the hall;
she was tying on her bonnet, and coming to meet me.
“Did you see Clarence ?” she asked'; “his horses
have just gone round to the stable.”
Before I could reply, I heard the tread of a spurred
and booted heel upon the threshold of the hall-door ;
Lady Amabel took it for granted Clarence had just
dismounted, for she inquired if the General and Cap-
tain Walton were following him.
No; Clarence had left them up to their knees in
foolscap" in a government office.
I escaped to my room, shut the door, and began to
think.

Those were two wretched hours, which I spent
alone on the 18th of January, 18— I pleaded, with
truth, the lady's excuse for not driving with Lady
Amabel to meet Sir Adrian. She took Clarence Fair-
fax with her in the carriage.
It was dusk when they returned, and a britzska full
of visitors followed the General's equipage. I was at
the head of the stairs, when I heard Mrs. Rash-
leigh's voice; the servants were lighting the lamps.
I looked over the banisters, she and two or three
other ladies were coming up to arrange their toilette
before dinner.

Clarence stood at the foot of the stairs; he was
laughing at some bold sally of Mrs. Rashleigh's, for
he said, “for shame.”
She had a brilliant bouquet in her hand; she tapped
him on the cheek, and he, catching the beautiful hand,
drew off the glove, and kissed it.

Clarence Fairfax loved me as well as he was capable
of loving anything besides himself; but he was en-
thralled by this daring being—he was afraid of her.
Ah! you may doubt; but history tells us how vain and
indolent men have quailed before vicious women. She
even exercised a sort of mysterious power over gentle
Lady Amabel. The latter had an instinctive, feminine
dread of Mrs. Rashleigh's sarcastic laugh and auda-
cious stare.
As for Sir Adrian, she amused him. She was a
dashing rider, too; she had given it up for some years,
but returned to it on being tempted to try Zara, my
well-trained Arab. God forgive me for my suspicions

ing; she used to boast of her talent for the manége,

said, were jealous of her, by riding with the General
and his staff about the square at a grand review.
Lady Amabel was beginning to penetrate the cause
of my fits of dejection, when unexpected news from
the military posts startled both her and myself.
The war-cry
had
rung
from the mountains in Kafir-
land. Vividly do I remember the night on which
this intelligence reached Cape Town. The whole of
the authorities, with many members of their fami-
lies, had assembled, amid a crowd of pleasure-loving
people, on board a fine English frigate, to celebrate a
national festival. Gay groups were scattered about
the decks, awaiting the arrival of Sir Adrian and his
party. I was happy that evening, and stepped on the
deck, leaning on Clarence's arm. How kind, how
tender had been his manner, as he almost lifted me
from the barge to the gangway of the noble ship! As
people are said, in the last hours of existence, to re-
view minutely every incident of their lives, so could I
once retrace the most trifling details of this brilliant
and enchanting fête. As I recall it now, I remember
everything—the wreaths, the flags of all the great
nations of the world; the glittering arms interspersed
among the laurels, and the effect of the soft light from
the battle-lanterns disposed along the poop; innu-
merable lamps shedding their radiance through the
draperies of scarlet and amber, purple, green, and white,
and blue; the crowds of laughing dancers ; the imposing
array of military and naval uniforms and decorations.
Ah, fatal gift of beauty!
How long it was before I could cease to think of
Clarence on that night, his plumed hat in his hand !
How often did his gay laugh haunt me, like a mockery,
in the silence of the night! His countenance beamed
like an angel's, as it leant down to mine, and his
whispered accents touched my very soul amid the din
of the giddy throng.
Arms clattered on the deck, as the Governor, Sir

eye,
Adrian, acknowledged the salute from the guard of
honour; the stirring air of “God save the King”
pealed from the band on the poop; the crowd parted
right and left, and the Admiral came forward to
receive us. Having paid his compliments, Admiral
D. gave the order, in a good-humoured voice, to

the quadrille.
Mrs. Rashleigh placed herself opposite to us, with
Captain Walton; she was fanning herself, and was
evidently much excited and agitated. I felt she was
my evil genius for the night at least.
There was a fiendish light in her but Clarence
either did not or would not observe it, and he was in
such spirits, that their influence for a time was irre-
sistible.
We were laughing merrily together as Mrs. Rash-
leigh sailed past us in the quadrille.
"Have you heard the news ?" said she, addressing
Clarence-she seldom deigued to recognize me ex-
cept by an insolent bow.
"News ?-10." And the young aide-de-camp led me
back to my place. “There's a man-of-war just coming
in,” said he ; " she has been making signals to the
station on the hills ; what news can she bring?"
The sun had long set, and the man-of-war dropped
her anchor in silence; it was soon whispered that she
had brought news from the south-eastern coast; and
besides this, some excitement prevailed in consequence
of her having had a desperate affray with pirates off
the coast of Madagascar, and she had been looked for
with much anxiety and interest, rumours of the action
having reached us some days before.
There was silence. It was so profound, that we
could distinguish the plash of the oars. The flag-
lieutenant descended the gangway to meet the com-
mander of the sloop, and attending him to the deck,

presented him to Admiral D. After the usual com-
pliments had passed, Captain Leslie requested to be
introduced at once to the Governor, for whom he had
brought important despatches.
Mrs. Rashleigh came up at once to Clarence Fair-
fax; but looking at me, observed abruptly, “We must
bid adieu to balls and fêtes immediately. The Gover-
nor and his suite will have to start for the frontier
without delay. You will be charmed, I am sure, to
take the field again, Major Fairfax," —here she ad-
dressed herself to him ; for you must be tired of
lounging at pianos and superintending embroidery.
Don't faint, Miss Daveney; you are as white as death,
Ivow. He will come back again ; aides-de-camp never
get shot, especially in Kafirland."
It is a fearful thing for a young heart to feel the
germ of dislike springing in its depths; and, alas ! I
began to hate this woman.
Clarence looked round for some one to whose care
he could commit me.
uncle at once. I instinctively moved away
with
him. We left Mrs. Rashleigh standing alone. Every
one was crowding towards the poop to hear the news.
Lady Amabel had fainted.
The next few hours are vaguely sketched upon the
tablets of my mind—day was dawning, as we descended
the carpeted steps of the gangway to depart for the
shore. I tottered into the barge, Clarence Fairfax sup-
ported me in his arms, and Lady Amabel was reclining
on a seat, with Sir Adrian attempting to comfort her.
Mrs. Rashleigh was waiting for the Admiral's cutter to
convey her to land. I could not reconcile her levity
with the idea of her regard for Clarence. She was
on the last step of the gangway, and leaning down,
she looked under the canopy of the barge: “Pray, tell
Lady Amabel,” said she to me, with a mocking smile,
" that she must not alarm herself; it will be quite a
question of words on the frontier, and we shall soon
return. I have made

Rashleigh, who goes with the Governor. We shall
have a charming party; good night."
Clarence muttered something between his teeth. I
laid my head on his shoulder, and sobbed bitterly. I
forgot Lady Amabel and Sir Adrian ; indeed they were
intent on their own regrets and responsibilities.
Clarence pressed me to his heart, and parting the
curls from my brow, kissed me for the first and last
time.

Oh! that stir in the household in the early morn-
ing—the dread preparation for war-weapons lying on
the gilded tables; holsters flung across the banisters
servants hurrying hither and thither with saddlery and
accoutrements ; the impatient chargers pawing in the
stable-yard, as if they already “snuffed the battle afar
off;" orderlies dashing to the open doorways on foam-
ing horses; and impatient voices issuing commands to
the startled underlings!
I rose early and went below; my heart sickened at
these evidences of immediate departure. I returned
to my sleeping apartment; it looked into the beautiful
garden; but I had a view of the approach to the
house from my dressing-room. I could hear the
clatter of horses' feet in the stables, and grooms and
soldiers laughing, enjoying the prospect of the journey,
and perhaps war. "It was early day. How lovely is
nature at her réveil in this soft climate! She was
waking in the garden to the matin songs of birds;
she was lifting her veil on the mountain-top, and
unfurling her crimson banner in the sky to herald the
coming of the sun.
But with me all was gloom. That Clarence Fairfax
loved me, in his impetuous way, I believed,-alas! I
did not know; but the future was a dark abyss. He
was going — going into danger. All the horrible
histories I had been told of death at savage hands rose
before me.

the night had been haunted with bloody spectres. I

had beamed on me with merry light closed for ever.
Gracious heaven! I had dreamt of torture, agony,
and shame, with my beloved Clarence in the fore-
ground of the picture.

Up and down, up and down those two rooms I
paced, shivering on that sunny morning with dread,
dismay, and doubt. Tears came — they poured in
torrents over my face. I caught sight of it in the
large mirror—it was pitiable to behold. I wept the
more at the sight of my miserable and altered counte-
nance. How sad is self-pity! It is so long since I have
recalled these wretched moments of existence, that I
can dwell upon them now more as a vividly-remem-
bered dream than as actual facts. I give you, dear
friend, more details than you may like to have, but I
think you have a right to watch the phases through
which my mind passed under the influence of that
absorbing earthly passion.
Yes, it was a mere earthly passion; but many
wiser than I have been bewildered and enchained by
exceeding beauty, a dazzling smile, a winning manner,
a perfect form, and a reputation distinguished among
men for gallant and generous actions-generous, you
know, in the worldly acceptation of the term.
Besides, while with me, Clarence was wholly mine;
if I might judge by manner, hanging over my embroi-
dery frame while Lady Amabel was writing; or
Ah! I have said enough of this. He was to leave
Would he die? Would he return? or, if
he did, would he return true to me, and tell me that
he loved me?
You see, under all this strong current of love for
him, there were doubts. I hardly recognized them;
but they existed nevertheless. I had heard him
laugh at “love-stricken damsels," left by men who
had been publicly engaged to them. I recollected his
boasting of giving advice to a young officer, who had

gone a great deal too far,” to get sick leave, and sail
for England by the first ship. The young man did
not take this advice; he stayed, married, and Clarence
called him " a fool.”
-Yes, these doubts rose to the
surface of my mind, and then-
*
*
I heard his voice in the front of the house. I lifted
the blind of the dressing-room window, and saw him :
he looked harassed, he had been up all night. He
was on horseback, and fully accoutred. Oh! was he
departing? I dropped the blind; next I heard the
rattle of spurs and sword; he had dismounted.
I wiped the tears from my eyes, and ran down to
the garden by a back staircase. Clarence had some
deer there in a little paddock. I walked mechanically
along a grape-walk to the inclosure: the pretty things
knew me, for I visited them every day ; they put their
faces through the railings, and licked my hands. Nelly
-he had named one after me—trotted up and down
impatiently; she was watching for her master. I sup-
pose he thought that I should be with his favourites;
for, ere long, he came through the grape-walk. I
hastened to meet him—for agitation and distress over-
came my reserve—and we walked up and down the
arcade together.
He entreated me not to forget him, said he should
be wretched till he returned, and a hundred tender
things besides; but I could see that the change from
garrison life to active service was exciting to him: he
had no idea of temporizing with savages, he said; he
hoped Sir Adrian would settle the question by "speak-
ing to the Kafirs," as they said themselves," with guns."
Oh! it would only be a month's affair. They were to
ride five hundred miles a week till they reached the
seat of war; and then, he added, with a gay air,
“ think how much faster we shall ride back."
We met Sir Adrian in the garden; he had been
looking for Clarence. The Governor was too full of
public affairs and his own domestic anxiety to say

much to me.
A young girl of seventeen, in the full
bloom of mirth and beauty, was an agreeable object to
him in a ball-room, but he was wont to laugh, like
Clarence, at “sorrow-stricken damsels;" he saw I had
been weeping, but could enter little into my misery;
he uttered some courteous expressions of regret at
leaving me to the dulness of Cape Town in the
absence of officials; and with more show of feeling
than I had seen him exhibit, said, 6. You will take
care of Lady Amabel, my dear Miss Daveney; I am
consoled in these hurried moments of departure at
the idea of leaving her with so sweet a companion.'
* You must make breakfast for us this morning,
added he, giving me his arm, and leading me through
the verandah to the room where the repast was
spread.
I sat down passively in the chair Sir Adrian placed
for me, and did the honours of the breakfast to the
Governor, his staff, and two or three civil func-
tionaries.
Mr. Rashleigh was there-obsequious, prosy, and
judicial: he was alike despised and disliked in private
life; but he was “ Sir Adrian's right hand at Cape
Town;" was au fait at the working of the difficult
machinery of government from one end of the colony
to the other; and, as I afterwards heard, kept up a
sort of civil treaty with Mrs. Rashleigh, who had never
loved him, but who had a thorough sense of the
advantages she derived from her position as his wife,
surrounded by the appliances, and, what she con-
sidered, the state of official life. She had ample evi-
dence against him to procure a divorce if she chose
it; but such a proceeding would have been the ruin
of both. She had the art to conceal her most glaring
errors from the world, and rumours were afloat of
stormy debates between this worldly, unprincipled
pair: he remonstrating on her extravagance, she de-
fying him, by threatening him with an esclandre that
would have deprived him of his high appointment.

You may believe that such rumours never reached
Sir Adrian and Lady Amabel. It is “expedient” to
overlook the most glaring errors of powerful and use-
ful men. Probably, if any one had endeavoured to
enlighten Sir Adrian, the latter would have deprecated
the information as intrusive. No; every one believed
Mr. and Mrs. Rashleigh to be unprincipled people;
but they had a fine house, gave elegant entertain-
ments, were on the best terms with the first authori-
ties through every successive government, never
worried others with their quarrels; on the contrary,
were perfectly civil to each other in public; and,
although the lady was said to be extravagant, she paid
her debts.
I am telling you what, probably, you may have
heard of these baneful people ; for it is not very long
since circumstances came to light which would never
have been known had the Rashleighs continued pros-
perous; but the day came when the world did not
care what it believed against them, and then their
very errors were exaggerated—if that were possible-
but I must not be uncharitable. How true that re-
mark of Sir Thomas More—I forget the exact words-
you quoted them the other day—that faults

The gentlemen hurried over their breakfast, and Sir
Adrian retired with Mr. Rashleigh. How I longed to
rise and escape through the window into the garden!
but it was impracticable, and there I remained
for up-
wards of an hour, with a heart bursting with grief,
while my face was condemned to wear a calm appear-
ance. Doubtless, “ Fairfax's flirtation with little Miss
Daveney” had been talked of at many of these men's
tables; but they were all too much interested in the
important events pending to give a thought to the
shy, melancholy little figure, sitting with her back to

Oh! the solitude of a great mansion which for
weeks has been ringing with sounds of dancers' feet,
of laughter, and of song. The large vacant rooms, the
tall mirrors, reflecting in all directions one insignificant
little object! I went wandering about the apartments
at Government House the greater part of that morn-
ing. Lady Amabel was in bed, exhausted by a succes-
sion of fainting-fits. The sudden announcement of
the evil tidings had scared her weak nerves, and Sir
Adrian's speedy departure had prostrated her. They
had scarcely been sundered for twenty years, save in
some short brilliant campaigns in India. No one
seemed to dread actual danger to the General's person
in his present expedition ; but I had heard something
of the foe he was about to encounter, and I knew what
might be.
"Clarence Fairfax and I parted amid a bevy of
officials. We shook hands like common-place acquaint-
The other members of the staff came rattling
in through the open doors. All was hurry at the last ;
I ran up to my dressing-room window, and watched
the assemblage of people who had come to make their
parting bow to the popular Governor.
Horses, men, equipages were crowded together;
Sir Adrian appeared—there was a hearty shout-the
grooms and orderlies brought up the chargers, they
ances.

were rearing and fretting with impatience. My pretty
Zara was led by a dragoon, to be ridden only occasion-
ally. The General and staff were soon in their saddles
-the crowd gave way—Sir Adrian waved his hat-
the aides-de-camp bowed right and left, and the caval-
cade proceeded at a rapid pace down the street. In
ten minutes not a trace was left of this gallant array.
The Rashleighs were to follow the Governor in the
afternoon. They drove up to the door of Government
House in their travelling equipage, saddle and sumpter
horses following. Lady Amabel could not see them-
I would not; but from my dressing-room, where I sat
trying to draw, I could hear Mrs. Rashleigh's impe-
rative voice. I looked through the Venetian blinds for
an instant, and turned away, sick at heart.
It was evening before Lady Amabel and I met.
How vast the room looked as we two sat at dinner,
with a lamp shining on a table usually crowded with
guests. Next day we departed for Newlands.
Sweet, gentle, kind Lady Amabel. She had, as I
have told you, begun to penetrate the cause of my
occasional dejection : occasional—for there were times
when I had no doubt of Clarence Fairfax's attachment.
But she had her misgivings about Mrs. Rashleigh,
whom she spoke of once or twice as a dangerous
woman;" and this was a strong expression for Lady
Amabel. She now drew from me a part of “Love's
sad history," and expressed her regrets at Clarence's
departure without opening his mind to her. In many
ways she betrayed uneasiness at the idea of Mrs.
Rashleigh's determination to follow the authorities to
the frontier.
How solitary now to me were those long, green
vistas at Newlands! The fountain of Egeria had its
own peculiar melancholy charm, and many early morn-

ing hours were passed in these bowers, consecrated in
memory to love and happiness.
Letters soon arrived, bringing us hopeful intelligence
of
peace
with Kafirland; but an immense press of
business was likely to detain Sir Adrian for some time.
He even talked of a journey to Natal, on the north-
eastern coast; but, the fear of absolute and immediate
danger removed, visitors poured in to offer their con-
gratulations, for Lady Amabel had endeared herself to
many.
The despatches contained a note for me. I put it
aside till I could open it in solitude. It was full of
kindness, and I was comparatively happy.
On the other hand, I was doomed to hear of fêtes
and balls got up to celebrate Sir Adrian's arrival at
Graham's Town, the capital of the frontier. Mrs.
Rashleigh was doing the honours of his house; her
husband and herself were its inmates, and I could
detect many a lurking smile on the lips of keen-witted,
ill-natured visitors, as they listened to the relation of
these “ facts and scraps” to Lady Amabel.
Some relations of Sir Adrian's happened at this time
to take up their abode at the Cape. They called at
Newlands, and introduced a young man, who had come
from England with them, and who brought letters of
special introduction to the Governor.
Lady Amabel was indisposed, and I received the
guests; they remained to luncheon. Lady Amabel
sent to request that they, with Mr. Lyle, would remain
to dinner. They could not accept the invitation, but
Mr. Lyle did, and was left tête-à-tête with me.
Handsome, original, and clever, he certainly beguiled
away those hours more agreeably than I had expected.
He spent the evening with Lady Amabel and myself.
She liked him ; she said he was “ not too clever for
us,” in our unsettled, agitated state, for we were only
hoping for peace; and she gave him a general invitation
to our country residence, to which she had also asked
her relatives during their séjour at the Cape. Unac-

a
customed to thoroughly “private life," Lady Amabel
was happy to throw her house open again to society.
We had no fêtes or dinner-parties; we were not gay,
but we were cheerful, for every week brought us more
hopeful intelligence from the seat of war. I heard less
of Mrs. Rashleigh and Clarence Fairfax, and believed
his excuses for short and hurried notes to me. The
interchange of these notes was not quite right; but,
although kind, they contained no warm expressions of
regard. Lady Amabel considered them harmless,
because Clarence signed himself Faithful Cousin.'
I suppose she had not the heart to forbid what she
saw gave me so much pleasure. He was, he said,
overwhelmed with office work.”
Mr. Lyle had been sent from England to join a
force quartered at Natal, but with especial credentials
to the Governor, to whom he enclosed them. He
shortly received instruction to remain at Cape Town
for the present, Sir Adrian anticipating an opportunity
of naming him for a staff appointment.
He visited us almost daily. Lady Amabel was
charmed with his attentions. He was ever ready to
bring us good news, and on the arrival of despatches
would gallop out to Newlands to be the first herald of
the tidings.
I have told you that the first impression he made
was agreeable—but as for marriage !-
He treated me with a certain air of respect, which,
I confess, pleased me exceedingly. He seemed more
anxious for my favour than Lady Amabel's. There
was a peculiar kind of cleverness, too, in his conversa-
tion, which was new-it was that of educated ability;
but he had an original way of discussing questions, and,
through the respectful reserve he maintained towards
me, I could discover a lurking talent for sarcasm, not
ill-natured, but irresistibly amusing. He entertained
Lady Amabel very much with his “quiet imperti-
nences," as she called them, and “ drew out* her
colonial visitors to an extent they never dreamt of.

I own that I was a little mystified; it was some time-
before I could discover the difference between jest
and earnest in this character.
Lady Amabel, as I have told you, though elegant
and charming, was an idler; she missed Mr. Lyle
extremely, when some days passed without a visit from
him. never struck me, till enlightened by his own
subsequent revelations, that he withdrew himself from
us occasionally in order to be recalled—an absence of
two or three days was sure to be followed by a note
of invitation to dine at Newlands—and then he came
with news, private and political. His credentials had
introduced him to the principal families at Cape Town,
and he was already well received among them.
He had the talent of adapting himself to the habits
and tastes of all classes and both sexes; he could
talk politics with officials, and was often asked by
Lady Amabel to assist her in entertaining such
persons as she had friendly reasons for inviting to
Newlands. She thought him a little spoiled, for it did
not always suit his mood to talk. She did not dis-
cover, nor did I at the time, her own error in spoiling
him herself.
He turned all kind Lady Amabel's foibles to his
own account.
No two characters could be more opposite than
Lyle's and Clarence Fairfax's, and yet both had certain
attributes in common; both were brave and daring,
but Clarence had less moral courage than Lyle—both
loved to conquer, but the one wanted perseverance,
and would yield to passion while success was doubt-
ful. I could recall many circumstances which would
explain these contrasts in the two characters.
Clarence Fairfax, in his resolution to conquer a horse,
closed the contest by shooting it dead in the face
of his grooms. Lyle seized the reins of one of
Sir Adrian's fiery steeds, and, mounting it when ex-
cited to fury, fought with it resolutely, till it quailed

beneath his hand, and then galloped it for miles
against its will, till it was thoroughly tamed.
People had seen these two men play billiards, and
remarked the dashing impetuosity of the one, and the
cool, calculating game of the other; the one winning
by luck, the other by quiet determination.
Both Lyle and Fairfax sketched well; the first
filled his portfolio with wild scenes from storms at
sea or battle-pieces, roughly done, but full of spirit-
there were also innumerable caricatures so true as
scarcely to be caricatures; Clarence was a graceful
artist. Neither liked reading, for reading's sake; but
Clarence could quote many a passage from Moore's and
Byron's softest poems, while Lyle was more at home
with “ Thalaba” or “Cain ;” but liked better, he said,
to shape his opinions from his own observation than
from books.

JASPER LYLE:
CHAPTER XIII.
THE
CATASTROPHE.
RUMOUR began, with bold and busy tongue, to talk
more openly of “scandalous reports * from the fron-
tier concerning Mrs. Rashleigh. Lady Amabel, always
charitable, put them down to the account of a little
“natural bitterness” on the part of weak, jealous
people, who might depend on Mrs. Rashleigh's in-
fluence for invitations to the official parties ; but I
heard otherwise, and from no other than Mr. Lyle.
So far, he said, from people being desirous of the entrée
at Sir Adrian's official residence at Graham's Town,
many persons objected to meet Mrs. Rashleigh, whose
conduct with Fairfax had become notorious. Lyle men-
tioned Clarence as though he was utterly unconscious
of my interest in him, and added, that he knew him
slightly—they had been at Westminster together.
He did not tell me that Clarence and he had been
foes in one of those shocking stand-up fights so
common in English schools. Lyle had conquered
Clarence, and the latter did not resent the issue of
what was declared a fair fight; but the former never
forgot that, though victory was his, there were few to
cheer him, while the vanquished boy was surrounded
by friends.
In short, with many tastes and talents in common,
these two men were totally different.
Clarence was accustomed to talk to me chiefly of
himself. I began to think of this, as Lyle did
homage to talents which he discovered I possessed.
Still there were the doubts about jest and earnest.
Every day I found out how difficult it was to under-

243
stand the character of men. Lyle became more
marked in his attentions as the time drew near for
Sir Adrian's return; and I-I must confess that I
was surprised at having borne Clarence's absence
with patience.
I had had my hours of sorrow and anxiety never-
theless. The dread of a war was dissipated soon after
the Governor and his troops had left Cape Town; but
diplomatic matters detained them for three months.
During that period I never left Lady Amabel; but
Lyle made himself acquainted with all the domestic
history of Sir Adrian's proceedings, laughed at the
scandal about Mrs. Rashleigh and Fairfax, but did
not doubt it,-it was too well authenticated; and when
he discovered that my countenance was clouded with
dismay, affected bitter regret at having wounded my
feelings; but smiled incredulously at the idea of my
entertaining a serious passion for that young roué.
He did not dwell on this. He knew that in a dis-
position like mine love reigned triumphant over
pride.
Woe is me! I knew so too.
I have tried to detail some of the characteristics of
this deeply-designing man; but you would rather
have them passed over, and I shrink from the recital.
He was determined on retrieving a tottering repu-
tation by an alliance with any one whose friends or
fortune might arrest the progress of ruin and dis-
grace; I was the victim he singled out. My thoughts
were far apart from his designs.
I was like a city besieged, with the enemy smiling
before me in friendly array, watching to stalk into the
gates, awaiting the arrival of a faithless ally.
Lady Amabel and I were at Newlands, expecting
tidings from the frontier, and prepared to return to
Cape Town to receive Sir Adrian. I was awakened
early one morning by the distant sound of guns—it was
a salute-it must be the Governor and his suite; they

dressing-gown, and ran to Lady Amabel's room.
I met her in the
passage; she was all joy. I trem-
bled with agitation, pleasure, and dread.
The carriage drove round within half an hour, and
we hastened into Cape Town. The bells were ring-
ing, the ships in the harbour were decorated with
flags. Crowds lined the streets; the Governor had
landed, and was detained on the shore by a congratu-
latory deputation. We were received by the throng
with loud hurrahs. Peace had been proclaimed, and
treaties established, which people believed would
be satisfactory. Triumphal arches had been raised
within a few hours. On we dashed. We reached
Government House just as the guard of honour
passed us after receiving Sir Adrian. Every one
looked joyous ; the mansion resounded again with
cheerful voices.
“ Here they come! Here they come!” Carriage-
wheels approached. Lady Amabel and I ran into the
hall. She threw herself upon her husband's breast.
Captain Walton and the military secretary advanced
to shake hands with me. They were laughing-quite
happy to have escaped the toils of an inglorious war-
fare. I could not speak.
Lady Amabel greeted them, and looking round,
said, “But where is my nephew? Where is Clarence
Fairfax?”
And they both answered with another laugh, which
Captain Walton checked suddenly, as he caught a
glimpse of my frightened face.
“Oh! he is quite
safe, and very-happy," said the secretary. “Well,"
said Captain Walton; "he is coming back overland
with the Rashleighs."
Yes," observed Sir Adrian, in a tone, partly of
sarcasm and partly of displeasure; "and he had much
better have returned with us. I am by no means
satisfied with this arrangement of Mrs. Rashleigh's."
I was most bitterly disappointed.

245
Shame to me, I had nearly forgotten to ask after
the welfare of my family. I addressed some agitated
questions to Captain Walton, who told me all were
well.
He had always been kind in his manner to me, and
could readily guess the meaning of my melancholy face.
My arm trembled on his as we proceeded to the break-
fast-room together—that same room where Clarence
Fairfax and I had parted in a crowd.
I would fain pass over much that followed. I re-
ceived a letter from my father. He had heard
somewhat of Clarence Fairfax's "conspicuous atten-
tions to me.” He feared Lady Amabel had been
“too indulgent.” Fairfax was the very person to
“charm a young girl's senses,” but he hoped they
were not overcome by a fine form and a bewitching
manner. My dear father thought too well of me
to suppose that I was enthralled by this lively, dash-
ing, handsome young aide-de-camp, who was, to say
truth, at the feet of a lady whose reputation had
suffered from her carelessness. Every one indeed
spoke of Fairfax as a male coquette.
You see, dear friend, my father would not
assume that I was seriously enthralled ;" he was
not with me to judge for himself. You shall read his
letter some day. You will see that though he tried
to treat this matter lightly, it weighed upon his
mind; he was bent on having me home again. “My
darling,” he says, at the close of this letter, “write to
me at once; you have never mentioned this affair,
which others speak of so carelessly, and your silence
makes me anxious. In my anxiety I asked your sister
if you alluded to Captain Fairfax in your communica-
tions with her, but she tells me no. My love, I long to
have you with me again. Captain Walton admitted to
you were looking ill. He is most kind, and

enters into my anxieties. He was unwilling, I could
see, to commit Fairfax. In a word, dearest Eleanor,
he has more respect for Fairfax than that infatuated
young man has for himself .
Then followed directions for my return, under the
care of friends about to leave Cape Town for the east-
ward settlements. They delayed their departure, and
I was detained, to Lady Amabel's satisfaction, for she
had become attached to me. But, albeit firm in her
attachments, she was a person, as you may have
discovered, ever open to fresh impressions. She was
as unsuspicious of evil as I was.
Mr. Lyle had made his way, and stood in high
favour when Sir Adrian arrived.
He was presented, and joined the circle at dinner
that day; he took his station at my side—I was sadly
abstracted-he was in his most agreeable vein, and
drew me from myself, as usual.
*
I know, dear friend, you will wonder that the letter
I received from home was from my father. I had
always belonged more to him than my mother. Marion,
you know, was the favourite in her babyhood; and it
was my fault, perhaps, as well as my misfortune, that
I was always reserved to
my
mother. I well recollect
her once expressing impatience at that reserve; but I
never could shake it off; it exists, as you know, to
this day. A sensitive child, once repelled, seldom
makes another advance, and I have told you that I
entered the world just as the best-beloved one was
fading from it. My mother had less thought naturally
for me than him. I turned to my father—his arms
were open, and I rested there.
You have been a member of our family circle for
some weeks now; otherwise, how could I bring myself
to cast a shade of reproach on my mother, for whom
you have so high a respect ? Ah! you will not set it
down to wrong account.

You see I linger in my wretched history.
I look again into my journal. 16th March. “ Cla-
rence has returned; at times dejected; at times ex-
cited; he is totally unlike his former self. We are
at Newlands again. All these scenes and objects
associated with happier hours! They bring but

in those long avenues, I fly—I am ill-I cannot rest

long for a friend to whom I could impart my sorrow.

reading this, I will not shed all my miserable thoughts
of this
period upon paper.
All this time Lyle was intent upon
his
purpose.
He felt my fate was in his hands.
He took up a new position.
I was sitting one morning in Lady Amabel's bou-
doir. A servant ushered in Mr. Lyle. He started
back; “ It was Lady Amabel he came to see,” he
said.
I begged him to be seated, and rose to go for her.
He detained me gently.
How specious he was-how blind was I! He had
“ been studying me for weeks ;" from the first mo-
ment we met, he“ had been deeply interested in me.
He had perceived the shade that an early sorrow had
cast round me, and had come to ask Lady Amabel if
there was no hope for him; he would not press the
question on me now, it would be unkind.”
I believed that he felt for me from his soul; that

he would have "given worlds for a look which would
bid him not quite despair ; but this was not the time to
assail me.
He knew I had pride; it was blinded now,
but the mist would clear away, the scales would fall from
my eyes. I should do him justice; he grieved that the
world should have dared to tanıper with my name-
-"
He quite frightened me as he said this. I was op-
pressed with a sense of bitterness and wrong, against
which I was powerless ; but here was one who seemed
disposed to do me justice. I wished to do right.
Lady Amabel would have been all kindness had I un-
burdened my full heart to her, but she would not have
understood me; she would have proposed a ride or a
drive, or a fête, or might have sent for Clarence, to
scold him. Ah me! I had not a friend at hand who
could give me good advice; and here sat this clever, expe-
rienced, silver-tongued man, offering me his sympathy,
and teaching me to believe he was the only one near
me who could feel for me--who had, in fact, any real
regard for me; and this regard was offered so humbly
that I had not a word to say against the expression of
it. On the one hand was Clarence Fairfax, reckless of
my affection, ignoring it indeed, and, as Lyle remarked,
with indignation he protested he could not suppress,
“insulting me publicly, by doing homage before my
face to a shameless woman, whose triumph was the
greater in that she had drawn this infatuated
young
man from one so lovely and pure-hearted as my-
self.”
My tears rained down upon the work-table on which
he leaned, contemplating me with an expression of
compassion new to me, yet not unpleasing.
I began to think I had found a friend.
More company on that evening! I longed to re-
turn to the quiet of home; but unavoidable delays
kept me back. We were to leave Newlands for Cape
Town next day. An irresistible impulse seized

mound, and went to our old accustomed seat under
the plane-tree.
The darkness and the silence that prevailed were in
accordance with the gloom that hung over my soul.
At last I bade adieu for ever to this spot, so pain-
fully dear to me. I descended to the avenue. A tall
figure approached me—it was Lyle's—“I thought,"
said he," that I should find you here ; but be not
alarmed, I shall not return with you. I recognized
your figure leaving the house, and came to prepare
you for meeting with Mrs. Rashleigh to-night; she is
to be among the guests. Lady Amabel's position
with regard to this woman is most difficult-but a
crisis is at hand; Fairfax is completely in her toils-
an esclandre must take place soon. I beseech you do
not add to this bad woman's triumph to-night by that
heart-broken demeanour which you have lately worn.
Ah! Miss Daveney, I shall look for your entrée with
án anxious eye and beating heart. Pardon my pre-
sumption in thus intruding on you, but my interest in
your happiness must be
my excuse.
He took my hand in his, but dropped it immedi-
ately, with a sigh; and, lifting his hat, disappeared in
an avenue.
I went to Lady Amabel's dressing-room. I had not
the courage to enter the saloons alone. I need not
have been afraid. Clarence was not there when I
joined the circle; but I felt as if all the guests were
looking at me. I condemned myself for the next few
hours to wear
“That falsest of false things, a mask of smiles.”

Lyle's eye met mine—it seemed to haunt me.

It was an al fresco fête. The heat of the season was
over, but the nights were soft and mild. One of the
long arcades was enclosed, and lit with variegated
lamps; a brilliant moon illuminated the lime-groves ;

every arrangement was made to conduce to the splen-
dour and pleasure of the scene.
I could not stand up to dance. My knees trembled,
my teeth chattered, and I felt my lips turn pale as
Clarence Fairfax drew near with Mrs. Rashleigh. I
could not look at her; she was laughing and talking
in her usual bold strain, and answering for Clarence
questions that were addressed to himself
. He saw me
not, though he cast himself beside me on the couch
his sash streamed over my dress, his sword rested
against my hand, his spur touched my foot. I with-
drew it quickly, and moved aside ; he begged my
pardon for incommoding me. I turned to him to bow,
and the crimson tide flushed that fine face. He
started up nervously. Mrs. Rashleigh rose, too, took
his arm, and led him off. She named me to him in my
hearing. I heard him say, "Hush ! Anna, for mercy's
sake; don't remind me of misdeed."
“ Anna!”--they were indeed on very familiar terms.
She was robed imperially that evening, and looked
wonderfully youthful. Whispers passed from lip to
lip, as she and Clarence passed up the apartment, and
went out into the lime-grove. Others were following
them. I sat, trying to talk to Lyle, and smiling
vacantly at the polite recognitions of some of the
guests.
Lady Amabel came up to me. My dear child,"
said she," you look quite ill-come into the air.
Mr. Lyle, give Miss Daveney your arm."
But I begged to withdraw for a little while, and
Lady Amabel excused me.
The library was the only room unoccupied on this
festal night. A single lamp stood on the table. The
windows of this room opened to that dark walk over-
shadowed by the mountain. Here there were no illu-
minations- no, crowd of dancers. I extinguished the
lamp, and sat down by the open window.
Two figures were walking slowly up and down the

of the mountain, into the moonlit path. It was Mrs.
Rashleigh and Clarence Fairfax." She was talking
vehemently; he was entreating her to be calm.

me,
I could not have obeyed.
She was reproaching him for some imagined neglect.
He told her that she fancied it. Now her tones were
those of passion, vehement and imperious ; he implored
her, for her own sake, to restrain her wrath.
It is impossible to relate to you all I saw and heard,
as, statue-like, I leaned against the window-bitter
imprecations were heaped on my own head. Clarence
would have burst from her at this, but she cast herself
upon his bosom, and clung there, pouring forth the
most passionate expressions of love and regret.
“ Would he desert her? She should die!
She only
lived in his presence.
He saw her gay and brilliant
in society-Oh! if he knew the dark hours she passed
without him.'

They moved slowly, close by the window; she was
talking to him, with her head resting on his shoulder.
She was speaking of her husband—complaining of
him—for Clarence uttered his name in an angry tone,
and then whispering, “ My poor Anna ! and you suf-
fered this for me!" folded her in his arms, and
embraced her wildly.
They were within a yard of me, and I dared not move.
Icy cold were my hands, clasped together; my eye-
balls burned and throbbed, but no tears came to their
relief. I seemed to realize the sensation that Niobe
must have felt on being turned to stone.
They leaned against the window—some one ap-
proached—they started, and were moving on, when
the angry voice of the outraged Mr. Rashleigh arrested
the steps of the guilty pair. The wretched woman

screamed aloud, and clung to Clarence, who, on Mr.
Rashleigh raising his hand to strike him, received a
blow on the arm he had lifted to ward it.
It was Lyle who had thus brought about this ter-
rible esclandre, though of this no one then was aware.
It was he who, as the crowd moved to a refreshment
tent, had put a slip of paper into Mr. Rashleigh's
hands, warning him of his wife's delinquency, and the
scorn in which he was held for his contemptible indif-
ference to her shamelessness. He was informed of
her whereabouts at that instant.
Mr. Rashleigh opened this document in the sight of
many persons; its tone of contempt galled him to the
quick, and, forgetting all consequences but the desire
of revenge, he rushed at once to the scene of his
disgrace.

was Lyle—he carried me into Lady Amabel's boudoir;
she was there, walking 'nervously up and down. She
received me with tears. Lyle withdrew. I felt
grateful for his sympathy, and the kind and delicate
manner in which he had expressed it.

STRIFE.
I saw Clarence Fairfax but once again.
The exposure which had taken place separated the
Rashleighs for ever. Challenges were interchanged
between the gentlemen at the same hour.
The selfish woman who had thus brought disgrace
on her husband, herself, and the man she had in--
fatuated by her art, lost all prudence in her ungo-
vernable state of excitement, and wrote a passionate
appeal, from her retirement near Newlands, entreating
Captain Fairfax to see her once again. But Sir
Adrian had placed his nephew under arrest. Mrs.
Rashleigh had the hardihood to endeavour to force
her way into his quarters by night; she was repelled
from the door at the point of the bayonet, the sentry
having due orders to prevent the ingress of such a
visitor. In vain she implored, in vain she stormed.
Captain Walton kept watch upon his brother-aide-
de-camp within, and would not let him yield to the
temptress.
Clarence resigned his appointment on his uncle's
staff, and was ordered to England forthwith.
Lady Amabel and I were in the library with Sir
Adrian when his nephew entered to take his leave.
It was before official hours, and such a meeting was
wholly unexpected on our part, nor perhaps had he
anticipated it.

“ Sit down, Amabel ; sit down, Miss Daveney," said
Sir Adrian.
· Yes, Clarence, they will both wish you well; I
do, from my soul; I take some blame to myself in
this wretched business; but what is done cannot be
undone. You have been the victim of that wretched,
worthless being, whom it would be an insult to name
here. Sit down, my lad, amongst us again ; we are all
deucedly sorry to part with you ; when
we meet again,
you will be all the wiser for this business, I hope. I
hardly like to let you go, but I suppose I must. I
shall not get on at all well without you, my dear boy.
Confound that devil
· Well, Amabel, it is enough to make any one
swear; for, now that she is fairly down, every one comes
forward to
say that she ought to have been banished
from society long ago. I don't pity her one bit,”
continued the General, rising and pacing the chamber;
" but I am heartily vexed to think she has seduced
my sister's son, and in this affair she is the seducer,
not Clarence."
“Oh! sir, I deserve more reproaches than you
dream of," replied his nephew. "I cannot stay; I
am unworthy of any kindness or consideration. Aunt,
God bless you."
Lady Amabel was sobbing audibly.
I stood mute and tearless.
Something like “Good-bye”
“Good-bye” was whispered. I
looked up in that face, once so ingenuous, so happy.
The laughing eyes were clouded with melancholy; the
saucy curled lip pale and compressed; the tall, grace-
ful form trembling with emotion. Not one word could
I utter. My fingers closed upon his shaking hand
for an instant. I withdrew them. He had pressed
them so tightly in his nervous agony, that the inden-
tation of a little ring I wore drew blood.
“Poor child! poor child !” said Sir Adrian, very
kindly—a sudden thought about me causing him to
stop and look fixedly at my sad countenance; “I pity

you, too, from my heart. Amabel, this has been a
sad business; it has moved me more than I like to
own.”
I looked up~Clarence Fairfax was gone !
The vacant appointment of aide-de-camp was offered
to Mr. Lyle; I applauded his delicacy when he told
me he could not accept it under the circumstance of
Clarence's disgrace.
I rather quailed, though, at that term,“ disgrace,"
applied to “poor Clarence," as Lady Amabel began to
designate him as soon as he departed.
Another staff appointment fell vacant in the frontier
districts. Lyle applied for and obtained it.
He was happy, he said, in the prospect of being
associated with me hereafter, but did not press his
suit.
!
It was not long before I followed him to the upper
districts of South Africa.
Lady Amabel and I parted with sorrow; she had
been ever kind to me; her very errors were those of
a tender-hearted, loving woman, and what would it
have booted me had she been strong-minded and
resolute ? Clarence Fairfax's nature was fickle-I
will add no more.
My journey homeward was a melancholy one; my
friends were kind you know them - Mrs. and
Miss C-; but I retired within myself, and they
had the good taste not to weary me with their sym-
pathy.
On the last day of our journey we halted on the
banks of a rapid river; night fell, and we were about
to close the
wagons and seek
repose,
when we heard
voices on the opposite bank. Your little bushman
May was one of our drivers—he had been in our ser-
vice before, and came to tell me that he recognized

my father's voice. I ran from my tent to the brink of
the river; it was dark, and the rushing of the waters
among the stones in the ford prevented my distin-
guishing any other sound; at last I heard
my
father
hailing us—he was in the middle of the stream—he
came nearer—some one accompanied him—two horse-
men rode up the bank-my father and Lyle!
*
*
I had not been two days at home before I dis-
covered that Lyle had established himself in my
mother's favour—he was quite a person calculated to
make a decided impression on her imagination-for,
sensible, well-principled, and firm-minded, as she is,
you know she is highly excitable and imaginative.
The late émeute in Kafirland had brought my father
from Annerley to B a small town largely garri-
soned. Here Lyle held his appointment-here my
father was now acting in a high official capacity in the
absence of one of the authorities; both were thus
brought together professionally. Lyle necessarily
had the entrée of our house.
Original in design, prompt to act, and of a deter-
mined spirit, Lyle was a most useful coadjutor to my
father. His quickness of perception taught him at
once all the assailable points, so to speak, in my
mother's character, appealing to her judgment fre-
quently in Government matters; and, although doing
this apparently in jest, constantly abiding by her pro-
positions. It was fortunate that her experience in
the colony was such as to make her advice really
available, and this artful man turned it to full ac-
count publicly and privately. He knew well how to
please my father, who had not at first been inclined
towards him as my mother was; whenever the former
gave him credit for good policy, he would refer him
to Mrs. Daveney as the suggester of the plan; my
mother would disclaim the suggestion, but would
confess that Lyle had appealed to her ere he began to
work it,

At a time when this beautiful colony was on the
verge of ruin from the commotions subsisting be-
tween the various races of inhabitants, you may well
believe that men of comprehensive mind and daunt-
less courage were invaluable to the Government.
My father and Lyle, both personally known to Sir
Adrian, were constantly selected by him for the most
difficult and dangerous services, and it is due to the
latter to admit, that he was ever ready for the severer
duties of the field, entreating my father to consider
how much more valuable was the life of the one than
the other.
The soldiers adored him; in his capacity as a staff-
officer he was not expected to volunteer heading large
bodies of the settlers, accompanying commandos into
Kafirland; but he did so with a spirit and efficiency
that materially assisted the Government agents in
their measures with the chiefs. He shared the fatigues
and privations of those he commanded, he was ever
first in a foray, and he was such an excellent sports-
man, that his return with a foraging party was
always welcomed by the hungry wanderers in the
bush.
Were this man still living, dear friend, I could not
dwell on these details; but, assured of his death,
I have been able to review much of my past life
more calmly than I could ever suppose would be
possible.
This clever, handsome, resolute man had, as I after-
wards found, resolved, in the first period of our
acquaintance, on making me his wife-you will wonder
why,—since there was little love on his part, and my
poor heart was bleeding from a sense of wrong at
the hands of one I had loved. But I began to
be ashamed of my girlish passion, verily not without

dily, false though they be, and afterwards the heart
shudders at the bare remembrance of what it suffered
in its bewilderment of a first passion; the experience
taught by such a sorrow is very bitter, and can never
be forgotten.
I cannot bear to detail the artful schemes by which
this man persuaded my father at first to listen to his
proposals for me; but, on my assurance that I loved
him not, Lyle was forbidden to press his suit farther,
at any rate for a time.
Thus he was not dismissed finally ; he declared
himself grievously mortified, and, obtaining leave of
absence during a lull in the political storms that had
threatened to desolate the country, departed on a
sporting expedition.
He returned in three months laden with the spoils
of the chase, and designated the White Somtsen, or, in
the Kafir language, a mighty hunter.
He again renewed his suit.
*
*
Woe is me! I could see that
my
father and my
mother were not agreed in this matter; the latter
openly reproached me for my weakness in adhering to
my first love-she appealed to my pride.
Alas, alas ! my friend, I own that I had been want-
ing in that-I admitted my error, and deplored it.
She spoke of the family reputation being sullied by
the union of my name with that of Clarence Fairfax
and the miserable Mrs. Rashleigh.
I could not see it in the light she did, but I wept
sorely when she alluded to the mortification it had
caused her and my father ; she emphasized the last
two words of this sentence.
She dwelt on a difference of opinion now existing
between her and my father—“it might estrange them
seriously.”
I trembled, and began to waver in my
resolution.
She said that the esclandre had been injurious to my
sister's prospects in life.

I feared that I had been more to blame than I had
believed.
I said “the world was very hard.”
* Very,” replied my mother—“so hard, that your
imprudence has been visited on all of us. I have been
blamed for launching you into the gaieties of life at
Cape Town, with all its incidental temptations. Marion
is pointed out as the sister of “that flirt, Miss Daveney,
Mrs. Rashleigh's rival;' and your father reproaches
himself for not remaining with you when he discovered
that Lady Amabel Fairfax had lost rather than gained
in strength of character”
I could have said, “Ah! mother, how do you
learn
what the world says of us ?-who dares tell
you
these
things ?”. I was not aware then that Lyle, in his own
specious, deprecatory way, was her informant, directly
or indirectly—“grieving to set such unpleasant truths
before her, but deeming it his duty to do so."
You will wonder that a clever woman like my
mother did not see through this systematic deceit;
but she was bitterly annoyed at the issue of Clarence
Fairfax's attentions to me; she fancied herself pointed
at by the finger of pity—you know how sensitive she is
on this point-and she was impatient at my belief
that Clarence had loved me. “ Had he ever told me
so seriously? Was I blind enough to believe him in
earnest ? He had never loved me; his regard, such as
it was, was contemptible."
More, much more, she said I admitted that Clarence
had never been my acknowledged lover; but-

I confessed that he was fickle--" And vain ?"-
“ And selfish, and heartless, and unprin-
cipled !”

older than himself, and deeply versed in intrigue.
I had once ventured to speak in this strain, and had

anger, which
drawn forth words of scorn and
my
mother afterwards repented using, but which I ever
dreaded to evoke again.
But the climax of Lyle's art lay in an incident I
shall record.
My father and I were riding one day, sauntering
through a kloof, when we were overtaken by him. At
the end of this kloof was a branch of a rapid stream.
Here it was deep and dangerous; but my horse and I
knew the ford well-Lyle rode a little behind me. In
the middle of the stream my horse began to plunge
among the stones—my father was a few yards in
advance ; he could not easily turn to my aid, owing to
the strength of the current-I was alarmed, yet tried
to restrain the animal, but he plunged the more;
Lyle, with his powerful arm, drew me from my saddle,
and bore me before him safely across the drift-my
horse was swept down—it is the same old gray we
pet sometimes; he was found two days after, hanging
to a branch by his bridle, having found a footing on
the bank.
Can
you conceive a man afterwards boasting of this
trick ? 'It was Lyle who had made the animal plunge,
that he might rescue me, and thus place me under a
supposed obligation for my life!
My mother insisted on my going into society-she
was doubtless right; but you know what society
consists of in a great garrison,-a few ladies, crowds
of gentlemen, and some women, whose friendship
is far from desirable; I believe some of the latter
were unsparing in their scandalous chronicles of
Cape Town, when Mrs. Rashleigh and I were both
made subjects of remark. The girl of seventeen, the
daughter of a representative of authority, and of a
mother whose abilities and lofty aspirations rendered
her an object of fear and dislike with many, was not
likely to be dealt with gently by these idle, frivolous,
uneducated women; the story of Miss Daveney's
"liaison” with Captain Fairfax lost nothing in such

hands; and although most of our earliest friends stood
by us through good report and evil report, these were
not many, and it was evident that the faith of some
was shaken. Lyle took care that my father and
mother should see this—he alluded to it with indig-
nation, and avowed himself more devoted than ever--
“My milher urged me sair, my father could na speak,
But he looked in my face"-
I asked for time-I sincerely believed that I had
banished Clarence from my heart, it 'not from my
mind. I accustomed myself to receive Lyle's atten-
tions; they were offered, though not offensively, in
the sight of other men, and in an evil hour for all, I
yielded.
I admired Lyle--I admired his courage, his abilities,
his apparently independent spirit, his resolution; I
was perpetually told that his perseverance deserved
reward.
I married him, believing that I felt a regard and
admiration for him, which would ripen into affection.
How much it has already cost me to set down these
details, these reasons, or excuses—if you think the last
word the truest—for consenting to a union which has
blighted so many years of my young life!

I have him before me now. I hear the solemn
adjuration of the minister of God, as we stood before

and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful
day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall
be disclosed, that if either of you know any impedi-
ment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in
Matrimony, ye do now confess it."
I looked up at
the tall, powerful man standing beside me. Never
shall I forget his countenance—his features were suf-
fused with a leaden hue, which faded to a deadly
pallor, his lips were colourless, and he leaned against
the altar-rails for support; but he recovered him-

We had been married about two months, when I
discovered that my husband was expecting letters
from England; he was evidently anxious about these.
And why? He had described himself to my family
as being without a single relation on earth, except the
uncle from whom he had brought recommendatory
letters; he had made a fair settlement on me, and my
father had placed before him a due account of his
finances and my prospects. My father was then a
wealthy landholder in Albany; but, unfortunately, he
had placed the greater part of his savings in one of
those great banking-houses in India, which failed so
suddenly as to ruin thousands.
My family had returned to Annerley, and my hus-
band and I had just taken up our abode at B-
when the fatal news of my father's heavy loss reached
us.
I had already had some experience of Lyle's vio-
lence of temper on his resuming his official duties :
there are some men, you know, whose tempers are
more violent than hasty, who can curb their passions
when obliged to bend before a superior power, and
whose wrath finds vent for itself at home; but I
was unprepared for the storm that burst on my de-
voted head at the announcement by letter of our
pecuniary misfortunes.
He accused my father of wilfully deceiving him ; he
bestowed the most revolting epithets on my mother,
and laughed bitterly at my having believed he could
love "such a pale-faced, forsaken, meek-spirited little
idiot for herself alone."

think, my
My father received letters from Sir Adrian. Here
is an extract from one: “ What will
you
dear Daveney, when I tell you that this Lyle, whom
we have received in our homes, proves to be nothing
more than a swindler? I have discovered that, not
only in England, but at the Cape, he has persuaded
various persons
to back bills to a considerable amount;
he has not a sixpence beyond his commission, which
he will be obliged to sell immediately. I have written
him a letter on the subject; and for your sake, my
dear Daveney, I do hope the affair will be managed as
quietly as possible. I inclose a few lines from Amabel,
who is deeply distressed for your daughter. We have
all been grievously deceived; and I consider that the
credentials he brought me from various military friends
should never have been accorded to this young man,
who, though professing to be a reformed character, was
not to be depended upon. The person to whom he
has been chiefly indebted for letters of introduction
granted them under peculiar circumstances, and in
the hopes that this handsome, plausible, clever vaga-
bond would mend his ways: he is young enough ;
but, I am sorry to say, I have proofs of his being
thoroughly depraved."
Sir Adrian did not know the worst. The docu-
ments which Lyle had laid before my father, previous
to our marriage, 'were forgeries.

JASPER LYLE:
You will wonder, since there was clearly no regard
for me from beginning to end, why I was selected as
a victim by this being, who, as you will learn some
day, had been unfortunate. It was from his lips I
heard the unwelcome truths: there was little time
before him to obtain a sure footing in South Africa in
an honourable position, ere bills, indorsed by men
whom he had succeeded in duping, would become due.
Subtle of purpose, he easily gained such information
touching the young protégé of Lady Amabel Fairfax,
as made him think it worth his while to lay siege to
me. Lady Amabel was just the facile, guileless, un-
suspecting woman to whom it was easy to gain access,
and this once accomplished, he readily found favour
with me—it would not have done to deliberate; and,
furthermore, I was the only girl, with whom he was
intimately associated, whose means were accredited.
My father was known to possess a considerable sum
of money, and a fine landed property. Lyle contrived
to have a correspondence with my father touching
settlements; the latter little knew that every line he
wrote was sent to England to reassure creditors.
He had a deep-laid scheme, too, relative to my young
sister, had I failed him. Time, time, was all he wanted;
and by sending home the correspondence on my father's
part, he succeeded in persuading some of his dupes to
renew the bills, offering high interest for this.
Will you believe it, when ruined in character and
fortune, it was his pleasure to lay bare these schemes
before me?
For some time after he had abjured his military
career, it was his policy to keep up an outward show

any man that he has sometimes taken me by the hair
of my head, and swung me round the apartment, till,
terrified, dizzy, and blind, I have fainted.
We had a wicked servant too, a Malay woman, who
hated me, and who was readily persuaded into spread-
ing a report that I was ill-tempered.
My poor father managed, in spite of difficulties, to
make us an allowance that would have been amply
sufficient for our wants had my husband been a rea-
sonable being ; but a man utterly devoid of principle,
and angrily deploring the ruin he has brought upon
himself,is not a reasonable being. My wretched partner
for life grew frantic at last with rage and disappointment
when Sir Adrian Fairfax found it necessary to denounce
him as a swindler; for, some of the better class of mer-
chants, deceived by his plausibility, were disposed to
trust him; and he had the hardihood to expect that
Sir Adrian, for the sake of my family, would place
him in a situation, with certain emoluments, at the
request of the most influential men connected with
the commerce and the diplomacy of the Cape Colony.
Much that I have last noted down has been drawn
from communications passing between my father, Sir
Adrian, and some other gentlemen, who were anxious,
if possible, to save Lyle from utter ruin.
His reputation was irretrievably gone; but they
would still have given him, if they could, the means
of existence. Sir Adrian, however, could not in
honour permit this; and I was beginning to consider
where we should hide our heads, at any rate till after
my infant's birth, when one morning I discovered
that the little money we had had in the house had
been taken from my desk. My husband had departed.
Whither, it was not easy to say.

house. My mother opened her arms to
receive me. You see her sometimes look reproach-
ingly upon me. She derives such unmitigated relief at
the idea of my release from bondage by the death of
my miserable husband, that she grows angry at times
because I mourn the wasted years I have passed, and
have no heart to meet the future.
I had remained three months at Annerley, often in
dread of my husband's return, but beginning to hope
that a letter which my father had despatched to him,
through a trader, would induce him to accede to a legal
separation. Alas! it seemed to me that it only re-
minded him that he held in his hands the power of
tormenting me.
I was one evening walking up and down the trellised
passage, pondering mournfully on my future prospects,
when the author of all my misery appeared before me.
He was scarcely recognisable at first. His com-
plexion was bronzed, his beard and whiskers, enor-
mously grown, gave him a ferocious appearance,
and his costume was more like that of a buccaneer
than anything else. He carried pistols in his belt,
and on my screaming as he seized my hand, he drew
one of the weapons out, and, in sheer recklessness,
discharged it. The ball entered the thatched roof; the
noise attracted my father from the vineyard.
The scene that ensued baffles description. My
father drew me towards him. Lyle held the pistol, with
one barrel yet undischarged, close to my head. My
father released me in dismay, and stood helpless. It
had been useless to attempt to thrust the weapon
aside" Advance a finger, stir a foot,” said Lyle, "and
I fire. She is my wife ; you gave her to me, and a
precious bargain I have got. I will keep her while it
suits me, and when I am inclined to go roving again, I
will send her back. Call me swindler!—it was you who

mind to palm off upon me what Fairfax had cast off!

My father would fain have drawn Lyle away, to
prevent so public an exposure. Little May was in our
service at that time-he had a kierrie (stick), and,
springing up, struck the pistol out of my persecutor's
hand.
It was impossible, however, to come to terms with
him. All that my father could obtain from him was a
respite till a wagon could be prepared for travelling,
and some arrangement made for occupying a small
farm near B-
It was not far from Mr. Trail's
mission station, and within a mile or two of a little

You were speaking of Mimosa Drift the other day.
You know the desert solitude of that beautiful spot.
Ah! what terrible hours have I passed among the
alders overhanging that hoarsely-murmuring river !
For there I would retire to weep, sometimes; there
I would hide myself from my husband in his hours of
wrath.
But these fits of insane rage became unendurable ;
and one night, after I had been struck to the earth, I
had the presence of mind to lie as if insensible. The
single Bechuana servant we had, terrified at the scene
of violence she witnessed, rushed away in the darkness
of the night to the little fort, where, on the command-
ing officer being informed of what was passing in our
wretched home, he immediately set off with assistance
to the rescue.
But I had flown-Lyle was there, raging like a wild

ness.
The night was pitchy dark when I crawled to
Mimosa Drift, and sat down by the river side to
recover my scattered senses. My feet were bare and
bleeding, a shawl, hastily snatched up, covered my
night-dress, and my hair streamed over my shoulders.
I had been dragged from my bed to look for some
ammunition which had been left out, and which I had
unfortunately put away in my ignorance of my hus-
band's intentions to go out shooting at dawn. Tired,
frightened, and confused, I could not remember where
I had put it for safety; discovering it at last, he found
that it had got damp from the rain dripping through
the thatch, and I paid the penalty of my thoughtless-

across the plain. The wind was howling between the
hills; great masses of cloud were floating like palls in
the lead-coloured atınosphere above; below all was
gloom, except when bright forked tongues of lightning
descended before me, showing every stone, every
insect, in my path; a shower of light struck the earth,
and spread into a sheet of flame, that ran past me, and
seemed to set the ground on fire. My shawl was
caught by the blast-I was drawn back-I fancied it
tormentor-I shrieked aloud, and the tempest
answered me from the hollows in the mountains ;
large drops of rain began to fall heavily upon my face
-the thunder roared--I never thought of turning ; on
I sped, wild with fear. The drift sheltered me from

the strength of the blast for a minute; the wolves and
jackals were screaming to each other from their hiding-
places; the hyenas gibbered and mocked at me, with
their sneering laugh; the bats wheeled on the air
whithersoever it drew them-their cold wings swept
at times across my burning cheek-the murmur of the
river increased to a tumult. I dreaded being seized
unawares, and, springing into the stream, forded it,
heaven knows how, in safety.
I must have lost my way, for, after wandering about
for hours, I came at dawn to the foot of one of those
sudden elevations which almost baffle human strength
in ascending them. The tempest had subsided, but
the rain shaded the heavens as with a veil. I ascended
the mound with much toil, but could see nothing but
bald rocks, and shrubs beaten by the torrent.
down upon a stone, shivering with cold and fear, and
wept as I had not done for months.
The clouds lifted at last, and showed me more dis-
tinctly my utter loneliness. God sent help. I heard
a sheep-bell tinkle, and guessed rightly that I was not
far from Mr. Trail's mission station. I followed the
welcome sound, and soon recognized the plentiful
gardens sloping to the road. I crawled up the accli-
vity. Day was banishing the Genius of the Storm as
I approached tlie gate. The windows of the school-
house were open, and the servants of the household
were assembled there in prayer. The“ Ainen ”swelled
like the murmur of an ocean wave; the voices of the
worshippers rose in the matin hymn, and, overcome
with exhaustion, and the transition from terror to
peace, I fell insensible at the threshold of the mission-
house.

JASPER LYLE:
CHAPTER XV.
DISMAY.
I RECOVERED myself in the arms of kind Mrs. Trail.
Oh! the repose of a quiet darkened room after such a
night! My friend laid me on her bed, and, giving
me a sedative, left me to the rest I so much needed.
But fearful dreams pursued me, and I was awoke by
angry voices beneath
my
window.
Too weak to move, my sense of hearing was too
acute to mistake one of those voices; Lyle was de-
manding me from Mr. Trail, the latter refused to
“deliver me up;" and my enraged husband, seeing,
I suppose, that it would be in vain to do battle in the
mission-garden, where the herds had gathered to
defend their master, if need required, departed,
threatening and cursing as he went.
Mrs. Trail came to me-I could only weep and
moan in her arms; by night I was so extremely ill,
that an express was despatched for my father.
And in this hour of dire distress and perplexity
my boy was born. Truly he was baptized in tears.
He was so weak and delicate, that we feared he would
die. I leaned over him in jealous terror as Mr. Trail
bestowed the Christian name of Francis
upon
him-
I named him after
my
father.
But, like those flowers which unfold their loveliness
amid the storms of the desert, he flourished in spite
of the evil influences surrounding me.
I was constantly persecuted by the desperate man to
whom I was chained by the law. My fears were now for
my boy; if I should lose him! Ah! what long, miser-
able watches have I kept by night over his little bed!

Although I knew that, by legal course, I could be
torn from my home, I yearned once more for my
father's sheltering arms. My mother learned, too
late, at what a cost I had obliged her, and came for me
herself.
We were obliged to travel by night, and with an
armed party; we well knew at, as far as law
went, Lyle was empowered to bear me off through the
desert; but my father was resolved to risk all to
secure me from wrong and insult, until he could per-
suade Lyle to agree to a legal separation.
But, while this was pending, Lyle's pleasure was to
sue my father from time to time for “harbouring his
wife.”
At this time a rumour reached my father that Lyle
had another wife living, but we all shrunk from such
additional exposure. The kind-hearted commandant
of the military outpost, near Mimosa Drift, took
advantage of this rumour to threaten Lyle with an
investigation; and doubtless Sir Adrian would have
released me from legal bondage pending the necessary
inquiries. The issue would only have involved us in
deeper disgrace, for we have since ascertained that
Lyle, by means of false representations-forgery has
been hinted at — had inveigled a girl, with some
money, into a mock marriage, and had deserted her,
after dissipating her property.
Be this as it may, we deemed it best to ignore the
rumour; but it had its effect on Lyle, who again
retired into Kafirland.
My friends at Fort Wellington entreated me to
visit them for a while, and though my father and
mother were unwilling that I should leave them, and
my very dread of the neighbourhood made me hesi-
tate, I consented at last, considering how much my
father's constant anxiety at sight of me weighed against
his zeal in his official capacity.
Certainly there was a greater feeling of security for
me in the little fortress. Sentinels at the gates, and

these closed at night, I could go to rest, with my
boy on my arm, certain that, under Providence, no
rude hand could awaken me, and tear him from my
bosom. Long used to lonely midnight vigils, I would
start up sometimes frightened from my sleep by what
seemed an angry voice, and then would fall back on
my pillow, relieved by the sound of the sentinel's
measured footsteps, and the loud clear cry of “All's
well !”
I could have been comparatively happy here, for,
although unsettled and miserable at first, Mrs. Lorton
was an active, intelligent, cheerful woman; and I was
delighted to share with her the task of instructing
her little family.
Anxious to relieve my parents, in their present re-
duced circumstances, from the burden of maintaining
myself and my boy, I entered with some zest upon
my new duties, and each morning found me the
centre of a little group of children, with books, work,
and music; and, to add to this feeling of repose, we
ascertained that my husband had shaken the dust of
Africa from his feet, and departed for England.
But he left me his curse, and it pleased Providence
that it should be fulfilled.
My boy was suddenly stricken with fever-you
know how impossible it is in the desert to obtain
timely medical aid. When the surgeon from a dis-
tant garrison arrived, it was too late to save my pre-
cious treasure.

tried to raise his weary head and bow his thanks, but
sunk back with a cry of anguish.

The few sands in the hour-glass of that little life
ran slowly out; the light from the beautiful eyes
shone into mine like rays of hor The children
gazed tearfully upon their pretty Frank ;" he would
try to smile, and once he spoke. “Mamma,” he whis-
pered, “you will be sorry for poor little Francy---
kiss me, mamma; I love you." I bent down-my hot
tears fell upon his face—he felt them not-my little
flower faded so gently away, that we knew not the
moment his spirit departed.
My cup of sorrow was full to the brim.-With
anguish too deep for tears, I performed the last offices
of love for
my
darling I would fain have followed
him to his grave in the burying-ground near the
fortress; often it seems to me now that there only
could I find rest.

But this is sinful—I should rather pray that my

lation, but

rebellious heart refused all comfort.

I would see my darling's little coffin borne from
the fortress. I sat at a window that overlooked the
gateway, and watched the simple procession with a
heart so still, that it seemed turned to stone in its
agony. My eyes were fixed and tearless, I dreaded
the last look of that coffin which held all my hopes.
*
I am a soldier's daughter—but I could take no
pride, for the sake of my darling, in the last honours
that were paid his little corpse—as it passed the gate,
the guard of the Fifty -st regiment turned out and
presented arms to the coffin. At this simple but

characteristic compliment to my dead child, the well-
springs of my full heart overflowed, and I burst into
tears.
The procession passed through the gateway, the
soldiers retired to the guard-house, the single sentry
kept his measured beat, and I, in my desolation, cast
myself upon my bed and cried aloud, " What have I
done, what have I done, to be so afflicted by the hand
of God ?"
“Say, rather, chastered," said Mrs. Lorton. "Ah!
Eleanor, believe me, that those whom the Lord never
sees fit to chasten are not to be envied, as you, in your
present sorrow, would believe."
The little miniature you have seen of
my Francis
was taken from life by Mrs. Lorton; it fell into Mr.
Trail's hands through the loss of a box when I was
travelling ; it has, you see, twice escaped destruction.
I returned to Annerley, broken-hearted. It was our
winter-a desolate one, memorable in the annals of
the colony for its storms and floods.
Oh! how long it was before the cold wind and rain,
which I heard beating against the windows, ceased to
send a shudder through my heart, for fear they should
injure my poor little lost snowdrop. I had dreaded
leaving Fort Wellington, yet, what a trial it was there
to see the vacant place in the nursery, and the unused
playthings, carefully put away by Mrs. Lorton, but
sometimes drawn out by stealth, that I might weep
over them!
These last lines of the manuscript are almost
illegible, from the tears that had fallen on them.
Frankfort's eyes were dim.
How shall I tell you the rest ? The unhappy being
who was bound to me by my wretched fate disap-
peared, as I have said. For more than two years we
heard nothing of him. At last, we learned that he

land, calling themselves patriots, who stir the people
up to discontent by disseminating false principles
among them. He was to be heard of in the different
manufacturing districts, rousing the lower classes, and,
as he himself said, “teaching them what they wanted:"
thus he drew the weaver from his poor hearth, to
send him back more discontented and unsettled than
ever;
the farmer from the market, to set him against
his landlord, whom hitherto he had loved; the mechanic
from his work, which afterwards he had no heart to
finish;
the
reaper from the sunny fields, and the boy
from his home, to destroy its influences if good, to
foster them if evil; and those who listened went
from him dissatisfied with themselves, and with “
in their hearts” towards their fellow-men.
In a word, you well knew the name of Jasper Lee,
he who was convicted for a conspiracy against the
Government. He was my husband the name of Lee
was an assumed one.
Within six months we have received authentic
intelligence of his death, and I am personally disen-
thralled of my heavy chain, but I bear its marks-my
head has been bowed to earth by this galling yoke,
and I shall feel that your decree will be just when you
renounce me for ever.
I am thankful that, at last, I can recognize the
hand of God in all the suffering I have undergone.
Do you remember my requesting an interview once
with Mr. Trail ?--you stood by and saw my confusion
on discovering you. Ah! I cannot tell you the con-
solation I have derived from that good man.
You will believe me fully, when I say that the idea
of obtaining your love never entered my head—it will
soothe me in my most lonely and melancholy hours to
think that you considered me worthy of it.
I have written this sad record somewhat roughly-I
fear, too, somewhat incoherently; much that must
have wearied you might have been omitted, and yet,
much remains untold. Alas! you have had to learn

not so much the history of my sorrow, as
of
my
disgrace.
Yes, disgrace--my misfortunes have been greater
than my faults, yet, in justice to others, I would not
have you account me blameless. I believe, if I had
the courage at first to tell my mother that I never
could love Lyle as I ought to do, she would not
have urged me to marry him. But I was passive in
her hands-indeed, I was bewildered.
I cannot tell you what it has cost me to write this.
While others sleep, my brain aches with conflicting
emotions; I pace my room again; I take up my pen,
scrawl a few lines, then erase them, and again com-
my
restless walk.
Soinetimes, overcome with hours of anxiety and un-
rest, I try to sleep, but my thoughts sway to and fro like
a sea, and I fall into that visionary state between waking
and sleeping, when the real and the imaginary are
so blended together, that no effort of our own can
separate them. Lo, then, I see you for a moment,
standing upon a sun-lit shore, with arms outstretched
towards me, then dark clouds arise between us, I
strive to reach the strand; but heavy booming waves
engulph and toss me to and fro, and next my hus-
band's face looks up from the surge, and his horrible
laugh awakens me.

When I heard of his death, deploring it as I did
for his sake, since I fear he had no time for repent-
ance, I did dream that fresh hopes might spring
from such an event-hopes of security and peace in
the bosom of my own family.
Alas ! having known you, I feel all the bitterness
of my lot with double force.
But what an apprenticeship I have served to
anguish! In time I may learn to bear even your loss,
and shall find consolation in the memory of your regard.

I cannot revise what I have written, though I dread
lest what I have said may impress you with a sense of
my inferiority.
I have asked myself this question often-“Will he
despise or pity me?” Both, perhaps. Your reason
will induce something of contempt—but your heart
will teach you to pity the unfortunate
ELEANOR.
There were many erasures in the manuscript; it
was unlike the ladies' love-letters described as written
in “fair Italian characters,” but albeit the style was
irregular, the writer's purpose was clear and decided.
In her feelings towards Frankfort, she evidently
“let I dare not, wait upon I would." His was just
the heart to appreciate the candour and the delicacy of
sentiment betrayed rather than displayed in this
record of human weakness, suffering, and wrong.
I have shown you that he was a man accustomed to
use his reason. It must be owned that he had never
found this so difficult to do as now: he was thoroughly
unselfish; but he had a mother and sisters—how would
they look on such connection ? Would it be wise to
draw Eleanor from the retirement of her father's
home? Facile, easily impressed, would she, were
she even free from the marks of her galling fetters,
be suited to him as a companion for life, or rather
could he make her happy? Then he asked himself
why this question of suitability had not presented
itself to his mind before now.
It was fortunate for Eleanor that the question re-
solved itself to this. His own position, his mother,
sisters, family connections, all became secondary con-
siderations before the one grand hope of brightening
this joyless creature's career.
Frankfort wrote Eleanor a few lines, as follows :-
“I thank you for the last line of your

we allude again to the terrible recital I have
passed the night in reading.
“ It

dawning. You know how averse I am to decide
suddenly on momentous points. Ere long the family
will be assembled for prayer ; we shall meet there; till

Eleanor found this note on her dressing-table. She
dwelt most upon the three last words.

She was first in the school-room, Mr. Trail fol-
lowed, and the household worshippers were soon col-
lected. As Eleanor was leaving the room, Frankfort
drew near. They shook hands. It was a friendly
greeting on his part; she bent her head and walked
slowly by, he did
not follow.
In after-life Frankfort would look back on that day
as the most momentous in his existence-even more
so than that terrible one on which-
But, what am I doing? Anticipating what it is not
you should know, my reader.
He was absent the greater part of the day, medi-
tating in the solitude of the hills. The little settle-
ment lay below the mountain slope where he sat.
It was a busy, happy, thriving place; the sunlight fell
on richly-cultivated lands and herds of fine cattle, the
vineyard was filled with workers ; Marion and Ormsby
were there laughing, he wreathing her brow with a
garland of grapes and vine-leaves—she looked like a
Bacchante; their voices in gay harmony floated up
the green hill-side ; women and children were seated
in shady nooks at work and at play ; the Trails and
Mr. and Mrs. Daveney were walking up and down
the avenue in earnest conversation.
In contrast to this scene of employment and cheer-
fulness, was Eleanor reclining beneath the corallo-

Frankfort had held their last meeting.
She was in a deep reverie ; her head rested on her
hand-her looks were bent upon the ground. Frank-

were only severed from each other by the ravine

And was it in his power to shed light and life on
the pathway of this desolate young creature ?
Motionless she sat as a statue, little dreaming that
he, whose image had filled her thoughts, was so near.
With all her philosophy, inborn, and lately taught
by Mr. Trail, she could not help considering her lot a
severe one ; but she called to mind the good minister's
reply, on her observing, in the words of the Psalmist,
“ I thought to understand this, but it was too bard
for me.”
CC
Yes," he had said, “ too hard for us to under-
stand; but look to the words that follow : 'until I
went into the sanctuary of God, then understood I the
end of these things.'
She rose and resolved on seeking the good teacher;
but ere she had moved many paces along the turf,
Frankfort stood beside her.
Love, charity, and tenderness of heart had tri-
umphed over all selfish considerations; the
making this patient, suffering, wronged creature happy
superseded all other sentiments.

full for utterance save in whispers, till the shadow of
the corallodendrums lengthened on the sward.
They rose to return to the house.
“Let us go to my father and mother,” said Eleanor.
Hark, a sound !--something whirred past them, and
descended so swiftly that they saw nothing till the
long, slender shaft of an assegai quivered upright in the
ground, within a few paces of their feet. May, who
had, unobserved by them, been gathering water-cresses
immediately below the Devil's Kloof, started up before
them. He had not from the hollow observed them ;
the three stood for a minute or two utterly con-
founded.
Frankfort drew the weapon out in haste, and hur-
ried Eleanor to the house; they met Marion and
Ormsby, mirthful as ever.
“We were going to look for you,” said Ormsby,
with a sly smile; but a glance at Frankfort told of
serious matter.
On reaching the house, and relating what had
occurred, Mrs. Daveney congratulated Frankfort on
having escaped danger from lurkers in the hills
during his morning saunter with his rifle, which, by
the way, he had forgotten to use. Lights were brought.
Mr. Daveney said little, but took the assegai in hand
to examine it.
There were some letters scratched on its polished
blade; they gathered round to look. On the one side
was inscribed the year “18—;" Mrs.

the lamp nearer; on the other, deeply and freshly in-
dented, were two words

her face with her hands. They had no doubt now
who was the agitator in Kafirland.
Before sunset a scout came in, breathlessly an-
nouncing that slender wreaths of smoke were begin-
ning to curl up on the points of the hills, and that a
Kafir herald, with a feather at his ancle, had been
seen by the herds stealing up a pathway from the
kloof. Some of these herds had probably followed him,
for there were deserters among the farm servants.
“Then,” said Mrs. Daveney, “this is the surest
sign of an attack, if we wanted no other evidence of
mischief. And now, God help us !” She withdrew
with Marion.

At midnight the watch-fires sparkled on the moun-
tains, and along the more distant ridges the war-cry
sounded faintly; but before morning dawned it rang
out, loud, prolonged, and clear, and the settlers at
Annerley knew that Kafirland was

the sun.
MEANWHILE, guided by Doda, Lee, or, as we may
now call him, Lyle, threaded his way through some of
those innumerable defiles which, cleaving the great
mountains of the Amakosa country in twain, afford
covert for many a marauding party with its cattle;
and, having passed the Zonga River, the two wanderers
sat down to rest in a “murky glen,” impervious to
At the time when the people at Umlala's Kraal were
intent on torturing the unhappy Amayeka, Lyle and
Doda were quietly preparing to refresh themselves
with such provision as they had brought with them,
and both were not a little startled at hearing the
branches in the jungle giving way before some foot-
steps. There was a crash close to them; two horns
emerged from the speck boom, or elephant bush, the
head of a huge ox became visible, the body followed,
and then two dusky figures. These were our old
friend Zoonah and a thieving comrade. The animal
had been abstracted from a kloof, where a herd of
stolen cattle had been concealed, and the worthy pair
had sought this solitary spot with intent to slaughter
the beast, and keep holiday as long as it lasted.
The apparition of a white man, seated beside Doda,
elicited from them the usual exclamation of “Ma-
wo!” but the party very soon understood each other,
and the three Kafirs having reimed the poor creature,
they proceeded to destroy it after their own fashion,
which I should be sorry to describe. Suffice it to say,

that the wretched animal, being secured beyond all
power of resistance, was deprived of its tongue by the
most cruel process, and its skin subjected to the
assegai ere it was fairly dead.
Of late years the Kafirs have abandoned this
shocking mode of slaughter ; but some of them, when
beyond the influence of the white man, or of their
less savage chiefs, will occasionally adhere to the old
custom.
Lyle gave up all idea of proceeding on his journey
that day; he knew his friends too well to suppose
they would separate with such a feast before them. It
is just to him to say that he turned with horror and
disgust from the quivering body of the poor ox, and
would have ended its agony by shooting it, had it
been prudent to use fire-arms.
The three Kafirs-Doda, Zoonah, and Lulu-applied
themselves to the plentiful meal before them with a
gusto indescribable, and then lay down to sleep.
Lyle would have travelled on alone, but this was inn-
practicable, as the only paths that could be safely tra-
versed were new to him; so he was fain to stretch
himself on the grass, and reconsider his plans, which
could not be matured till he came face to face with his
desperate colleagues, the disaffected Boers. Zoonah
was to be questioned as to what he knew of colonial
matters, for Doda informed Lyle that he was a well-
known spy; but greediness and sloth are the principal
characteristics of the Kafir, and till these inclinations
were satisfied, nothing could be elicited. Lyle knew
that; so, giving way to weariness himself, he, too, fell
asleep.
But for this, the noise of the explosion at Umlala's
Kraal might have reached them.
They slept on through the hour of noon, till the
sun, reaching its meridian, pierced even the dense
jungle with a ray or two of light, and Lyle rose, and
would have rejoiced much in a cool bath, had there been

a stream near; but the torrent that in the rainy
season roared and tumbled over the rocks in the
middle of the kloof was almost dry; he could only lave
his face and hands in the pools, but even this was
refreshing
The three Kafirs were talking together as he
ascended the bank, and Doda related to him the tra-
dition of the Sunless Kloof.
It was here that the first white man had been seen
by the Amakosas.
“He came,” said Doda, “from there," pointing
westward. “The tribes whom this wild rider-for he
was on horseback-passed on the way were too much
terrified to stop him—the covering on his head was
supposed to be part of it, but when he lifted it, it
caused still greater surprise. He was seen to get off
his horse at one time, and the people followed the
spoor. They had never seen shoes then; and the print
of his feet, so different to our own, made them believe
he was not formed like ourselves. He carried in his
hand a long hollow weapon, from which there came
forth fire, smoke, and thunder; and the horse, being
an animal never before seen by Kafirs, caused deeper
dread. The natives shunned him as a being not of
earth. Some killed cattle on his approach, and placed
it in his way as a peace-offering, and, in return, he
would leave beads and tobacco beside it. Some ho-
noured him as a wizard; from him the Wizard's
Glen' takes its name, for his footprints were disco-
vered there one day. He had nearly reached the sea,
when Narini's people, believing him to be some unna-
tural animal, determined to kill him, and, watching
him from the rocks, hunted him down, and asse-
gaied him. Since then, men have said that he was one
of a tribe of white people, who had been sent by their
chief to the country beyond Shiloh: almost all were
murdered. Some found their way back by the Winter-
berg, but this one must have intended to seek the
Zooluh country, where it was known that a race with

white skins, but hair dark as the crow's wing, ex-
changed beads for slaves."*
Doda ceased to speak, and Zoonah and Lulu com-
menced singing a wild air, the first words of which
were intended to imitate the clatter of a horse's hoof.
" Ite cata, cata mawooka,
Na injormane."
" Clatter clatter, he is going ;
He goes with a horse, he goes with speed.”
Over and over again they repeated this inharmo-
nious, monotonous
“ Ite cata, cata mawooka,”
and then drew the embers of the fire together, and
prepared to set to work anew upon some fresh steaks
of meat.
So, sleeping, and eating, and talking alternately,
these savages passed the day in the Sunless Kloof.
Lyle was content to wait till nightfall ere he advanced,
and as he was able to understand much of the lan-
guage of these children of the wilderness, he listened
not without interest to a conversation between Doda
and Lulu, the latter never having been located, like
Doda and Zoonah, among the missionaries. He had
lately, however, paid a visit to one of the larger frontier
towns, where he had heard an account of a criminal's
execution; he had not seen it himself, and therefore
was sceptical.
“I do not doubt,” said Doda, “ for I have been told
by the teacher, that the English always kill a mur-
derer." +
"And I," remarked Zoonah, "have conversed with
people who have described the manner in which they
kill them by hanging them with string by the neck on
poles."
Lulu, after thinking for some minutes, observed,
* The Portuguese
led on the south-east coast.
+ The literal translation is, “ one murders another."

The English must have more people than they can
manage ?”
“Why do you say so ?" asked Doda, who, being the
elder, took the lead in the conversation.
“Because I see no end to be answered in killing
him ; it is surely sufficient that the one already dead
should die. Killing his murderer will not raise him to
life again, neither will it benefit his family: besides, it
is depriving the chief of one man more.”
Zoonah interposed, “ The English say that the mur-
derer must be made to feel what the dead man felt-
that was, to die.'
“But what help," asked Lulu, who, though the
least educated, was the shrewdest of the three in argu-
ment,-"what help is that to the living? Why do they
not eat him up,* and let him live ?”
Zoonah spoke, in a low, deep voice,“ Where is the
the dead ?"
“No more!” replied Doda ; "he has ceased to be.”
Then,” asked Lulu, “how will he know his mur-
derer has been killed or eaten up ?-he is not there to
see him."
“What need," asked Zoonah," for him to know he
is no more?"
“It would compensate his heart for the loss of his
body,” replied Lulu.
“But," said Doda, "we have nothing more to do with
his heart—his body is gone-he is no longer a man."
There was a long pause.
Doda was the first to break silence. “When," said
he, “I inquire of my own heart, one view of the case
makes me on the side of the English lawgivers. We
know the two principals in a murder are the murderer
and the murdered. The last has left this world, so we
cannot call for his evidence. The murderer denies all
about it. The English say, God made man; to destroy
what God made is ukwapula umsila, to break His

property.

your
representative. It is clearly a case beyond the juris-
diction of man. It can only be understood and dis-
posed of by the maker of the dead thing; and on these
grounds it seems reasonable that the murderer should
be sent the same path that he caused the other to go,
in order that they may meet and be judged before God.”
“I see what you say,” answered Lulu, after due
deliberation; “it is too strong for me. Do the Eng-
lish do this from such views? They can talk: they do
talk-but one cannot always believe them. The argu-
ment is good. My heart is satisfied; I have heard.
My heart is satisfied with words. Nevertheless,
I do not comprehend
And Lulu withdrew to ponder in silence on this
argument.
After this, Lyle bid Doda question Zoonah on all
that he had seen in his late perambulations “ to and
fro”
upon
the earth.
Zoonah complied partially, but omitted the episode
of his being discovered by May, and outwitted also
by the bushman.
He described the two sportsmen, and the cavalcade
with which they were attended ; and added, that they
had retraced their steps, and had joined
the bivouac at
Annerley, which was known by all the Kafir scouts to
be the rendezvous for the women and children of the
district farmers. The scouts, of course, were in con-
stant communication with some of the Annerley herds-
men, who, as was shown in the last chapter, were
spies, ready to desert at the right moment. One of
these had, some weeks previously to the open demon-
strations of enmity in the frontier districts, on over-
hearing Mr. Daveney announce to a farmer that
England was sending troops, quitted the settlement,
travelled 150 miles without sleep, and, after delivering
his message, dropped dead at the feet of his chief. Aů
Kafirland now
was ripe for war, the tribes were
gathering in the hill, and the watch-fires beginning to
smoke.

JASPER LYLE :
Zoonah, in his turn, put manifold queries to Doda,
The former said his path was uncertain ;
his “ feet were
towards Umlala's Kraal, but his face turned away
sometimes.” He asked, also, about Amani's proceed-
ings. Amani was his bitter foe. Lulu was bound for
the settlements in the Annerley district, to look for
plunder. Was Amayeka at Umlala's Kraal ? He must
get cattle to offer Doda, for his daughter. He thought
he should go with Lulu; he must come to Doda with
full hands, to ask for Amayeka. How many bullocks
would Doda want for her—the girl with the shining
hair ?
And then there was the usual subtle bartering
argument between the two Kafirs.
Meanwhile, a thought had struck Lyle. Taking
one of Zoonah's assegais from the bundle, he scratched
with his clasp-knife his name and a certain date on
the blade of the weapon. Zoonah, who could elicit no
decided answers from Doda, leaned over the convict's
shoulder.
He had seen books ; indeed, as a boy, in a former
war, he had, with others, cut them up as wadding for
muskets, but could not read. Nevertheless, he knew
that letters were, as he called them, “ silent words.”
Lulu came too, and sat down beside Lyle—“Was
he bewitching Zoonah's assegai ?"
Zoonah grasped the weapon, and would have drawn
it away
Lyle explained to him, in a mingled jargon, that the
words were mystical, but not intended to injure him.
“ Take it,” he said, “to Daveney's Great Place,
Annerley. Be like the asphogels. Watch them, but
let them not see you till the time comes to cast the
weapon before them.
You know that Daveney is
your enemy. Doda knows that I am the friend of
the Amakosas. I have brought you guns and powder,
I have made a path between you and the Dutch. The
Dutch hate the English more than you do now.
There are people in my country, beyond the great

waters, who know that the English colonists are great
liars. Can the white chiefs sent hither ever carry
their threats as far they declare they will ? No. You
know that when they have laid schemes to drive you
from your lands, a word comes to them across the
foaming vley, and they are forced to eat their own
words. Your chiefs have many to speak for them in
my country. I have been one of your mouths there.
I was here long ago, when the son of Umlala's great
wife was no taller than that mimosa: when I went
back to my land, I spoke in council. I said you were
under the feet of the English here; that you were not
permitted to sit still in green places in your own
territory; that you only wanted grazing-ground and
patches of land to grow corn in; but that instead of
rewarding you for refusing to help the Boers against
the English, we have suffered your cattle and your
land to be taken from you. You see, too, that the
Boers are angry.
They have cause. You and they
were as two gnoos fighting for plunder. One gnoo
comes first, and possesses himself of the prey; another
follows, and would seize it. Up stalks the lion, he
parts the combatants, seizes the plunder, and takes it
to himself. What should the gnoos do? They should
unite, go to war with the lion, take the plunder from
him and share it. The land is large enough for all;
but when you would have justice, the lion puts his paw
beyond his own boundary, shakes his mane, his eyeballs
burn and roll like flames, he roars, and the very
trees
of the forest tremble at the sound. Up, then, Ama-
kosas, and at this roaring, ravaging lion. Quarrel not
among yourselves; the musket and the flint, and the
powder and the bullet, are all good when used to-
gether; apart, what are they?
“ Drive these greedy white men to the sea.
The
Boers are already treking towards those great soli-
tudes where the sun rises; divide this glorious coun-
try among you, and make a place along the shore for
white men to come and traffic, bringing you beads,

and blankets, and knives, and brandy, and all those
good things which white men love best, but which
they tell you, when they preach, that God has no
delight in, and forbids."
Lyle went on much further in this strain, standing
up, and declaiming in a strange dialect with increasing
spirit. The three Kafirs seated themselves at his
feet, and listened attentively to his specious reason-
ing. He informed them that he was going among the
Boers: that they too would make a stand for their
rights; that there were more men like himself in the
land intent on seeing justice done to all; and that if
the Kafirs were overcome by numbers in the forth-
coming onset, they had but to fall back to the sources
of the white Kei, and mingle their war-cry with the
thunder of the Storm mountains. There the Boers
would answer them, and, ere long, the Zooluhs would
echo it back, and bring their hosts to join them in the
onslaught. The Zooluhs and the Amatembus, the
Amapondas and the Amakosas, should be brothers;
they came from the same father originally, they were
branches of the same tree. The Zooluhs were worthy
to be the brothers of the Amakosas, for they were
brave. What a day it would be for Kafirland when
they should chant the same war-song, when the Fin-
goes should be their dogs again. The Fingoes, who,
like the Zooluhs and Amakosas, had once been a great
nation, but who had lost their name, had no longer a
place to sit, and were fain to do the white man's bid-
ding now, and work! Lyle laughed scornfully, and
there was a low chuckle among the three Kafirs.
He pursued the theme skilfully, and if he did not
persuade the three men to believe him implicitly, he
succeeded in stirring up their hearts to join hopefully
in the coming strife. In proof of his allegations
against his countrymen, he reminded them of what a
Kafir chief, who had visited England, had told them,
-how he had been brought before a council* and
* The Committee of the House of Commons.

questioned, and how even women had stood
up
and
pleaded that their land should be restored.
They were fully aware, too, of the difficulties which
many a
“cruel white Governor” had met with in
trying to oppress those whom he was sent to protect
-how strong had been the words of those who spoke
in their favour. They, the Kafirs, had heard of and
seen English papers. They could not read them, but
they knew that, like the Kafir watch-fires, they were
silent messengers. They had heard the teachers read
from books. Who asked the teachers to come? What
good did they do? They drew the people away from
their chiefs: they would break up chieftainship in
Kafirland.
The shades of evening were beginning to gather
over the glen, and the sky above was like a spangled
banner of deep blue. Lyle was determined to proceed
that evening, and brought his speech to a close by
bidding Zoonah take the mystic assegai to Annerley,
and having, when opportunity offered, cast it where it
could not fail to be observed, warned him to note
carefully, by means of household spies, the effect that
would be produced on the whole family at the sight
of the inscription on the blade. Lyle had already
been in communication with Brennard regarding the
present position and circumstances of the Daveney
family, and Zoonah’s information, gathered from vari-
ous sources, confirmed him in the idea that the two
young officers, now domesticated at Annerley, were,
whether in earnest or not, on most agreeable terms
with the whole family, especially with the younger
ladies.
He knew every inch of ground about that settle-
ment,—he could realize the whole scene ;-he learned
that the place had been made very defensible, and
that a block-house was in progress. It was clear that
the magistrate intended to hold out vigorously against
all attacks; but there was much cattle, said Zoonah,
most of which had been seized on commandoes, and

the chiefs were outrageous at being deprived of their
property, for Zoonah did not call it plunder.
Lyle knew his ground in thus sowing the seed of
evil in a small way. A white man standing up, and
venturing opinions among a tribe of Kafirs, would meet
with argument from some, contradiction from others,
dissent from most, distrust from all; but these three
men would soon be on different routes. Two were
accredited scouts in Kafirland; wherever they went
they were asked, “What news ?” then they sat down,
and talked;" thus what he had said would spread gra-
dually, but surely, and doubtless gain in importance.
He had already become popular at Umlala's Kraal ;
the trade in muskets, gunpowder, tobacco, and Cape
brandy had been brisker under his guidance than it
had ever been. He was an athletic man, a rider, a
swimmer, a perfect marksman, and had once beat a
Kafir in hurling the assegai.
He was wont to respond cheerfully to the cry of
“ Baseila ;" would join in the games even of the boy
warriors—this was the very class to conciliate ; and
with his fearless air, his reckless laugh, and withal a
certain deferential manner to the chief, Lyle had con-
trived to make himself much at home with the tribe :
while
poor Gray was looked upon with some distrust
and much contempt; his step was slow, his whole air
cast down and melancholy, and the women and the
youths had some suspicion of his passion for Ama-
yeka; but Lyle was his friend, outwardly, that was
clear; and as the whole population must suffer by
quarrelling with the traders, Gray's presence was
endured. The children liked him, for however abs-
tracted or dejected he might be, he had always a
smile for them, and the mothers thanked him for
this. The Kafir women love their children as long as
the latter are helpless, but cast them aside when
they become adults, and able to live by their own
exertions.
Lyle's authoritative manner had due weight with

the three Kafirs; the ox was divided into portions,
and each man took a goodly piece with him. Lyle and
Doda started ere the Southern Cross began to bend and
tell the midnight hour had passed. Zoonah and Lulu
bent their course westward, and idling as they went,
resting here and talking there, lurking about the
settlements, and helping the Kafir women whom they
met in their commissariat arrangements for the ensuing
periods of strife; they separated in the Buffalo Moun-
tains, Lulu to join the warriors in the Amatolas,
Zoonah to keep watch in the Devil's Kloof.
You have seen the result of Lyle’s plan. The herds-
men at Annerley, who fled into the wilderness at the
sound of the war-cry, caught sight of Zoonah at sun-
rise next morning, when he was skimming along a
distant ridge, and recognizing him, by the feather
at his ankle, to be a special messenger, waved their
karosses. He waited for them; they had not deserted
empty-handed. Two fine heifers were driven before
them, and dropping into a neighbouring kloof on
the shady side of a mountain, they all met together
to hold a parley, and fare sumptuously on one of the
slaughtered animals.
The detention in the “Sunless Kloof” was so far
fortunate, that it prevented Lyle and Doda from en-
countering the young Dutch burghers bearing off Ama-
yeka, and, by a strange coincidence, Gray, in his uncer-
tain route, passed during the day within two miles of
them;
his course, however, lay more to the westward,
for he no longer cared to conceal himself: but, as his
ill-luck would have it, he was overtaken by his fellow-
convict two days after, on the northern bank of the
Kabousie River.
Weak from hunger, he had been obliged to keep to
the more fruitful spots, and had subsisted on roots,
Kei apples, and a little Kafir corn, gathered from
deserted gardens. Utterly disheartened, he again
yielded passively to his fate, and told the tale of the
events which had driven him forth as a wanderer again.

JASPER LYLE:
After this, the three pushed forward night after
night, and in the course of a few days, the heavy
clouds that had veiled the horizon cleared off, and they
found themselves within a few hours' journey of the
Stormberg Mountains.
Gray's narration of the events which had been the
cause of his leaving Umlala’s Kraal did not particu-
larly move Lyle or Doda; if the latter had any sus-
picion of the deserter's regard for his daughter, he
did not betray it. Until a Kafir is excited by incidents
passing before him, he never displays any decided
emotion; hating Amani, he was more inclined to be
enraged with him for his condemnation of Amayeka,
than anxious for his daughter's fate. In the hands of
white men, he felt certain enough of her safety to
take the matter coolly, suggesting that she was now
among the Boers in the Stormberg; and, under this
impression, he tramped steadily on, staff in hand, and
with a loose assegai, ready to bring down any game
that might cross the path.
Lyle, on learning the destruction of the ammuni-
tion, congratulated himself on having settled all mo-
netary transactions ere he started. The articles of
barter exchanged by the Kafirs for the gunpowder
were all well on their way to the Witches' Krantz,
and the only point now on which he was ill at ease,
was Gray's faint-heartedness, as he termed it.
“What would you do?” said Lyle, as, side by side,
the two Englishmen followed Doda through the tan-
gled pathways intersecting the small plains, covered
with fine pasturage, and watered by numerous streams
proceeding from the Stormberg, “what would you
do? declare yourself a runaway convict, a deserter
from the Royal Artillery ? My good fellow, you are
the man the Boers want-they have got guns, as you
know, but few to handle them—you will meet some old
comrades, though, I have no doubt, up in those hills."
Then Gray spoke the first resolute words he had
uttered for a long time.

“If,” said he, “you think I will work a gun against
my own countrymen, you are mistaken. You
may
call
me fool, coward, if you will—I may be branded, shot
as a deserter, but I will not die a traitor!”
Lyle gave a long, low, contemptuous whistle, and
then burst into a laugh. “What do you call a traitor ?”
he asked: “to my mind, he is a man who enlists in a
good cause, and then, without rhyme or reason, or for
some vicious purpose, turns against it. Why, they
condemned me to transportation as a traitor, because
I took the side of justice and the oppressed. It is
more manly to fight for the weak than for the strong.
Talk of might against right in this country-I should
like to know who are the rightful owners of it—why,
those little nations, the bushmen. As for justice, she
may well be painted blind, for the strongest arm turns
her scale, and she can't see to help herself. It is the
same everywhere. We left the Government in England
riding rough-shod over the poor starving devils, and
when the worms began to turn, the law, as they call it,
crushed them with its iron heel. The lion of Eng-
land is a mighty fine fellow to boast of, but wherever
he stalks, he leaves the traces of his bloody paws.
They are beginning to find this out at home. Home!
- it is no home to us.” Gray heaved a deep sigh.
“They are getting sick of being taxed for those hired
assassins, the soldiers. I was one of those to show
the people what they were taxed for—to pay men for
shooting them like dogs, if they complained of wrong.
I did not conceal from them that I had been a soldier
myself, and I pointed out the slavery of such a condi-
tion. I was licensed to talk of what I had been. I
might have been pulled up and shown up, for I had
got into a few scrapes from want of money; but this
would have dragged forward some respectable names,
so justice was deaf, as well as blind, on this question,
and Jasper Lee was only talked of as a Chartist
leader. The real traitors to the cause were those
who sat safely at their desks in dusty offices, and

made promises which gained them popularity at the
time, but which they never intended to perform. One
wrote, “If Jasper Lee leaves the B— D— dock in a

however, terrified at the sight of the soldiers, quailed
before an unloaded gun ; but at last they began to
show fight with brickbats. There was barely time to
read the Riot Act-ha, ha! how the old mayor's
hand trembled that held it, when a charge of cavalry
came down the street and drove the poor devils right
and left. We were the victims of treachery. Some
of our pretended friends had been bribed, turned
informers, and went over to the enemy. These were
the traitors and deserters; they have pocketed the
price of blood, and are at work again, no doubt, like
spiders in their dark, gloomy offices, making false
promises, deluding the people into the assemblies they
convoke, only to bring the troops upon them, and then
reap their reward for betraying their victims.”
In this strain Lyle proceeded; Gray paid but little
heed to his sophistry-his mind was intent on casting
aside the thraldom under which he writhed; but fate
seemed against him.
And Amayeka, what was to become of her?
Lyle next pointed out the advantages of the pros-

pect before them. It was by no means certain, he
said, that the Boers must necessarily fight against the
English government; it was well known that Vander
Roey had gone to the Commander-in-Chief to hold a
conference; it was not improbable that terms would
be made, and that a territory would be given to the
Dutch settlers, where they might exercise their own
laws.
• Here,” said Lyle,“we may find a place of rest,
for, unless something is to be gained by it, I am not
inclined for war for fighting's sake.”
This was, as the reader may divine, untrue; but
he adapted his expressed opinions to the tone of
Gray's mind at the moment.
So, for the present, my lad, make your mind easy;
you cannot get away from this if you would, and you
would not if you could, for your dusky lady-love
is, without doubt, yonder in the hills, and no bad
refuge neither. By Jove, this is a fine country-ha!
Doda told me it was a noble pasture-land for
borses, and see, the mountain sides are dotted with
them; and here is a troop of jolly young Boers.
Now remember, once for all, my lad,” continued Lyle,
clutching Gray suddenly by the arm—“let me tell you
to put a good face on the matter. As to getting these
people just now to listen to your history, and give
you a guide or an escort to take
you back-
-you young
fool to fight against them, it is of no use.
reasoning would be as useless as whistling jigs to
milestones—all your wrath like the grimaces, and the
sputtering, and the swearing of the bushmen at a
storm of thunder and lightning. So now say good
morrow' to these young fellows with the best face

· A party of youths rode up as Lyle spoke; the
latter informed them, in tolerable Dutch, that he was
the trader whom Brennard had located at Umlala's
Kraal, and, as he had no intention of at once avowing
himself willing to be enrolled as a rebel, he affected to

have started from the Kraal with mere prospects of
traffic. He then related what had occurred since his
departure, and Gray listened with a beating heart to
the reply made to Lyle on his inquiring whether a
Kafir girl had been brought to the mountains by the
young men of the foraging party.
Yes; but they had carried her over the hills to
the Boers' large encampment, where she would be
taken care of by some of the women.”
With this information Gray and Doda were
obliged to be content. The young Dutchmen informed
Lyle that the ammunition was on the south-western
side of the mountains, where it was carefully stored in
some of the bushmen's caves, long abandoned by their
first tenants, until Vander Roey sent intelligence of
the result of his conference with the Commander-in-
Chief, Vander Roey's wife was in charge of it, and,
under her directions, instalments of gunpowder were
daily forwarded on pack-oxen and horses, the passes
of the mountains being impracticable for wagons.
The young Boers having turned their horses' heads
in the direction of the mountains, the convicts and
Doda accompanied them to the temporary bivouac,
where Vander Roey's wife held sway in the absence
of her husband. The three were left among the scat-
tered tents and wagon-tilts of the few families con-
gregated together in the sequestered spot, while the
riders hastened to Mrs. Vander Roey to inform her of
the new arrivals in the camp. Lyle and Gray were
soon summoned by the lady, who advanced to the door
of the cave to receive them, and ask their business.
She was a woman apparently five or six and twenty
years of age, though probably she was much less.
She was not what might be termed a true specimen of
the Boeress in Southern Africa, but was, in colonial par-
lance, an Africander, of French extraction, her father
belonging to the race who established themselves at the
Cape after the revocation of the edict of Nantes ; and
her mother, although the wife of a Boer, had a slight

touch of dark blood in her veins. To these circum-
stances, which, in the eyes of the community to which
she belonged, were objectionable, she owed her raven
hair, drawn back from the temples, and bound round
her head in classic fashion. The forehead was low,
but well formed; the eyes long, dark, and fringed with
black lashes, that softened their fiery expression; the
nose aquiline, with the delicate nostril indicative of
Indian blood; the mouth scarlet-lipped, and radiant
with pearly teeth; her figure, above the middle height,
and gracefully, if not perfectly, shaped, was set off by
the dress, which, albeit coarse and rough, was pic-
turesque; a petticoat of bright-coloured voerchitz, a
bodice of the same material, but of different pattern,
over which was thrown a rick silk handkerchief of
orange hue--a gift from Cape Town; loose sleeves,
reaching a little below the elbow of a beautiful arm;
cotton stockings, passing fine, and veldt scoons, of
better make than was common among her people,
fitted to a tolerable foot and slender ankle. Such was
the attire of Mrs., or, as she chose to call herself,
Madame Vander Roey; and, as she came forward,
the rays of the setting sun illuminated her figure, and
set off the manifold hues of her costume in a very
striking manner. Even the attention of the listless
deserter was arrested by the vision of this showy
dame, who, with a pistol in her belt, her arms folded
across the orange handkerchief, her head thrown
back, and her flashing eyes bent eagerly on Lyle,
awaited their approach in front of her rude but pic-
turesque domicile. She opened the conversation by
the direct inquiry addressed to Lyle in Dutch, of
“Where do you come from, and what is your
busi-
ness ?"
Lyle replied, with equal decision of tone,
“I am the trader from Umlala's Kraal; I have been
in communication with Vander Roey for more than
six weeks."
“ Vander Roey has been absent nearly a month, but

I did not wish Umlala's people to know this; the
scouts were told he was ill, and have received the
ammunition; some of it I have stored, some has been
sent over the mountains. Are you here only as
traders, and who is this boy?"
She scanned the dejected-looking Gray with some-
thing like glances of contempt.
“ Doda, good morrow; you are to be trusted, be-
cause you would gain nothing by betraying us.
Go, you will find meat cooking at those fires in the
hollow. Who, I say, is this boy?"
“A deserter from the service of my king,” answered
Gray, “ and a miserable creature."

“As neither,” replied Gray ; “ but I am a most un-

“ Neither friend nor enemy!” said Madame Van-

Lyle, seeing that Gray had resolved on making a
true statement of past occurrences, suddenly ex-

guish between jest and earnest—"we must teach him
the use of his wits.”
Gray knew it was vain to remonstrate with his evil
genius. Madame Vander Roey invited both the tra-
vellers into her retreat, and Gray passively followed
Lyle and the lady into the bushmen's cave, her present
dwelling-place.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE PATRIARCH.
It was, like most of these retreats, a deep recess in
the rocks. The walls were ornamented with grotesque
drawings, poorly executed in coloured clay, of men
and animals, the figures of the former more resembling
apes than men. The ground--for flooring there was
none, save a carpet woven by Nature's tasteful hand
-was partially covered with mats and skins, and the
furniture consisted of a rickety camp-table and two
or three broken stools. A long roer and a pair of
large pistols were slung against the scarp of rock at
the back of the recess, and the place was faintly illu-
minated by a primitive kind of lamp—a calabash filled
with sheep-tail oil—from the centre of which rose a
rush wick. The coolness of this retreat for the sun's
rays never penetrated therein,-was delicious, after
passing so many days in the open air during the
hottest period of the South African summer.
The lamp only emitted sufficient light to make dark-
ness visible to the travellers' unaccustomed eyes. On
their entrance, they heard voices, and Lyle stumbling
over some object on the ground, there rose up Madame
Vander Roey's attendant pages, Lynx and Frolic, two
small bushboy imps; they uttered a little screech at
sight of the new-comers, and were tumbling out of the
cave, when their mistress called them back and issued
some orders, desiring them to send Hans, the Hot-
tentot. She then lit another lamp, and thereupon they
discerned another object in the corner of the recess.
This was the aged father of Madame Vander Roey,
a venerable Boer, with snowy hair and a long silvery

beard. His seat was an old arm-chair, which his
daughter had rendered more comfortable and sightly
by throwing over it a kaross made of the silver jackal's
skin. His dress was of the usual coarse duffle, a good
deal worn, and a crutch beside him indicated infirmity
of body. His mind appeared less enervated than his
limbs, and he bowed with an air of great courtesy to
the new-comers, evincing no surprise at the appear-
ance of strangers.
He shook his head mournfully, and inquired of
his daughter if they were English; she replied in the
affirmative, and added that they were friends.
His first thought was hospitable; he reminded her
that they must need refreshment; he next begged
them to be seated, and inquired whence they came.
Madame Vander Roey said that this question must
be deferred for a while, and left the dwelling to see
that food was provided for the evening meal.
The old Boer, Du Plessis, began to talk in soliloquis
ing fashion as soon as he was left with Lyle and
Gray; the latter reclining listlessly against the painted
rock, the former with his full grey eye fixed intently
on Du Plessis.
“Has my daughter's husband returned ?" asked
the patriarch; but, instead of waiting for an answer,
he went back to memories seventy years old, when he
was a youth and his father a landowner in the lower
districts of the Cape. He repeated the usual tale of
complaint. “ They robbed us," said he, speaking of
the Kafirs. “We offered our humble petitions to the
great men at Cape Town, and asked for help; but,
while we waited, leaning upon promises-broken reeds!
our enemies swept away our possessions, stole or
mutilated our cattle and sheep, and left us poor.
Then we learned with great sorrow that some of our
fellow-burghers were against us, and time was lost in
disproving
this, and our enemies laughed at us; there-
fore we sent messengers to their honours in Cape
Town, and said, ' As we possess little, we pray you let

us go and live in peace upon the Sneeuwberg, where,
if you will permit us to remain, we will pay you rent;
there is quiet there and much game; indeed, we need a
supply of food, for many of us now have not a hundred
sheep and five cattle. Let us go then with our small
flocks and our wives and our little ones.' So then we
waited, and could get no certain answer, and our great
men advised us to go, and we went sorrowfully, and
sent again messengers to implore forgiveness of their
honours if we had done amiss in treking, and prayed
the Lord would bestow His grace upon them, that they
might select a fitting person to arrange all disputes
between neighbours.
“ We fared ill with the bushmen: if we went out
to kill sea-cows, these robbers would follow us, or
plunder our homes in our absence, or shoot at us with
their poisoned arrows. So we grew more and more
impoverished, and a generation passed away while we
were waiting for help; and so, not being able to hold out
against the robbers, we abandoned our places again.”
Here Madame Vander Roey returned to make such
preparations as the times permitted for setting the
supper-table in array ; her father went wandering on.
Next,” said he,“ they took away our slaves. We
had been told by good teachers that slavery was bad,
that we had no right to traffic in human flesh; but we
could not understand anything at first except that we
were left without servants, and with pieces of paper in
our hands, which we were told were money-bills, but
that we must go to Cape Town to get them cashed,
and so we did ; but we had many hundreds of miles
to go. Some treked away with their slaves altogether,
but my father inclined to the Government, and accepted
what they called compensation, and I went with him
to Cape Town, and we were glad to sell our bills for
what we could get from the merchants, and when we
came back we found our farms uncultivated, our cattle
gone, and our wives and children very miserable; so,
you see, my white brothers, we have come step by step

further and further and further, and I am heartsore,
and would fain listen to the word that my son Vander
Roey shall bring; for I had rather die in peace with all
men and with my face turned to the west, than with
anger in
my
heart."
Hans brought in, on some sticks, some slices of broiled
gnoo, and there was a rusty tin dish, filled with rice
and carbonatje; the savoury steam was grateful to the
senses of even the melancholy Gray, and some coarse
but sweet bread and a calabash of Cape brandy being
added to the refection, the adventurers did full jus-
tice to their hostess's hospitable display.
The bald rocks of Asphogels' Kop, a peak distin-
guished from the other heights of the Stormberg by
this name, were shining like snow in the rays of the
newly-risen silver moon, when Lynx and Frolic put
their impish faces into the cave, and announced that
Vander Roey and his escort were in sight of the Donder
Berg, for a fire was blazing on the hill.
The old Boer crossed his hands on his breast, closed
his eyes, and his lips moved, as Gray supposed, in
prayer. The deserter sat down beside the aged Du
Plessis; Madame Vander Roey, accompanied by Lyle,
left the cave.
On emerging from it, into the clear
moonlit air, the latter saw that the whole bivouac was
astir; there were some forty men and eight or nine
women, several children, and a motley assembly of
Hottentots, half-castes, and
bushmen. These
gathered
together in a group near Madame Vander Roey, and
the heads of approaching men and horses soon appeared
above the long waving grass of the little plain, on
which the encampment was spread in somewhat dis-
orderly fashion.
The equestrian party came up leisurely, after the
manner of those who bring no cheerful or decided
tidings. The atmosphere was clear and light as that
of day.
Madame Vander Roey said, in a low voice, to Lyle,
“ There is no good news!”


## p. 306 (#320) ############################################

306
JASPER LYLE:
And so it proved. Vander Roey had not even been
admitted to an interview with Sir John Manvers ;
indeed, there was little time for treating with any one ;
for, as we have shown, the brand and the spear were
abroad, and the colonists were looking with anxious
eyes
for the
sea-wagons from across the broad
waters,” and their freights of “ red men.”
The captain of the bivouac, Lodewyk, a hunter,
with a face almost covered with hair, arms bared to
the elbow, but garnished, Kafir fashion, with bangles
of brass, and a ring of ivory, a large straw hat on
his head, and equipped with leather trowsers, girded
with a belt containing immense pistols, and carrying
besides an elephant gun, stepped forwards as Vander
Roey swung himself from his jaded horse, and said, in
a loud, distinct voice, in the Dutch language,
“Vander Roey, is it peace or war with our white
brothers ?"
“War," replied the Boer leader, abruptly, and strode
on without greeting his wife, who followed him to the
cave.
“ War!" shouted Lodewyk—“ War!” echoed Lyle ;
and Lodewyk, recognizing the trader, whom he had
had dealings with of late, turned to Lyle, and offered
his hand.
Lyle grasped it.
“ Let us smoke a pipe of tobacco together," said
Lodewyk, and the two men strolled off towards the
habitation of the latter; it was a domicile, half hut,
half tent, formed of withered boughs and skins, and
screened from the east by a scarp of rock, on which
many, a grotesque and unnatural-looking creature
was depicted in yellow ochre and different-coloured
chalks.
Circumstances conspired to induce Lyle to develop
his plans and purposes sooner than he had first in-
tended; there was something in the bearing of Lode,
wyk that chimed in with his own feverish desire to
up and doing; and, on the other hand, Lode-

wyk had been attracted by the hearty, dare-devil style
in which the Englishman had flung up his hat, in
the moonlight, and shouted “War! war! to the
knife!”
They talked far into the night, as they reclined on a
bank facing the habitation of the Vander Roeys.
Gray had joined them, and lay fast asleep, his head
pillowed by a stone.
The people in the bivouac, through which the cry of
“ War!” had rung till the voices that uttered it were
hoarse, were all busied in preparing for the march at
early day across the mountains, the chief having re-
solved to move to the plains, where the majority of the
Boers and their families were awaiting his decision to
trek or return.
The women were as busy as the men, collecting the
few draught-oxen they possessed, and yoking them to
the wagons with their own hands, that there might be
no delay; and stalking in silence from group to group,
and wagon to wagon, but chiefly intent on superin-
tending the packing of all the gunpowder that re-
mained, on the backs of the beasts of burden, might
be seen Vander Roey, with his broad-flapped hat and
dark ostrich plume, towering in height above his
fellows, and issuing his orders in a tone of lofty com-
mand.
Within the cave, Madame Vander Roey was making
preparations for the journey, her father watching her
movements with a sad, bewildered air.
“ Peace or war!” muttered the old man.
“ How
many years have I been wandering without rest for
the sole of my foot, without a roof to shelter these gray
hairs ! My son Vander Roey, let it be peace till I
die. Whither would you take me? The mountains
will sunder me from my dead-my buried wife-my
three brave sons, all lying in one grave, killed within
a month. I can see from these plains the blue peaks
of the hills beneath which they lie. Let me, too, rest
here, within sight of those blue hills!

morrow.
“There has been strife too long, always strife. Let
there be peace till I die !-peace! peace !"
And so the old man muttered on, his daughter pro-
ceeding with her preparations, and now and then
remonstrating with him kindly, and begging him to
rest as long as he could on the couch she had spread
for him, and so arranged that it could be lifted like
a litter. In this, with a light wagon tilt, the aged
patriarch was to be borne over the mountains on the
Ere the night had passed, three men rode into the
camp; these were Brennard and two young Boers of
Vander Roey's party. The former had resolved to
join the rebels, and due greetings passed between him
and Lyle. Poor Gray shuddered at the web gathering
round him, but there was no escape. He was resolved,
however, to keep to the one resolution he had formed
during his miserable sojourn among strangers-he
would not fight against his sovereign's troops, come
what might.
He could recollect many a loyal saying of his
father's; as a child, he had been taught to "fear God
and honour the King.” In spite of the sway his
passions had obtained over him, he remembered the
lesson; and now, in spite of difficulties and danger, he
determined to keep his fealty to his liege. Alas! many
a soldier who forgets God abides by his allegiance to
man !
Brennard confirmed all that Lyle had been striving
to impress on Lodewyk. He swore that Holland
had protested against the conduct of the English
Government towards the unfortunate white Africans ;
that help would be sent to Natal, near which the
Boers might establish a government of their own,
backed by the mother-country ; that France was
favourably disposed towards the descendants of her
sons. They might hear through the papers that France
was perfectly peaceful; but it was not som

destroyed them—they were deaf to all warnings ; the
rising Powers had already begun to think of the colo-
nial possessions of England, and their unsatisfactory
state. As for the colony, now was the time to
make ready for war. The troops, although they fan-
cied the Kafirs would be easily beaten, would be
thoroughly harassed—“ used up”—before reinforce-
ments could arrive. Every one knew that Sir John
Manvers, the present commander of the forces, was an
irresolute, sullen, haughty man, anxious for the arrival
of the new Governor, who was reported to be Sir
Adrian Fairfax. Every one knew, too, what Sir Adrian
was; he had said that he compassionated the Boers,
but was bound to carry out the orders of Government,
and must shoot them as rebels if they attempted to
show fight. What had they—these poor, unhappy
white Africans-gained by passive endurance of ill? In
England, men were already standing up for a fresh
Charter on their own ground—but what did the Boers
want? Only space to feed their cattle, permission to
exercise their own laws, without interfering with the
English—and this was not to be granted. Would they
submit like dogs ? At any rate, was it not worth while
to try for freedom ?
Vander Roey followed up this tirade by informing
those who had not accompanied him to the British
settlements, that he had been turned from Sir John
Manvers’s door like a dog. “He sent me word,” said
he, " that he had not time to listen to me. His
messenger was a youth with careless mien. I opened
my lips to speak, but he heeded me not. I could hear
voices, and see lights through the doorways, and the
young man passed away, leaving me to be shown out
of the house by a servant. I walked by the front of
the mansion ; the man who had not time to see me'
was receiving guests in a large lighted room. The
windows were open, and I stood in the garden, grind-
ing my teeth with rage. I strode out of the light into
the darkness; my 'horse stood patiently at the great

gates of that fine house. He hung his head; he was
worn with hard riding—he had a sorry look—the
sentry, standing under the lamp, was laughing at his
miserable plight. I mounted him, dashed through the
town, and never drew rein till I reached a river, the
waters whereof bubbled and foamed, and I was forced
to stop to give the good beast rest. We lay down side
by side to sleep, and when I awoke, poor 'Starry
Night' was dead?
“I had to carry my saddle many a mile before I
came up with my people; they asked me few ques-
tions, but saw that hope was lost-so now for war.”
“ War! war!”-it was not shouted now, but passed
from lip to lip, as the chief occupants of the bivouae
continued their preparations for the early journey. Only
the children and a few of the elder people were asleep
in the open ground, for the tents and other wretched
contrivances for covering were struck, and all the poor
property of these unhappy wanderers packed for the
march.
“War! war!" was the dogged watchword of sullen
men without. Du Plessis sat up on his couch of skins.
“Peace! peace! let there be peace !” he murmured.
His daughter laid him gently down on his rude
pillow, a saddle, and, before taking an hour's rest her-
self, stepped out beyond the cave to see how the people
sped in loading, under Vander Roey's superintend-
ence, the patient beasts of burden.
Lo! a brilliant lunar rainbow spanned, with its
broad, illuminated arch, the little plain over which the
houseless people were scattered. See,” said Madame
Vander Roey to her husband, -“see the sign of peace
God sends us. Ah! I begin to feel myself but a
woman; must you lift your hand against our white
brethren ?"
“We are aliens,” replied Vander Roey, sullenly.

casting herself on a pile of dried leaves, was soon
asleep.
Oh! the contrast of that shining arch, which God
had set in the heavens, and the restless, feverish scene
below; horses neighing, bad men swearing, children
wakening from their uneasy asleep, and screaming
in vague terror, women foremost in urging men to
up-saddle and trek. Lodewyk, Brennard, and Lyle,
strong in nerve and limb, forswore sleep till they
should pass the mountain ridge which shut out the
western plains from their sight. Gray lay betwixt
sleeping and waking, and as he watched the hues of
the rainbow blend one within the other till they faded
into mist and veiled the beauty of the moon, an old
fancy revived within him-a child's fancy—“that the
rainbow takes its shape and hues from the gathered
tears of Heaven," and is set in the clouds by angel
heralds, as a token between God and man of a cove-
nant of
peace.
The clouds which, like sheeted ghosts, hung about
the sides of the Stormberg mountains, melted into
drizzling showers, and met the party commanded by
Vander Roey, in its journey up the steep and stony
pathways.
Firsť rode Vander Roey, his flapped hat and sweep-
ing feather drawn down to his eyebrows. A little
apart from him, watching his leader's countenance with
keen and anxious glance, strode the wild hunter on
foot, staff in hand, a handkerchief bound round his
head, and this surmounted by a coarse, weather-
beaten straw hat. Close behind were Brennard, Lyle,
and Lodewyk.
The former was
a sworn ally of
Vander Roey-he, too, had been a deserter. Lyle,
introduced as his friend, had found a ready welcome,
but as yet had had no opportunity of close discussion
with Vander Roey; and poor Gray was mounted on a
somewhat tired steed; but this signified little, as the

acclivity was impracticable for a hurried journey; and,
besides this, the feeble and infirm of the party could
only proceed at a certain pace. Very few wagons
accompanied the procession, and these halted often,
that the smoking oxen might take fresh breath for the
desperate task before them. Now a wagon was lifted
almost edgeways on a huge block of stone, now it came
down with a crash that threatened dislocation to every
joint of the creaking mass; sometimes the poor animals,
in utter despair at the sight of the almost perpendi-
cular track, dashed at it at headlong speed, halted
suddenly, and were almost dragged back by the
weight of the huge vehicle in the rear; or, if they did
succeed in gaining a ridge, overlooking a hollow in
the mountain side, would plunge recklessly on, and
come down en masse, jumbled together in a confused
heap.
But, apparently absorbed in thought, sullen, angry,
smarting under a keen sense of wrong and disappoint-
ment, the leader expressed no impatience at the delays
occasioned by the feebleness or incapacity of the most
useless followers of the cavalcade. He made no reply
when told that a halt must be called, for the sake of
some sickly family, wasted with fever, from lying long
in the open bivouac, or some patriarch of the tribe,
head of three or four generations, who could not walk,
was not strong enough to sit his horse, or whose
rheumatic limbs needed a respite from the jolting of
the wagon. Moodily silent, he sat upon his powerful
horse, which he had kept fresh for the work before
him, and apart from his fellow-men, save that Lode-.
wyk and Brennard occasionally conferred with him.
At last Lyle made his way slightly in advance, and,
turning his horse's head to the westward, surveyed the
panorama lying before him. They were on a ridge of
table rock near the summit of the lowest mountain,
over which their path lay, and here it was intended
they should outspan for an hour or two, and make a
meal of some of the poor sheep, which with great diffi-

culty had been driven up the steep by the bushboys,
Lynx and Frolic.
Lyle's powerful frame, bronzed but handsome face,
the very air with which he carried his rifle, his attitude
on horseback,-in fact, his whole bearing, as he smiled
cordially on Vander Roey, attracted the latter at once
to his colleague. The two riders brought their horses
together, neck and neck, and watched the party wind-
ing up the steep.
In rear of all was old Du Plessis on a litter. The
mists had cleared away, the rays of the sun illumi-
nated the hills above them with a glory, the clouds
were tinged with flame. Nature breathed gently on
the rocky soil, and as the aged Boer sat up in his
primitive palanquin, the tilt partially drawn back, the
balmy breeze lifted his white hair, and seemed to
refresh him. His daughter rode close by, reining in,
with no small skill
, a horse of the same shape and
power as her husband's, but with some attempt at
smartness about his harness; the saddle was a man's,
but she had learned to ride in the civilized districts,
and with the left stirrup shortened, and the right one
brought over to the near side, she contrived to sit
with comfort and considerable grace; but the head-
gear was unsightly; -a gingham bonnet, shaped like a
wagon-tilt, almost concealed her face, yet from the
depths of this miniature tunnel flashed out the dark
and brilliant eyes; but when these turned upon her
father, their radiance softened to a tender light.
As Vander Roey and Lyle sat conversing in short
pithy sentences on the subject of oppression, the
former believing Lyle's indignation to be as patriotic
and disinterested as his own, the latter somewhat
discomposed at finding Vander Roey as shrewd, reso-
lute, and intelligent as himself, and withal compara-
tively honest of purpose, though blind in judgment,
they both watched the last division, consisting of the
chief Boer's wife, the litter, its bearers, and some of
the younger people of the clan.

All at once, Madame Vander Roey dropped her
reins, clasped her hands, sprung from her horse, and
cast herself on her knees beside the couch of her
father, then looking upward, beckoned her husband to
her; her bonnet falling off, disclosed an anguished
countenance. Vander Roey dismounted, and leading
his se, descended the few hundred yards that lay
between him and his wife. Lyle followed, and the
little crowd, halting on the hill-side, looked down upon
the litter and the attendant group.
Du Plessis had raised himself with a strength un-
usual to him ; an unnatural light filled his eyes ;
his
voice, though not loud, was firm and clear. The air
was so still, that the gentle breeze wafted his words to
those above. Those who could, drew as near as they
could do with due respect to his immediate relatives.
“My children,
» said the old man,
“ draw near.
Let me bless before I die. I thank
my
God that
he gives me light at the last. I shall die within sight
of those dark purple hills, whose feet are washed by
those pleasant streams beside which I dwelt through
many a long, long year. There my forefathers came,
pitched their tents, and tarried for four generations.
There they sowed, there they reaped, there they were
despoiled, but abided patiently for help that never
came. My children, I would fain have
you
still wait
for help; the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to
the strong; God will take his own time to make the
crooked pathways straight, and the rough places plain;
think well before you lift your
hand against your
white
brethren.”
Old memories seemed to flit in shadows before the
eye of the dying “white African settler ;' it looked
into the past. A sudden flush crimsoned the ashy
cheek, and the eyes shone with tears.
Folding his trembling and withered hands together,
he gave himself up to thoughts of bygone days; the
cheek paled again, but the tears of weakness rolled
slowly down, and bedewed the old rough jacket. He

was back again at the foot of those hills, purpling in
the glory of the morning sun, but green and fresh in
his
memory even now.
He mentioned father, mother,
brothers, sisters, wife, all gone ; all lying beneath the
sod near a ruined chapel. Of all his people, his
daughter was the last one; his sons' bones had bleached
unburied in the waste.
Sometimes swiftly, sometimes slowly, he spoke of
the days when the white men of Africa were all
united: “But now,” said he, our white brethren-
where are they? Some tell us they are sorry. We
were friends once. We ate bread together, we smoked
our pipes together at sunset. We had no thought of
strife-strife-strife. Peace, peace? the wings of
the angel of death swooped down, and overshadowed
his recollection. A gleam of light irradiated his face
for a few minutes, he raised himself higher on his
couch, the wind parted the snowy hair on his majestic
brow, his gaze was fixed westward, his arms were
stretched towards the mountain ridges of his first
home, his daughter clasped his hands in hers, he
bowed his white head upon her breast, she uttered a
loud cry, Vander Roey stooped to support the patri-
arch, but he was dead to human sympathy. The
sable wings of Azrael had overshadowed him, and his
soul passed away, while his outward vision was fixed
longingly and lovingly upon those mountain ridges
which he was never more to tread in youth or age, in
sorrow or in joy.
They buried him decently upon the lone hill-side.
Few of the married families were without their
Bibles; and he, who stood next in age to Du Plessis,
said a prayer over the open grave. While they were
occupied in closing it with safe blocks of stone, a
mother gathered a little flock around her, and read
them a chapter suited to the occasion. Madame
Vander Roey sat beside her, weeping bitterly; the men

stood apart in groups. Some had been impressed
with the old man's last words, “ Peace, peace."
But as in all disorganized communities the strong
and evil spirit of man's nature prevails over the good,
there were not wanting women, as well as men, to
step forward and urge even the incident of old Du
Plessis' death as an incentive to carry out the purpose
of wrath and of revenge. He, the aged, the virtuous,
the banished patriarch !—who had driven him into
the wilderness to die, but his white brother, another
Cain? Were they to submit to the will of these
jealous, bad white brethren, who permitted the savage
Kafir the exercise of his diabolical laws, his heathen
rites, and denied the poor Dutch colonist the use of
his own moral laws ? Who had first robbed them of
their slaves, and then pretended to make them com-
pensation for depriving them of what was theirs by
purchase ? Had not Du Plessis himself urged the
obligation of making a sacrifice, because it was dis-
graceful to white men to trade in human flesh ? What
reward had he gained ? His cattle had been swept
away, his sons shot down by the Kafirs, his home
devastated; he had met with no pity or redress, and
he had died sorrow-stricken amid the mountains of the
storm.
And to add to these grievances, men had belied
them, and were still belying them, in England. The
traders, now with them, had brought them the evil
sayings of wicked or ignorant Englishmen, who pro-
claimed to the world that the Boer was cruel and
rapacious, never satisfied with the land he had pillaged
from the Hottentots, but committing unequalled cruel-
ties against them, entering their countries with com-
mandoes, despoiling them of their cattle, devastating
their villages; but men were among them now who
knew how false these allegations were; that the com-
mandoes, wherein many à life was lost, were under-
taken to recover their own goods stolen from them by
the thieving Hottentots, the bushmen, and Kafirs,

who had no villages, except hamlets of huts built by
the hands of women, their beasts of burden; a noble
race were these to be indulged and pitied by enlight-
ened men of the greatest nation in the world.
“ Peace. Yes, they would have peace; but the waters
of many a river must be turned into blood first ere
this would be. On, on! to the land of promise, the
land flowing with milk and honey, where they should
have their own rules, and the judge and the criminal
speak one language face to face !"
So spoke Lodewyk, the hunter, standing between,
and at all times appealing by gesture to Brennard and
Lyle. Alas! the sentiments he uttered had been
strengthened by the agency of these two desperate
men.
Gray sat moodily apart from all, resigned doggedly
to the fate that awaited him, but resolute in his intent
to die, rather than fight against “ his own.”
Day was dying in glory on the hills Du Plessis
loved, ere all the rites of sepulture were concluded,
and as the moon came up calm, serene, and radiant, the
sky cloudless, the elements at peace, the band of pil-
grims halted on the mountain ridge, and, turning their
faces towards the homes of their forefathers, sang
their beautiful paraphrase of the 137th Psalm,“ By the
waters of Babylon we sat down and wept;" and as the
last low notes floated dirge-like over the patriarch's
new-made grave, they descended the eastward side of
the mountains, and held their silent course during the
night, halting at daylight, when many an eager,
curious gaze was turned to scenes hitherto unes-
plored by these wanderers. As the mists lifted, a
strong gleam of sunlight shot down upon a spot in
the centre of a wide-spreading, treeless plain. Some
men of the party advanced and tired a volley from
their roers. A thick wreath of smoke intercepted
the glory of the sun's rays, and the signal was re-

sponded to. As the eye became accustomed to the
glare, a large bivouac, dotted with tents, wagons, oxen,
sheep, horses, and men, became distinctly visible.
Soon a little body of horsemen were seen skimming
the plains, and ere long the salute of their uplifted
hats was answered by a similar movement on the part
of Vander Roey's determined band.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE
SETTLEMENT BESIEGED.
How sped they at Annerley, when the war-cry
rang loud and clear in the silence of that night in
Kafirland ?
Daveney and Ormsby were pacing the stoep in
silence; Frankfortsat within the entrance-chamber,
his head buried in his hands.
That unearthly cry was a relief to his paralyzed
heart: he started up, his host and Ormsby lifted the
latch of the door as he put his hand upon it to go
forth. Mrs. Daveney and Marion stood by the bed-
side of the unfortunate Eleanor, who, pale and mo-
tionless as marble, lay insensible to the yells of the
savages on the hills, or the voices of the
poor
settlers
under the windows.
Mr. Daveney was too good a soldier to be abso-
lutely surprised; but so stealthy had been the Kafirs
in their movements, that not even a distant scout had
been seen for many days.
They were near at hand now, however: the moun-
tains far and near shone with the fiery telegraphs of
the warrior tribes. The master of the house sum-
moned his people to arms, and bade the women and
children come from the wagons to the interior of the
building. It has been shown that the settlement was
backed by hills, intersected with gullies or kloofs; one
of these, by which Zoonah had approached, was wide
and dense: it will also be remembered that redoubts
had been thrown up; but the space
enclosed was so
vast that there were barely sufficient hands to defend
all points in rear. The front was well protected

by a fortification of wagons, drawn up in line with
great precision; from these wagons the settlers were
able to check the enemy in his advance; and a small
six-pounder, brought in former days from an aban-
doned fort, filled the gap between the steps and the
In rear of the house, within the trellised passage,
was a little corps de réserve of young men and matrons,
the latter being in charge of spare ammunition, and
provided each with a brace of pistols, which they had
learned the use of by experience.
It was of course
certain that the Kafirs would make their first attack
on the cattle, and as the herdsmen at sunset were
driving in the animals from their pastures, the enemy
poured down the hills in hundreds ; by this cunning
manæuvre they at once cut off the communication
between the settlement and the cattle-herds ; indeed
the latter, of whom some were Kafirs, mostly deserted,
the Hottentots flying off to conceal themselves where
they could—they were not worth following while
plunder was to be got; so the poor cows and oxen
and bleating sheep were driven off by the detachment
of the enemy told off for the purpose, and the others
advanced, their dark faces reddened with ochre, their
crane plumes waving, and their assegais and muskets
ready poised for the onslaught.
Mr. Daveney had adopted the wise precaution of
dividing his flocks and herds, only sending half to
pasture at a time ; for, with so large a population to
feed, and at such a distance from any emporium of
provisions, it was necessary to husband the stock with
peculiar care. Thus the kraals in rear of the vine-
yard were tolerably well filled at present, and the
chief object now would be to keep the enemy at bay,
lest he should carry the redoubt, and rush in upon
the cattle.
But few shots had been exchanged between the
herdsmen and the Kafirs; but, as the marauders car-
ried off the plunder in triumph, a chief appeared, clad

in leopard skin, and riding a noble white charger.
Advancing at a smart canter, he was cheered by the cry
of “ Izapa,
“ Come on ”—from the hill-sides, and,
followed by those who had assisted in capturing the
cattle, he passed the left of the buildings, turned sharp
with his face towards the kraals, and bade his people
advance; they did so, made a dash at the redoubt,
were suffered to set foot on the top, and were received
with a rattling volley of musketry, which tumbled
them within the defences sooner than they had
bargained for. A shout of laughter rose from the
Annerley garrison, a yell of defiance burst from the
savages.
Then the chief on the white charger drew back,
rallied his forces, paused for the reinforcements which
rushed down the hills in all directions, lighting their
brands at the fires as they passed, and having formed
them in a phalanx, of which he was the centre, the
mass pressed forward, shouting their wild war-cry, and
brandishing aloft their weapons of steel and flame. The
blaze on the mountain slope gave all this a demonia-
cal aspect; the horrible screams, the excited, rampant
gestures of the Kafirs, the dropping fire of musketry
from Annerley, and the occasional hearty English
cheer answering the war-cry, all combined to inake as
terrific a scene as the most imaginative eye or ear
could conceive.
As yet the enemy reserved his fire.
Two women stood suddenly face to face in the
entrance-room of the house.
“My sister, my little sister!” shrieked the girl.
My child, my child !" gasped out the elder.
“I left her beside you sleeping in the wagon,” said
the girl.
“I woke frightened,” said the pale mother," and
thought you had taken her-you did, you did—where
is she ? "
“ I laid her beside you,” again answered the girl.
The elder one burst through the group that crowded

the room, and put her hand to the door-latch. Ormsby
stood sentry there. “No one can pass,” said he; "the
house is closed while the enemy advances.”
The
woman raised her hands imploringly, her lips moved,
and she had just power to articulate the words, “My
child !” Ormsby's heart had been softened by gentle
companionship—he opened the door, the pale woman
rushed upon the stoep, flew down the steps-soon they
heard her laughing hysterically;“Let me in, let me in,
she cried. Ormsby opened the door again, and she
entered, bearing her infant in her arms. Something
followed her overhead; a sharp whizz made all draw
back; the door was slammed to, but not before a
bullet had buried itself in the wall beyond—the little
child pointing to the splintering bricks, with a merry
laugh.
Then the occupants of Annerley knew that the
enemy encircled the settlement; the shots soon began
to answer each other swift and sharp.
That part of the building which was commanded
by the hill in the rear was defended by a wall of earth
some twelve feet high; fortunately, the hill sloped
abruptly and was lower than the rest, so that there
was no great range for assegais, and the enemy's shots
were fired at random—they told, however, among the
cattle, and the chief on the white horse, watching his
opportunity, made a dash at a side gate, and suc-
ceeded in forcing an entrance to the kraals between
the vineyard and the redoubt. The confusion that fol-
lowed is indescribable; the settlers fearing to fire on
the besiegers, lest they should kill the cattle; the
beasts lowing, the sheep bleating, horses flying about
wild and terrified, and the Kafirs yelling, whistling,
shouting, and goading the frantic animals forward with
their weapons, till they fairly succeeded in clearing
the stock-yard, the spectators on the ridges above
dancing about between the fires, and mocking at the
poor settlers, four of whom had fallen, severely,
if not mortally, wounded.

The enemy
Maywas flitting about, perfectly reckless of the flying
bullets, and when the Kafirs cheered their comrades,
he would wait for a pause, and then set up a laugh of
derision, crying out, “Shoot higher, shoot higher;"
while, in fact, the balls were whizzing many feet above
the heads of those at whom they were aimed. Now
May would crouch behind the redoubt, single out his
man, get him in a certain position, where the fires
glaring on him lit him up as a mark, and then, with
an original remark, a grin, and a gibber, would bring
him down, draw a long breath, cut a caper, and anon,
lying at full length, would load his musket in the dark,
and
go
to work again, con amore.
in front meanwhile were busy in trying
to dislodge the poor farm-people, who had tied their
span (team) oxen to their wagons, and drew closer
every moment to the building. Frankfort stood on
the stoep directing the defence, and striving, by keep-
ing the Kafirs at bay, to prevent bloodshed as far as
possible ; but the chief on the white horse, having
seen the cattle from the kraals safely whistled off,
resolved, in the true spirit of rapacity, to have more,
and, with a phalanx of his warriors, advanced at a
rapid pace up the avenue.
Then Frankfort, standing on the upper step of the
stoep, said, in a clear, calm, but most decided tone
“Man the gun.”
And four men, who had been trained to the deadly
exercise, took their stations.
The firing from the wagons ceased ; in the rear all
was comparatively still, for the enemy was resting on
his arms, and the settlers were carrying in their
wounded. The Kafirs, unprepared for the reception
it was deemed necessary to greet them with, came up,
quivering their assegais, and shouting their war-cry.
In their imagination, the settlers were paralyzed
they were within
hundred yards of the
wagons.
“Fire!” said Frankfort.

JASPER LYLE:
The word rose strong and clear above the savage
chorus.
A dazzling flash ka wreath of smoke--a roar-
a sharp sound of a ball cleaving the air, and the dark
mass of human beings burst asunder like a splintered
oak.
The shrieks of startled men rose to the sky, that,
lurid as the vaults of the infernal regions, burned
fiercely overhead, and the compassionate-hearted
Frankfort shuddered at the shout of exultation
uttered by the settlers as they saw the havoc the dis-
charge of the gun had effected, and the dispersion of
the enemy in front.
It may be imagined that Daveney's mind had been
so disturbed by the renewal of anxiety about his
daughter, as to render him scarcely fit to meet the
emergencies of the hour; hence the surprise of the
cattle-kraals, an advantage the Kafirs fortunately
cared not to improve, since they quitted their ground
as soon as they had collected the stock. The aper-
ture was immediately closed and manned with steady
hands, and, as the besieged were beginning to suffer
from the enemy on the hills, and the water irrigating
the vineyard was discovered to be cut off, the magis-
trate deemed it advisable to draw the rear guard
within the house; the front was not likely to be
attacked again, the gun occasionally making play
along the avenue.
Among the defences, Daveney had erected a small
block-house, or square tower of stone; this was well
provisioned, and contained the principal stores of
ammunition. This building was now under the com-
mand of Mr. Trail, who, with some of the younger
hands, kept the enemy in check from attacking the
trellis-work uniting the vineyard with the house.
Bitterly, indeed, did the good man deplore the neces-
sity for action; but there was no alternative, and he
calmly directed the movements of his subordinates in
keeping off the Kafirs, who drew near with lighted

brands. The house, built of stone and roofed with
zinc, would have withstood an attack by fire; but the
destruction of property and inconvenience attending
the ignition of the outworks would have been very
serious.
To this block-house Mr. Daveney determined to
remove his still insensible daughter as soon as a lull in
the siege permitted it; and the chief attraction being
withdrawn, it was likely the enemy would retire for å
time; indeed he would probably have done so before;
but the destruction, at a single blow, of so many of
the band, elicited a thirst for revenge, which the
abler warriors declared their intention of satisfying,
swearing, by the bones of the great chief Gwanga,
that they would “eat up” the white man's kraal, and
trample the inmates to dust!
Banishing for the time his own domestic anxieties,
Daveney went from man to man of his little garrison,
and, returning with them from the redoubt to the
house, concentrated his rearward force, and, drawing
up a body of men in line, poured forth a heavy volley
of musketry just as the enemy, having rushed down
the hills, had succeeded again in reaching the top of
the parapet. This daunted the Kafirs considerably,
and they drew off in skirmishing order, dragging their
dead and wounded with them; and thus encumbered,
the
rage of the fight moderated, and the settlers had
time to wipe the smoke and blood from their faces,
take breath, and refresh themselves with some water,
which Mrs. Trail, aided by Fitje, served out to them
as carefully as if it had been wine; for she believed,
like others, that this was but the beginning of a long
season of tumult and bloodshed.
Mr. Daveney ascended the staircase leading to his
daughter's apartment; he carried no light, for day was
approaching. A shadow flitted by, noiseless and
swift, and he heard the latch of a side door, which had
been unbarred, lifted quickly, and the door cautiously
closed. He thought little of it; but, on mustering

the attendants, it was discovered that little Sana,
Eleanor's especial protégée, was missing. She was
Zoonah's sister, and, having been present at the scene
which followed the examination of the assegai, had, in
the confusion, possessed herself of the weapon, and,
gliding along a vegetable garden flanking one end of
the house, soon escaped to a kloof in the hills; and,
ascertaining Zoonah's route from some of the scouts,
followed his footsteps for two days, when she came up
with him on the banks of a river, whence they could
perceive, on a distant elevation, an encampment of
British troops. She related the issue of Zoonah's
manæuvre, and he departed, and told Lyle, as will be
shown, how his mission had prospered.
*
**
Poor Eleanor !
“ She lay upon her pillow, pale,”
her cheek ashy white, and cold as clay. The expres-
sion of utter hopelessness is seldom blended with that
of terror, for the grave of Hope is generally that of
Fear also. But this poor young creature seemed to
have been singled out by Fortune as a worthy victim
for her angry caprices in every phase. Yes, utterly
despairing, she lay moaning softly, like a child that can
scarce comprehend its pain ; but the large eye, usually
80 soft and downcast, now shone with a wild lustre,
and glanced rapidly and uneasily around. Even
her father's tread alarmed her-her lips quivered with
affright, and she gazed long at him before she could
quite believe it was he.
Marion was sobbing, as though her overcharged heart
would burst. Mr. Daveney took Eleanor's cold hand
within his agitated palm. She tried to smile in his
face ; it was the saddest smile you can imagine. Mrs.
Daveney, overwhelmed with anxiety on her husband's
account, had, on Eleanor's recovering from her death-
like trance, descended to the trellised passage, and
there watched the progress of the siege, till, on the

wounded being brought in, she had shared with Mrs.
Trail and Fitje their duties towards them; poor Fitje
running out at times to call May, that she might
employ him within-May sometimes answering her
summons, but oftener disobeying.
There were no cases requiring surgical skill—alas !
those whose wounds had disabled their limbs lay dead
within the redoubt, speared by the assegai of the
relentless savage. Three had fallen, never to rise
again, and within the house rose the wailing sounds
of " lamentation and mourning and woe!” They
reached the upper apartments. Eleanor's senses were
awakened at the cry of sorrow from the women.
She spoke for the first time.
“ The world seems filled with grief,” said she, and
then looked vacantly from her father's face to Marion's,
and back again, with an air of sad inquiry.
Mr. Daveney took his stricken daughter in his arms;
Marion followed. Mrs. Daveney waited for them
at the foot of the stairs. Loud cries of anguish burst
Children were sitting on the floor,
weeping for lost fathers or brothers.
A woman
had" fainted, and her baby tried in vain to rouse
her.
May drew a little cordon round the father and
daughters, as they hurried to the block-house, for shots
were still interchanging between the besieged and the
besiegers, and Mrs. Daveney, vacating her office in
favour of the matrons who had borne their part in the
strife, followed with Mrs. Trail and Fitje, the latter
carrying her sleeping infant in her arms.
The gray light of morning was streaming through the
loops of the little tower. The enemy was evidently
on the retreat, and firing as he retired; and Mr.
Daveney, having seen Eleanor again laid upon a couch,
and gradually awakening to the consciousness of her
mother's presence, returned to the dwelling to restore
order, as far as he could, among the mourners, the

wounded, and the untiring, fighting members of the
community.
Ormsby's first inquiry was for Eleanor--next for
Marion; Ormsby was becoming accustomed to think
of others before himself. Frankfort, for the first time
since the beginning of the siege, cast himself on the
sofa, and, after several minutes' deliberation, inquired
of Mr. Daveney whether he thought it likely that the
troops had taken the field.
“I have not the slightest doubt of it,” replied the
magistrate; " the demonstrations we have witnessed
to-night are the result of information from the tribes to
the westward that the army is on the march; it will
not be long now before the expresses reach us,—that is,
if the savages do not cut them off. Sir John Manvers
is new to this country ; I hope he will be guided by
good advisers, and send strong escorts with his dis-
patches."
“ The escorts will of course return to the camps,'
observed Frankfort inquiringly, " or will they proceed
further?”
"I shall take advantage of the first arrival," an-
swered his host, " to communicate with some of the
farms in the district; but,” he added, anticipating
Frankfort's intentions, "they will return hither with
all possible speed after delivering their dispatches."
“Then,” said Frankfort, rising, and clasping his
host's hand warmly in his own, “it will be time for
me to go;
if my regiment is not in the field, I doubt
not Sir John Manvers will permit me to accompany
his force as a volunteer; or I may be useful to him in
heading a band of burghers -
All he could say in addition was, “I fear I shall ever
remember Annerley too well, You will, I hope, some-
times think of me as linked to you by being a sharer
of the calamity that haunts your
house."
Only the common-place remarks of life passed after-
wards between these two good men.

Mr. Daveney admitted that this was clearly his duty
as a soldier.
Three weary days dragged their slow length along
ere the expresses arrived. The Kafirs had occupied
the immediate frontier in such multitudes, that no
small force could move; but now, having plundered the
settlements, and disposed of their prey to their hearts'
content, they had dispersed, and spread themselves
along the bushy banks of the great Fish River, waiting
their opportunities of crossing into the colony, which,
had they known their own strength, they might have
devastated from the Fish River to the sea.
The dead were decently laid out beneath the mul-
berry-tree, the bell swinging heavily in the oppressive
air of a sultry autumn day. Here the mourners
gathered round to take a last look of the uncoffined
corpses of the brave. The household, with few excep-
tions, assembled to listen to the
prayer
and exhorta-
tion pronounced by the good missionary, for the
pressure of circumstances would not admit of their
lingering over the grave, which was to contain all three.
Then the comrades of the poor, sacrificed settlers,
with muskets reversed, formed in funeral order round
the bearers, and Mr. Daveney having taken his place
as chief mourner, the sorrowful procession wended its
way to the ground which had been purchased for a
chapel; and there, in sad and hurried fashion, the
deep, deep grave was filled.
It was well, indeed, that the master of Annerley had
provisioned his little fortress, the inmates of which
amounted to forty persons, the greater proportion
women and children. The defenders of the wagon
barricades had saved their span-oxen, but it would
have been imprudent to kill these unless driven to
the necessity, as, without oxen, how were they to
travel, if obliged to desert the settlement ?
Daveney himself contemplated removing his family
as soon as circumstances would permit; for, although

the buildings were safe, a sad scene of devastation pre-
sented itself when day dawned upon it, after the
terrors of the night attack-broken palisades, scattered
thorn-bushes, the earth torn and bloody with the
fearful struggles of men and beasts, the vineyard laid
waste and trampled, assegais half buried in heaps of
rubbish, and sheep that had been stabbed, and left to
die, running hither and thither, mutilated, and bleat-
ing piteously. The pretty trellis-work was battered
to pieces, and the walls defaced with bullet-holes.
The enemy had taken his departure towards the
colony, but this was only suspected, till the fourth
day, when the expresses from Sir John Manvers's
camp brought news of his whereabouts.
Then the younger men of the garrison sallied forth to
the known fastnesses for cattle, and brought back a few
foot-sore beasts, which had strayed from the rest; and
the good host held a consultation with Mr. Trail, on
the re-organization of the little band under a stout old
settler, no longer able to ride, but quite capable of
defending a post.
Marion looked from the loops of the blockhouse, and
saw the departure of her lover and Frankfort with an
aching heart.
It was known beyond doubt that the
Kafirs were mustering in the mountains; it was fully
believed that there must be an action; and even this,
with such an enemy, in such a country, could not be
decisive.
She consoled herself by contrasting her own lot with
that of her unfortunate sister. Frankfort had not
trusted himself to a last interview with Eleanor;
Ormsby's adieu had been as tender to her as to her
sister. Buoyant of spirit as he was, he yet could not
help admitting that the aspect of affairs was very
grave.
Marion watched the two young men and their
heavily-armed escort as they traversed the plain
through a slanting shower of rain, so determined,
that the space between the sky and earth looked as

if it was ruled slantwise with thick leaden lines. She
could not see them long for the storm, and she was
descending from her look-out to her sister's bed-side,
when she heard May, who was on the top of the
block-house, exclaim, " More riders--more news!"
A dozen men galloped from the eastward at speed.
They brought the welcome intelligence that Sir Adrian
Fairfax had arrived at the mouth of the Buffalo River
with reinforcements from Cape Town, and that the
burghers from the upper districts had rallied round
Sir John Manvers.
“Hurrah !" cried May, “ we've got the Kafirs in a
calabash ;” and May was right—the warriors were in
the mountains between the forces of the two generals;
but the cattle, the great source of contention, was far
eastward, under the charge of a chief professedly
friendly to England.
Mr. Daveney hastened to send Sir Adrian a dis-
patch announcing his suspicions of Lyle's confederacy
with the rebel Boers, but suggested that the idea
should not be mooted for the present.
The roar of cannon and the sharp rattle of musketry
proclaimed to the settlers at Annerley, on the 18th of
March, that the colonial forces to the westward were
engaged with the Kafir warriors.
It thundered on till night; then the fiery telegraphs
were lit again upon the mountain ridges--silence
fell—heaven and earth grew dark again. Morning
came, the sun struggled with flying mists, and again
the echoes from shot and shell and musket rever-
berated from kloof to kloof, and filled the hearts of
the listeners with terror and dismay.
The little bushman kept watch upon the top of the
block-house from dawn till sunset, and Marion shared
his vigil for hours. They were strongly contrasted,
were those two beings, both fashioned by God's wise
hand. The girl young, blooming, sunny-haired, and
graceful; the bushman stunted, ugly, and uncouth ;

nevertheless, they had many thoughts and feelings
in common.
Another day was passing, and still the battle raged;
but in the afternoon there was a lull. The very
elements were still, and a soft rain descended gently.
Still May and Marion kept watch together.
“Express !" shouted May.
Marion's lips were closed rigidly, her teeth chat-
tered within; she knew not how she reached the lower
apartment: her father had left it; the door stood
open; the riders galloped in by the trampled vineyard
paths.
They are beaten, of course ?” said Mr. Daveney to
the captain of the riders.
“ Beaten, but not conquered," replied the latter
gravely; "and we have lost ---
Marion, statue-like, appeared at her father's side.
“A hundred men and five officers," continued the
burgher captain.
“ We had friends in the action," said Mr. Daveney,
trying to be firm. “ Can you tell us if they are safe?"
*“ Their names, sir ?”
“ Frankfort and Ormsby."
“I have the list of officers killed and wounded,” said
the man; and first he looked in his hat, next he fumbled
in his capacious pockets, then he turned his havresacka
round,-it was not there; examined his pouch--"No;
he was afraid he had lost it.", How little could he
understand the agonized suspense of Marion.
He took off his wide-flapped hat again.
“ See under the feather," said May.
The bushman's quick eye had detected a paper
stuck in the string encircling the hat; it was the
list. May snatched it from him, and handed it to
Mr. Daveney.
Neither Ormsby's nor Frankfort's name was there.
Marion burst into tears of gratitude and excitement.
The burgher spoke truth when he said the enemy
was beaten, but not conquered. May said there were

· holes in the calabash, and so it was; the 'warrior
bands were broken, but they infested the colony in
all directions, walking in and out of it as it pleased
them, by manifold kloofs and passes untrod by
settlers.
It was Sir John Manyers's division which had been
engaged. Sir Adrian was still to the eastward, pre-
paring to march beyond the Orange River; the mes-
sages of defiance addressed to Sir John Manvers were
referred to him.
The master of Annerley, in utter dread of Lyle's
reappearance at no distant period, determined on
retiring, as soon as possible, to the lower and more
civilized districts of the Cape Colony; and Mrs. Da-
veney, eagerly according with his plan, prepared at
once for the journey, which was to be undertaken as
opportunities offered of travelling with escorts.
Meanwhile comforting letters were received from
Ormsby. Frankfort had joined Sir Adrian's force.
Eleanor tried to rouse herself to exertion, and the
day arrived when the family was to quit Annerley for
May, to his infinite joy, was, with Fitje and his
child, to accompany the Daveneys.
"Be not heart-sore, missis," said he to Eleanor ;
6 when the night gets darkest, day is nearest ;”, and
taking the long whip from Griqua Adam, he gave the
signal for departure by a loud sharp crack, that echoed
like twenty whips up the kloof.
The colonists, men, women, and children, with Mr.
and Mrs. Trail, stood at the gate of the avenue. Some
begged to say.“ Good-by" to the young “missis," and
the curtains of the wagon were drawn aside for a
minute ; but those who caught sight of Eleanor turned
away frightened and sorrowful at her ghastly looks,
and begged the rest not to trouble her.
Her mother was beside her. Eleanor's head was
pillowed on her sympathizing bosom. Truly did that
mother deplore her own blind, obstinate folly in trust-
ever.

which, had she chosen to look deeply into it, she would
have seen was but a chance of well-doing after all
.
Oh! how many are there who will work for them-
selves, instead of waiting for Providence's gracious
helping hand.
Mr. Daveney and Marion were on horseback.
The people pressed forward to say “Farewell.”
Father and daughter had a hand for each, and one
blue-eyed, fair-haired child would be lifted up to be
kissed.
"Ah!” said an Englishwoman,“ bless Miss Marion !
she has no pride."
Troth, an ye’r wrong," interposed an Irish one.
“Sure it's herself that has the raal pride—the pride of
the lady, that knows she does not demean herself by
showing the good will to all God's creatures."
The little procession moved slowly and silently
across the grassy plain. The people at Annerley
watched it till the glittering bayonets of the escort
were lost in the haze; and when “ the master” was
fairly out of sight, Markland, the old settler, put the
house in order, and assumed the command.
Daveney had planned his line of march intending
to avoid Sir John Manvers’s camp; but, on the third
day's journey, the sound of harmonious voices swelling
in chorus struck on the surprised ears of the party.
A deep glen lay just below; the cavalcade halted;
they could see nothing, for the cliffs overhung the
gorge. The sounds drew near—'twas an old Scotch
air, very martial and stirring, especially in that deep
solitude. In front was an opening, an outlet from the
glen. Mr. Daveney and Marion rode forward, and
looked down.
Soldiers singing on a march! Reader, did you ever
hear it? Ah, it is worth a world of fine, well-taught,
scientific melodies! You should have seen them in
this mountain-pass. They were Highlanders, not
kilted, but they wore the “tartan trews.”

Beating time with steady tread to the noble chorus,
they passed below the cliff from which Daveney and
his daughter Marion watched them. Truly this had
a singular effect in that ravine, so like a Scottish glen,
with mountains looming far and near, and—oh! rare
in Southern Africa—a waterfall tumbling and foam-
ing over hoary rocks.
Softly it rose and fell upon the air, again burst
forth in full harmony as the glen widened, and died
away in the shade where the pathway narrowed
between tall hills.
All was still once more, save the murmur of the
waterfall. The Daveneys took their station for the
night. The escort formed its cordon round the
little bivouac, and May directed the lighting of the
fires and preparations for the usual sunset meal.
Midnight-Daveney held that watch himself.
“ Who goes there?”
Friends,” answered a voice—it was Ormsby's. He
was in command of a company of soldiers. Sir John
Manvers was extending his force. The Daveneys
found themselves unexpectedly within the lines of the
British troops.

CHAPTER XIX.
THE
BATTLE.
I HAVE said that the salute of the horsemen who
advanced to meet Vander Roey's band was answered
by a corresponding movement from the latter. 'Each
party moved along its path in stem silence. They
met at the foot of the hill, and then palm met palm,
as though sealing a sullen but determined compact.
Vander Roey's countenance proclaimed evil tidings.
No one liked to ask him questions ; besides, the very
advance of the pilgrims over the hills was a signal that
hope was lost. Lodewyk was the spokesman, while
Vander Roey and his wife rode forward with Van-
bloem, a son of the settler introduced in the early
chapters of this work. He was young, active, brave,
and clever. Each of these two men had much to tell
the other.
Lodewyk strode on declaiming-Vander Roey told
again how he had been turned from Sir John Manvers's
door with scorn.
The colonists had sympathized with him at the
insult, but what could they do? All hope of redress
of grievances was over, and no better time could be
chosen for treking. The troops were marching to-
wards Kafirland. Sir John was as bewildered as a
bird in a mist. Here were men-pointing to Lyle and
Brennard-who could tell them that the eyes of
England, and France, and Holland were upon them.
Lyle was a patriot, had suffered in the cause of
patriotism; he had been cast upon the shores of Africa
for a great purpose. They already knew the services
that Brennard had rendered them; well, Lyle had

been an able colleague-his plans had proved his
ability ; through his means arms and amunition had
been safely conveyed through various branches of the
colony ; every Boer was armed, every, honest man was
roused to a just sense of his forlorn and degraded
position; but the time had come if they were per-
mitted to go in peace, well and good; if not
“Ah! if not,” said Lodewyk's brother,
dress ourselves in thunder, and mark a boundary-line
for ourselves with blood.”
They reached the bivouac: it was more wretched
than the last. The plains were saturated with water
from the heavy rains which had prevailed on the
eastern flats. There were but few tents or wagon-
tilts, and these were ragged and damp, serving as
poor coverings to the sickly, shivering wretches
beneath.
Lyle's first salutation from a sallow man, who sat
making a coffin for his wife and baby, was,“ Welcome
to the place of graves." He passed on; some squalid
children in rags were stirring up a pool of stagnant
water to find frogs; an agueish woman with parched
lips remonstrated with them for troubling the waters;
she wished to slake her thirst. Two women were
grinding corn between stones, others looked greedily
on. There was neither milk nor bread. Some wretched
sheep, lately brought in by a foraging party, awaited
their doom—they had been earned at great cost;
three men lay dying of their wounds ; in truth, it was
a sorry sight.
Poor Gray was more disheartened than ever. The
Boers had begun to look upon him with a suspicious
eye; it was evident he was not a volunteer. He
felt that he was despised, and his heart died within
him. He sat down upon an old pack-saddle; he looked
so weary, so dejected, that young Vanbloem's wife took
pity on him. She was an Englishwoman. She spoke
kindly to him in his own language. The deserter
could have wept, but for very shame.

“Come hither,” said she, “ you poor young English-
man ;
has
your country done
you any wrong,
that
you
should turn rebel? You look miserable enough in
mind and body, but I can give you something for
your heart to rest upon,-see here.”
She raised a canvass screen, and showed him
Amayeka fast asleep. Amayeka had found a kind
heart, and trusted it.
Gray's face shone with sudden light.
Anne Vanbloem dropped the screen: “There,” said
she; “it is good for you to know she is safe ; be satisfied
with that for the present.”
Poor Amayeka! Vanbloem was the man who had
rescued her from the torture, and his wife “ had
compassion on her.''
Gray would have given much to have poured out
his heart to the young Dutchman; but Vander Roey's
disastrous mission and its results had fanned the flame
of rebellion to such a height, that no one could expect
to meet with a hearing who was not resolved on
freedom, or on fighting for it; besides, Gray knew
that his confession might draw on him the imputation
of cowardice, and then-alas for resolution !-here
was Amayeka, the only being on earth who truly
loved him.
Doda was as philosophical on discovering that his
daughter was in safe hands as he would have been
had he heard that she had died by torture. In the
latter case, he would have excused his apparent want
of feeling by alleging that grief was useless-a Kafir
has as little idea of gratuitous sorrow as gratuitous
labour.
Brennard expected that Zoonah would bring them
news from the colony, and it was resolved in council
that, on the arrival of the scouts from different
points, if the intelligence of each agreed with the
other, the bivouac should be entirely broken up.
Vander Roey had brought some supplies with him,
and parties were formed to obtain provisions from

the hunting-grounds. In these expeditions Gray
redeemed his character for skill and courage, albeit
he was no longer strong and lithe of limb as he had
been.
He saw little of Amayeka. Anne Vanbloem had
her own plans about her, and changed the subject
whenever Gray alluded to her. He saw, however, that
the young Boeress meant kindly, and was obliged to
content himself with that idea.
Anne and Gray were left together one afternoon;
he had been assisting her in carrying goods from her
tent to the wagons, which were to move towards the
Modder River on the morrow with various stores and
a strong escort of the Boers, Vander Roey's object
being to advance gradually beyond the colony, and to
give battle, if driven to such an alternative, in a posi-
tion of which he knew the advantages. Thus the
elder men, women, children, goods, and arms,
were sent off from time to time by small divisions.
The Kafir scouts, and five or six more traders from
the British settlements, were anxiously expected ;
and, although the Boers did not contemplate suc-
cess on the side of the savages in the present strife
in Kafirland, they knew that the warfare would be
such as to harass the troops, and keep them employed
for a considerable time. In the mean time he de-
spatched his message of defiance to Sir John
Manvers.
“It is very clear, young man,” remarked Anne
Vanbloem,“ that your heart is not in this business.”
“I am a miserable creature,” replied the poor
young deserter; “my heart is, indeed, quite opposed
to the treachery I am called upon to join in."
“ And mine also,” said Anne;
" I do not see my
way; but, by God's help, Vanbloem shall have no
part in this war.”

hour of his new acquaintance with Vander Roey.
He ascertained from the chief that the great body of
the Dutch had formed a settlement near a river, which
it was necessary to cross ere the English could satisfy
themselves of the existence of the great Salt Lake.
The Boers and aborigines had explored this part long
ago ;* but men of science professed themselves unbe-
lievers on this point. Lyle showed his colleagues the
advantage of such a position, and stirred up the rest
of the unfortunate wanderers into the belief that it
would be as unavailing as cowardly to yield without
a struggle. Rumours had reached Lyle and Bren-
nard of the prospect of Sir Adrian Fairfax's return
to South Africa, but they determined on keeping this
to themselves.
*
The scouts came in, Zoonah among them ; Lyle
took the latter aside, and learned from him how he
had hovered about the neighbourhood of Annerley,
holding daily parleys with his little sister—the trai-
tress !-how she had brought him back the assegai,
and related the issue of its discovery.
“Ha! ha!” thought Lyle, laughing bitterly;
“they know now that I am not at the bottom of the
sea, as they hoped.”
The reports of the scouts encouraged some and
daunted others.
On the one hand, Sir John Manvers was harassed
by the Kafirs—on the other, Sir Adrian's sudden ap-
pearance in the heart of the country struck terror
into the minds of the less resolute.
The season of dewy mornings and bitter nights
was fast approaching, sickness was increasing in the
camp; Lyle, Brennard-all the English traitors, in
fact -- urged Vander Roey to retire to the north-
eastward without delay. With his usual policy, the

former had contrived to send forward a member from
almost every family, and thus all had an interest in
falling into a position where they might make a stand
against the British forces.
The chill dawn of an April morning saw the
bivouac again broken up, and by noon the plain was
vacant.
Vanbloem rode in the rear with a heavy heart-
he was_beginning hourly to repent; Gray was beside
him. Each knew what was passing in the other's
mind, but neither spoke.
It was midnight; the wanderers had halted at the
foot of a hill on the site of an old mission station
part of the house still remained. The rain fell in
torrents, a few stunted bushes were all that afforded
shelter to the poor pilgrims of the desert.
Gray heard his name called.
It was Vanbloem-he came for help; he had
removed his wife into the dilapidated building-
Amayeka was with her; ere long he hoped to behold
his first-born; but he was in dismay at the sudden
pain and peril of Anne, who, hurried by the journey,
and terrified at the prospect of her husband leaving
her, had been brought sooner into her trouble than
she expected.
Gray assisted Vanbloem in removing certain com-
forts from his wagon to the deserted mission garden;
Amayeka came out under the dripping trees, and
received them from her master's hand, for the poor
girl was now in the capacity of a domestic.
God was gracious. Vanbloem held a living girl in
his arms ere the night had passed; but it was impos-
sible for his wife to be removed, and he would not
leave her desolate.
How Lyle cursed the woman !
“Oh!" thought Gray, “ that I might stay with
them, and wait my doom from the hands of my coun-
trymen."

but they would brand you with a coward's name. I
pity you from my soul. May God have compassion on
you, and help you! I see the finger of Providence in
what has just occurred to myself. I will remain in
the desert with my wife and Amayeka."
Gray led the young Dutchman to a retired spot, and
poured forth his whole soul to him.
“I leave Amayeka,” said he,“ to you and your
kind English wife; tell her never to forget poor Gray,
the deserter."
*
Vander Roey felt that Vanbloem would never join his
band again. They parted friends, however, the latter
resolving, if opportunity required it, to act as inter-
cessor between the Government and his countrymen.
Sir Adrian was indeed utterly confounded at hear-
ing that Lyle was alive, at liberty, and at work in such
a field. His career from the time he had left the
Cape had been, as I have shown, short and mischievous.
He had been foremost as a Chartist leader, had organ-
ized bodies of men in Wales and Cornwall; but had,
at a fortunate moment for his country and the people
he had misled, been seized by the Government, tried,
found guilty, and transported, ere the wretched men
under him had recovered their breath, after their frantic
but useless demonstrations.

Well, there was enough work before Sir Adrian for
the cleverest and most active of governors. In front
were thousands of savages at war with troops and colo-
nists; to the north-eastward, with a space between
of 400 miles, through a difficult country, was a sullen,
determined enemy, well prepared with arms and am-
munition, bent alike on revenge and the establishment
of privileges “ dearer to these Boers than life.”
Mr. Daveney soon found that it would be madness
to attempt proceeding with his family to the more
civilized districts. He therefore contented himself by
forming a little encampment of his own, some fifteen
miles from Sir John Manvers’s. Major Frankfort,
having received an offer of active employment from
Sir Adrian, had joined the division on the banks of
the Buffalo River. Ormsby was in command of a
detachment of his own corps, under Sir John.
Here we must leave our friends for a short time.
The good master of Annerley set to work upon the
erection of a temporary dwelling, round which was
drawn a cordon militaire. His advice and assistance
would have been of the utmost advantage to Sir John
Manvers, but circumstances, which shall hereafter be
explained, prevented their holding any but necessary
communications with each other, and no alternative
was left the General but to harass his savage antago-
nists till they were compelled to sue for peace.
Meanwhile many Boers in the lower districts, hear-
ing that Vander Roey was on his way to join those
who had already treked beyond the boundary, deserted
their farms and bivouacs, and on coming up with him
learned that he had resolved on halting in a position
where he might give battle to the British forces, or
pause in security till the helpless part of the commu-
nity had reached a more habitable tract of country.
It was to Gray a melancholy thing to hear so many
English voices among those who came, day by day.

zest into the prospect of battle with their fellow-sub-
jects.
It was June, but not like that balmy month in
England. All day long a blinding shower of snow
had been falling, it was bitterly cold, and a cruel
north-east wind drove the storm before the Dutch
videttes of Vander Roey's camp, who, posted on a
stony ridge, kept the look-out for a reconnoitring
party, long expected.
Night drew on; rain and sleet veiled the prospect;
the videttes descended the ridge, and joined their
comrades round the great bonfire, which was no easy
matter to keep up, from the scarcity of wood.
Wrapped in their heavy coats, with hats flapped
over their brows, their arms at hand, the red light of
their pipes irradiating their bearded and swarthy faces,
the rebels listened to the alternate tirades of Lyle and
Brennard.
It was these two connoisseurs in human nature
who had taken care that there should be plenty of
tobacco
among
the stores of the bivouac. The Boers
they knew would make the better listeners for this
solace.
It was a scene fit for a painter of the wild and
picturesque. Rising abruptly in front was the stony
ridge, the outline dimly marked against the murky
sky; two or three ragged tents and as many wagons
were drawn close to the fire, which, from time to time,
emitting its fitful light, shone on none but angry or
anxious faces.
Vander Roey paced restlessly up and down between
his wife's wagon and the fire. Madame Vander Roey
was the only woman in the bivouac. She sat with the
curtains of the wagon drawn aside, listening for the
approach of expected horsemen. The wind had died
away, and the sleet continued to fall noiselessly. The
silence of nature was alone disturbed by Lyle's voice

tinels. The two little bushboys, Lynx and Frolic,
wrapped in skins and coiled up under the wagon,
peered with their sharp eyes into the mist.
“ Here they come,” said Lynx. Frolic laid his ear
to the earth, satisfied himself that horses' feet were
beating the ground at a distance, and announced the
fact to his mistress, who called Vander Roey.
He was already by her side.
6 Who comes there ?"
Who
goes
there?” shouted sentinel number one ;
it was repeated by number two, and in an instant the
rebels were on their feet.
“Who comes there ?”
“Friends !” and about a dozen horsemen galloped
in hot haste down the stony acclivity.
The foremost threw himself from his horse: it was
Hermanus the stutterer; the light from the fire shone
upon his face; in his endeavour to speak, he made
hideous grimaces. Lynx and Frolic laughed. Lyle
kicked the one aside, and struck Lynx such a blow
with his rifle, that the boy was stunned for a few
minutes, but recovered to gibber and curse—he had
learned to swear in English.
The riders brought word that Sir Adrian was on
his way to attack the rebels, if they were unwilling to
listen to terms. The Kafirs were coaxed into quietude
for a while, that Sir John Manvers might follow the
Governor, if necessary, with a corps de réserve ; it was
clear that all other political questions were to be laid
aside, that a heavy blow might be struck against the
Boers.
Vander Roey had never anticipated the sudden
appearance of Sir Adrian and his troops in the heart
of the country, nevertheless there seemed nothing for
it now but to fight or surrender, and the cunning
English traitors implicated in the rebellion, men who
had nothing to lose, persuaded him, through Lyle and
Brennard, that to yield at once would be to draw on

themselves greater odium, and as heavy a penalty as
though they resisted the law to the death.
“ Let it," said Lyle, addressing Vander Roey, in the
presence of his wife, “ be only a feint of resistance, if
you will, but do not, after all your proclamations and
messages to that insolent General, throw down your
arms as soon as you face the troops; they will laugh
at you, despise you, and you will deserve to be beaten
like a dog.
Vander Roey could not help reminding Lyle, that it
was he who had dictated his
very
last
message” to
Sir John Manvers, to the effect that, as Sir John
had not written to Vander Roey, the latter should
answer him as he chose, and that his determination
now was to fight, to conquer, or to die.”
Lyle laughed scornfully, raising his voice, and
thus gathering a crowd round him, while Madame
Vander Roey, undaunted, but anxious, watched her
husband's countenance by the light of the wagon
lantern.
· It is well for you to talk thus," said Hermanus
the stutterer, who, once set going, could talk glibly ;
"you may run away in the scuffle, and
you
know
you cannot escape justice if we yield—you are speak-
ing in favour of your own interests. I say it is folly
to fight now,-make a truce.”
“Never," shouted Vander Roey, suddenly kindling
with anger, as he remembered his contemptuous dis-
missal from Sir John Manvers's residence.“ Fight or
fly,—which shall it be, my friends ? Speak, for before
daylight we must be up and doing."
He raised his lofty figure to its utmost height and
looked round, his wife leaned anxiously over his
shoulder; the lantern, swinging to and fro, showed the
expression on the face of each; hers was anxious, yet
fearless; his brows were knit, his eyes flashed, and he
added, “ Let the majority decide; remember my
watch-
word is still War-war to the knife!”
The English traitors sent up their hats in the air,

and cheered the leader, and all the young Boers did
the same.
Our convict had taken care that not a
youth should leave the force; within a circle of two
miles behind the strong ridge there were four hun-
dred good men and true, between the ages of twenty-
five and thirty ; the whole force amounted to eight
hundred, and few of the oldest had reached the age
of fifty
Lyle turned to congratulate Madame Vander Roey
on her husband's decision; the curtains of her wagon
were closed-he lifted a corner, her head, covered with
her scarlet handkerchief, was almost buried in the
cushions of her bed ; by the light of the lantern he
could see her whole frame was shaking with emotion,
and stifled groans issued from her lips.
He dropped the screen with a sneer; "She will
come to her senses by-and-by," muttered he; and he
was right. At dawn, in spite of a wind which cut like
razors, she was busied with Hermanus and others at
the stores hidden in the rocks.
Lyle and Brennard took charge of the “ Cape
Smoke," and served out to every man his sopie. The
spirits of the bivouac were never suffered to flag.
The horsemen had been sent on with all speed to
the larger encampment of Boers, Vander Roey's party
being in front, to defend and keep possession of the
strong ridge, along which, at intervals, the few guns
the rebels possessed had been ranged.
were attached the number of men necessary to work
them. Gray had yielded passively enough to Lyle's
orders on the subject, but that very apathy made the
latter more suspicious of his victim. Unnoticed by the
deserter, he watched him narrowly, and, all-daring and
subtle as he was, felt baffled in his conjectures as to
the probable issue of Gray's forced enlistment in the
rebels' cause.
The position taken up by Vander Roey was the
strongest in the whole country, being a succession of
hills covered with large loose stones. In his front

rose the ridge, surmounted by a natural rampart,
rendered more complete by the art of deserters from
the corps of Sappers and Miners.
In the rear was a
stream, lined with rushes and long reeds, fordable to
those well acquainted with its depths, but offering no
easy passage to British infantry. The line of fire
extended a full mile.
At dawn of day, the videttes reported the appear-
ance of a mounted reconnoitring party from the
enemy's force, and within half an hour every man
was at his post; Gray taking his place at the gun he
was to serve.

agony. Ah! how
many
who dare unseen
dangers, who even meet the reality of peril with flash-
ing eye, a fevered cheek, and brow unblenched, but who,
in the dread pause between plan and action, quail at
the loud beating of their own hearts !
For months, Madame Vander Roey had looked
forward to some such moment as this she was ac-
customed to scenes of danger, she had been present
at those strifes in cattle-lifting which are the common
occurrences of a South African settler's life ; but this
sudden call to arms against men, whom her father
had been wont to term his "white brethren,” rang on
her ear like a knell, and a presentiment of evil over-
powered her for the moment.
Still she was persuaded that her husband was right,
and she knelt down and implored help and mercy
from Him who is "the Father of the oppressed."
Reassured after her devotions, she assumed the cos-
tume she had lately worn in camp, and leaving the
wagon, untied her horse from the wheel, saddled and
bridled it herself, and mounting it without assistance,
rode along the foot of the hill, inspecting the defences
with a steady eye and considerable judgment.
Her dress was simple enough, a long stuff petticoat
serving her for a habit, her face being shaded by a

large straw hat, with the ostrich feather depending
from it. It was typical of the times, was that drooping
plume, soiled and saturated as it was with the cold
mist of that sad morning. Her horse, handsome, fleet,
and with that easy action so peculiar to the mountain
steeds of Africa, looked somewhat the worse for scanty
rations; and her face, once so radiant with health and
joy, wore a look of intense anxiety, as, on hearing a
murmur among the Boers, she glanced in the direction
indicated by their gestures, and saw her husband
heading the large force which he had gone forth to
meet, and descending the low ridge on the other side
of the stream. It was traversed in silence, and,
hurrying forward somewhat irregularly, they spread
out in extended order.
In twenty minutes each had his station assigned
him. Madame Vander Roey dismounted, and took
hers beside her husband, to the right of the granite
rampart. Gray_stood as steady as the rock that
screened him. Brennard assumed the command of the
left wing. Lyle occupied the centre of the line, where
there was a slight bend, and thus he was enabled to
watch both flanks, and keep a close eye on Gray, to
whom, as he fell into his place, he addressed a few words.

“By God's help, I will," was the reply of the young
deserter, in a tone of confidence quite unexpected by
the Mephistophiles of the wilderness.
The latter looked at him, sneered, but was satisfied;
and then, with his head bent below the ridge, scram-
bled over stone and scrub, reached his post, and there
knelt down, his rifle ready for work, and his eye
the line of march by which the troops were expected.
But rain and sleet still occasionally veiled the pros-
pect in vapour. The report of the videttes was
questioned in its accuracy by some, and each man
strove to pierce the mist, and give the first warning of
the enemy's advance.

A. death-like silence reigned throughout that ex-
pectant company.
At length the clouds slowly and almost impercepti-
bly lifted, and here and there some new feature in the
scene developed itself—a solitary bush, the carcass of
an ox, or a grave covered with stones—and, finally, two
mounted men, soldiers of the Cape cavalry, moving
leisurely forward, and, as May would have said, evi-
dently spenning.
' By heavens !” exclaimed Lyle, they see us, and
have turned to report. Confound that fellow Gray,
he has run out the gun too far, and these Totties * have
distinguished its black muzzle among the gray rocks."
It needed no oaths to confirm the
truth of his statement—the reconnoiterers had faced
to the rear so suddenly, that there seemed but little
doubt as to the cause of the movement, and a few
minutes decided it.
As the sun came up, the veil of mist was rent in
twain, and fully disclosed to view a small body of
English troops, under the command of Sir Adrian
Fairfax. Lyle unslung his spy-glass, took a deliberate
view of the encampment, and, closing the telescope in
haste, exclaimed, "Every tent is struck--the advance-
guard is on the march.”
The word passed to the right and left.
Vander Roey, white as death, but steady as ever,
glanced his eye, now along the line, now forward, now
in the rear.
His spies had evidently been mistaken as
to the strength of the force ; and now reason whispered
him that his chance of success was small, but he had
much dependence on his position. It was perfect in
every way, whereas the British forces were on open,
stony ground; they were new to the locality, and well
worn with a march of thirty miles, which they must
have made within twelve hours.
But, as the troops advanced, it appeared that a

manæuvre of Lyle's had answered his purpose for the
present. To the extreme right, where a road cut the
ridge in two, he had placed several men, who were only
to affect concealment. It was to this point that the
attention of the advance-guard was evidently directed,
for, instead of making a forward movement, they took
an oblique path, intent on attacking the detached party
to their left, who were fully prepared to retreat within a
narrow gorge, capable of containing some twenty men,
and defended by a gun placed at the opening:
Poor Gray was guiltless of running out his piece of
ordnance, as Lyle imagined—the error lay with a less
practised hand, but the
circumstance turned the fortune
of the hour; for the Boers, misled by the diagonal
march of the soldiers, were somewhat off their guard,
and, in imagined security, watched the forces of the
Government.
It was curious and painful to Gray to hear the
cool
way in which the deserters of the party made their
observations on the scene before them.
Ha!” said one, who knelt beside him, gazing
intently through a fissure in the rock, “they have
got up a company of the old Ninety-th; that
rascal Zoonah said they were to remain in garrison.
*-an oath or two filled the space" they know

“ Matthews and
Wilton, and you, Jem Blaine, you belonged to it.”
“ How they march !” said Jem Blaine ; "they
are as fresh as when I saw them at drill at Graham's
Town;"
and the last oath was uttered heartily,
and in thorough good-humour, as a strange touch of
pride in his old corps brought the red colour to his
hard brown cheek. “By, there's my old captain,
Frankfort. Well done, grenadiers; well done, old
fellows--step out. Look sharp, Frankfort. Oh! I
see he is a staff man. God bless you, old fellow ; if

should have been marching with you now.

Jem Blaine sat down, turned his back upon the fissure,
and would look no more.
Standing up, leaning on his long roer, his hat at
his feet, and great drops of perspiration on his broad
forehead, Vander Roey followed the troops with his
eye. The mist had not yet quite cleared off, but he
could distinguish the rear of the division. He saw
that the force was small, but well chosen, but he said
nothing
They have no artillery,” said a young Boer.
Vander Roey made no reply, but watched his wife,
who was looking through a telescope beyond the
division.
In another moment Madame Vander Roey ex-
claimed, “They have artillery ; I see a gun advancing.”
She handed the telescope to her husband.
First came the division, consisting of infantry and a
small body of Cape cavalry. The Boers had gained
heart at sight of this little force, and Vander Roey took
it as a sign of the Governor's contempt of his enemy;
still he could scarcely believe that the great Sir Adrian
Fairfax would head a mere handful of men; and,
therefore, he did not exult prematurely. “Were this
the only force," said he to his wife,“ we should powder
them to dust in an hour.”
But it was not the only force. The mists hanging
to the westward still screened the barren landscape
far in rear of the troops, but ere the latter had moved
half a mile across the broken plain, there emerged, as
from the clouds, four “coal-black steeds," of great
power. These drew a deadly weapon, and, following
them, were two slender pieces of ordnance, the nature
of which was incomprehensible to the unfortunate
Dutch, who soon, however, learned what a rocket
could do from their English opponents. Added to these
was a strong body of infantry, and a troop of cavalry,
protecting the artillery.
Vander Roey's courage and presence of mind did not
forsake him. He saw at once the advantage to be

353
gained by the false move the enemy was making. His
plan was to attack him on the broken ground, up
which the infantry must move in skirmishing order,
in the endeavour to dislodge the Boers on the left.
It seemed clear that the General had no idea of the
strength of the rebel forces, and, believing that in-
fantry would rout them out, was bent on bringing the
wretched men to terms without using the artillery or
charging with his cavalry.
But while nearly a mile distant from the stony
ramparts, that looked so still and lifeless, Sir Adrian
called a halt. Lyle watched him narrowly; the General
conversed for a few minutes with Frankfort, who next
rode into the ranks, and brought with him some old
sergeants of the corps. It was evident that a council
of war was held; it lasted but a few minutes, yet
time was thus given for the artillery to advance. Still
it was consideral in rear of the front division, and
Lyle was slightly baffled in his conjectures.
Brennard would have had Vander Roey open out
his guns upon the infantry as they drew near the
rebels' right flank, but at this instant Vander Roey
hesitated, and the opportunity was lost. Had the
rebel chief followed this advice, he might have con-
quered, and retired far to the north-east; but his
heart failed him at the thought of dealing death from
a masked battery on the soldiers.
Probably he would have felt differently had Sir
John Manvers headed the enemy, and Lyle, in that
case, would have urged a death-blow without hesi-
tation.
Steadily, although the ground was more broken at
every step, the British infantry pursued their march ;
slowly after them moved the cavalry and guns.
See,” exclaimed Madame Vander Roey, who no
longer needed a telescope, “they march still, but
there is some stir among them. The tall man on the
skimmel (sorrel) horse is flying backwards and for-
wards from the ranks to the General, from the General

to the ranks, and now he gallops to the rear with
orders; the artillery halt again, and the skimmel
rider dashes back in spite of stones and stunted
bush.”
The troops suddenly halted, their bayonets glittered
in the morning sun as they changed their position,
and they paused for an instant within gun-range of
both ridges.
This was the moment Vander Roey had anticipated;
piles of loose stones still lay between the two divi-
sions of the British forces; the ground was scarcely
practicable for cavalry or artillery. At this juncture
the rebel chief turned to the rugged valley in the rear,
and lifting his hat from his feet, waved it three times.
Five hundred rebels started
up
from
among
the reeds
and rushes of the river, from behind the great stones,
and from the natural caverns at the base of the hills.
In rear of the left battery sprung up a hundred others.
The summit of each ridge was carefully manned with
the deserters, some from the artillery, some from the
line, all armed with roers; and mingled with these
were many traders and wandering thieves.
Sir Adrian's consultation with the old soldiers of
the Ninety —th had caused him first to
pause,
and
next to alter his movement. These experienced fel-
lows had detected first the muzzle of Gray's six-
pounder, next a Boer's hat, which, albeit nearly the
colour of the stone near which the head leaned, was
easily discerned by accustomed eyes. These two
indications were quite sufficient to point out the real
position of the rebels, and Sir Adrian changed his
route accordingly.
“Sit there till I come for you," said Vander Roey
to his wife, taking her by the arm, and placing her
in a hollow some feet below the rampart, with a gun
above her; he leaned over her, placed his hand on her
shoulder, looked sorrowfully into her face, and uttering
in a tender tone the words “ Poor wife, poor wife!”

men.
of the ridge, and galloped to the front of the rebel
band.
Some of the Boers, like Vander Roey, were mounted,
but many were on foot. The latter were speedily and
silently formed into parties commanded by the horse-
Each division was still screened by the ridge,
and Vander Roey's plan was to rush out upon the
enemy when he should have begun to mount the
acclivity. The larger division of the British troops
remained halted, and it was plain that Sir Adrian had
no idea of the strength of the rebel forces.
But the General learned his mistake soon enough.
Scarcely had the infantry advanced many paces up the
steep and rugged hills, ere, with a shout of defiance,
the rebel Dutch dashed out from their ambush. The
road between the ridges was narrow.
Horse and
foot made a simultaneous charge, and pouring the
fire from their long roers right and left with unerring
aim, laid many a gallant fellow low.
Staggered at the unexpected appearance of five
hundred men in a body, uncertain too of the numbers
concealed behind the formidable rampart above, the
infantry drew back. Sir Adrian galloped forward, a
bullet took the peak from his forage-cap, he met
the retiring infantry: he saw the madness of attempt-
ing to charge on such ground, and gave orders to
retreat beyond gun-range till the artillery should come
up, and be put in position.
Lyle laughed aloud.
The Boers, having expended their fire, retired be-
fore the infantry had time to return it with any kind
of precision; five of the Dutch, however, lay stretched
in their blood, and many came back wounded.
The scene now, with the exception of the dead and
wounded scattered about, presented the same appear-
ance as at first-the British troops forming for the
advance, the ridges silent, and apparently unpeopled.
Madame Vander Roey, implicitly obedient to her
husband's orders, sat where he had placed her, and

with eyes of stone watched the sharp angle at the
base of the ridge. The Boers came back in masses.
She saw not Vander Roey; he was the very last, and
then he turned and fired a parting shot at one gallant
soldier who had lingered in rear of his company, and
who paid the penalty of his imprudence--the roer's
bullet laid him dead among the rocks.
Having thus crippled the infantry, a great point
was gained, for foot soldiers were the only people who
could work in such a position; and as for the artillery,
the ground was equally against that, or cavalry, follow-
ing up what it might begin. So thought the Dutch;
“but," thought Lyle and Gray and some twenty
others," they have never seen rocket practice !"
“How dd passive that fellow Gray looks,"
said Lyle to Brennard, as the latter, during the awful
pause, held a parley with his colleague.
“I never could make him out," replied Brennard,
indifferently. “I think the fellow is half a fool.”
“He is no knave, certainly,” said Lyle, contemptu-
ously.
The British force now began to move in that deter-
mined way which proved it was in earnest, and having
reached the points whence the artillery could work
against the enemy, again halted.
Lyle saw that the humane Sir Adrian was still
awaiting a signal for peace, and what was his horror,
his rage, when he saw Gray rise from his kneeling
position, and leap on the rough parapet before him.
There stood the young deserter, unarmed, erect,
motionless, undaunted.
Then Lyle, furious beyond control, raised his rifle,
and fired; the ball struck the poor youth, who fell
forward, and rolled down the face of the ridge into a
rocky hollow, his blood marking his descent.
“Frankfort," said Sir Adrian, "what can be the
meaning of that?”
“I cannot tell, Sir," replied Major Frankfort ; "the
man who so suddenly rose to our view was either a

coward and panic-stricken, or a traitor to the cause he
has enlisted in."
I rather think,” said Sir Adrian," he is some poor
victim enlisted against his will, who chose to die rather
than fight against us. He must have been sure that
either we or his own party would have shot him after
such a manoeuvre.”
And then, too much occupied to give a second
thought to the unfortunate young man, Sir Adrian
proceeded to inspect his force.
But Lyle's shot was received by Brennard as a
signal, and forthwith he poured forth a volley from his
flank. That to the left of the troops, and the right of
the Boers, followed his example ; but they miscalcu-
lated their distance, and did little mischief; it was
returned, however, by a hearty salute of grape-shot,
which, however, did little harm among the Dutch.
Screened from their opponents, they affected to treat
it with contempt, and Vander Roey, having dis-
mounted and joined the line above, took off his hat,
and gave an exulting cheer.
Then Lyle, and the gunners under him, made the
great gun roar, as Lynx and Frolic described it, sit-
ting at their mistress's feet, and laughing impishly at
the deadly game playing before them.
A sharp tongue of flame, and then a great volume
of smoke, burst from a gap in the ridge, and the ball,
moving swiftly through the air, fell into the very centre
of the troops, and made a vacant space, where it burst.
The broken ground, the masked battery, the un-
counted enemy, all were forgotten in the moment of
indignation which followed this assault. Sir Adrian
waved his cap, and advanced with his staff, but not
too rapidly, giving time for the guns to work their
way. The infantry proceeded in extended order.
Another tongue of flame, another volume of smoke,
threatened more mischief; but at this the force quick-
ened its pace marvellously, and the ball fell harmlessly
in the rear.

* Down the Trongate, my boys!" shouted an old
grenadier of the Ninety-th-the regiment was com-
posed chiefly of Renfrewshire-men—" down the Tron-
gate!"* and away went the brave fellows over the
rocky plain as steadily as though moving at the double
along the peaceful streets of the old town of Glasgow
This experienced little body of tried men, led by a
cool-headed officer, were directed to their extreme left,
where, it will be remembered, Lyle had placed a small
party, which, by affecting concealment, was to divert
the attention of the troops. In rear of this, it will
also be remembered, was a gun fixed in the narrow
jaws of a gorge. If a passage could be made over this
ridge into the gorge, the gun, which was immovably
fixed in the rocks, could be brought to bear upon the
rebels themselves.
On the first grand movement of the troops, this
smaller rampart was abandoned to a very small force,
and as there were no guns to spare, was defended by
roers and rifles. British soldiers, however, were not
to be daunted even by these unerring weapons; un-
encumbered by their knapsacks, in lieu of which Sir
Adrian had ordered them to substitute light havresacks,
they persevered in spite of the dropping fire which
slightly thinned their ranks, and gradually working
their way through the stones and scrub, took posses-
sion of the rossjies (ridge), and speedily dislodging
the besieged, scrambled down towards the gorge, and
poured such a volley of musketry into it, as made the
poor defenders of the pass cast their arms from them,
and
cry
aloud for quarter.
The gun was instantly taken in hand, and, not without
difficulty, brought to bear upon the right flank of the
rebels in the rear, several of the Boers being detained
in the gorge by the guard of the Ninety-th, who

knew that, without this precaution, the roers and
rifles above would
pour
their fire upon them.
Lyle, standing in the bend of the rossjies, saw by
this maneuvre of the old soldiers that all chance of
defence was lost, and at once rushed towards Vander
Roey, and advised him to meet the forces on the
plain.
The manæuvre would have answered, had the Boers
been organized for battle face to face with the foe;
but the plan of operations had been to begin on the
defensive, and retire behind a succession of these
rossjies, till they reached a river impassable save at
a ford difficult to pass except by practised men.
It was not long before Madame Vander Roey
found herself the only tenant of the stony hill; the
battery was deserted, but below were ranged a party
of Boers, who, contriving to keep out of sight of the
soldiers in the gorge, stepped out one by one, and,
taking aim with sad precision, shot several. This in-
solence the Ninety--th attempted to return by firing
the gun, but the ball fell innocently among the stones
in the valley.
Again a Boer advanced, and lifted his roer—it was
Hermanus the stutterer, one of the most deter-
mined—but this time the soldiers were beforehand
with him ; ere he had time to lift his roer, he was
stretched bleeding on the stones.
Madame Vander Roey watched the action from the
very edge of the parapet.
Á mid the din, the smoke, the groans of dying men
and horses--a strange adjunct in that picture of strife
and agony—was the figure of the rebel's wife; her
long skirt falling far below her feet over the rocks,
giving her the appearance of supernatural height,
her head uncovered, and all her sable tresses streaming
in the wind.

Many a stout heart quailed at first view of this
singular apparition, as the sun, opening his crimson
chambers behind it, threw out the tall form in bold
relief between the rocks and sky.
On either side of her were crouched her impish
pages, Lynx and Frolic, immovable and unappalled,
as she was apparently.
But, ah! that woman's heart was beating as her
eyes followed the plumed hat, which towered above
the rest, and was always foremost.
The Boers had now all dismounted, and were fight-
ing hand to hand, muzzle to muzzle, with the troops.
Even the guns could not work, for the artillerymen
had been the first to fall, and the rockets had had no
opportunity for use.

But there is a lull in the strife; Madame Vander
Roey sees her husband fall—he is seized, not by the
enemy—but Brennard flings the wounded chief across
his swift steed, mounts it, and, with his burden bleed-
ing before him, gallops furiously to the rear.
“Vander Roey has fled !-has fled !-has fled !”
passes from mouth to mouth among the rebel ranks-
they break asunder, fall into disorder, and retreat. In
vain Lyle attempts to rally them—he sees that he must
run like the rest, or fall into the hands of a go-
vernor from whom he must expect justice rather than
mercy.
But he is cool, as usual, selects the swiftest horse
at hand, gallops a few paces through a shower of
bullets, turns, faces the troops, takes aim with his
rifle, and brings down the man next Frankfort-he
marked this « fellow on the staff” for his
prey-
again retreats-again pauses between the ridges to
fire, and finally dashes like lightning beyond the
range of the gun in the gorge.
The poor rebels, caught in that trap, became at once
prisoners of war; they surrendered unconditionally,
and were sent to the rear with the wounded.

The British troops pursue, the guns are limbered
up, and dragged through the rocky pass; the Boers
succeed in crossing first_the stream, and next the
stony neck beyond, and Lyle again posts a strong
line of defence along another natural rampart; but
Sir Adrian is better prepared now for the attack.
A long streak of light shoots upward from the
river's brink, and, breaking far forward towards the
sky into a thousand golden drops, falls among the
fugitives, scattering them apart, and strewing the
rough ground with bleeding corpses !
Madame Vander Roey had turned to watch the
retreat of her husband; she tried to descend the ridge,
but her heart sickened and her limbs failed her; she
sunk, terror-stricken and shocked, upon the stone
where her husband had bid her wait for him.
She was found there that afternoon. Lynx and
Frolic brought some old soldiers of the Ninety--th
up the slope ; they spoke in Dutch, and begged her to
go with them to the wagons in the rear; but she told
them her husband had bid her wait for him there.
But he never came; the kind soldiers brought her
provisions, but she would accept nothing at their
hands.
She sat there through the day, still watching the
combatants, as the English pursued the Dutch from
ridge to ridge.
The sun went down amid the vapours that rose
from the conflict; night fell moody and dark; the
din of battle was succeeded by the whistling of the
wind through the rocky passes; the sleet began to
drive; the dress of the miserable watcher was satu-
rated with damp, but she was reckless of bodily
discomfort. The mind, for many months wound up
to a pitch beyond its powers, gave way,
s started
aside like a broken bow," and, helpless and “infirm of
purpose," she continued to keep the vigil till nature
was exhausted, and she fell insensible upon the cold
earth.

She awoke to consciousness under the kind hands
of an English surgeon ; she was lying on a couch in
a comfortable marquee, Anne Vanbloem and Amayeka
were watching beside her-a baby slept on Anne's
lap-Amayeka, mournful but very quiet, sat sewing at
the opening of the tent. Madame Vander Roey
could see far out upon the plain; she pressed her hand
to her eyes, looked again, collected her scattered
memories, and recognized the position of a former
bivouac; it was occupied now by the tents and
wagons of the English. Soldiers were lying on the
ground, or passing to and fro, or engaged in merry
games, or singing beside the scanty fires. The air
came in cold, but dry and balmy; it gave her strength
to rise and look around, and to question Anne.
And then she learned that Vander Roey was
dead.
She waited many minutes before she uttered any
remark, and then she said-
“Did they take him prisoner ?”
No," replied Madame Vanbloem; "he died of
his wounds among his own people.”
“It is well !” said the widow, and, turning her
face from the light, she never spoke again.

CHAPTER XX.
Τ Η Ε GENERA L.
From the head-quarters of Sir Adrian Fairfax, I
must transport you, my reader, to one of the most
lonely and romantic districts in Southern Africa, where
Sir John Manvers, with the second division of the
army, had pitched his camp. Stretching in a south-
easterly direction rose the green Chumie Mountains,
their verdure contrasted occasionally with bold gray
columns of rock; beyond these again, the Amatolas
blended their purple heights with the roseate clouds ;
northward, the Winterberg range formed a barrier
between the colony and Tambookieland, where dwelt
the “royal race” of the Kafirs, and, towering to the
sky like a gigantic elephant, with a howdah on its
back, the Great Winterberg, nine thousand feet high,
lifted its lofty head, crowned with a diadem of snow.
On a fair green plain, the clear stream of the Kat
running through the midst, were ranged with beau-
tiful precision the white tents of the little army, which
had been at first employed against the Kafir warriors,
and afterwards held in reserve, lest the Dutch should
rally in their strongholds. But Vander Roey's fate
had been the death-blow to all further opposition for
the present, and the troops were only waiting Sir
Adrian's return from the Orange River to disperse,
provided the aspect of affairs was peaceful.
It promised to be so, for the Kafirs were consider-
ably dismayed at the news of the severe loss the Boers
had suffered, in spite of their unerring roers and
strong position, and now promised submission with
the meekness of the dove and the wiliness of the
serpent !

JASPER LYLE:
Sir Adrian's detention arose from delay in diplo-
matic measures. Several prisoners_were yet to be
disposed of. The principal traitor, Lyle, still eluded
discovery, but a price was set upon his head.
On the outskirts of this encampment, just where
the bright waters of the Kat River and the Mancazana
meet, were scattered over a few acres of ground some
temporary dwellings. Simple and rudely fashioned
as they were, these thatched tenements looked exceed-
ingly picturesque among the natural groves over-
shadowing them. The walls were whitewashed, the
little windows neatly glazed, and the verandahed
fronts were gracefully wreathed with the wild creepers
that grew about in profusion.
These dwellings, albeit not quite proof against the
storms that often sweep in terrific grandeur through
this lovely region, were comparatively luxurious, con-
trasted with the poor shelter of the tent or marquee,
and one, divided far apart from the rest by a banquette
of earth, would have made apparently a sufficiently
pleasant summer dwelling in England.
Mr. Daveney finding it impracticable to reach the
lower districts in safety, and earnestly requested by
Sir Adrian Fairfax to accept an appointment of trust
and responsibility, if only for a time, had taken
up
his
abode here. The whole fabric had been run up
within six weeks, despite untoward weather; a few
days of sunshine made the little habitation of wattle,
clay, thatch, and whitewash fit for the reception of his
family. The ladies occupied one bed-room, a small
office served the Commissioner—for such was Mr.
Daveney's new appointment-for a reception and sleep-
ing apartment. The common sitting-room opened
as usual from the verandah, and the simple cookery
was carried on by the old Malay in the hollow of a tall
rock, backing the premises. A couple of tents added
materially to the accommodation and comfort of the
tenement.
The intense anxiety of Eleanor's mind had produced

a low fever, which kept the unfortunate young crea-
ture on her couch-wasted to a shadow, she lay
beneath a little casement, her only rest snatches of
fitful sleep, her only enjoyment the fresh air, that
brought sweet odours with it from the heath-clad hills.
Her mother and sister watched day and night by turns
beside her. The Trails were again their neighbours,
and were a great solace to the afflicted invalid.
“ It is a sad strait for one so young to come to,"
said Eleanor to Mr. Trail one day, “to wish to die.”
“Sad, indeed,” replied the good missionary; "sad,
because so sinful.”
“Ah, me!” said the sufferer, “this suspense is
killing me-is it not natural that I should long to be
where the tears will be wiped from off all faces ?”
“ Patience, Eleanor, patience,” whispered Mr. Trail.
“God has his own means of bestowing happiness;
you have been sorely tried, my poor child ; but you
are young, a long future may lie before you.
And the invalid lifted up her large luminous eyes
to Heaven with the most hopeless expression of
despair.
Hark! horses are galloping past the dwelling-the
rattle of accoutrements announces that soldiers are
on their way. They soon go by; there are but few-
it must be an express.
And the question passes along the tented line, “Is
Lee taken ??
“Not yet; but the dispatches from Sir Adrian relate
that a clue is obtained to his discovery."
In a word, Hermanus the stutterer, who, rebel as he
was, hated English traitors, succeeded in persuading
his comrades that Lee and Brennard had never had
any view but self-aggrandisement. It was therefore
resolved in council to purchase their own pardon by
delivering up the trader and the convict. Poor Gray
had been carried off with the wounded to the hospital
tent, and found to be seriously, though not mortally,
hurt. He had not an enemy among the Boers; but it

was proved that he had consented to serve a gun,
and despite the decided step he had taken to avoid
firing upon his countrymen, there was no evidence to
show whether the act was the result of panic, or
repentance.
He was, however, not to be condemned without a
further hearing, when more evidence could be collected,
and was sent to Sir John Manvers’s division, with
other convalescents, after the action.
Perfectly passive and resigned to his impending
fate, the young deserter met with compassion and
solace at the kind hands of Mr. Trail, who obtained
permission to lodge him in his own little dwelling.
Gray was, however, ironed whenever he passed the
threshold; but, in spite of his bonds, the poor lad
confessed himself happier than he had been for years.
Marion and Ormsby were, as in happier times,
sitting, side by side, under the willows that bent over
the rushing waters of the two rivers. They were not
many paces from the house, and hearing the tramp of
horses' feet, hastened to learn the news brought by the
express.
As they passed Mr. Trail’s cottage, they saw Gray
walking up and down, as he was permitted to do at
certain hours of the day, between two sentries.
Marion shuddered at sight of the manacled limbs of
this slight, handsome, and frank-hearted looking youth.
He had been the associate of Lyle! She was turning
from him with a feeling of dislike, when his poor
attempt to salute her with his fettered hands disarmed
the sentiment and filled her heart with pity.
She passed on with her lover, and on entering the
house, they learned from Mrs. Daveney that the
express had brought private letters from Sir Adrian
to Sir John Manvers and Mr. Daveney.
The latter was at this moment sent for by the
General commanding the division.
Sir John Manvers's marquee stood in the centre
of the canvas city,” distinguished from all similar

habitations by its superior size and the greater space
of ground allotted to it. The marquee was closed, two
sentinels were pacing silently up and down before it ;
the still aspect of the domicile strongly contrasted
with the life and stir of the encampment, which, as
usual in hours of peace, presented an agreeable and
busy scene.
The afternoon sun shone brightly on the gleaming
waters of the winding river, groups of soldiers dotted
its banks, some sitting, talking quietly together, some
wrestling, some running, some cutting wood to re-
plenish the cooking fires. Among these were inter-
mingled the dusky forms of Kafir men and women,
the latter with long bundles of sticks, accurately
poised on their heads, which they had brought to ex-
change for tobacco, or money where it could be got.
Intermingled with these scattered and motley groups
might be seen the tall, manly form of the young Eng-
lish settler, the diminutive shape of the lithe-limbed
Hottentot, the swarthy Griqua, and the grave Dutch
colonist, and collected in knots, or walking apart in
twos and threes, in grave communion, were the Officers
of the division.
I have spoken of this division as a little army ; in
truth, it might so be called, for on either side, parted
from the encampment by a little wilderness of mimosas,
were the lagers and bivouacs of the native levies, in all
amounting with the regular troops to 3,000 men, who
were waiting the decision of Sir Adrian Fairfax to be
disbanded.
Daveney walked through the encampment, neither
looking to the right nor the left, but not unobserved
by the officers, who, heartily tired of the inaetivity
without the excitement of the field, were longing to
return to quarters, and anxiously looked for news of
all descriptions.
The General, Sir John Manvers, was not popular
with those he commanded. Cold, abstracted, haughty,
self-opinionated, he was a striking evidence of that mis-

JASPER LYLE:
But a very
chievous system of interest, which, like a destructive
insect in a noble structure, injures and often destroys
the whole.
Sir John had been appointed commander of the
forces in Southern Africa and temporary governor, not
because he had served his country, not because his
judgment, his experience, his temper, or his principles
fitted him for the deep responsibility he assumed, but
because he was the brother-in-law of a man who had
long held sway in the House of Commons, and whose
silence or vote could determine a question of vital
importance to certain landed proprietors of rank and
power.
Sir John was provided for, and the bill was passed.
short
essay
in the management of affairs
served to prove that the General was not the diplo-
matist for the Cape colony, with its extraordinary
mixture of tribes, its extended and complicated inter-
ests, its untried population, its vague lines of demar-
cation between the varied races occupying the pasture-
grounds; and on the first substantial information of the
prospect of a war, one member of the Ministry fortu-
nately recollected that a former one had proved expen-
sive, and that Sir Adrian Fairfax had been the man
who succeeded in bringing it to a close. But Sir
John Manvers could not be dismissed without a
saving clause in the document that gave him his congé;
by this clause he was offered a more agreeable and more
lucrative government in a less troublesome country.
With this arrangement he was perfectly satisfied.
Thus it was desirable for all parties to bring the
warfare to a close; but Sir Adrian was a conscientious
man, who did the duty he was paid to do, and would
not hurry over proceedings involving great results.
Sir John Manvers was chafed at the delay, and angry
because Sir Adrian would not take himself the office
of Governor, and thus relieve the former from his
duties. With a delicacy as graceful as it was politic,
Sir Adrian delayed his installation as Governor till

369
peace should be proclaimed, contenting himself with
the command of the principal division of the army.
But, on hearing from Mr. Daveney that Lyle was
one of the principal instigators to mischief, he deeply
regretted the arrangement he had made. It was,
however, too late to alter his plan without compro-
mising his character for consistency.
On looking through the list of killed appended to
the humble memorial of the conquered Boers, it must
be owned that a feeling of disappointment arose in
the breast of the General, all humane as he was, and
he could not conceal his uneasiness from his secretary,
Frankfort, when he was officially informed of Lyle's
whereabouts, and of the convict's intention to rally the
Boers, and cause further trouble to the Government.
But Daveney is wending his way across the camp
ground to Sir John Manvers's marquee.
He held in his hand a letter, which he was requested
by Sir Adrian to place in Sir John's hands, when the
latter should have been duly prepared for its recep-
tion. Sir Adrian felt that the Commissioner was one
of the few men in the world whom he could trust
with the unthankful task.
Sir John Manvers bowed coldly on the entrance of
Daveney, and pointing to an open note before him,
said, in a tone of vexation, " That note is from Sir
Adrian Fairfax; I confess its contents are beyond my
comprehension, and I am utterly at a loss to know, ,
sir, why my friend has thought it necessary to make
you the medium of communication to me, instead of
addressing me'on a point which he chooses to invest
with mystery."
Sir John Manvers had been accustomed to see men
bend at once to his haughty, imperious manner; but
this was not the case now. Daveney bowed with due
deference to the General, but the mild blue eye
good friend expressed sincere compassion for the man,
as he replied, “I grieve indeed, sir, to be made the
medium of communication on a subject which will cause
of our

JASPER LYLE:
you not only surprise, but unmitigated pain. Sir, I
must beg you to be prepared for exceedingly unwel-
come intelligence."
The last words were uttered less blandly than at
first, for the proud General sat with his arms folded
and wrath darkening his brow, as the Commissioner
stood before him ; but the latter was too kind at heart
to be overcome by the arrogant bearing of one who
he knew must suffer bitterly ere they parted, and
checking the indignation incident on Sir John's arro-
gant bearing, he said gently, “I admit that I am in
your eyes, sir, unduly honoured; but Sir Adrian Fair-
fax is my friend as well as yours, and he has chosen
that I should impart to you personally what he dreads
to write."
Dread, sir! what do you mean? Speak out; what
is there that you can tell me to make me shrink from
hearing it?" and the stern man rose and stood up
with an air of defiance and contempt, as his eyes
gleamed from beneath his bent brows upon the kind
countenance of the Commissioner. “Speak, sir !” he
continued, “I command
you.”
“ This communication, replied Daveney, quietly,
placing Sir Adrian's letter on the table, “is private,
as you perceive; this,” laying a larger document before
the General,“ is official. In the last, Sir Adrian in-
forms you, that a man of the name of Lee has been,
with one or two others, the chief confederate of the
rebel chief Vander Roey, has assisted the Boers in
every way by facilitating the trade in gunpowder, and
is now on his way to the Singpoo River, where he
purposes establishing a settlement, and defying the
laws of the colonial government-
Here the Commissioner paused.
“Well, sir!” said Sir John; "and again I desire to
know why this communication is not forwarded to me
directly, instead of through you."
“Sir," replied Daveney, "I had imagined that my
name was not altogether unknown to you.?? A sud-

den flush suffused even the bald forehead of the
General; but he recovered himself instantly, and coldly
remarked, “I had not forgotten it, but you will ex-
cuse my saying that the reminiscence is not agreeable
to me, and expressing at the same time my perplexity
at your referring to private matters when employed
very strangely, it seems to me--on official business
you must excuse my requesting you to speak to the
purpose for which
you came.
“The real name of the offender,” replied the Com-
missioner, “ is communicated in the private letter;
he is a convict, who was supposed to have been wrecked
in the Trafalgar, but who was wonderfully saved with
the deserter Gray, and succeeded in reaching the
Amaponda country, spent some months among Um-
lala's people, encouraging them in sedition, trafficking
in brandy and gunpowder, and at last made his way
to Vander Roey to fan the flame of rebellion among
the Dutch."
Mr. Daveney had summoned resolution to convey
the above intelligence with perfect calmness, and as
he spoke he clearly perceived the inward working of
the heart he probed, despite the struggle against the
display of outward suffering.
As he referred to the private letter,” Sir John
Manvers reseated himself, but forbore to take up
the
document, although his hand was impulsively stretched
out to take it. At the mention of the wreck of the
Trafalgar, the handsome face of the proud General was
again deeply suffused—the flush passed away, leaving
a livid ring round the eyes and mouth, and when the
Commissioner ceased to speak, the countenance before
him, with its ashy lips and stony orbs, more resembled
that of a corpse than a living being.
The stern man moved his head with the rigidity of
a figure worked by springs—he waved his hand, indi-
cating a wish to be left alone, but Daveney did not
stir. Hat in hand, he still stood contemplating with
an air of earnest sympathy the unfortunate Sir John

JASPER LYLE:
Manvers--the father of Jasper Lyle—the convict-the
rebel the doomed traitor!
Several minutes elapsed, mind and body seemed
equally prostrated; but Sir John's senses had not for-
saken him, he had still the capacity to suffer. His
right hand lay fixed as marble on the table beside the
fatal letter, the nails were blue from the stagnant
blood within, his chest heaved with stifled sighs, the
stony orbs grew bloodshot, the ghastly features were
convulsed.
He fought manfully, desperately, against nature,
and conquered. He rose, and trembling violently,
Daveney was prepared to see him fall; but although
he tottered, he kept his ground.
Still he could not speak. A watch ticking on the
camp-table sounded like Time passing with a heavy
tread; the din of the camp was but a murmur in the
distance, but it seemed strangely distinct. So did the
sentry's foot on the grass. How close he was; a
canvas screen only separated the suffering General
from the careless happy soldier. A chorus rose clear
and joyous from the banks of the river, and laughter,
shrill and boisterous, pierced the air.
All these accustomed sounds now jarred harshly on
the Commissioner's ear, as before him stood the stern,
cold, haughty man, suddenly assailed by trouble, his
pride tottering in the dust. He, the centre of this
busy crowd, had not a friend to whom he could turn
for support or consolation. In the kind Daveney's
breast he might have met with sympathy, but his was
a nature which resented pity. Again he bade the Com-
missioner depart, and the latter, regretful and anxious,
retired, leaving the unhappy man to the solitude of
his marquee.
*
*
The sun was setting, the camp-ground was dotted
with fires, the games were over, but the laughter and
the
song continued as the soldiers lounged over their
evening meal. The herd-boys were driving the flocks

and cattle over the heathy uplands, and Marion,
Ormsby, and Mr. Trail stood at the rude gate of the
new-made garden, watching the Commissioner's ap-
proach from the lines.
He was so intent on what had passed between the
General and himself, that he forgot to ask the usual
question, “How is my darling ?” but he was reminded
of her by Marion telling him that her sister had fallen
into a deep and quiet sleep, and that the medical
attendant foretold improvement from the moisture
which already bedewed her tense brow and wasted
hands.
At midnight Daveney looked forth upon the hushed
camp-ground. The stillness was only broken by the
occasional challenge between the watchful sentinels,
and but one light burnt strong and clear in the vast
and tented field; it was in the General's marquee.
Before daybreak the Commissioner, accompanied by
Mr. Trail, and followed by May, reconnoitred the
location in which he had placed his dwelling. Perfect
silence reigned throughout, but still that light shone
steadily.
Oh! to have lifted the canvassed screen of that
pavilion, and seen therein a strong man and a
proud, pacing, pacing, to and fro, to and fro, with
arms tightly folded across his chest, striving to stifle
the emotions which rose and fell like a heavy tide, as
his thoughts dragged him back, and forced him to look
upon the wasted, the irredeemable past !
And the laughing sun came forth from his gorgeous
eastern throne, and poured his beams alike upon the
sleeping soldier and the waking General, and it mocked
the light of the poor lamp even as the things of heaven
mock
all things of earth!
Both the public and the private despatch from Sir
Adrian Fairfax to Sir John Manvers lay open on the
camp-table.
The first simply contained the official information
respecting Lee; the second was as follows:

JASPER LYLE:
“My dear SIR JOHN,—
“I have requested my good friend Daveney, the
present Commissioner for the Gaika tribes, to prepare
you for intelligence which it gives me unmitigated
pain to write. My resolution not to accept the post of
Governor till my work here was done was founded on
the best principles ; but I regret it now for your sake,
since as you will have learned, before opening this,
the man Lee, named in my official despatch, 16th
May, 18—, is no other than Jasper Lyle. At present
his identity is known only to the Daveneys, their
immediate friends, and myself, and I see no way of
your avoiding personal contact or correspondence
with him, unless you resolve to throw over publicly
the reins of government to me. Would to heaven,
my dear friend, that this man had perished among the
unfortunate passengers of the Trafalgar, or that he
had fallen in the encounter with the Dutch at the
stony ridges! My chief desire now is to hear that he
has got clear into the upper districts; but unhappily
he has made enemies among the people he affects to
assist, and I am told they are determined to yield him
up to me. In such a case, as a soldier, you know I
have no alternative.
"In a word, my dear Sir John, my mind would be
greatly relieved at hearing that either you or he had
quitted the colony. Pardon language that appears
uncourteous; my pen fails in expressing as it ought
all that I feel, all that I am ready to do in any way
in which I may serve you at this lamentable crisis.
“ With great regard, and assuring you of my earnest
regret at this unfortunate and unlooked-for result of
the late action against the misguided Boers,
“I beg you to believe me most truly yours,

" So so
friends, and myself !” Sir John Manvers stopped
from time to time in his circumscribed walk, and read
· and re-read these odious and degrading words fre-
quently during the night, and as the sun poured his
beams athwart the sickly lamp, he held the letter to
the flame, and finally casting the blackened paper to
the ground, crushed the ashes beneath his boot.
- I am a gazing-stock for the Daveneys and
their immediate friends,—that soft-voiced, cautious
missionary, that idler Ormsby, that Frankfort, who
writes such d--d laconic memoranda, that are in
reality orders! I am a mark for bad men's scorn and
good men's pity. Good men! What constitutes a
good man ? Is he one whom the devil has not been
permitted to tempt?-permitted to tempt, mark
that!
“ That one fatal error of my life. Was it my mis-
fortune or my crime that the citadel of
my
heart was
weak, and that I could not drive out the Tempter, who
had been permitted to besiege and enter it ?
“I am utterly confounded—which way shall I turn ?
There seems but one remedy."
He took up a pistol which lay, loaded only with
powder, on the table. With this he was wont to
summon his valet, who occupied a tent too distant to
distinguish any other call.
Had it been loaded with ball, he might have lifted it
to his head. He cast it impatiently from him; the
trigger caught in his watch-chain, and the weapon
went off. The valet, who stood with his master's
coffee at hand, entered the marquee almost immedi-
ately.
The General instinctively turned his back upon his
servant; the latter, accustomed to execute his duties
without observation and without thanks, placed the
little tray, with its small silver service, on the table,
and stood waiting further orders.
“ You may go,” said the General, in his usual voice ;:
and the valet retired.

JASPER LYLE :
It is indeed strange how a mind torn for hours by
conflicting emotions can in a moment, when pressed
by necessity, bring itself to act in the most trifling
occurrences of life; reaction once produced, the brain
partially recovers its tone.
The morning light, the sound of the stirring réveillée,
its bugle echoes answering each other from kloof to
kloof, the rattle of accoutrements, and the roll of the
martial drums, with their shrill accompaniments, the
fifes, awoke the little world around.
Day is well represented as scattering roses in her
path, for she brings much comfort to the wretched,
whose wretchedness is not all of their own making.
Amid the multitude who wake to the sunlight,
some kind hand may be stretched out to those who
suffer. Hope is ever moving among the crowd, but
her mirror, remember, turns its bright face only to the
repentant—the truly repentant—to those who lift up
their hearts to an offended God, and pray that they
may sin no more. Those who suffer remorse, and
dread only the world's contempt, have no part in the
bright promises of Hope ; and all the freshness and the
fragrance that life offers to the humbly sorrowful falls
to dust and ashes before the breath of pride, which
trembles before man, but seeks to defy the very
laws
divine.
Yes; Sir John Manvers repented him truly of his
former sin, not because he feared God, but because he
dreaded man's scorn and pity.
Reader, do we not see this day by day?
Sir John Manvers's destruction of Sir Adrian Fair-
fax's letter was perfectly characteristic of the man. It
was a written record against him, therefore it should
perish; and could he have seen all those who were
initiated in his secret perish likewise, he would have
gone forth to the world apparently unmoved, or with
satisfaction so predominant as to smother all remorse-
ful sentiments.
Still they did not know all.

The real secret lay dormant in a little dark nook in
one of the remotest corners of Cornwall, and was in-
scribed in letters, now somewhat browned by time, in
a huge old volume, a parish register, kept as securely
as if the clergyman's whole welfare depended on the
safety of its contents, in a dim oak-wainscoted vestry-
room of a dilapidated church.
In a leaf of that register might be read these
words, among the
“Marriages solemnized in the parish of G---, county
of Cornwall.
“ John Lyle and Mary L-, residing at G
“ In the

of
us,
&c. &c."
By this time, dear reader, you will have given up all
hopes of learning the early part of Sir John Manvers’s
history from himself. He was not the man to indite
a record of his sin, or “ folly," as he would probably
have termed it, even to his friend Sir Adrian Fairfax.
I shall therefore relate as succinctly as possible those
events connected with his opening career which influ-
enced him through life, and finally brought him to the
strait in which he stands so miserably before you.
His first prospects were uncheering. His father
held a small curacy in Devonshire, and the circum-
stance of this poor curate marrying the daughter of a
baronet, in whose household be held the appointment
of chaplain, instead of leading to prosperous results,
was the means of impeding his progress in the Church.
The union was cursed with the deep and undying
resentment of the lady's father, and the poor curate
struggled on till the grave gave him that rest which
earth had denied the living.
The wife he had chosen was not worthy of him. She
had married him from pique, and when he felt the
world's frowns most keenly, she told him so. But she
did not often remind him of the wrong she had“ done

herself.” Cold, sullen, impatient of misfortune, and
angry with him, whose fault had been in loving her
too well, she nursed her wrath in silence.
But it was
stamped upon her haughty brow, her dilated nostril,
her curled lip. She lived upon it! She looked upon
the whole world as her enemy; but the world did not
think her worth quarrelling with-some called her
“poor Mrs. Lyle."
“ Poor Mrs. Lyle! Who made me so ?" she would
say; and then, because her Christian husband met her
scorn without retort, she would utter some bitter
word, indicative of contempt, and relapse again into
gloom.
But the iron entered into his soul. He died, leav-
ing her with a son, who had little knowledge of his
father, save that his mother spoke of him as the
author of all her misfortunes.
The child did not understand this. All he could
recollect of his father was the good man's deathbed-
the thin hands held out to wife and child—and pale
lips parting, and blessing them that had mocked him ;
for the boy had been taught to laugh his father to
An elder brother allowed Mrs. Lyle a small annuity.
She accepted it, grumbling, because it was scanty; but
the baronetcy was not rich, and the brother did more
for the sister than she deserved, for she had always
been ungracious.
Her son, although he resembled her, was not happy
in her society; he was glad when he went to school,
and he found companions there who drew out his better
qualities; at sixteen his uncle desired that he should
be sent as a private pupil to a clergyman; at seven-
teen he lost his mother; and at twenty, his uncle being
also dead, he found himself without a profession, and
with two thousand pounds, a remnant of his mother's
fortune, for patrimony.
One being in the world loved this proud and gloomy
boy--she was the daughter of the Cornish clergyman

whose pupil he had been. She was not beautiful, but
there was a graceful gaiety about her which relieved
him from himself. The principles of this poor mother-
less creature were not what her father imagined them
to be; indeed, he was too learned to have much know-
ledge of human nature ; but when he discovered the
result of Lyle's intimacy with his daughter, the old
man’s grief and terror were overwhelming.
The sight of those white hairs bent to the dust with
shame and sorrow, was more than Lyle could bear-
he, who had never known the strength of a parent's
love, was overcome. He married his victim-married
her on her death-bed : for, five hours afterwards he
was a widower, and the father of a son—the convict,
Jasper Lyle.
The poor old clergyman wrote the record himself in
the parish register, and died the day after. By one
of those fatalities which for a time are permitted to
arrest the course of truth's clear stream, the medical
attendant and the nurse, who were the only people
present at this melancholy bridal, were laid together in
the narrow churchyard of the remote village, and the
poor boy was committed to the care of a woman, who,
so long as she was regularly paid, was content to let
him share her scanty living with her own children.
This woman believed the boy to be young Lyle's
natural son, for her husband was a new-comer in the
village, and neither of them could read, nor had they
any acquaintances there. After a while they left it,
and carried young Jasper to London. The stipend
paid for him was unexpectedly raised to what was to
them a considerable annuity.
The baronetcy of Manvers, for want of male heirs,
passed to the female line, and, at the age of five-
and-twenty, John Lyle found himself, by an unlooked-
for concurrence of circumstances, Sir John Manvers,
with but a slender income for his position.
Interest, however, got him a commission, though he
was beyond the regulated age-interest placed him on

the staff of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and he,
whose destinies had once appeared of no account, was
now the admired favourite of a showy court, for such
might then be termed the official residence of the Duke
of L-, in Dublin. His tall, aristocratic form, his
grave beauty, his proud reserve, attracted the attention
of the elegant and witty Duchess of L-, and her
admiration stamped him with a prestige surprising
even to himself.
His past love! what was it now to him ?-a dream-
one, however, to which he looked back with uneasi-
ness, for was there not a living witness of this “fan-
tasy ?” Every day, every hour, deepened the gulf
between him and the dark paths of his young life. He
had never made a friend. No one stood at hand to
whom he might unburden his soul, and each succeeding
week found him placed more irrevocably in a false
position. He was looked upon as a rising man, poor in
patrimony, but sure to force his way to better things.
While he was halting between two opinions, a
familiar face suddenly carried him back to the old par-
sonage, and its dim and silent
groves.
Although we may not have been intimate with an
early associate, our hearts are strangely stirred at
sight of one with whom we have been in communion
under circumstances different or distant from those
in which we again meet.
Something of pleasure lit up Sir John's intelligent
eye as he recognized the open countenance of Sir
Adrian Fairfax, who was younger than himself, and
whom he had known during the last few months of
his residence at the vicarage; they were the first
months of love-months in which life had been pre-
sented to him in its happiest phase.
But while the proud mind was debating which
ought to be the first to speak, a vision stood between
the two which riveted the gaze of both, and turned
the current of young Manvers's thoughts.

It was the Lady Amabel, who, in all the purity of
beautiful and innocent sixteen, suddenly appeared
the lily of the dazzling parterre. She leaned on the
arm of the Duke of L, and moved
up
the
to the dais, on which the Duchess was seated with the
handsome and favourite aide-de-camp.
But love is ever at cross purposes.
The heart of
this gentle being stirred not, the eye was not illu-
mined, as the young and handsome baronet bent over
her. She smiled when Sir Adrian came to greet her;
but he, at whose approach she blushed and trembled
like a rose at morning prime, was Daveney, then a
young ensign, without a prospect in the world save
that to which blind fortune might lead him.
But the reader has seen that Daveney thought
not of his gentle cousin. Both were much together
in the early part of that brilliant Dublin season;
but the young soldier changed his quarters-some
said he withdrew purposely from the light of those
eyes, that tempted him to love one whom it would
be ruin to marry—some, that he was blind—some, that
he was heartless; no matter--they were sundered.
Meanwhile Sir John's heart was chilled towards
one in whom he might have found a friend; and
when some months afterwards he saw that Lady
Amabel suffered Sir Adrian to talk to her for hours,
the circumstance widened the gulf.
Later, at the age of eight-and-twenty, Manvers
became associated in Ireland with the sweet and gra-
cious being who eventually became his wife. She had
wealth, connection, talent, and, above all, the most
amiable disposition. The grave, austere young sol-
dier was drawn imperceptibly towards this happy,
ardent being. She shone upon him like sunlight
upon snow, she was like a beam from heaven gilding
the darkest recesses of a mine.
He might have told her all. Many a time he was
disposed to throw himself at her feet, and disclose his

early history; but her father-it was from her mother
she derived the stamp of aristocracy-was a parvenu.
Manvers dreaded to lose this first real love, this dar-
ling of his heart; and albeit she would have gone with
him to the desert, he knew full well that his title
and military interest weighed heavily in his favour,
with the father.
He kept his secret, and married the heiress; and,
in the course of time, he had almost forgot the very
existence of his eldest born, when one day he received
a letter from the woman Watson, informing him that
his son had run away from her home; the boy, she said,
must have been led astray, and she hoped to trace
him. The annuity must be paid as usual. She
doubted not he would be found in some of the haunts
of the metropolis, and she would inform Sir John as
soon as she received tidings of the boy.
Upon this, after some hours' deliberation, Sir John
Manvers wrote to Mrs. Watson, and, making it a con-
dition that she should never again address him on the
subject of this miserable child, he settled an annuity
of two hundred a year on this woman and her hus-,
band for the boy's maintenance, till of age, if he
returned and reached the age of one-and-twenty.
At the age of one-and-twenty some other steps were
to be considered.
Sir John believed that the Watsons had some rea-
son for endeavouring to overreach him, but it was
not so in this instance; the child really was missing.
The man Watson would have pocketed the annuity
without acting further in the matter. Mrs. Watson
“used to the child,” and “ had a liking for him;".
$0 she did her best to discover him, but for a long
time without success. Her husband kept back part
of the sum allowed, and she afterwards learned that
he bribed some infamous people to keep young
Jasper out of the way of his nurse, who, though
without firm principles, was not bad-hearted.
Sir John soon began to hope-God forgive him !-

that he should hear no more of the poor boy cast
upon the troubled waters of the world. In those days
there were no railways, nor electric telegraphs, nor
police; sin prospered much more secretly than it
does now.
Èven now the little church in Cornwall
lies remote from populous places, for no iron road
can penetrate through the rugged defiles that lead
to it.
Oh! that men would consider the future, and cal-
culate even the chances of the evils which may accu-
mulate from the commission of one solitary sin.
We are inclined to pity the youth, who in the poor
curate's daughter found relief after the gloomy days
spent at home, and surely for him whose heart was
softened at the sight of the father's anguish there
were hopes of better things; but his besetting demon
was pride--pride fostered by his mother. Oh mothers !
do you deeply weigh your responsibilities ?- do you
remember that it is to your hands the virgin soil of
the garden falls for culture ?
And lo! see what a strait this pride brought him to
at last! And is it not always so ? Are we not per-
petually punished by the very instruments we have
ourselves employed for evil ? 'Do we not constantly
stumble at the pit we have digged to serve our own.
purposes?
Pride made Sir John Manvers hesitate ere he re-
cognized Sir Adrian Fairfax in the lighted saloons of
Dublin Castle; be would have been his friend, but the
opportunity was lost; and, though in after years the
incidents of their profession brought them nearer to
each other, it then was too late to remedy the evil.
When a man is embarked in a bad scheme, he is at
no loss for reasons, or rather excuses, for persevering in
mischief; and Sir John Manvers, becoming day by day
more accustomed to look on the sin he had com-
mitted as an error which could not be repaired, at
last satisfied himself with the notion, that to place
his son in his true position would be to entail irre-

mediable sorrow on his household, and in nowise
benefit the unfortunate Jasper.
Jasper !—what could have induced him to permit
the child to be called after his grandfather, that poor,
imbecile, wretched old curate ?
Still, who was likely to search through an old
parish register, and, in doing so, who would stop to
inquire into the identity of John Lyle and his wife
Mary and their son Jasper ?
The very devils, we are told, “ believe and tremble;">
but how short-sighted are men, who only calculate on
human chances !
No; there was little chance of the old yellow-leaved
parish register of Tremorna ever being brought in
evidence against him; and, besides, where was this
boy—this Jasper ?
Nurse Watson at length traced the child at last to
some den of iniquity in the heart of London. She had
a woman's heart—it yearned to Jasper—he was a fine,
manly child; and when she had relieved him of his
soiled habiliments, and purified his strong young
limbs with water, she was pleased with herself at
having rescued this gentleman's son from filth and vice.
She had, it is true, no fixed principles; but she
had benefited by this child. She and her husband
and children were living in ease and plenty on the
money paid for him; and she believed that, in spite of
what he had said, his father would rejoice at hearing
that the lost sheep was found and in safe keeping.
She sought Sir John at his house in one of the
squares; she was ungraciously received by his confi-
dential valet, who would not give her admittance to
his master. She was of a passionate and determined
temper, and, enraged at the imperative tone of the
saucy London menial, she told him, in plain terms, that
as he would not let her see Sir John, whom she had
Watched into the house a few minutes before, he
might carry the message himself, and tell him that
Jasper was found."

Her voice was raised, her cheeks were crimson, her
eyes flashed at the cool impertinence of Sir John's
gentleman," and at this juncture a lady descended
the staircase and crossed the hall.
Lady Manvers, for it was she, stopped at once; and
instead of retiring, as some fine ladies would have
done, or ordering the angry woman from the hall,
she walked quietly up to Mrs. Watson, and with a
look of reproof to the valet, whose temper she knew,
said, “My good woman, what is the matter, and who
is Jasper ?
The voice, the calm sweet face, the graceful air of
the gentle questioner, disarmed the wrath of the
irritated woman; but she was at a loss what to say.
She stammered, looked confused; the valet's self-
satisfied mien provoked her, and, in a word, Lady
Manvers was very soon made aware that her husband
had a secret which it was not his intention to share
with her.
Lady Manvers trembled exceedingly, but not with
anger. No; after a short time she was able to ques-
tion herself as to what it would be her duty to do.
She led Mrs. Watson into her dressing-room, and bid
her wait there till sent for; but Lady Manvers asked
her no questions. No; this high-minded, generous
lady went at once to her husband.
She would scarcely have believed the truth from his
own lips. She was so proud of him, she would
soon have dreamt of his making her his wife while
another claimant to that title lived, as of his having
an heir to his estate unknown to her, the mother of
his beautiful boy, his darling Gerard.
Sir John was utterly startled and thrown off his
guard, as his wife, in her softest accent, but with her
clear honest eyes fixed on his, asked him to“ trust her
with the secret which the woman Watson would not
tell?” Who was Jasper ? Who was Mrs. Watson?
Surely, if there was concealment, there must be
something wrong; or did dear John think she, his

own Nina, did not love him as she ought to do? Oh!
if he had a sorrow or anxiety, might she not share it?
If the sin of an early day hung heavy on his mind,
would he not let her bear the burden with him ?
And a hundred other such persuasive things she
said, hanging on his shoulder, with her sweet face
lifted imploringly to his moody countenance.
He bade her wait till evening for his reply; but she
would not. She drew from him that Jasper was his
son; but, he added, she was never to ask him about
the boy's unfortunate and ruined mother.
So the father tacitly stamped the brand of illegiti-
macy on the brow of his first-born; and the innocent
woman he now deceived thanked him for such con-
cessions as he had made, and resolved, without asking
further permission, to send for Jasper.
But when Mrs. Watson reached home, he had again
abscozded; and of this she did not fail to inform
Lady Marvers, whose gentleness had won her regard.
The idea of this unfortunate child of ten years old,
her husband's son, wandering from haunt to haunt of
iniquity, was a source of perpetual anxiety to Lady
Manvers. She drove from one magistrate's house
to another, trying to discover the little recreant. She
dreaded compromising her husband, yet was resolved
on doing her duty. She met with nothing but cour-
tęsy and kindness, but all seemed unavailing; and
she was beginning to despair, when, on the eve of
departing for Scotland, where Sir John's regiment
was quartered, her attention was riveted by a para-
graph in the newspaper, which she could not help
connecting with the object of her search.
It was an extract from the minutes of a magistrate's
court. A little boy, “apparently between ten and
eleven years," had been brought before a magistrate,
having been found among thieves and pickpockets in
some disorderly meeting.
The evidence presented a sorry picture.
Į There stood the child in the dock.

The magistrate, a man esteemed for his benevolence,
examined the little prisoner attentively ere he ques-
tioned him. At length the good man said, -

The child did not answer.

spoken to her own children, whom she always ordered,
never asked, to do her bidding.
The unfortunate child lifted his face to Mr. M-
and looked half-wonderingly at it. The mode of
speech was evidently beyond his comprehension: he
looked round at his evil associates, older by years in
crime than he was, and laughed.
The magistrate had the young prisoner removed
from the dock, and taken to his own house.
Lady Manvers ordered her carriage as soon as she
had finished reading this paragraph. She drove, with-
out delay, to Mrs. Watson's at Lambeth, and then
hastened to Mr. M-~'s.
She found him at home, and told her mission with
her accustomed grace and tact. Mr. M—- rose
from his chair, opened the door of his library, and led
from an inner room a handsome boy, who, accustomed
to resist, would have run back, and even now drew his
curly locks against his large speaking eyes, and strove
to shut out the sight of her who stood before him as
an angel of compassion.
Mrs. Watson was summoned, and as Jasper recog-
nized her, he dropped the magistrate's hand, and went
to the woman; but there was no demonstration of
tenderness on the part of either, and Lady Manvers,
agitated and dismayed, burst into tears.
When Sir John Manvers found that his wife had
actually stood face to face with his first-born son, he
felt the reality of the secret buried in the old Cornish
church.
The departure for Scotland was delayed for some
days. He spent many hours in his library, affecting
to be engaged in business with his agent; but oh! the
tortures he suffered! Now he would go to Nina,
and confess all. He opened the door; a merry
voice
echoed from the stairs, his boy Gerard came bounding
down, crying “Papa, papa." Sir John closed the
door abruptly; the boy cast his whip upon the ground
and sat down weeping on the mat.
He had never

been denied admittance before; but his father's coun-
tenance had frightened him; he dared not lift his hand
to the lock, but he did not move ; he sat there sob-
bing as if his little heart would break.
And the father sat within ; he had no tears, but
his youngest son's honest sobs struck to his heart.
He heard his wife come down the staircase; he
heard her carry off the weeping Gerard. The child
went sobbing up the stairs on its mother's shoulder,
and Sir John felt that she would not intrude upon
his
privacy at a juncture when old associations were so
seriously revived.
Ah! how could that pure-minded, high-souled wo-
man understand or believe in his remorse ?
Remorse without repentance !
Sir John Manvers easily taught his amiable wife to
believe that she having succeeded in persuading him
to adopt his son and provide for him, her mission was
over; still Lady Manvers entreated that she might
continue to interest herself in the boy, till he became
accustomed to his new sphere of existence. She sought
out an excellent clergyman at Clapham, who took a
limited number of pupils ; she candidly admitted the
chief points in Jasper's story, she anticipated for the
good man much trouble and discouragement, she pre-
pared him for the worst. He tried his best with the
child, but he had not strength either of mind or body
to cope with young Jasper.
The boy passed from one master to another, till a re-
solute man was found to take charge of him as a West-
minster scholar, when he battled through life in Dean's
Yard, Westminster, for twelve months; headed a con-
spiracy against the assistant-masters, and would have
been expelled, but that his “uncle," as Sir John was
reputed to be, had interest enough to withdraw him
privately, and finally to get him a commission,

JASPER LYLE:
It was Jasper Lyle's luck to be ordered at once to
join his regiment in India. He opened his military
career before a fortress which surrendered to the
British arms.
The banner planted on the battlements
was a rag dripping with gore. The young ensign was
mentioned honourably in general orders, and for a
time the laurel wreath of fame acted as a talisman in
checking evil principles; but ill weeds are hard to
eradicate, and he would have been disgraced for debt,
had debt in the army been disgraceful. Sir John found
himself answerable for bills which his son bad chosen
to draw on his father's bankers, and an angry corres-
pondence took place, in which the baronet threatened
to leave the young man to the consequences of his
folly and dishonesty.
And at every fresh revival of error, Lady Manvers
pleaded for the recreant, who each time promised fair;
for his connection with the upper classes of society
had taught him to dread the ills of poverty.
Although he had been first made to believe that he
was a distant relation of Sir John's, he soon ascer-
tained, through Mrs. Watson, the real position he
held in Lady Manvers's eyes. Of his true condition
he could not dream. He was specious enough to keep
his ground with his father's gentle wife, and so, alter-
nately in disgrace with the former, and in treaty with
the latter as a mediator, he contrived to keep his com-
mission and to satisfy his creditors.
An opportunity for an exchange to a regiment at
the Cape occurred during the government of Sir
Adrian Fairfax, and Sir John Manvers, anxious to
rid himself even for a period of Jasper's presence,
addressed a confidential letter to Sir Adrian, with
whom of late years he had become more intimately
acquainted, through the friendship existing between
Lady Amabel and Lady Manvers, and introducing the
reprobate to him as “the issue of an unfortunate con-
nection," asked his Excellency's patronage.

mestic principles were but lightly touched upon. He had
been "rather wild," was “careless in expenditure,” &c.
Sir John trusted that under Sir Adrian's kind patron-
age he would " become steady;" in a word, the kind
Sir Adrian, on reading the letters of introduction
forwarded to him by Lady Amabel, on Lyle's arrival
at Cape Town was more inclined to pity than con-
demn the young man, and accordingly wrote, as we
have seen, to his wife, requesting her to receive the
new-comer with hospitality.
From the period of his arrival at Newlands to his
departure from the colony, the reader has watched
young Lyle's career. Afterwards ruined in fortune,
overcome by his evil passions, possessed, so to speak,
by a devil, he abjured all allegiance to his country's
laws. Branded as a swindler, he resolved on making
a new road for himself in the great wilderness of life,
where bad men think that the race is to the swift
and the battle to the strong. The details of that career
need not be enlarged upon. Lyle himself related
to Gray how the disciples of his evil creed treated
him : they abandoned him as recklessly as he would
have abandoned them.
Tried and convicted of seditious leadership at a
time when other nations were shaken to their centre
by the thunders of republican eloquence, he was con-
demned to transportation for life, and Sir John
Manvers, striving to suppress the whispers of con-
science, reconciled himself to the issue of events by
hoping that he had “done the State some service
substituting for this vicious heir to his title and
estate the docile yet manly Gerard.
Ah! he would not, he dared not, look into first
causes.
News came home of the loss of the Trafalgar ; a
list of survivors and of those drowned accompanied
the official notification of the event. Sir John Manvers
was absent from his wife when informed of the dread-
ful tidings. He shut himself up for some days, and

people looked at him when he emerged from his soli-
tude, and whispers went about—“What a shock Sir
John Manvers had sustained in the death of his
nephew, or, as people believed him to be, his son,
for whom he had formerly done so much, but who
was so incorrigibly vicious."
Next Sir John took steps to ascertain, through Sir

with Eleanor Daveney. He had heard of the birth of
a son, and he received with breathless thankfulness of
heart the tidings of poor little Francis Lyle's death.
He tried to wash his brain of these awful realities;
he at times rejoiced in some of the pleasantest things
that life could give--a lovely wife, with the sweetest
temper and the firmest principles, graced his hearth;
beautiful children made his lofty halls musical with
laughter; many partings and meetings had endeared
him more and more to that beloved wife, those
noble-looking children. He was in the prime life,
and had won many laurels ; but he was restless, eager
for command, impatient of solitude, yet reserved and
abstracted in society.
He could not keep away the dread remorse that
haunted him. All the sophistry in the world could
not veil the sin he had committed against įthe help-
less, unoffending infant, the melancholy legacy of his
ill-starred Mary. True, he had a strange facility of
suppressing deadly memories by the aspirations of
some new ambition ; but there were times when, like
our fallen parents at noon-day in the garden, he
“heard the voice of God,” and was “afraid."
But all the remorse, all the repentance in the
world, could not compel the sea to "give up her
dead ;” and, if the strict performance of his duty to
his family and his country could have made atonement
for his early crime, God would have had compassion
on the sinner. But God requires another kind of
repentance, another atonement, than that existing
between man and his brother. The thief on the cross

was justified and pardoned at the last moment; but
albeit the justification and the atonement sufficed to
save, he acknowledged the justice of this world's
condemnation.
There was nothing of this in all Sir John Manvers's
regrets for the past. He trembled at the warning
voice that pierced the worldly din surrounding him,
or disturbed the repose he sought; but he did not say
with David, “ Against Thee only have I sinned, and
done this evil in thy sight."
And so it is ever with sin
prosperous ;
there
may
be warnings, there may be misgivings, there may be
heavy regrets for the ill we have done our neighbour;
but there is not that depth of remorse which bids us
cast ourselves before God for pardon and for grace
to
6 lead a new life."
Still, long association with an amiable woman and
an innocent family had softened the heart of Sir John
Manvers, and he would have given worlds that he had
never been tempted.
The command at the Cape of Good Hope was
offered to him soon after the loss of the Trafalgar ;
his acceptance of it was requested as a favour, since
every one knew it was eventually designed for Sir
Adrian Fairfax, then absent in India. Change of
any kind was agreeable to Sir John, who was weary of
a country gentleman's life at home, and whose finances
would be advantageously recruited by a measure
which would lead to something better. He parted
from his family with the less regret, that, on obtain-
ing a better appointment, they were to join him.
But when Mr. Daveney presented himself before
this proud General, with the information that the
wretched prodigal was not only alive, but would ere
long be brought forth to be tried for his life as a
traitor, Sir John Manvers beheld the truth in all its
hideous nakedness.
“Better, oh better, had the sea engulfed him !”
exclaimed the sinful father, in the solitude of his

tent, " than that my hand should sign his death-
warrant."
Sir John Manvers uttered these words as he heard
the sentry again challenge some invader of his privacy.
He re-seated himself in his easy-chair, tried to quell
the anguished thoughts that surged within his breast,
and turned, with apparent calmness, to his aide-de-
camp, who, putting aside the canvas screen, stepped
into the General's presence, and laid before him a
packet of letters brought in by another express.

CHAPTER XXI.
CONCLUSION.
It was a bright autumn day in Kafirland. Eleanor
was borne out into the garden. They laid her on a
couch on the sunny side of the cottage; the lime-
trees and acacias met over her head. May had shaped
them into a bower; they were the remains of a grove
planted on the spot by some poor colonist, who had
been long since driven by the savage from his home-
stead. The cheek of the invalid had resumed its
marble hue, the eyes shone less brightly, the fever
had abated.
The morning was delicious,-it reminded one of June
in England; the canaries were singing their last
summer melodies, and the swallows trilled their fare-
well lays to Kafirland. Below the willow bank, the
stream murmured with a sound that pleased the ear
and refreshed the senses.
Eleanor had been told by her father that her hus-
band had again eluded justice. By a tacit agreement,
the convict's name was never referred to. All hoped
alike that he would never more occupy a prominent
position in the world, and the patient wife, daily pray-
ing for strength to support her in her trials, daily
grew more resigned.
She longed to get away to some quiet nook, and be
at rest.
She leaned on her mother's bosom-Mrs. Daveney
was devoted to this sad daughter now. A faint colour
tinged the sufferer's wan cheek, the soft air lifted the
dark braids from the temples : how tense they were !
What a picture of desolation she presented—that
young, intelligent, graceful, desolate being !

JASPER LYLE:
Mr. Trail was reading, his wife working, the little
Trails were watching the antics of May, who was
dancing for their amusement, after making herds of
clay oxen for them. Marion and Ormsby were walking
up and down, talking earnestly, for both had grown
more serious of late; and Mr. Daveney was superin-
tending the irrigation of his garden, when the quietude
of the party was disturbed by a message summoning
Mr. Trail to his cottage, which, it will be remembered,
was only separated by a lane from the Daveneys'
home.
Presently there was a clatter of arms, and the
steady tread of soldiers; then the guard passed by-
it soon re-appeared, bringing with them the young
prisoner Gray.
Mr. Trail walked by his side. The party passed
close to the garden fence--Gray, though handcuffed,
contrived to salute the compassionate people, who had
in many ways softened the miseries of his confinement.
On the afternoon of that day, it was understood that
the evidence on the court-martial was entirely against
him—that his showing himself to the troops was pro-
nounced the effect of terror and panic, and that it was
proved he had lived for months among the Kafirs and
Boers, trafficking in gunpowder with the former, and
assisting the latter in their preparations for treking
and for war. There was little time given for the
defence. The accused could only affirm on oath
that he had constantly remonstrated with Lyle on the
course they were both pursuing, while, on the other
hand, a Dutch prisoner related Gray's reply to his
fellow-convict, when the latter desired him to “ do his
duty.”
Poor Gray also admitted that he might have made
an effort to remain with Vanbloem, when the latter fell
to the rear with his wife, but he also urged, that by
doing so he might have involved the young Dutchman
in serious trouble. In short, he had no sound ground
or defence to present, and the court-martial closed, after

sitting four days. The finding was approved, and the
sentence ere long promulgated. The poor youth was
condemned to be shot as a deserter and a rebel.
Mr. Trail was with him soon after this was made
known to him. He bowed his head in silent submission
to the laws of his country, and requested the good
missionary to come to him that evening, when he
should be glad to impart his last wishes to him.
“That done,” said the poor youth, “I will turn my
back to the things of earth, and give all my thoughts
to heaven."
And, as the sun went down, Mr. Trail went again to
the condemned man, who was now a solitary prisoner,
strongly guarded. They talked far into the night.
Poor Amayeka ! thou wert foremost in the thoughts
of thine ill-starred young soldier-love. He gave Mr.
Trail some tokens of affection and kindness for the
friends of his early youth, “ if they still lived;" but for
Amayeka, he entreated the missionary's care of her
welfare, “ that she might know there was a future,
where the tears shall be wiped from off all faces."
No further intelligence of Lyle-or Lee, as he was
denominated officially-reached the British camps.
The last accounts of Sir Adrian Fairfax referred to his
being deep in diplomatic business with the conquered
Dutch beyond the Orange River; and, save the anti-
cipated execution of Gray, matters remained in abey-
ance with Sir John Manvers's division until the two
Generals should meet, to hold a parley with the Kafir
chiefs and people; for, although subdued for a time,
these restless savages would not " sit still”—the great
array of forces scattered over the face of the land
kept them in check; but though their words were
“sweeter than honey in the honeycomb, and smoother
than oil," there was war in their hearts.
Mr. Daveney had long asserted this to Sir John
Manvers, who, jealous of all interference from the
Commissioner, and haughtily reserved alike in commu-
nicating or receiving opinions, especially from him,

made no serious objections to the return homeward of
some of his best burgher captains. Troops and colo-
nists rested on their arms, and the usual amusements
of camp life were entered into with all the avidity of
excitement-loving soldiers.
Poor Gray had now but three days to live.
Mr.
Trail could not help thinking, that if all the circum-
stances of the case were related to Sir Adrian Fairfax,
that kind General might mitigate the sentence. The
missionary had drawn the young deserter's history
from him, and every word he spoke increased the good
man's interest, and made him long to rescue the youth
from an ignominious death.
Even the eyes of the president of the court-martial,
Colonel Graham, were observed to fill with tears
when the question was asked of the prisoner-
How old are you
?"
And Gray replied, “I am twenty-two to-day.”
His air was so different to the reckless, daring man-
ner of men hardened in crime, and every one felt the
force of the words he uttered in his defence.
“I acknowledge my crimes,” he said; “but I have
been very unfortunate.”
His open countenance when his eyes were raised,
for shame and sorrow usually weighed them down;
his slight boyish frame, attenuated by illness; his air
of deep humility-humility without fear-for every
question was answered unhesitatingly and honestly';
the gentle way in which he met the accusations of the
chief witness against him, a man who hoped to pur-
chase his own freedom by the blood of his fellow,
creature; and the straightforward manner in which
he related his history from the time he and Lyle had
been cast ashore from the Trafalgar, taking more
blame to himself, in the matter of gunpowder traffic,
than he deserved, were all adjuncts in his favour with
the honourable court; but, alas! there was the damn-
ing evidence to prove the life he had lived for the last

six months, and nothing to confirm his assertion that
he deprecated his occupation or position.
Under present circumstances, Gray was not per-
mitted to occupy his little chamber in the kind
missionary's cottage; but Ormsby-no longer the
thoughtless, selfish Ormsby-gave up his hut to the
poor young príoner, who, patient and resigned, sat
within, looking through the open door upon the dis-
tant plains of Kafirland.
He was fettered, and safely guarded by sentries,
who would fain have avoided their sad duty
Mr. Trail sat beside him—the Bible he had been
reading was closed upon his knee-the two were
silent now-
" thoughts too deep for words” filled the
breasts of both. The missionary's eyes were over-
flowing with a sorrow he could not repress, and the
tears fell drop by drop upon his sleeve.
The deserter took no notice of this; he continued
to gaze upon the plains. Between him and the great
space beyond was spread the camp-ground-the
troops with glittering arms—the sturdy burghers
scattered in somewhat disorderly fashion—the Fingo
warriors dancing their untiring dance and chanting
their war-song. But he noted not this stir-his in-
terests were no longer of earth—his eyes were lifted
above those vacant green plains to those “aisles of
light,” beyond which men have a vague idea that God
dwells in heaven.
At the foot of the camp-ground the waters of the
two rivers spread east and west; eastward the stream
widened considerably, foaming and tumbling over
gigantic blocks of stone; westward the current was
comparatively smooth and shallow; precipitous banks,
intersected with kloofs, formed the boundary on the
opposite side, the cliffs overhanging the eastward
being densely wooded.
The ground above these cliffs sloped up to a long
green ridge, sbarply defined against the clear breezy

sky of a Cape autumn day. The young prisoner's
eye swept this ridge with a purposeless look; but the
sentries who watched him, following that look, were
surprised to perceive several men on horseback with
one in the midst, whom they soon discovered to be
unarmed and bound upon the saddle he bestrode.
This body of men inclined to the bank leading to the
smoother waters of the river, dipped suddenly into a
gorge, and did not reappear till they ascended the
slight declivity at the extremity of the encampment.
The horses, somewhat jaded, flagged in their pace
till they came in full sight of the troops, when the
party, some fifty strong, cantered to the guard-
house, demanding to see the commanding officer of
the troops, to whom they desired to deliver up Lee
the convict.
Bound in limb, but with the dauntless spirit blaz-
ing in his eye, Jasper was led into the guard-house,
and there, surrounded by his captors and the soldiers,
awaited the arrival of the officer who was to receive
him.
Colonel Graham was directed to dispose of the con-
tumacious rebel for the present--no words passed
between this officer and the prisoner. The elder Boer
of the party delivered him to British authority,
and claimed the reward, which was to be applied to
kindly purposes among the sufferers by the war; and
Lyle was conducted to a cell, rudely but strongly
built, adjoining the guard-house. It contained a
bench, a table, an iron bedstead with a straw pallet,
and was but faintly lighted by a narrow slit high up
in the thick stone wall. An iron ring in this wall
showed that, if necessary, the prisoner could be
chained to his desolate abode.
All that could be seen from this narrow chamber
was the blue vault of heaven, with sometimes a bird
careering freely in the clear ether.
The door swung heavily behind Jasper Lyle as he
entered the cell— we must leave him there for the

present. No one visited him for some hours—the
chained eagle was left to beat its wings against its
cage.
It was on the afternoon of this very day that an
advance guard of cavalry emerged from a glen head-
ing the encampment, and announced that Sir Adrian
Fairfax was at hand; the little knots of officers, dotted
about the ground, canvassing the various reports
which had lately floated about concerning the convict
so unexpectedly delivered up to British authority,
dispersed instantly. The bugles gave warning to fall
in, and Sir Adrian, attended by his staff, and followed
by a small body of troops, rode at a sharp pace into
the square, where all, save Sir John Manvers, were in
readiness to receive him.
It may be imagined that rumour's busy tongue had
not been still as regarded Jasper Lyle, for it began to
be known that Lee was not the real name of the man
who had made himself so notorious beyond the bor-
ders of the colony.
It was first ascertained that this rebel had been in
South Africa before; then, some one remembered
having heard of a so-called nephew, but, in reality, as it
was said, a natural son of Sir John Manvers, who
had given him an infinity of trouble, but who had
been reported lost off the Cape of Good Hope; in
short, one link after another was furnished to com-
plete a chain on which to hang something very
like the truth.
But the Daveneys were unconscious of the curio-
sity and interest they excited. Eleanor as yet knew
nothing of what had taken place, and Marion,
although she felt acutely, was consoled by Ormsby's
generosity.
Mr. Daveney parted these two young people, and
led Ormsby away to Mr. Trail's cottage.
There, in the presence of the missionary, the Com-
missioner proposed to release the young man from his
engagement with his daughter.

“You see the strait we are in,” said Daveney ;
“there is no shutting our eyes to the fact that my
wretched son-in-law must die the death of a traitor.
You must not ally yourself to the sister-in-law of a
malefactor.”
“It is my Marion's misfortune, not her fault, that
she is so allied,” replied Ormsby. “I love her, and
she loves me, and we will not be parted."
Mr. Daveney's mind felt somewhat lightened of its
weight of anxiety on seeing his old friend Sir Adrian
Fairfax. He did not believe, for an instant, that, by
any circumstances, Lyle could be absolved from punish-
ment; but a vague hope filled his breast that the
convict's life would be spared. Stern and cold and
unfeeling as Sir John Manvers had been in his com-
munications with him, the mild-tempered Daveney
experienced the deepest compassion towards the father
of such a son.
But what if he had known that that son was the
legitimate first-born of the baronet ?
And how had Sir John received the fatal news that
his ill-starred son Jasper was
a fettered prisoner
within a few hundred yards of his own marquee ?
On the day after hearing who this Lee really was,
he had sent for Colonel Graham, who stood next in
command, and desired that whenever the convict
should be brought into the encampment, Colonel Gra-
ham should be ready to receive him, without reference
to the higher authority. He dreaded lest a panic
should seize him on suddenly hearing of Jasper's
unwelcome approach.
Accustomed to his cold manner, his aide-de-camp
had, on the convict's arrival, placed before Sir John
the document from Colonel Graham reporting the
outlaw's capture.
“ You may go, sir,” said Sir John, on receiving this
dire intelligence; and he did not lift the paper, on
which he recognized the handwriting, until the canvas
screen dropped between him and the
young
officer.

He opened it and tried to read it through ; the
letters swam before his eyes, they turned blood-red,
they blazed like characters of fire, the paper fell to the
ground, and for the first time in his life the strong
man fainted away.
A
very few minutes sufficed for the hasty review
Sir Adrian took of the assembled forces, and profiting
by Colonel Graham's offer of his marquee, he retired
thither, and sent at once for Mr. Daveney.
Frankfort, who, with the General, awaited the
Commissioner, wrung the hand of his friend in silence,
and all four entering the tent, where some refreshment
had been hastily spread, Colonel Graham informed
Sir Adrian of the apprehension of the rebel convict.
Frankfort was a stranger to the old colonel, who
was fortunately too much occupied with matters of
duty to notice the death-like hue which suddenly over-
spread the young man's face. At a signal from Sir
Adrian, Mr. Daveney drew Frankfort into the air, but
he turned from the sight of the busy camp.
At this moment the Commissioner's attention was at-
tracted towards a little cavalcade of a couple of wagons,
drawn by mules, and attended by a mounted escort of
one of the town levies : it passed the guard-house, and
was directed by a soldier to the dwelling of Mr. Trail.
Anon, a messenger hastened across the square, and
announced the arrival of Lady Amabel Fairfax. The
messenger was fortunately Ormsby, who knew by
Frankfort's expression of horror and surprise, that he
had learned the tidings of the day. Daveney hurried
off; neither of the young men spoke. They strode on
till a thicket shut the camp from their sight, and,
descending a bank, cast themselves on the turf.
“ Where is Eleanor ?” asked Frankfort.
“Do you see those willows?” said Ormsby, pointing
up the little rivulet; "the tops of them wave just
below her window. She has been almost dead, but is
better and more resigned, for she thinks--"
“ That he is still dead ?" said Frankfort; and, in

the bitterness of his heart, he added, 6 Would to
Heaven he were!” The next moment he prayed God
to forgive him, and, burying his face in his hands,
groaned aloud.
“She believes," replied Ormsby, “that he has again
escaped."
Lady Amabel arrived !” exclaimed Sir Adrian, in
great surprise, as Mr. Trail entered Colonel Graham's
tent with the information.
“Arrived-impossible ! have you seen her?"
“I have, sir.”
“Now, then, thank Heaven," said Sir Adrian;
“had I known yesterday that my wife was travelling,
I should have been less able for the work I had before
Mr. Trail, it may be well to inform you that, in
spite of this calm, which apparently pervades the whole
of Kafirland, the Gaika warriors are assembling in the
mountains, and my trusty Fingoes have warned me that
they are meditating an attack on the camp. I have long
had the idea that Sir John Manvers was not so pre-
pared for mischief as myself, and I hastened hither;
but I have distributed my forces I hope advantageously;
and although we may not keep the enemy out alto-
gether, we may check his advance, and meet it with
caution. It is time that I conferred with Sir John : it
is strange that I should have received no message from
him.”
The three gentlemen left the marquee. Colonel
Graham bent his way to the tents of his regiment ;
the other two directed their steps to the canvas
pavilion. A military surgeon met them at the door-
dismay was painted on his face.
General Manvers lay as dead upon
his camp
bed-
stead—his jaw dropped, his cheek sunken, his eyes
glaring and fixed. He had been found in this state
by his servant. The document relative to Lyle was
crushed between his fingers.
While Sir Adrian stood beside this rigid object of
despair, the eyelids quivered, a faint sigh stole from the

Save my
blue parted lips, and some low words were breathed,
not uttered, but Sir Adrian distinguished them.
“My son! my son !—my first-born!
miserable son Jasper !”
The sudden surprise of seeing Sir Adrian Fairfax
caused the unfortunate man to start up; he was bewil-
dered-looked first at one, and then at the other, of
the two kind men who leaned over him. The surgeon
was utterly in the dark as to the cause of this sud-
den seizure.
Greatly disturbed at what he saw, deeply anxious
about his wife, and keenly alive to the responsibilities
of his command, Sir Adrian was anxious to withdraw,
but Sir John held him firmly by the hand.
“Fairfax," said the latter, “I must speak with you
alone."
The interview lasted but a few minutes. Dr. E
who had only retired to a tent close at hand, was
speedily summoned again. “I am obliged, you see,
Dr. E," said Sir Adrian, “ to leave this unfortu-
nate gentleman. I fear he will disclose to you much
of a history which it will shock you to hear, but I leave
him, I know, in honourable hands, and his valet is
faithful. The sentries had better be removed beyond
ear-shot of the marquee. You are aware that there
are symptoms of a warlike nature among the Gaikas
in those hills; but, come what may, you must not leave
Sir John. Delirium, I have little doubt, will supervene,
for he is fearfully excited, and, alas ! there is no
earthly comfort for him. In a word, the convict who
has been brought within our lines to-day is his son."
The good surgeon stood confounded. Low moans
struck on his ear —then a bitter cry; he had only
time to send for the valet and a trusty sergeant be-
fore the patient was wild with delirium.
Miserable man! we must leave him; his pride is

humbled to the dust-he weeps aloud, and implores
his servant to intercede, to pray for his son, his first-
born son.
Sir Adrian Fairfax did not seek his wife till he had
made a minute inspection of the defences of the camp
He entered the guard-house. A thrill of anguish
pierced his very soul at sight of the heavily-barred
door of the convict's cell. All was still within.
The day was more than half spent ere the general
had time to greet the Lady Amabel. Mr. Trail's cot-
tage was appropriated to her use, but the kind and
gracious woman had found her way to Eleanor's little
whitewashed room. Still equipped in her riding-
dress, she reclined on cushions spread upon the floor.
She looked like some fair lily, beaten by the storm..
Her riding-hat was laid aside, and her hair, still beau-
tiful, hung disordered about her face, which had lost in
loveliness of outline, but had preserved all its grace
and sweetness of expression.
She silenced her husband's tender reproof at having
undertaken such a journey without his knowledge or
permission. “ Permission, dear love !" said she; “I
did not ask for what I knew you would not grant, and
it has been my great pleasure to surprise you in this
beautiful desert. Besides,” she added, with a grave
face, “ truth to tell, I hastened my journey in conse-
quence of news gathered by the way by my trusty
Klaas, the Hottentot.
“Preferring my travelling accommodation to the dis-
comforts of the little village inn at B-, where we
halted last night, thirty miles from this, I sent Klaas
to the mission station, for Mr. M who I knew
would give my people milk and vegetables; but Klaas,
hearing on his way that Mr. M was absent, de
scended towards a Kafir Kraal in the valley. You
know how cautious he is—he never trusts a Kafir in
time of peace, so he crawled on his hands and knees to
a bush crowning a height, where he stopped to recon-
noitre. He was horror-stricken, when, on looking

down upon the location, he saw two murdered Eng-
lishmen lying among the stones and thorn-bushes,
and, at a little distance from them, sat a council of
Kafirs. He waited till it grew dusk, and then crept
down to listen to their conversation. He brought me
back the fearful intelligence, that all the Kafir ser-
vants in the colony are to be mustered this day, by
the Gaika warriors, in the mountains.-Ah! I see,
exclaimed Lady Amabel, looking from her husband
to the Commissioner, “that this is no news to you.
Gracious Heaven! is it possible that these fearful
savages are likely to come down upon us ? Oh!
Adrian, Adrian! I am glad I have come.'
“There spoke the true soldier's wife," said the
General; “ but I trust we are too well prepared, for the
enemy to approach our lines ; they may harass us in
many ways. They have already, I understand, swept
off our cattle from the hills."
But all day long the wary foe, from his mountain
fastnesses, watched the proceedings in the British
camp. All idea of attacking it was given up for the
present, and, at the close of day, several Kafirs, grace-
ful, gentle, dignified, and smiling, came to offer milk
and corn and wood for sale.
Lady Amabel, who had never seen these wild beings
before, looked from the garden at the dusky groups
mingling with the soldiery, and could scarcely be
per-
suaded that these were the people meditating a fiery
onset with the burning brand and the gleaming assegai
upon the camp they entered like messengers of
peace.
Men and women, however, were armed with the
weapons used by their race of old.
Despite this fair seeming on the part of the Gaika
Kafirs, every preparation was made for their reception
in hostile
array. All day long scouts had been seen
skimming along the ridges; much of the cattle belong-

ing to the burgher camps had been carried off, and
here and there glimmered a telegraphic fire.
No member of Mr. Daveney's household retired to
rest: the night was spent much as I have described
one on a similar occasion at Annerley. Still there
was a certain feeling of security in being surrounded
by a large, well-disciplined garrison, well
prepared.
Wearied with her journey, and attired in a loose
morning robe, Lady Amabel reclined on a camp chair;
Eleanor was seated on the cushions at her feet, and
both had dropped into an uneasy slumber, when they
were awakened by the echoes of the morning gun.
No sign of scouts upon the ridges, no smoke from
dying signal-fires; all was still, calm, and peaceful in
the outer world. The heavens shone serene and clear,
the sun careered in brightness along the hills, and the
busy camp was soon astir.
And so passed another day. Kafir men and women
and children again came among the soldiery, bartering
and chattering and laughing; you would, indeed, have
thought they were the "pastoral and peaceful race"
described by some deluded men.
The door of Gray's hut was closed that day, and
none saw him but Mr. Trail.
Midnight went by; the camp was hushed in deep
repose, though the ear at intervals was startled by the
challenge of a sentry, or the rattle of muskets, as the
officers on duty went their rounds, and, fatigued with
the excitement and harass of the previous hours, most
of the community, except the watchful sentinels, were
hushed in sleep. Even Sir John Manvers's delirium
had yielded to the anodynes administered, and he lay
stupified and still, watched by Dr. E. and his servant.
But Eleanor, who had longed to be alone, and who
was too wretched to fear for herself, sat with the Book
of Consolation before her, in her little chamber. The

sofa-bed was undisturbed, her light burnt low, and
she had just unfastened her hair to bind it up again ere
she lay down to rest, when the flame of her candle
flickered in a sudden current of air. In the room were
two tiny windows, scarcely two feet square, at right
angles with each other. That to the east was uncur-
tained and was lighted by the coming dawn; she looked
up at the one opposite to her; it was open, and a face
filled it as a picture would fill a frame.
It was the face of her husband and the large full
eyes were fixed upon her in a fashion that riveted her
own as though attracted by a rattle-snake. They had
not met since that fearful night when, with throbbing
heart and bleeding feet, Eleanor had rushed from her
home to the sanctuary of the mission station.
Each looked in silence at the other. Only a minute
passed away, there was a low growl from the hound
Marmion, a foot pressed the ground below the eastern
window, and the dread
presence vanished.
She heard the willow boughs breaking, Ormsby's
dog barked furiously, hurried footsteps again passed her
window, and before she had strength to rise, Fitje with
Ellen in her arms crept quietly into the room.
Voices sounded through the cottage, in the garden,
-the dog's angry bark retreated up the ravine, the
whole camp was roused, and the cry went along the
lines---- The prisoner has escaped.”
With his usual tact and presence of mind, though
death stared him in the face, Jasper Lyle had contrived
to conciliate the young sergeant on guard so far, that
the latter did not turn a deaf ear to the man who,
though he knew him to be a rebel, he believed to be
brave and adventurous. Lyle asked but few questions,
and these in a careless way.
He ascertained that Sir
John Manvers was like to die, he was so ill;" that
Sir Adrian was in command, and that the family

of the Commissioner, Mr. Daveney, was living in a
cottage within five hundred yards of the guard-house.
Sir John Manvers ill-delirious ! Had the blow
told ? Sir Adrian in command ! He was the last
man to punish by death, if it was possible to
avoid such an extremity. Life might be spared,
but there would be no more freedom for Jasper Lyle.
Gray convicted-condemned !-how, then, could he
expect favour? Something like a spasm of remorse
touched his heart as he thought of the young
deserter.
His wife! was she so near ?
There are moments in the lives of evil men over
which good angels hold their sway. Gray and Eleanor !
were they not his victims ? 'He would fain have
said a good word for one,-a strange desire arose to
see the other.
He had not been an hour in his prison ere his quick
eye
had descried a possible means of escape.
The walls were of stone, the roof of shingles, the
loop-hole a mere narrow slit high up in the wall.
Lyle drew his bedstead near it, he stood up and
looked out; he could see the southern plains and part
of the encampment, he could hear the reliefs passing
too and fro; he listened and distinguished the parole,
Albany.” He rubbed his hands with glee, he examined
the loop-hole, and discovered that no coping-stone
supported the roof. A bar of iron from his bedstead
would remove the shingle overhanging the loop.
He sat down upon the bedstead in a desponding
attitude. When the sergeant entered with the after-
noon meal, the prisoner was weeping.
Fortune favoured Lyle. The sun set, in heavy
clouds, torrents of rain began to fall, the sentry who
paced below the loop-hole retired to his box in the
angle of the building, the thunder roared, the light-
ning flashed, and the convict worked amid the din of
the elements. Every now and then he listened at the
door; in the pauses of the storm he could hear the
sleepers in the guard-room breathing hard; he went

to work again, the roof had rotted from the effects of
the rainy season, it gave way, and Lyle raised his head
through the aperture.
In another instant he had slid down the wall, and
was on the turf.
The sentry was within a few paces of him, but the
wind, coming from an opposite direction, blew the
blinding rain in the soldier's face. He was wide
awake, though, and, on finding something was astir not
far off, uttered the usual query, “ Who goes there?”
The steady reply of “ Friend,” and the countersign
“Albany,' were sufficient; the sentry imagined it was
some officer passing from one tent to another; the
convict plunged below the bank in rear of the guard-
room, which was on a line with the Daveneys' cottage;
and, scrambling on till he came to the group
of willows,
sprang into the garden, and saw before him a window.
A light shone through the muslin curtain.
It readily yielded to his touch ; he looked in his
pale, sorrowful-looking wife was before him.
What a contrast with the turmoils through which
he had passed, with the wild uncertainty which made
his bosom throb, was the sight of this grave, sad, inno-
cent woman, alone in the stillness of dawn, with her
Bible beside her!
It was so totally unlike what he had experienced
since he had first known her, that he was softened,
though confounded, at the sight. He wanted words;
he felt as if he could have said something kind, but
did not know how.
Ah! the scorched and fiery ground of the sinful
man's mind hath no resting-place for the angel's foot.
The good spirit halted on the threshold; nevertheless,
Jasper wore a look unusual to him, and when it had
passed away, it haunted Eleanor like a vision. Her
memory of it was touched with something like compas-
sion, and it was well that it was so.

JASPER LYLE:
The cry was raised, “ The prisoner has escaped.”
The morning broke cold and chill, and the vapours
hung about the hills, as the little force of Cape cavalry
and its infantry supports were mustered, ere they
started on the spoor of the convict, with orders also to
reconnoitre the ground haunted by the enemy. It
was May who had discovered the
spoor.
Devoted to the Daveneys, and especially attached to
Eleanor, he had built for himself a little pent-house,
a lean-to, beneath the eastern window of her room.
In this he, and Fitje, and Ellen, and Ormsby's gallant
hound-May's friend and playmate-all slept at night.
May was always ready to accompany the Commissioner
in his rounds; he was at hand any moment during the
twenty-four hours; he was as watchful as the hound.
Although he had never enlightened Fitje on the sub-
ject of Eleanor's miserable connection with Lyle, he
had followed her through her whole history, and a
vague sense of dread for her sake hung about him as
soon as he learned that her tormentor had reappeared
in the shape of Lee the convict.
On the night in question, May, like a true bushman,
was too much disconcerted by the commotion in the
elements to sleep.
He never could banish the idea,
entertained by his race, that evil spirits were working
mischief in the stormy air; and he had just turned
round
upon his mat, comforted by the streaks of day-
light penetrating the shed, when his quick ear de-
tected a foot-fall to which he was unaccustomed-
• By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes,”
thought May, in words not unlike the text; and,
creeping from the shed, he saw a tall, dark form
between him and the white wall of the cottage.
Lyle’s ear, almost as keen as May's, was disturbed
by the bushman's movement, stealthy as it was; the
next instant the hound sprung out. The convict
swung himself down the bank by the bough of one of
the willows, and, lifting a stone, cast it with such

sure aim at poor Marmion, that he fell lame on the
spot. Still the beast managed to follow him ир
the
ravine, and May tracked the steps from bush to bush
till Marmion sank down whining piteously, and hold-
ing his bleeding limb up with an imploring look that
May could not resist.
He returned to the house, informed his master of
the route taken by the convict, and honour left no
alternative to Mr. Daveney but to report it to the com-
manding officer of the party of soldiery about to start
in search of him.
It was the fate of Frankfort and Ormsby to be of
this party; but whatever they felt on the occasion
was not expressed between them. Doubtless each
had the same wish-never again to behold the mise-
rable being, who spread sorrow and dismay whererer
he went.
But the advanced guard of gallant Fingoes has
entered the defile; the troops proceed with cautious
steps and muskets loaded, for, peradventure, many
a dusky head is peering out from behind the green
tufts and rocky masses that make the way so steep
and toilsome.
scene
The sun poured a flood of golden light upon a
so fair, that it should have been peopled
by beings as guileless as our first parents when
tenants of Eden. It was an open tongue of land
stretching from the kloof through which the troops
had passed, and planted by the graceful hand of
nature with those clumps of bush which give to
African
scenery
the air of a noble park. On the one
side a mountain, wooded from the base to the summit,
rose majestically to the clouds, all golden-tinted with
the radiance of the east; on the other rose a krantz,
abrupt and rugged, the white rocks standing out in

strong relief from the dark foliage of the yellow-
wood trees, among which the monkeys were chat-
tering, and swinging by their long tails from
bough to bough. The foot of this grand barrier was
watered by a stream clear and still, being gathered
into pools between the rocks; and over the shining
waters hung groups of willows, weighed down by the
oblong nests of those pretty birds which most dread
the snake, sure denizen of the loveliest nooks in
Southern Africa.
There were cattle drinking at the stream, and
these were unattended by their guards, as usual.
It was this circumstance which made the Hottentot
soldiers in advance halt, and keenly examine the
locality.
A slight elevation concealed part of this little
prairie from the soldiers, who, with May and three or
four Fingoes, plunged into some intervening bush to
reconnoitre. Î'hose in rear dropped behind the em-
bowered rocks, and kept strict silence till ordered by
the commanding officer, Frankfort, to advance upon
the enemy,
who was soon discovered.
Half-way down the slope stood a noble grove of
trees; interspersed among these were several Kafir
women and boys, all carrying assegais and knob kier,
ries, and all in a state of excitement; for, although
silent, they were dancing in their strange way upon
the flowery turf, and waving
their
weapons
aloft with
wild gesticulations. A few aged Kafirs contemplated
the scene with manifest satisfaction, but grinned a
noiseless applause; and far down were gathered some
sixty or seventy Kafirs, ranged in a semicircle round
a stately oak. They had been sitting in council, and
rose at the very instant Frankfort's eye fell upon
them.
They were, however, unconscious of being over-
looked; they stood up, cast aside their karosses, and
began to dance a solemn measure, which soon changed
to the wildest gestures.' They leaped high in the air,

swung themselves round and round, brandished their
spears, and presently a low hum of voices ascended
the bank, and swelled into a chorus.
A great pile of sticks was gathered round this tree,
and Frankfort began to believe that they were per-
forming some heathenish rite, when a sharp, clear
whistle issued from a clump of euphorbias and
mimosas on the right, and a yell from the women
proclaimed that the soldiers were discovered.
It was not ground on which Kafirs would make a
stand under any circumstances, and it was not their
policy to fire the first shot. They began to retire
slowly, as if peaceably disposed, and retreated to the
krantz; but, as they went, the boys cast their knob
kierries at the oak-tree, and raised a shout of defiance
to the troops, who showed themselves on the green
ridge. Finally, the savages collected in a body near
the pools, and, casting back a shower of assegais, dis-
appeared with their cattle among the yellow-wood
trees.
The echoes of that savage yell rang far and wide,
but a dead silence ensued; "the Cape cavalry gal-
loped down the slope, and poured a volley of mus-
ketry amid the trees and cliffs ; they were answered
by the shrill war-cry of Kafírland, and in a few
minutes they beheld the savages and their cattle
on a ledge of rocks far beyond the white man's
reach. The savages uttered one derisive shout, and
vanished.
It was useless to attempt to follow them. The
first signal of defiance was given, there was no fur-
ther doubt of hostility; but the troops were left
upon the lovely prairie without an enemy.
Many a gallant fellow lay bleeding on the flowery
turf; Ormsby was stretched beside one of the pools,
the blood poured from an assegai-wound in his side;
his soft shining hair was matted with gore from another
in the temple.

JASPER LYLE:
A horrible object presented itself to the troops as
they faced about, carrying their wounded up the
slope ; it was the figure of a white man bound with
thongs to the oak, round which the fagots had been
piled, but happily not ignited. The arms were
stretched out, and fastened to two wide-spreading
branches of the noble tree; the feet rested on the
sticks, which it had been intended should blaze beneath
them, and there were the marks of heavy blows upon
the fine athletic limbs ; the face was distorted, the
eyes glared in their sockets, and the body was trans-
pierced by assegais.
The Kafirs, athirst for blood, afraid to attack the
camps, had gone roaming about for days seeking
whom they might devour. Here, in this lovely and
sequestered spot, a group of Gaikas had halted with
their cattle; a solitary white man suddenly appeared
among them -- he was alone, unarmed miserable
wretch that he was !-he was in search of freedom in
the beautiful desert. They rushed upon him, seized
him, and, pinioning his arms, fastened him to the
tree, and sat down before him to deliberate how he
should die by their ruthless hands.
Reader, he understood their language!
He heard them, and was powerless.
They were all of one opinion.---
He should be killed by slow torture !
But how?
And then they talked together, and the victim, for
the first time in his life, called on God to have mercy
upon him, the sinner.
And Zoonah was there--Zoonah, who, in early
youth, had been fostered and kindly trained by white
men, and taught who God was, and how all the beau-
tiful and pleasant gifts of earth came from God-
and Zoonah mocked him, and cried aloud-
“ Is your God black or white ?"
Then all was still again, and it was decided how he
should die; and they took their assegais, and drew a

red circle round his throat, and sat down to see the
beginning of their work, sharpening their weapons,
and bidding the young boys take good aim at the
quivering and bleeding form with their knob kierries.
Some of the women came, and looked shily at him at
first, and so went away, and danced and returned;
and it was at this period of the tragic drama that a
girl caught sight of a carbine in the bush above, and
shrieked her warning-
“ The soldiers ! — the soldiers ! — and the Fingo
dogs!”
They fled, but left their victim no chance of life
from his fellow-men.
Jasper Lyle was quite dead when they unbound
him from the oak, down the bark of which the blood
streamed from his mangled limbs.
It was riven by lightning afterwards, and, till
Mr. Trail had it cut down, stood all white and
ghastly, an unsightly memento of the convict's awful
death.
The hour fixed for Gray's execution passed by—the
world was already dead to him; but had Mr. Trail,
the kind, the thoughtful, the unselfish, forgotten
him ?
How clear are the heavens! how serene and still !
how balmy the autumnal breeze of Kafirland.
Hark to the sullen roar of artillery close at hand !
It shakes the darkened hut of the poor prisoner.
Cries of anger and defiance disturb the silence of
the majestic hills; men rush by with clattering arms.
The dusky host has gathered on the mountain
slopes; they hover about in clouds. Gray recognizes
the well-known challenge, “Izapa!" it is answered by
a volley of musketry. Again the deep-mouthed guns
open wide their fiery throats, and a hearty English
cheer announces that shot and shell have told upon
the savage
foe.

But the wild war-cry rings out shrill and strong
again; it draws nearer, and is answered by the
Fingoes.
Gray could see but little from the aperture of his
hut. He noticed though that the Kafirs, emboldened
by their superiority of numbers, came muzzle to muz-
zle with the infantry; they grappled with the soldiers,
they snapped their reed-like assegais in two and gave
back stab for stab; they gibbered, they leaped, they
dropped as if dead into the bush, only to rise the next
moment and wound their adversaries in the back ; they
came bounding down the hills in fresh bodies, among
which the British artillery soon began to make havoc ;
but, for those that fell, numbers started from behind
the rocks and shrubs, and dashed forward to the
onslaught.
They stepped into the open ground. Up rose the
warlike Fingoes from beneath their shields! Their
spears glittered in the glowing sun; the mass extended,
it spread east and west, and they advanced to the
charge.
Slave and master meet in the deadly strife! How
the dark eyes of each glare with vengeance and detest-
ation ! but the Fingoes not only know the warfare of
their enemy, they also fight with the skill and coolness
of the British. They will die rather than yield, for
they feel that to surrender were worse than death.
And they do conquer, before the outlying picquets
posted in the mountain glens, by the experienced
orders of Sir Adrian Fairfax, emerge from their ambush
to meet the retiring warriors.
It was a deadly struggle. The Kafirs, beaten back
from the encampment, hoped to find safe shelter in
their strongholds; but Sir Adrian's policy was as deep
as their own. He, too, had had his spies scattered
through the land; and albeit these specious savages
had sworn to sit still-had humbled themselves like
dogs, and sworn by the bones of their dead chiefs to
keep faith, he knew that when they professed most

they meant least; and, on being informed that Sir
John Manvers's large force was scattered, and that
some of the burghers had anticipated their dispersion,
and were about to depart, he hurried his march, after
closing his treaties with the Boers, whom he contrived
also to conciliate, and made such an admirable dispo-
sition of his troops that the Kafirs were deceived com-
pletely.
The soldiers, dispersed among the kloofs, appeared
to the Gaikas to be making roads and hewing wood:
they little knew that, at a certain sound of the bugle,
they would be up and ready at any hour of the day or
night.
Hundreds of the enemy were left dead, after the
action, near Sir John Manvers’s camp: and, alas!
many a family in England, whose best sympathies had
been enlisted in favour of this “ill-used race,
from their land"_" a peaceful, inoffensive people, ask-
ing only grass for their cattle," mourned the loss of a
gallant son or brother shot down or assegaied by these
cunning and untameable beings.
And all day long, and through the dark night, the
wailing cry of women mourning for their dead re-
sounded in the mountains, and, lo! from the British
camp the triumphant chorus of the Fingoes answered it.
The enemy were beaten, and councils were held,
and the warriors crawled to the feet of their “ white
Father," and prayed to be forgiven as little children!
But melancholy experience teaches us the value of
a Kafir's word !

A little pyramid marks the spot where, on the even-

dug a grave for the comrades who had fallen in the fray.
There are other monuments around it, for a town

sward, and a church is rising in the midst. Within it

is a grand monument to the memory of Sir John
Manvers, who died ere the body of his murdered son
was brought into the encampment.
Divided in their lives, are they united in eternity?
Within the encampment there were no great signs
of the struggle which had taken place on the preceding
day. On the contrary, there was an unusual stillness
about it, for short and conclusive as had been the
battle, the heavy wings of Death had cast a dark
shadow on the scene, which had its influence on all.
The cottages were closed, there were no people at
work in the gardens, men spoke apart and in whispers,
and, though morning was in her prime, a stillness like
that of night prevailed.
Presently, there came forth from the tents soldiers
fully accoutred; then their officers; next Sir Adrian
Fairfax and his staff. All wore the same grave aspect.
But the brilliant uniforms, the glittering arms, the
waving plumes, made a dazzling array, as the troops
fell in and formed three sides of a square.
Nine or ten men stepped out from the rest.
Beyond the soldiery, were the Fingo warriors, seated
on the turf; and a few Kafir women and children
looked from the hills upon the scene, which they
could not understand, for, with arms bound, and head
uncovered, there walked into the square a young man,
whose whole air and aspect bespoke him anything but
a malefactor—a rebel doomed to die: it was Gray!
Mr. Trail was with him. The prisoner advanced
with steady step, but the flush of shame overspread
his face, as he felt that the gaze of hundreds was fixed
He would have read sincere and sorrowful
pity in that gaze, had he seen it, but his eyes were
fixed upon the ground.
Anon, there swelled upon the air that solemn march
for the dead that thrills to the very soul when we hear
upon him.

it. The sudden burst of the drum startled the pri-
soner, and he looked up. He saw his coffin borne
before him; he moved on mechanically to the time of the
wailing music; he passed the long lines of soldiers;
he did not lose his presence of mind. As he drew near
Sir Adrian Fairfax, he raised his eyes for an instant,
and lifting his fettered hands, bowed on them. Frank-
fort's heart beat with the dread of being overcome to
tears; Colonel Graham brushed the drops away from
his eyes, and one young soldier fainted in the ranks.
All at last was ready; the drum ceased to beat.
The prisoner's eyes were bound: it was observed
that he cast one long, lingering look upon the bright
and lovely scenes around him, ere this was done.
He wished to take a last look of earth!
He was told that some moments would be allowed
him for prayer at the last. He pressed Mr. Trail's
hands withiu his own, and the good minister left him.
The lightest whisper might have been heard while
the prisoner was absorbed in prayer.
He never
moved when the firing party knelt down, although
their arms and accoutrements broke the silence
sharply. The officer in command of this party uttered
the word, “ Ready!” in a voice so clear that it pene-
trated to the farthest in the ranks.
Did Gray hear it? None could tell.
“ Present!”—he heard that, for he lifted his head
and dropped his hands before him, awaiting the fiery
shower of musketry.
Still, not a movement in those disciplined ranks!
“ Prisoner!
It was another voice that spoke.
The General had bid the party wait his order to fire,
and, lest
any fatal error should occur, had warned the
men, that he should step before them to address the
prisoner.—“Remember,” said Sir Adrian, "if you do
not strictly adhere to my orders, you will shoot me.”
None but the firing party and Mr. Trail were
prepared for this pause in the ceremonial.

" Prisoner"-
Gray remained kneeling, but bent his head in
recognition of the voice addressing him.
“ The offence of which you were found guilty on
the-th of — should have been punished yester-
day by death ; but the events of that day delayed your
doom. Extenuating circumstances induced your
merciful judges to reconsider your case, and finally
to accept your own assertions as evidence in your
favour. God is the judge of your word, whether true
or false. In the name then of Him, who loves mercy
better than sacrifice, I entreat you to redeem your
past errors by a deep repentance. Prisoner, rise !
you are pardoned!”
Some one removed the bandage from Gray's eyes-
the light dazzled them—he could see nothing; but,
though faint and powerless, he knew it was in Mr.
Trail's kind arms that he reclined.
He heard the clattering arms of the dispersing
soldiers, and the drums and fifes beating merry time
in marching off the ground, but he felt utterly unable
to help himself. He was lifted up-he fainted as
they carried him away, and on reviving, found himself
in the little room he had occupied in Mr. Trail's
cottage.
But it was strangely metamorphosed -a carpet
covered the hitherto matted - file
snowy curtains
shaded the small windows, there were books on the
table, and a glass with wild flowers, and, beside the sofa
on which he leaned, stood a lady tall and fair, who
looked to him like some ministering angel.
It was Lady Amabel Fairfax.
Peace was proclaimed in Kafirland-peace for a
time.
There were busy artificers on the camp-ground;
fortifications were in progress, and traders were open-

ing their stores. Everything gave promise of esta-
blishing a thriving town; wagons were winding down
the green slopes of the western hills, and fine herds
of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats were passing
through on their way to fresh pasture-lands.
A cumbrous and old-fashioned, but comfortable,
English carriage with four fine horses stood at the
gate of the Daveneys' cottage. Ormsby, somewhat
wasted by his wounds-happily the one on the temple,
was but a cut from a passing assegai-led Lady
Amabel to her equipage, and Mr. Daveney followed,
leading Eleanor in deep mourning. Major Frankfort
stood at the gate with Sir Adrian; he gave his hand
to Lady Amabel—she felt it tremble.
He could not see Eleanor's face, it was closely
veiled; they had never met since that fearful night at
Annerley, but now she held her hand out to him. He
heard her utter the word “ Farewell.”
Sir Adrian shook hands with him, and Lady Amabel
leaned forward to say “God bless you.
But Frankfort answered not a word.
“Farewell.” In after-years, in the deep solitude of
midnight, on the sea, in the still noon of summer days
in English woods, where he loved to cast himself
beneath the umbrageous oaks, and dream of Kafir-
land, that soft and sorrowful voice still whispered
“ Farewell.”
Lady Amabel retired with her young and mourning
guest to the shades of Newlands. Eleanor never
accompanied her friend to the busy scenes of Govern-
ment House. Her father and mother soon established
themselves in a lovely spot within a day's journey of
Cape Town, and here she hoped to find that seclusion
and repose, which she had vainly sought before.
Marion and Ormsby were married, and embarked
for England; soon afterwards, Lady Amabel and
Eleanor bade them adieu, as they stepped into the
boat awaiting them in the treacherous waters of Table
Bay; poor Marion's cheeks were flooded with tears.

Eleanor was calm and pale, but it seemed now as
though she never could weep.
Lady Amabel longed to see some change in her
demeanour, but nothing seemed to move her. The
evening after her sister's departure she sat so still
within the embrasure of a window, that her kind friend
thought she must be asleep; but no, the large mourn-
ful orbs were fixed on the darkening heavens in which
the sentinel stars were mustering their radiant hosts.
Her thoughts were not of earth—they were with her
angel boy—her lost Francis-that link between her-
self and the mysterious world, of which we know
nothing, save that there is no sin there, and therefore
no sorrow.
The dwelling purchased and improved by the
Daveneys commanded a magnificent view of the sea.
Eleanor sat in one of her mournful reveries, as was
usual with her at eventide. In the daytime she
resolutely employed herself--mechanically, if possible.
She never sang now, but she would play whole pages
of difficult music, then work in the garden ; walking,
or riding for miles with her father, filled up the after-
noons; but the evening time was truly the dark hour
with her. She loved best to be alone at this time.
So there she sat, her book dropped listlessly on
her knee, and her melancholy gaze fastened on the
shining waters of the moonlit ocean, that washed the
rocky boundary of the grounds she had helped to
fashion and to plant with orange-groves,
Her father and mother were in an adjoining room;
she heard a door open, and some one, not of the
household, spoke in a low voice; but she recognized it
--it was May's.
She went to meet him, and give him welcome; the
poor little bushman cried and laughed with joy.
And Fitje came, and Ellen, and they sat down in
the door-way, and said they would stay, if they might.

May was going to Cape Town, and would come back
again, and be gardener and groom, and everything, if
Mr. Daveney would have him.
Going to Cape Town ?”
“Yes, with Master Master Frankfort." They
were travelling by land from Algoa Bay, and had come
to see the Knysna River, and May had a letter for the
Bass. It contained an inclosure.
Eleanor retreated into the other room.
Eleanor's Note to Frankfort.
“ Most generous Friend,–
“I love you too well to take undue advantage of
your kindness. Return to England; there, earlier and
happier impressions may be revived; and although I
would not have you forget me, think only of the
unfortunate Eleanor as one whose hopes are fixed on
Heaven.
" Farewell.”

The Trails, weary with the repeated aggressions on
their property in Kafirland, came nearer the civilized
districts of the Cape; they established a mission and
a school within a few miles of the Knysna River. A
young assistant of Mr. Trail's attracted the notice of
all the farmers' daughters around, but he paid no heed,
did “ that handsome young teacher,” to the bright
glances aimed at him. He seldom entered the houses
of the richer settlers, except in cases of sickness, when
Mr. Trail was absent from home.
The Vanbloems had returned to an old family farm,
which they had deserted in the hopes of bettering
themselves by seeking "larger pastures;" they wero
wiser than their rebellious brethren, for, instead of
flying beyond the boundary, they retreated to their

original settlement, and contented themselves with
less land but surer ground. I speak of the elder
Vanbloem, with whom Frankfort and Ormsby made
acquaintance in their first days of travelling.
Gray—for he was the young teacher-had resolved
one day on asking Mr. Trail to make some inquiries
of Amayeka, albeit he dreaded the issue of such
inquiry.
Poor Amayeka !--Surely the younger Vanbloems
had not deserted her; but she might have been taken
from them by violence.
That day old Vanbloem came to tell Mr. Trail that
his son's wagon was outspanned in a valley an hour's
ride from the station; he and some neighbours were
going to meet him, would Mr. Trail go too ?
The party passed the mission station that evening;
there were horsemen and wagons, quite a cavalcade-
for some one from every family had gone out to wel-
come the new-comers, returning to the land of their
forefathers.
It was dusk when Mr. Trail returned home; Gray
started on hearing his master's voice.
“ Master”—so he called the missionary—“master,
are there bad tidings ?-has she survived the fury of
her people ?”
“Come hither, Gray,” said Mr. Trail; “Amayeka
is here."
Meek and trembling, poor Amayeka had seated
herself on the lowest step of the stoep; her head was
bent low, and her cloak drawn around her.
Amayeka," said Mr. Trail, “rise, and come in.”
She shook her head, and crouched lower.
Master," whispered she, “I am ashamed-
Amayeka,” said another voice beside her.
Mr. Trail had prepared her to meet her lover.
He left them together.

strange wedding; the young English teacher was to
be married to a Kafir girl—it was quite true.
At first the settlers in the neighbourhood turned
away their heads when the young teacher and his
dusky wife passed them by; but Amayeka was so
humble, so industrious, so neat, what could be said
against her?
Mrs. Trail helped her to establish a school. To look
into her room on Sabbath nights, and see her the centre
of a crowd of children, would do your heart good.
She is no longer young—at thirty the women of her
race are old—but her voice is musical and girlish as
ever ;
to hear her and her husband lead-
ing the Evening Hymn, you would never recognize, in
the grave and neatly-dressed catechist and his wife,
the young unhappy pair whom I once introduced to

Kafirland, with the eyes of the Wizard Amani glaring

Ormsby's patrimony was large; his family at first
were disposed to receive his wife with hauteur—they
were among that class of English owls who fancy
themselves eagles, especially in their own county.
Ormsby took possession of his fine estate, and left
the army, glad that he had been a soldier for many
reasons; but, above all, because he had thus been
given the means of finding a fair and happy-tempered
wife in Kafirland. He made his sisters welcome to
Ormsby Park, and they confessed, among their
country friends, that she was to be “ tolerated.”
Frankfort's cousin, the Duchess, the former friend
of Mrs. Daveney, begged to be introduced to young
Mrs. Ormsby at a ball, and asked affectionately about
her mother's welfare. The Duchess was childless, had
led “the most monotonous life in the world;" she
was dying to hear of Kafirland.
“ Did the people there live on the white men they

killed in war time? and how was it that Marion was
so fair, and would Mr. and Mrs. Daveney ever come
to England again ?” &c.
“Yes; Marion expected them to spend a year
with
her, and, after that, they would return; for her father
and mother had many interests and occupations in
Southern Africa which they would not wish to give
up.”
66
“ Interests and occupations!”--the Duchess yawned,
and begged Mr. Ormsby to find her carriage, and
was glad the ball was over ; but it was marked by
one pleasant fact, that of meeting Marion, the daugh-
ter of her old friend.”
They shook hands cordially.
“Who on earth is the Duchess of M---- shaking
hands with so heartily ?” said the member's wife.
“Mrs. Ormsby, of Ormsby Park.”
“Oh! yes; the uncle is dead, and has left young
Ormsby seven thousand a year, has he not ?"
“Nine, they say," replied the other speaker.
“Dear me, how fortunate !-his wife is pretty,
rather;
I should like to know her.”
*
Summer was dying in all her pomp, the woods of
Ormsby were arrayed in their mantles of green and
gold and crimson and rich brown; the shadows
from the old oaks were lengthening on the grass, when
the lodge-gates were thrown open to admit the car-
riage which had been sent to Portsmouth to meet
the voyagers from Kafirland.
A touch of the old ambitious feeling thrilled
through Mrs. Daveney's heart, as the elegant
equipage swept along the noble aisles of horse-
chestnut trees and beeches, through which the man-
sion, with windows illuminated by the setting sun,
showed fair and stately.
But Eleanor's face was opposite, revealing its
mournful history of past suffering. It had lost its
look of anxiety, and something like pleasure shone in

the large dark orbs as they caught sight of Marion's
home, and her sister and husband, with Marmion
between them, in the open doorway, waving their
handkerchiefs.
Who thought that, instead of an embowered porch,
rudely built and thatched with rushes, they now met
beneath the stately colonnade of a noble mansion !
Oh! those precious meetings, when the sea has long
divided us.
The cultivated lands of England ! the fields
crowded with reapers ! the heavily-laden wains-
women and youths and children singing along the
roads, as if rejoicing in the plentiful harvest; the
noble woods, stretching afar, and glowing in the
mellow light of autumn !-all contributed to bring
repose to Eleanor's soul. She lived a new life--she
seemed to begin a new career in a new world.
Here she was indeed at peace-no fearful storms,
no savage war-cry, no dread of an enemy stalking in
and making desolate the hearth! The space between
her and the past seemed suddenly widened.
Sir Adrian and Lady Amabel were of the party;
there were no strangers-neighbours there were none
within five miles.
The events of former years were scarcely ever
alluded to; Marion's twins were painfully like their
little cousin buried in the African desert; but no one
spoke of him. The children lived almost in Eleanor's
room,
One evening, after she had gone upstairs to dress
for dinner, these little creatures detained her till the
second bell rang. Her hair was hanging over her
dressing-gown, and, finding that she could not possibly
be in time, she ran to Marion to say she would join
the little circle at tea.
“ Marion! Marion!” — but Marion had gone.
Ormsby's study door was open; there was a light
within! She called to him-no answer.

The children ran up to her; they threw the door
wide open; two wax-lights were burning on the table,
and before the fire stood Frankfort.
And for the first time for many long years Eleanor
uttered a cry of joy.
She forgot that she was in her dressing-gown, that
her hair hung disordered about her, that the children
were half-frightened at the sight of a stranger.
Frankfort opened his arms again to her
“ Never again to part, Eleanor,” said he.
Never, never,” she answered.
He strained her to his breast, and her tears of un-
utterable joy mingled with his kisses.

When Colonel Frankfort had been married a year
or two, people who had been mystified about Mrs.
Lyle's widowhood forgot everything but that she was
the sweetest and gentlest and most lowly-mannered
lady they had ever seen. The old air of melancholy
was so habitual to her, she would have been less
charming without it. The sisters were near neigh-
bours during half the year, and for one month in their
lives were united with all their South African friends ;
for the Daveneys paid another visit to England, and
the Trails accompanied them. May and Fitje and
Ellen were

brought them home as honest and rare specimens of
what Christianity had done for South Africa. Grav

Not long since, I saw two charming pictures of the
sisters in the exhibition of the Royal Academy. They
were in the characters of Day and Night. I recognized
them, though they were not mentioned by name in
the catalogue. Marion stood in the sunlight, with a
smile on her face and the glow of summer on her
azure scarf. Eleanor was seated in the shade of twi.
light, with the sea in the distance, and a star rising
over her head and irradiating her pale and thoughtful
brow.
Were her thoughts wandering over those shining
depths to the wilderness where her boy lay buried far
kindred ?
I heard a deep sigh behind me as I stood contem-
plating these sweet portraits. I turned, and recognized
in the somewhat roué-looking young man behind me
Clarence Fairfax. A celebrated danseuse of the day
hung upon his arm, but she was too much occupied
with another admirer to notice his abstracted gaze.
I hope Eleanor did not meet this idol of her former
fancy. I saw her five minutes after with her husband
and sister. Her veil was down, and I could only hear
the music of her gentle and cordial salutation. And
then, as exciting intelligence from Southern Africa
was filling the papers of the day, she asked, “Is there
any news from Kafirland ?”

DEDICATION.
TO THOMAS PRINGLE, Esq.*
MY DEAR PRINGLE-I am gazing just now from the upper
windows of my habitation. A waste of snow extends before
and around, as far as the eye can reach, and being unrelieved
and unbroken either by hills, or valleys, or trees, it looks
like a winding-sheet hiding the features of the dead. There
is not a cloud in the sky-or rather all is cloud, and of that
dull, grey, dismal hue, to which black itself is something gay
and lively. Through this solid barrier the sun can no more
insinuate himself than he who died a-Wednesday can walk
forth from his leaden coffin. The snow, therefore, has nothing
dazzling in its whiteness, and the unwounded eye is at liberty
to pursue its career over the interminable plain, till it returns
of its own accord in weariness and satiety. It is necessary
to remind you that my hermitage is not perched near the
borders, nor upon the bosom of the frozen sea, but in delight-
ful France, and within a short walk of the grave of our
Norman William.
Six weeks ago, having succeeded in scraping an eye-hole
with my nail upon the frozen window, I was earnestly em-
ployed in observing the same amusing scene, when the hue

of the snow, as I gazed, seemed gradually to approximate to
that of the clouds; its uriformity of tint disappeared; and
the colouring matter, if matter it be, appeared to move, and
roll, and break, like waves of the sea. Presently the agita-
tion subsided; but, instead of sinking into its former level,
like the ocean, when the wind has died away, the surface
before me was broken into darker and loftier points, and into
deep lines of shadow, intersecting each other at every imagi-
nable angle, and conveying the idea of innumerable streets,
and terraces, and squares, and spires. The next day the
same illusion was repeated, but with greater vividness. A
wilderness of houses seemed to stand before me; towers,
domes, and columns rose proudly amidst the throng; the
earth was cumbered with the shadowy load, and the heavens
pierced with its jagged outline. On the third day, in addi-
tion to all, and more than all I had before observed, one huge
dark dome rose like a giant in the very middle of the picture.
I could feel my heart beat, my cheek flush, and my eyes
sparkle without knowing why; till at length a sudden light
seemed to circle--waver--fix above its monstrous head; and,
as a Golden Cross, rising from a Golden Ball, became dis-
tinctly visible, I knew that the edifice before me was St.
Paul's Cathedral, and the city it commanded and adorned,
the mighty Babylon of the earth.
My idleness was no more the idleness of ennui; my waking
dreams were filled, not with shadows, but realities; I lived
over again my years of metropolitan adventure; I walked
again with the strange comrades I had fallen in with on my
way; my thoughts rioted on the past, and my pen, ever too
ready to follow my thoughts, committed the medley to paper.
In the following sheets I present you with a group cut out of
the back ground of the picture. The characters, whether
natural or not, are drawn from nature, and the greater part
of the action is culled from the history of those on whose
veracity I can place reliance.

valrous adventurers, who rush every day from the extremities

PREFACE.
THE GAME OF LIFE was originally published by a fashion-
able bookseller, who was probably ashamed of its vulgarity,
for he dropped it at once; and the author was complimented
by a fashionable critic, with what was meant to be a bitter
sneer, on having rendered it obvious, by the truthfulness of
his pictures, that he was himself the hero of the tale.
If the notion of the critic were correct, the hero would
have been endowed with fewer good qualities, and his mis-
fortunes, of whatever kind they might be, would have ap-
peared to be more his own fault. The author, from circum-
stances and the wilfulness of youth, was early thrown upon
his own resources; and, although he would at any time have
been received with joy and welcoming into the bosom of a
family of love in another part of the country, having set
his life upon a cast,” he resolved to “stand the hazard of the
die.” He committed the grand and often fatal blunder, of
sacrificing his other prospects in life. to his attachment to
Literature; and, as it usually happens, the more complete
was his discomfiture, the more tormenting his vexations and
anxieties, the deeper his indignities and degradations, he
clung all the more firmly to his thankless mistress.

PREFACE.
During the continuance of such struggles—which, in the
case of those who are destined to surmount them, run almost
a regular course—he enjoyed an opportunity of seeing the
world in a strange variety of phases at the same moment.
There is no walk in life which affords so great an insight
into the general constitution of society as literature. The
literary man is a gentleman by courtesy.
He is not
patronised, it is true, by the government, and not often in-
vited to dinner by the great; but he has the entrée both of
the drawing-room and the study, in addition to the thousand
haunts into which he is led by poverty or curiosity. The
great safe-guard of his character, the author can undertake
to say, is PRIDE. If—to use a vulgar phrase—he “lets him-
self down,” he is lost. When a man sinks from good society
into bad, he blames the world for its reverses, but it is a
proof of nothing more than that he has forfeited his own
esteem. In London many a "gentleman" is seen mingling
with an untroubled brow in the assemblies of the gay and
the fair, who might be traced to a home as wretched as that
of the hero of the tale.
It is not pretended, however, that any of the characters
in the following pages are literary men: they are merely
probationers of literature, and form a far more numerous
class than the other. Most of them die in youth, and leave
behind only the select few who are destined to become
literary men. Even in this lower grade, however, there is a
striking distinction between them and the vulgar of other
classes. There is always a remnant of high feeling, even in
their lowest degradation. The author of the GAME OF LIFE,
soon after the book was published, met in the street the pro-
totype of one of the principal personages, in the form of as
hopeless a desperado as ever figured in the dock of the Old
Bailey. The poor fellow stopped-for the first time he had
done so for years and referring hastily to some revelations
(not personal) in the tale, exclaimed, while a deep blush
mantled over features that were begrimed with dirt and
intemperance, "By – that is too bad!"

PREFACE.

The author is sensible, that since this book was first pub-
lished a considerable revolution has taken place in literature
and that to gratify the taste of the public now it would be
necessary to make some of his unfortunate or dissipated
adventurers, preternatural villains, and convert the haunts of
poverty into dens of crime. A proverb says that there is
no disputing of taste; and yet we cannot help suggesting
that it is the province of romance to follow nature in her
general aspects. He never happened himself to fall in with
a man or a class either wholly good or wholly bad; and, in
that portion of society into which his tale has led him,
although the higher qualities of virtue may be rare, crime is
still rarer.

EVERY body knows the village of Dornton. It is
situated on the road from Bath to London, (as the
Gazetteer hath it,) and who has not travelled from
Bath to London? It consists of some two or three
dozen houses placed parallel with the road on either
side, the vista closed in the townward direction by a
church, somewhat large for the place; and in the other
by an eminence approaching to the character of a hill,
around the base of which sweeps the mail-coach road.

The church, in architecture, is a mere steeple-house ;
it is neither old nor new; neither possessing attractions
for the antiquary by its connexion with past times,
nor for the mere man of to-day, as belonging peculiarly
to his own.
The other buildings which
constitute the
village are in no manner different from those of other
villages, except in the total want of that picturesque
appearance which sometimes marks the abode of the
poorer and more solitary classes ; nor are they dis-
tinguished from each other but as being in some in-
stances houses of one story, and in others houses of
two. There are no gentlemen's seats in the immediate
neighbourhood, nor is there much of that sort of
scenery which draws the wealthy lover of nature away
from the busier congregations of his kind. The village
of Dornton is, in short, one of those places at which the
traveller pauses to wonder what motive could have in-
duced its founders to choose for their abiding place,
from among all the fair valleys and fertile plains of
merry England, a spot so utterly destitute of human
and natural interest.
On the side of the hill mentioned as forming a termi-
nation to the vista through the village, stood a tene-
ment somewhat larger than the others, and which
though not arriving, even with the assistance of its
neat inclosures and Lilliputian lawn, at the dignity of
a gentleman's seat, yet presented an appearance of
absolute gentility when compared with its ruder neigh-
bours. The avenue ran up from the road in the most
direct and business-like manner possible, as if in utter
contempt of the line of beauty, and altogether the
arrangements bore the stamp of a taste more formal
than fashionable. The owner and occupier of this
mansion, which was known by the name of The
Mount, was Mr. Vesper, a gentleman of whom, for
reasons which will be speedily apparent, we must in
this place proceed to give some account. His family
was so inconsiderable, that his origin could never be

traced beyond his grandfather. His father had been
in some small
way
of business—a shopkeeper, we are
afraid—in a neighbouring town, in which he had
promised himself the assistance of his two sons when
the infirmities of age or ill health might render himself
incapable of active exertion. His parental anticipa-
tions, however, were never realized. His eldest and
favourite son, a fine youth, just rising into manhood,
with character and prospects, according to his humble
station in life, as fair even as father could wish, fell,
by some unaccountable imprudence, into association
with companions of low and desperate habits; and
gradually sinking from comparative respectability into
contempt, at length fled from his friends and native
place, not again to return. Into this dismal fall it
was supposed he was precipitated by the example or
seductions of a young man of somewhat better fortune
and prospects, whose name was Wilkins. Wilkins,
who was imagined at first to be led into vice by the
mere exuberance of his animal spirits, turned out a
very desperate character, and owed his life, it was said,
to the benevolence of a gentleman of high respecta-
bility, called Fisher, who declined prosecuting him for
a robbery, aggravated by assault, although he was
taken in the fact. As for Vesper, he closed the cata-
logue of his crimes in this country, by marrying under
a false character and name a beautiful girl of good
family, whom he deserted when in a state of preg-
nancy; and all that could be learnt of him afterwards
was, that he found his way by some means to America,
where he died.
The unhappy father did not live long after, and the
younger son was thus thrown loose upon the world,
without friends or money, at an age when the counsels
of experience and the restraining hand of parental
authority are most wanted. His life, however, was
destined to be in many respects the reverse of that of
his brother's. The terrible example was not thrown

away upon him, nor were the months which he spent
at the bed-side of his dying and broken-hearted father,
Their little fortune had been much injured by the ex-
cesses of the unfortunate youth, and was almost totally
exhausted by the old man's illness; it may be supposed,
therefore, that the bed of sickness and death was not
frequently surrounded by sympathizing friends. The
misfortunes of the family had at first attracted some
interest. The shutting up of the shop, so long the
scene of late and early industry, excited the pity and
curiosity of the neighbourhood, and the father and son
were followed to the obscure lodging they chose, with
kind inquiries and condolence. These, as time rolled
on became fewer and fainter; the old man did not get
better, and the son was seen seldomer out, so that both
at last were almost forgotten.
To minister to his father's wants was now William
Vesper's only business, and to read to him his only
amusement. The book in most cases easiest of at-
tainment is the best, and the Bible, which he took up
at first in filial obedience, with a feeling almost
amounting to disgust, became speedily a source of
comfort and recreation even to himself. With the
progress of his disease, the sick man's mental faculties
became disturbed, and, reverting in the aberrations of
his mind to the scenes and circumstances of his former
hopes, the poor father would fancy himself still the
master of his little business, issue his commands with
a melancholy air of pride, and call to his assistants by
their names, sometimes with reproach for their idle-
ness, and sometimes with encouragement.
But the name most frequently in his mouth on such
occasions, was that of his lost and darling son, and he
would struggle vehemently with the suggestions of re-
turning reason, as it would force upon him, as if in
the person of another, the fatal reality.
“It is false,” he would cry, “ he has not forsaken
his poor, fond father! You are all in league against

him: you hate him because he is so beautiful, and
proud-looking. Tush, tush, what are the follies of a
boy? When his head is as grey as mine he will know
better. But he shall not drink, nor swear, nor stay
out of nights any more; I will call him this moment
and scold him soundly. Henry! Henry! What, not
within? Well, wait a little, he will come presently;
he is only at the fair or the tavern. Why does he not
come? It cannot be true that he has left me! Is it,
indeed? Well—well—well! Oh, Henry, my son, my
son!” And as the fatal truth broke upon his reco-
vered reason, the poor old man would throw himself
back on the bed, from which he had raised himself to
look out for the coming of him who once would not,
and now could not hear, and give way to the most pas-
sionate lamentations. It was the custom of William,
when he began to read to his father any of the books
of the New Testament, to go regularly through, al-
though necessarily meeting with many passages in
documents coming so home to the business and bosoms
of all men, which severely probed the yet bleeding
wound; and one night when the invalid, although
calm, was somewhat worse than usual, it was with a
pause of dismay, he beheld the well known title of the
chapter, following the one he had just finished: “The
parable of the Prodigal Son.”
He looked at his father, but the old man seemed in-
tently listening for the continuance of the reading, his
eyes turned towards him with even more intelligence
than usual, and he went on, but in a lower voice, and
turning by fits a timid look towards the bed, to watch
the effect which might be produced. At the account
of the prodigal's sufferings in a far country, he could
see his father's lips tremble, and his breast heave; but
when he came to the return of the wanderer, where it
is said, “When he was yet a great way off, his father
saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his
neck, and kissed him,” the old man raised himself up

on his pillow, and bending his dim eyes on vacancy, as
if it contained some real presence, and stretching forth
his shrivelled arms as to some palpable embrace, would
have fallen from the bed, had he not been caught in
the arms of his son. It was strange to witness the
magical effect of imagination, in converting everything
to its own purpose; changing even palpable and accus-
tomed forms into its own phantasms, and peopling the
void of that small chamber with its visionary creations.
“ Henry,” said the old man, looking fondly up in
William's face, “it was not well done to leave your
poor father, but you are sorry for it-you weep. Well,
well, we'll talk no more of it; it is forgotten and for-
given, and we shall all be happier than ever. But
who is this?” he continued, turning his head.
I forgot--you are married, and that lady with her long
dark hair, and snow-white hands, is the bride of my
Henry. Another? What small face is this, looking
up to me with its innocent eyes ? mine are so dim now,
and yet I can see Henry in every feature. William,
too, he was ever with me,' and must be with me to
the last. Bless ye, my sons, and my daughter; bless
thee, sweet little one; bless-bless all!” William al-
lowed his father's head to sink slowly from his arms,
and received his last gentle sigh as it touched the
pillow.
As we have more to do with the afternoon, than
with the morning of William Vesper's life, we must be
permitted to pass lightly over the rest of his history
till he is wanted for the purposes of our tale.
In turning from the situation in which we have just
left him, to view him as the master of The Mount, at
Dornton, a superficial observer would be apt to infer
that it must have been a train of fortunate circum-
stanoes which conducted him to such comparative, and
indeed, positive independence. But if it suited us to
depict individually the struggles of the poor and friend-

flict of an upright and virtuous mind, amidst the
servile, the crafty, and the base; the bitter communings
of a spirit overshadowed even in its noon of strength
by misfortune, when surrounded by the frivolous, the
idle, and the dissipated, another view of the question
might be taken. The impression made on him by the
death-scene we have described, was never effaced. He
seemed as if surrounded wherever he went by the
phantoms conjured up by the diseased imagination of
his father, and for many years after, every strange
face he saw brought some token of it home to his re-
membrance. Often has he stood still in the crowded
street, to gaze after some form as it glanced past him,
which seemed to resemble the lady with her “ long
dark hair and snow-white hands,” who was to him no
creature of the fancy; and many a mother has been
made proud by his inquiries after her little one, in
whose innocent eyes” he detected some resemblance
to his lost brother.
In the mean time, however, years rolled
on,
tidings reached him respecting the forsaken family.
Years rolled on, bringing with them even more than
their usual complement of cares, vexations, and disap-
pointments, and even fewer of their compensating
enjoyments. Love passages, too_and in whose life
are they wanting? came in the midst, and in them also
Vesper was unfortunate: but these are matters of every
day, too stale and common to awaken the sympathy of
the most confirmed novel reader. It was long after
this disappointment, that an opportunity occurred of
naturally assisting a friend, by exchanging the small
· sum of money he had by that time acquired, and
which was nearly the whole of his worldly possessions,
for some landed property in the neighbourhood of
Dornton,
When he went to take possession of his Lilliputian
estate, it was not with the intention of living there,
nor had he even formed a resolution to relinquish the

cares of business, and sit down contented with the small
acquisitions he had made. But the most important
events in a man's life are frequently brought about by
trifles, or by circumstances which might seem to a
looker-on to be the least calculated to produce them.
The very bleakness of the prospect that met his view,
when looking out from the cottage window, and the
dull uninteresting appearance of the village, were
positive attractions to him in his present mood of
mind.
“ I can live here,” said he, “and what more could
I do elsewhere? I have already some books, and can
still afford to purchase more; I shall have leisure to
indulge my own thoughts, and money to procure, in
the moderation I have ever accustomed myself to, my
own fancies. What if I have not yet reached the age
or the fortune when a man commonly thinks it time to
forsake the world: my wealth is equal to my wants ;
and if the first days of the years of my pilgrimage
have not been productive of much worldly happiness,
what could I expect for the remainder? It shall be
so: this is the first resting-place I have reached
which I could properly call my own: I am tired, and
will go no further.
In pursuance of this determination, Mr. Vesper set
himself seriously to prepare The Mount for his "win-
ter quarters," as he termed it, looking forward to the
dark and cold season of human life. This afforded
him occupation for some time, and even amusement;
then his books came into requisition, and the intended
additions to his library were to be carefully selected
and ordered ; by degrees he became acquainted with
the inhabitants of the village, and interested in their
little concerns and family matters, sometimes their
benefactor, as far as his limited means permitted, and
always their counsellor and friend. Nor was he himself
long in falling in with a friend—at least, if not with
a friend, in the most refined sense of the word-with

a companion. The curate was a well-disposed, and even
religious man, although not of the highest march of
intellect, and among his other aecomplishments played
an excellent hit at backgammon. Mr. Vesper, in
short, although we have not room to dilate upon the
nothings which filled up his life, found himself decidedly
within the region of old bachelorism, while hardly
conscious of the lapse of time which had taken place.
Even the love-passages hinted at above, were now
forgotten, or remembered only as the amusement of a
moment, when pacing backwards and forwards through
his little parlour, he busied himself in calling to mind
the adventures of his past life. This is the fate of
all our youthful feelings, however sweet or bitter
they may have been, yet it was not without a certain
sense of shame that Mr. Vesper recollected what
he now termed the silly exaggerations of fancy in re-
presenting the “ blow” as altogether irrecoverable,
and the gloom which darkened over his brow, as the
production of
“One fatal remembrance-one sorrow that throws
Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes;
O’er which life nothing brighter, nor darker can fling-
For which joy hath no balm, and affliction no sting.”
The early part of the day was devoted to healthful
labour, the evening to reading or conversation, and the
whole sanctified by a strict and methodical attention to
his moral and religious duties. Time flew away un-
heeded but not unimproved, and to all human appear-
ances Mr. Vesper was destined to pass his quiet, but
not useless life, undisturbed by the cares of the
world, and to sink at last into the
grave
attended only
by that calm regret which follows the good and respect-
able, who are without any of those nearer ties of
kindred and affection which render a man's life so
valuable and his death so calamitous. A circumstance

occurred, however, which overturned the equilibrium of
his mind, deranged his plans, and drove him from his
hermitage, at the age of fifty-five years, a sort of
knight-errant into the world.
His lost brother was at length heard of, but his
name was repeated only as the echo of a sound that
had passed by, for the owner was no more. Fortune
had rained treasures instead of curses upon him in the
New World; but his heart, as he became rich, did not
become more human. His home and his family were
forgotten to the last, and it was only when the event
of his struggle became certain that his thoughts were
borne across the Atlantic on the pinions of pity or re-
He divided his fortune, by will, in equal parts
between his brother and his child, either in compliance
with the common usages of men, or as an atoning act
of justice and mercy, and then calmly, as it was said,
resigned his soul to judgment. This is all that can be
said. We know nothing of his feelings while dictating
the will, nor of his mind's history since he quitted
Europe; he has left no justification upon record; he
was willing that, with regard to men at least, the tree
should lie where it fell--and let it do so. Mr.
Vesper renewed his exertions to trace out the family of
his brother, but without success; and when the
proper
time had elapsed, he found himself the undisputed
master of a handsome fortune. He enlarged his house,
as a matter of course, although it is not stated how
much his accession of wealth increased his physical
bulk; he extended his library, the home of his mind,
in proportion; he added many hundred of acres to his
demesne, and nearly a hundred names to his memo-
randum book of probation and beneficence, and then
he began again to play backgammon with the curate,
and argue, or rather lecture, on the motives and actions
of mankind.
Experience, however, in this sober game, seemed to
have quite the opposite effect to what it usually has;

23
for when he played, it was the oftener the worse; or
else his antagonist (which, by the way, was the curate's
own opinion) increased so marvellously in skill that it
was quite loss of time to contend with him. The
more books he bought, the seldomer he read; and the
more familiar access he obtained to other men's minds,
the more he indulged himself in the unsupported specu-
lations of his own. As the circle of his territory ex-
tended, his walks were contracted; and at length, in
proportion as the things that are usually the objects
of man's pride and ambition, spread rapidly over the
now considera ble area of his estate, he acquired the
habit of confining himself to the narrow limits of his
parlour, surrounded by books with uncut leaves, and
portfolios with untied strings.
His eyes, however, were much more excursive than
his feet; they dwelt for hours together on the far and
misty expanse of the world before him, which he could
see from the window spread out like a map; he became
curious in telescopes, which at such times of observa-
tion he seemed to use as reading glasses, and was as
diligently employed in watching the varying aspects of
distant objects as a mariner at sea. When he had
amused himself in this manner till amusement became
weariness, he would lay down his glass with a sigh,
and pace for another hour through his little chamber;
then the business of the day, and this word included
his charities, must be attended to; then his solitary
meal would while away another syllable of his unre-
corded time; then the dying daylight would draw him
again to the window to gaze on the distant world till
it withdrew from his vision into the shades of night;
and then darkness bringing forth her unnatural off-
spring, candlelight, would present the short round face
of the curate and the mimic volume, which, instead of
the National History it promised, only contained within
its chequered world the shadows of whole years of busy
idleness. The curate one evening was rubbing his

hands with glee at his own remarkable skill, or the
remarkable stupidity of his companion, which was
hurrying him on to a double triumph.
• Deuces, a pair?” cried the good man in a tran-
sport, “and almost the only covered point in my
chequer. Well, now it is my turn. Ah, poor dear
Mr. Vesper! I hold your destiny in the box, and out
it comes in the shape of defeat and dismay. But try
it again, good sir, just to exercise the elbow. Weil
done; you enter with both, but it was not in the dice
to do otherwise, every point being open. And now
for the last--quatre, cinq–a gammon, as I'm a sin-
ner!” and he threw himself back from his chair,
pushed his spectacles up from his overflowing eyes,
and emitted such a genuine, unsophisticated laugh of
good-humoured triumph and delight, as would have
made the demon of gaming, had he been looking on,
run out of hearing.
* Nay, now," said the winner, in a soothing tone,
when he had recovered from his ecstacy, “never take
it so to heart, man; there is a time coming for us all.
And yet, truth to speak, I get rather an overmatch
for
you
at the game: I think I improve. But you are
thoughtful, and, of a surety, to lose a gammon is
enough to make a man think! Is it the oversight you
committed, may I ask, in entering rather behind than
into the six point of my chequer when it was your cue
to run, that engages your meditations; or the extra-
ordinary perversity of the dice in turning up deuces
three times running when the point was a dead cover?
What are you thinking of?? continued the curate,
with startled emphasis, as he observed through his
spectacles an appearance of awkwardness and per-
plexity on the usually placid features of his friend.
“I am thinking,” said Mr. Vesper, slowly, “of the
resemblance which exists between this backgammon-
table and the great field of the world.” But this was
a resemblance which he had so often detected and en-

larged upon, that the curate thought no further remark
necessary than the common one of acquiescence, which
some people deem it becoming to make use of when
mankind is brought down from their stilts by' a de-
grading comparison.
“Ah, true,” said he,“ we are all blind, senseless
creatures—stocks and stones—stocks and stones: but
how? Well?” he continued, still bending forward,
with mouth half open to receive the reply, and his face
raised as if to admit of his seeing from beneath his
spectacles.
“I am thinking,” said Mr. Vesper, " that it would
be more interesting than a game at backgammon if
one could look on • amid the crowd, the strife, the
shock of men,' in some of the busier haunts of hu-
manity, without being personally engaged in the
struggle, and disturbed by the selfish feelings of indi-
vidual interest and preservation.”
“Very true, very true!” replied the curate; “but
how? well?”
“ When I was in the world,” continued Mr. Vesper,
“it was not as a looker-on but as an actor; my know-
ledge of mankind is therefore confined to the narrow
circle of the arena in which it was my lot to struggle
for life and bread, and even then my views of men and
things must have been influenced by prejudice, and
modified by my own individual character. I am now
rich. I have no one to care for: to become a second
self is the faculty of blinding or distorting the moral
optics—
“ And how? well?” said the curate, out of all pa-
tience, as Mr. Vesper stopped abruptly.
Ring!” said his friend, "the bell is behind you.”
But before the curate had half finished the motion of
turning round in his usual sedate and methodical man-
ner, Mr. Vesper had strided from the other side of the
table, laid hold of the tintinabulant appendage with
the grasp of a vice, and- sent such a larum peal

through the regions of the kitchen as had never been
heard before in the memory of Betty.
Betty!” said her master, as she entered the room
almost in the same instant, like a spirit conjured up
by the sound, holding still in her hand an empty tea-
saucer, from which she had been sipping her evening
beverage, its late contents being transferred to her
apron: ** Run down, Betty, to the “Griffin,' and en-
gage a seat for me in the mail to-morrow." Aghast
and bewildered, yet mechanically obeying, Betty started
off to execute the extraordinary commission, and her
feet in a moment were heard clattering along the
gravelled avenue.
“My worthy neighbour is clean distraught!"
thought the curate; "his mind has been wavering
these three weeks-ever since the dice began to go
against him; and now this unlucky gammon has
finished the business. "My excellent friend,” said he,
turning soothingly to the patient, “I will never

“Many, many, my dear sir!” said Mr. Vesper, his
awkwardness and embarrassment gone, and an air of
cheerful decision presiding over his manner.

by his friend's calmness. “Are you really going to

CHAPTER II.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE GAME.
It is necessary to know that there are thirty-six chances
upon two dice, and the points that are upon these thirty-six
chances are as follow:
HOYLE.
“THE world was all before him,'' but he knew no more
than the first traveller, Adam, “ where to choose.
He had not a single relation alive of consanguinity
near enough to warrant a visit, or of character inte-
resting enough to invite one ; and his early friendships
had been all dissolved long ago either by the touch of
death, or the as fatal intervention of living interest.
The distant world of society to him presented an ap-
pearance resembling that of the physical aspect of the
earth when the space selected by the eye is too far off
to be distinguished in its natural inequalities of height
and hollow. It was like an immense plain filled with
moving images, confused and indistinct, no individual
of which overtopped its fellows, or demanded peculiar
observation. But at length 'one spot on the dim sur-
face of the picture presented to his mind's eye, began
to assume a more definite character, and awaken a
more lively interest. The thought "recurred to him
again and again of her whom in fantastic youth his
imagination had exalted into a goddess; who had

sported with his happiness so cruelly, and left off
the fatal pastime so heartlessly; who was now a wife
and a mother, and in both situations an important link
in that chain of society from which he appeared to be
severed himself.
The Clives could not be rich, for when he knew
them, and this, by the way, was some twenty years
before, the husband was only a lieutenant in a march-
ing regiment, and a man of the most idle and dissipated
habits. Was he still alive? or had he died in youth,
and left the gay coquette the most miserable of all de-
pendants—a dependant on herself? Their son, the
infant he had once seen, when his heart still bowed in
recollected idolatry to the image of his lost Maria, had
he redeemed the promise of that early age? Had
heaven embued his heart with a portion of that Divine
Spirit which preserves it undefiled even by the vices of
a parént? Was he tall, and strong, and beautiful-
buoyant with youth and youthful hopes-rich in gene-
rous feelings, and pure and lofty aspirations? The
tears started into Mr. Vesper's eyes as a thousand
such questions swept across his mind, and he felt bit-
terly, for the first time, the loneliness of his own situa-
tiori. A thousand beautiful feelings arose and stirred
within him, useful and admirable when employed, like
the spirits of the wizard, but dangerous or fatal in
their idleness; and, as Michael Scott, for want of a
better task, assigned those troublesome slaves of his
art the never-ending duty of weaving ropes of the sea-
sand, to be unwoven again by the returning tide, so
our childless and solitary traveller satisfied the crav-
ings of his mind by acting the parent in his dreams,
which the very next day would probably dissolve for
Llanwellyn, a little town on the borders of Wales,
where he had heard the Clives resided, was the place
selected by Mr. Vesper for his outset in viewing the
world, The town was indeed small, and without much
ever.

dignity either of nature or art; but what of that?
This world is not built only of hills and houses ; the
spirit of man abides in its meanest village, and the
spirit of God surrounds the whole like an atmosphere.
It is constructed, in its noblest part, not of the piled
stones of architecture, or the still more stupendous
materials of external nature, but of human feelings
and sentiments and passions, of hopes and fears, of
love and joy, and grief, and triumph, and despair. At
Llanwellyn, therefore, the traveller descended from the
coach on the evening following the night on which he
left home; and, after taking some refreshment at the
inn, prompted by the not unpleasant restlessness of his
feelings, he went out to explore the little town in search
of Mr. Clive's house.
The day had been fine, and clear, and bracing, and
his route had lain through a picturesque country, where
the cottages seemed comfortable, and the peasantry
bold, free, and contented. Everything had conspired
to produce cheerfulness and good humour in a benevolent
mind like his; and, excited withal by the associations of
almost chivalrous adventure, which a journey usually
calls up in the fancy of an unfrequent traveller, it was
with a light and quick, yet firm step, that he strode
along the street, and at length mounted the steps of
the house he sought.
One might have thought, by his high and gallant
air, that the visit was to a mistress, rather than to the
grown-up family of a woman he had loved in youth;
but, on closer inspection, it would have been discovered
at a glance, that the days of poetry and delusion had
for ever fled with him. The reigning 'expression of
his face, which, in early life, had been melancholy,
was now exalted by religion and philosophy into a
thoughtful seriousness; his brow, once reckoned hand-
some, was ploughed by time and care into deep furrows;
large grey eye-brows gave, at a casual glance, a look
almost of fierceness to the calm, clear, blue orb they

overhung; and in the mouth alone remained distinctly
indicated, the benevolence characteristic of the man.
His dress was in perfect keeping with his countenance.
A plain brown coat, somewhat in the rear of the exist-
ing fashion, and yet not far enough so to excite
; remark; & wig nicely powdered, and of a form so old
as to make it improbable that he would overtake and
get beyond it before its time of service expired; a hat
slightly approaching to the quaker, and a good old-
gentlemanly stick of polished cane, were the principal
items, of which his costume was composed.
It may excite a smile to imagine a figure like this,
hesitating for a moment at the door, before entering
the presence of an early love. Mr. Vesper, however,
did pause; his breathing was suspended for an instant;
and, like the prince in eastern story; who seemed to
undergo many years of vicissitude and adventure in
the brief space in which his head was dipped in a basin
of water, during that instant the thoughts, of. Mr.
Vesper wandered over the thousand, scenes of enchant-
ment which he had once beheld, in the love-gjlded
visions of his youth. The next moment he stood before
Mrs. Clive.
The once beautiful Maria was now: a pale, thin,
anxious-looking woman of forty years. There were
still, however, in her figure, the shadowy remains of a
gentility and even elegance of proportion which, twenty
years ago, had rendered her, the, abjeet of general
admiration; and although the crow-foot prints of time
were distinctly visible at the corners of her eyes, those
heretofore stars of love still exhibited, in their waning
beams, a token and a trace of early splendour.
Her dress was suited to the thread-bare, and poverty-
struck gentility of the apartment, in which a harp with
tarnished gilding, a few books in the remains of elegant
binding, and a Grecian couch minus the cover, con-
trasted strangely with dirty,, unpapered walls, and a
single curtainless window. Her
gown was of rich but

faded silk; a solitary spangle, still hanging by a thread
to her small shoe, proclaimed that the wearer was
either careless, or not unwilling that its old ball-room
associations should be suggested to the spectator; and
her head, luxuriant even now in beautiful dark hair,
was wholly uncovered, as if to serve as a solitary,
witness against the crowded teatimonies of forty years.
She was sitting beside an open trunk, surrounded
by various folded articles, as if busily engaged in pre-
paration for a journey; but when a stranger entered
the room, unannounced by the servant, she rose hastily
up, apparently ashamed of her employment. She
saluted the visitor, however, with habitual grace and
lady-like ease, and then paused for a moment to learn
his pleasure.
Mr. Vesper was too busy with his own reflections to
speak at once; his eye had embraced, with a single
rapid glance, the whole details of the scene, and then
returning, to fix upon the faded face before him, it was
with a sigh, that seemed to exclaim, “Poor Maria!”
he saluted her in the common forms of society. The
smile which usually accompanied his address was
enough for her. She made one step back with an air
of conscious confusion, relieved, however, by the vain-
glorious recollections of youth; and then, scanning
with an altered eye his time-furrowed countenance,
lost herself, for a few moments, in a dream-like reverie.
The faint hue, however, which had risen into her cheek,
faded almost instantly; her eyes reverted to the open
trunk, and her thoughts to the habitual cares and
anxieties of a parent; and in another minute the jilted
lover and the gay.coquette were seated side by side on
the couch-a grave elderly gentleman, and she the
mother of a grown-up son.
66 And

midst of the interrogatories which are usually addressed
to each other, by long separated acquaintances: when
they chance to meet again on the earth.

“Alas, sir!" she replied, “Captain Clive has been
dead these ten years! Were he alive, you should not
have seen me in this miserable place; although, indeed,
I must say, the street is the most fashionable in the
town—quite the Mall, I assure you.
Times are
changed, however, that is certain—poor dear Clive!”
and the widow applied her handkerchief to her eyes.
You I trust, the consolation-” said Mr.
Vesper, solemnly, “he died, I hope_” but recollect-
ing that his hope was useless to the dead, and, in all
probability, groundless, he stopped short.
“He died,” said Mrs. Clive, “like a gentleman and
an officer!
And yet it was hard, very hard—at such
a time, on the brink of promotion—with a wife still
young,
and child of eleven years—without a guinea
in the house, and no arrears of pay!
blamed him; they said he might have avoided going
out, without detriment to his honour—but I do not
know; poor Clive was rash and thoughtless, seldom at
home when he could help it; I was that day, myself,
at a public breakfast; Willy was in the measles, and
and-the gentleman who killed him was a colonel.'
The widow again applied her handkerchief to her eyes,
which prevented her from seeing the surprised and
indignant glare with which she was regarded by her
visitor, who abruptly stood up to take his leave. A
young lady, however, who had stolen into the room,
and was quietly employed in packing the trunk, rose
suddenly from her knees, and looking much distressed,
and somewhat ashamed, took a part in the conver-
sation,
“It was an affair of a moment, sir,” said she, with
a deprecatory look to Mr. Vesper; "at least of an
evening. The quarrel took place at supper, and the
unhappy man remained with his companion till the
morning. If a moment of reflection had been allowed

listened, in the awful stillness of night, to the warnings
of his heart, and the merciful inspirations of his God-
oh! I am sure, I am very sure and as emotion
choked her utterance, she turned away. Mr. Vesper
looked at her for the first time, having been unconscious
of her presence in the room till she spoke, and thought,
as he gazed, he had never beheld an earthly being so
fair. Her form, however, was too slight to be abso-
lutely perfect, and her face too pale to be perfectly
beautiful; but the intellectual glory which played in
her blue eyes, would have made deformity itself seem
divine. Her age did not seem to exceed seventeen;
but owing to her calm and thoughtful air, and in part,
also, perhaps, to the form of the cap with which her
auburn tresses were confined, her almost girlish figure
appeared to be invested with even matronly dignity.
"It is beautiful!” exclaimed Mr. Vesper aloud,
although communing only with himself; his face lighted
up with that radiant smile which sometimes makes age
itself appear more charming than the brightest bloom
of youth. “It is beautiful to see a daughter palliating
even the sins of her father, and striving to conceal their
enormity, not only from others, but from herself, by
looking at them only thus reflected in the pure prism of
her own innocent and holy imagination!” The young
woman turned pale while he was speaking; but, after
a moment's pause, with a calm manner, but in a tre-
mulous voice, replied-
" It was of Captain Clive, sir, I spoke; for me, I
have no father to defend, nor to deplore.'
“She is an orphan,” said Mrs. Clive, looking with
unfeigned kindness at the poor girl, “ but of a good
family, at least on one side of the house.
They turned
her mother out of doors for choosing a husband for
herself, and so the young couple became entirely des-
titute; and Mr. Howard being disappointed of a dowry,
was not so kind to his wife as he might have been.
But this is an old story now.'

« Oh, yes,
“A good family!” mused the visitor. “But you,
Mrs. Clive,” continued he aloud, apparently striving
to palliate, or account for the allusions of his early
life, “you received the forsaken child into your
house--you became a friend to the friendless, a mother
to the orphan. Did you not ?"
“I had nothing in my power,” replied Mrs. Clive.
indeed
you
had!” cried Helen Howard,
with animation, “ You had a kind word, and a kind
look for me when almost every body else was cold and
silent; you have been in every way that I required, or
could accept the obligation, my benefactress and my
friend. As for affording me the charity of an asylum
in your house, if the gentleman alludes to such a thing,
-I was a great strong girl when my poor mother
died, my education was good and my spirit willing.
I was, as I now am, in a worldly sense, my own sup-
port, and all that I could reasonably ask, and which
I readily, instantly found, was your countenance, your
good wishes, and I hope your prayers." Mrs. Clive,
who was really, in the common phrase, a good-natured,
though weak-minded woman, was affected even to tears
by this expression of gratitude for kindnesses, trifling
perhaps in themselves, and certainly bestowed from no
steady or virtuous principle; but her son, the only
child of her ill-fated marriage, who had joined the
party in time to hear what had passed on the subject,
as soon as the fair speaker concluded, ran up to where
she stood, and seizing on both her hands, exclaimed
in a voice broken with emotion, yet deep, manly and
energetic
“Helen, Helen, will you force me to doubt the single-
ness and integrity even of your heart? Is it
talk of obligation; you the unchangeable, the disinter-
ested, the tender nurse of my sick mother, the counsel-
lor of my blind and wayward self?
What should we
have done without you? Who would have sustained
the feverish spirits I could only alarm and exasperate
you who

by my extravagance?—and who now, when I am gone”
-here the young man's voice became low and tremu-
lous, and at the allusion to his approaching departure,
was entirely drowned in the clamour of his weak
mother's grief.
Mr. Vesper stood gazing on the unexpected picture
with a sensation of choking which at length became
intensely painful. William Clive remained looking in
the fair orphan's face, with both her hands locked in
his; and the spectator believed that he had never before
seen traced on human features an admiration so abso-
lutely devout. Helen herself met the gaze
for some
moments with an unshrinking eye; a proud and happy
smile illumined her countenance, and a lightness and
buoyancy in her air seemed to assert an affinity with
one of those angelic forms which doubtless swam in
unconscious analogy before the imagination of her
worshipper. A soft flush at last broke on her cheek,
and she suddenly withdrew her too ingenuous eyes.
The mother, who had sat sobbing upon the couch,
gazing upon
as tow’rd a star," started as the
town-clock told ten, and in an instant the passionate
stillness of the scene, like a lake struck suddenly by a
mountain gust, was shattered and dissolved.
The packing, however, had been already almost
completed by the exertions of Helen, and after a very
few moments more, nothing remained to be done except
to deposit in a nook preserved for them, the parting
keepsakes of his mother and friend. Mrs. Clive, in
the mean time, had taken the opportunity of letting
her visitor into the secret of William's intended
journey.
“I had hoped,” said she, with a heavy sigh, “that
I had interest enough to procure him at least an en-
sign's commission--and surely that figure must have
been intended by nature for the army! But, alas !
from the moment in which I was driven by straitened
circumstances into Wales, it seemed as if I had been
her son

driven from the world, and from the recollections of
those who lived in it. Until now, I have managed,
with the assistance of Helen, to pacify the poor boy,
and keep him quietly at home; but dependence, even
upon a mother, is bitter to a young spirit : and no
doubt he thought it hard too, although the word never
passed his lips, to be deprived so long of the little
comforts, I may say necessaries, which are the very
birthright of a gentleman. What could I do, however,
with my poor forty pounds a year, but lately increased
to fifty? I saved, it is true, all I could from dress and
board to educate and clothe him like his class; and
God knows that I would have saved more if he had let
me : but when he would catch me stealing, as it were,
from myself, that he might not want a good coat on
his back and a show-guinea in his purse, the fits of rage
and desperation he would fly into never failed to
frighten me into an illness that cost more han all
the thefts of the sort I could commit in a month."
“ And his destination now, my dear madam?” in-
quired Mr. Vesper, with a sudden kindness and core
diality of manner.
“0 London, London!—he will go to London ; and
I am in hopes that with his figure and address, and a
letter from me to our rich relations, the Blanks, and
a recommendation to Mr. Irvine, the great East India
merchant, he may do some good. To be sure,” added
Mrs. Clive with a sigh, “I did not expect once on a
day that I should be reduced to hope to see my son in
a counting-house !"
· If
you see your son in a counting-house, madam,”
said Mr. Vesper warmly, “you will see him in the
same station with the first men of our country for
talent, integrity, and wealth; and you will probably
see him in perhaps a very few years, if he conducts
himself well, with a better salary than any captain's
in the army. You will see him too, my good madam,
much more reputably employed than any military man

can hope to be in time of peace, or even in time of
war, if the battles are not fought in defence of our
own homes and altars. But London, London, though
a proud, is a dangerous field; he may be longer idle
than you imagine, and there is no vice more fatal than
the absence of vice without the positive presence of
virtuous exertion. However, I augur
well both of his
conduct and success; his thoughts, at any rate,” con-
tinued he, with a melancholy smile, “his thoughts
at least will be well employed, and that is much.
He is doubtless provided with money enough to keep
him with strict economy for a reasonable time, and
if
• Now, mother,” cried William, “your keepsake?”
“ As for money,” said Mrs. Clive, in a hurried
whisper—for like most people who are fond of talking,
she did not stop at half-confidences—"there is no use
in hiding—"
"Come, mother; Helen is just going.'
“How much?” whispered Mr. Vesper, with irre-
pressible curiosity.
The widow blushed faintly while she answered,
· Ten pounds."
She now took up a book from the table, the bind-
ing of which had once been superb, and was still
rich-looking, though tarnished.
“It was your father's,” said she, putting it into the
hands of her son, “almost the only book I ever saw
him read. Keep it for his sake and mine; I know
you
will be a good man —there is no need to talk to
you about that—but never forget that you are a gen-
tleman's son!” William kissed his mother's hand af-
fectionately; but a deep blush suffused his face when
he saw that the prying, almost impertinent stranger,
had read the title over his shoulder" Chesterfield's
Letters.' Helen Howard now came forward with a
timid look and a faltering step; she held a book half-
concealed under her arm, which she rather slipped into

William's hand than presented formally. The hands
of the two young people met with the book between
them, and they looked for an instant into one another's
eyes with an expression which partook as much of
awe as tenderness. William then surrendered the
treasure to his mother to be deposited in the trunk,
and left the room in search of Helen's cloak and bon-
net.
- I declare it is a Bible!” cried Mrs. Clive in a tone
of surprise; "well, you are a good creature, Helen.”
Mr. Vesper took the book from her hands, and in a
voice not of surprise but of solemn pleasure, read the
title aloud, “ The Holy Bible.” Helen knelt once
more beside the trunk, as if to inspect for the last time
the arrangements, and a silence of some minutes pre-
vailed in the room. William at length returned, the
cloaking and bonneting was effected, and Helen, having
given and received a cordial good night, took her de-
parture, escorted by her friend.
When they were gone, Mr. Vesper set himself to
stride up and down the room as had been his custom
at home; sometimes he smiled, and sometimes rubbed
his hands, and quickened his pace; till Mrs. Clive be-
gan to think it strange, and wondered within herself
when he meant to go away.
At length, suddenly
catching up his hat, the eccentric visitor darted out
of the room; but before finding his way to the door,
he returned, and shaking her by both hands, “Good
night, my dear madam,” said he, “good night! they
are a glorious pair, a finer specimen of humanity could
not be selected. Depend upon it, your son will get on
well in London; you were right; he will be a good
man, even you could not spoil him! Good night,
good night!"
When Mr. Vesper found himself in the street, he
paused for an instant to recolleet whether he ought to
turn to the right or the left, in order to regain the inn;
and then choosing the wrong direction, he arrived

speedily, owing to the rapid pace at which he walked,
at the very extremity of the town on the hillward side.
When just about to turn back, he spied on the oppo-
site side of the deserted road, the very individuals who
were at the moment the companions of his thoughts.
They stood under a little portico of rustic lattice-
work covered with woodbine, and were in the act of
bidding farewell. William held both the hands of his
mistress locked in his, while she was speaking, appa-
rently with earnestness, although her voice was inau-
dible to the unseen spy, who had ensconced himself in
the shadow of a tree. When the motion of her lips
was ended, her lover drew her gradually nearer, and
at length clasped her unresisting to his breast, she
drooped her head upon his shoulder, and they thus
stood for some time like statues in the moonlight.
She then raised her head, from which her bonnet had
half fallen back, and her pale, bright face shone for a
moment upon his; their lips met, parted; the door
opened and Helen disappeared.
William stood for a moment rooted to the spot, and
gazing at the closed door, but at length started and
withdrew, walking swiftly, not towards home, but in a
direction leading to the hills.
“Ay, go your way, young man!” said Mr. Vesper,
the tears starting into his eyes—"go, go your way,
with moonlight on your head, and love, hope, and
heaven in
your
heart! Go, rove once more among the
haunts of your visioned youth; go, gaze once more on
the hill, and the stream, and the dell; go, worship yet
once more on the high places of idolatrous memory!
No moon so fair shall ever light your walks again; no
scene so beautiful shall ever glad your pilgrim eyes;
no thoughts so pure shall ever sweeten and consecrate
your heart; no phantoms so glorious shall ever rise
upon your waking dreams! Go, go; look, listen, feel;
saturate your memory with the loveliness around and
within you; it will one day be like a charm to pre-

serve your soul unhurt amidst the contagion of the
world!”
When the enthusiastic traveller returned to his inn,
the excitement had not yet abated in his mind. А
thousand projects teemed in his brain, a thousand
splendid phantasms crowded his imagination. He
placed himself in the situation of a kind of earthly
providence, watching over, if not directing the destinies
of the interesting pair; he rubbed his hands with glee,
while passing through the room; and, as at last he
leaped into bed with the lightness of eighteen, “ Aha,
my friend!” said he, addressing himself mentally to
the curate, “this is better than a game at backgam-
mon!”

him;
WHEN William Clive's journey, which he commenced
on the following morning, began to draw near a close,
his excited feelings grew more tumultuous every
moment. The villages in the neighbourhood of Lon-
don appeared as towns of respectable magnitude to
and the idea of the vast leviathan, to which those
were but minnows, became proportionably expanded.
Every step, at length, proclaimed more distinctly their
approach to some enormous congregation of the human
kind. The avenues opening to the main road became
more frequent and more crowded—looking like innu-
merable ducts constructed for the
purpose of draining
the country of its population to convey it to one grand
central reservoir.
Even the aspect of the passers-by exhibited a sud-
den and remarkable change. Each man walked
steadily on, absorbed in his own thoughts, or busy
with his own occupation; he looked as if about to

THE GAME OF LIFE,
enter, or having just left, a tumultuous crowd, in
which his only business was to elbow his way as well
as possible. No vacant stare of curiosity greeted the
approach of a new freight of human beings to swell
the mass; the coach rolled on with as little observa-
tion as one of an interminable succession of drops
trickles down a cliff to lose itself in the ocean.
The sky behind was bright with the golden hues of
an autumnal sunset, which showed with nice precision
the edge of the distant horizon, broken at intervals
with small tapering spires. Before, embracing nearly
two-thirds of the entire visible circle, a dull, dusky,
motionless cloud sat brooding over the earth. The
road along which the travellers were journeying seemed
to plunge into the midst of this portentous gloom; but
extending on either side, vast and irregular lines of
buildings, as they caught the parting rays of the sun,
flashed them back from their windows, looking like
fragments of some victorious city in which the illumi-
nations had begun. In a little while the eye was able
to wander through opening vistas of streets, and to
discern that the dim interior was formed of similar
materials, while, spire after spire, and dome after
dome, and column after column, rising slowly on the
sight, conveyed to the spectator an almost exaggerated
idea of magnitude, and magnificence. At length, as
one, enormous dome stood distinctly revealed, apparently
the centre and nucleus of the proud array, and when
the sunlight flashed on that golden cross and ball,
rendered as familiar by pictorial representations to the
distant hind as the roof of his father's cottage, William
sprung upon his feet, where he sat on the top of the
coach, and his high-wrought and tumultuous feelings
of expectation, awe, wonder, and delight, burst forth
in the exclamation=--"London! London!”
As yet the wheels had not grated on the paved ways,
which mutter, with portentous growl, of the business
of a town, but already a dull, grating, monotonous

sound filled the air, It was like the low and soft, yet
most mighty and magnificent, voice, which is heard
upon the sea-shore at night, disturbing the ear,
amidst the silence and calmness of the hour, with news
from the far ocean. Soon a louder rush was heard,
sweeping and dying away at intervals; then a single
shout might be distinguished, rising among the millions
of voices rather felt than heard; and then slowly and
gradually, as the ear of the rustic traveller learnt to
apply its wonderful faculties to the new world of sound
which, it was entering, the supposed monotony divided
into ten thousand component parts, and the roar of
carriages, the working of machinery, the noise of 'in-
numerable trades, the, barking of dogs, the voices
of men, women, and children, in, tones of cursing
and blessing, and shrill laughter, deluged his very
soul..
Darting suddenly from the road into one of the
narrow avenues which gaped at every step, the paved
stones at length rattled and grumbled and crushed
beneath; rival vehicles swept headlong by, the wheels
grazing as they passed; the air darkened, the sky was
hidden; and with a momentary sensation of fear, our
traveller saw the houses closing dimly around him, and
felt that he was now fairly swallowed up and lost in
the insatiable maw of the metropolis.
His inexperienced eye, however, exaggerated the
darkness. The lamps in some places were only begin-
ning to be lighted, and the citizens still walked on as
if: in broad day. In one shop, a woman was matching
the shade of a coloured stuff, which, for aught Wil-
liam's optics could discern, might have been either
canvas or muslin;, while in another, a solitary lamp,
destined by and by to communicate light to the whole,
threw a shadowy, splendour upon the riches in the in-
terior, which brought to his recollection the cavo of
Aladdin. In some places the street was broken up
beside him, and as the carriage tottered slowly past,

he threw a gaze of wonder and almost terror into the
excavation below, where, at a vast depth, numerous
labourers were working by lamplight, in what appeared
to him to be the streets of a subterranean city. The
coach stopped several times, and some of the passen-
gers one by one dismounted; but William, having no
motive for choosing one place rather than another,
kept his seat, resolved to go as far as they would take
him.
In the mean time the lamps became more bright,
and the shop-windows were lighted up, the streets
were crowded with innumerable carriages, and the
foot-pavements with. hurrying passengers; every thing
wore an air of life, and bustle, and prosperity, and the
sensations of the traveller were wound up to a pitch of
almost joyous excitement. Looking eagerly from one
side to another, measuring with his eye some gigantic
spire, till it was lost in the gloom above, now fixing a
lingering gaze on some window of surpassing splendour,
and now looking with no less surprise and delight on
some lovely face turned up in the lamplight to glance
listlessly on the passing vehicle, he sat perfectly insen-
sible of the lapse of time, till the coach plunged sud-
denly into an archway, and stopped before the door of
an inn.
The area was crowded with similar vehicles; and
porters staggering under baggage, waiters carrying
lights, coachmen, guards, and travellers, all were seen
passing and repassing, or crowding the door and hall
of the general rendezvous. William, amused with the
novel scene, remained staring around,' till a man,
touching his hat, recalled him to himself with the
usual “Guard, you please, sir!” and he found to his
surprise that the horses had been removed, and that
he was sitting alone on the empty and motionless
coach.
Having removed his trunk to a bed-room in the inn,
he descended to the coffee-room. Here there were no

symptoms of the bustle outside. A few travellers
dropped noiselessly in, or slipped as noiselessly out;
some sat quietly reading the newspapers, smoking the
while a cigar, or sipping brandy and water; others,
already busy with their accounts, pored over the con-
tents of their pocket-books; but all were absorbed in
themselves, and appeared to be absolutely ignorant that
the room contained another human being.
Tired of the selfish monotony of a scene which cor-
responded so ill with the present excited state of his
feelings, William determined, as the hour was yet
early, to indulge in a stroll along those streets which
had appeared so delightful, when viewed from the
coach; and, by way of blending the utile with the
dulce, to find out at the same time, if possible, an old
country acquaintance, who, he had some hopes, would
put him in the way of obtaining lodgings the next day,
and commencing the economy of his London life. The
name of this acquaintance was Burnet, and William
remembered him a lad of much promise at Llanwellyn.
Being left destitute at his father's death, he had re-
paired to the metropolis to try his fortune, where it
was understood he had married. He was attached to
some department of the law, but in what capacity or
with what success, was not known.
It so happened that the quarter indicated by Bur-
net's address, was in the immediate neighbourhood of
the inn; and William had scarcely time to accustom
his eyes to the glare and glitter of the shops, and his
ears to the thousand incongruous noises of evening,
when on looking up accidently, he read the name of
the street on the corner. The houses looked respect-
able and spacious, although in reality they boasted no
more than two apartments on the floor, and he felt an
unselfish gladness in thinking that his friend must
have done well in the world. On arriving at the pro-
per number, he knocked, and the door was opened by
a respectable-looking female, with one child at her

breast, and two or three at her heels. His informa-
tion was correct: Mr. Burnet did live there.
" Is he at home?" inquired William.
Higher up,” replied the woman, 'retreating into
the parlour, and leaving the stranger in darkness.
Surprised and indignant at the rudeness, he groped
his way to the staircase, and succeeded in reaching
the first floor, While searching for the handle of the
door, the noise he made attracted the attention of the
inmates, and a young lady came out to inquire his
pleasure. Through the half-open door he could per-
ceive that the room was well sized, and handsomely
furnished, and the lady herself evidently belonged to
the genteeler classes of society.
“Mr. Burnet?” she repeated, thoughtfully; “Mam-
ma, do you know anything of a Mr. Burnet?”
No, my dear.”
“Do you, papa?”
No, no-nonsense. Stay; higher up, 'I believe :
yes, higher up.” The young lady shut the door.
William, left again in darkness, climbed another flight,
and knocked.
“Come in," cried a voice. He entered, and found,
in a decent, respectable-looking apartment, two men
in the garb of quakers, with their broad-brimmed hats
on, reading newspapers by the fireside, with a large
pewter flaggon on the table beside them. One of
them, after finishing deliberately the sentence he had
been perusing, turned round his head, and William re-
peated the question.
“I know not, friend," was the reply; " higher up,
perhaps, higher up;" and the quaker resumed his
reading. The other did not so much as raise his eyes
from the paper; and William, therefore, withdrew, sig-
nifying his disapprobation of their inhospitality by
shutting the door after him with less gentleness than
usual. Higher up, however, our adventurer groped,
and on arriving at the third floor, was happy to find it

the last. Being invited, as before, to open the door
for himself, and walk in, he did so, and found the apart-
ment meagerly supplied with mean furniture, among
which was a tent bed; a young man “sat by a table, on
which some books and papers were scattered; a few
anatomical preparations lay about the room, and a
coffee pot beside the fire proclaimed the suitable so-
briety of the student's habits.
"Mr. Burnet?” said 'he. “I don't know, indeed;
you had better inquire further.
Upon my soul, I am much obliged to you!” re-
plied William, hastily, who was now out of all patience;
6 but I would rather be excused, just now, from scram-
bling upon the slates, unless you, in the first place,
will show me the way.” The student smiled.
*There is no need,”"said he; “ there is a family
next door, I believe; and if ‘one Burnet' does not
hang out there, why I would recommend you just to
descend quietly by the stairs as you came;" and, so
saying, the young man resumed his studies.
William accordingly tried the next door, and, at
length, found his friend.
He had some difficulty, at first, in 'recognising the
features so familiar in his earlier youth; but the in-
stant he became convinced that Burnet stood really
before him in life and limb, he ran up to him with all
the kindly enthusiasm of a young man unhackneyed in
the ways of the world, and shook him vehemently by
the hand. His old companion neither shrunk from the
gripe, nor returned it; he replied in the usual manner
to the usual questions, but asked none in return; and
when the first brief salutations were over, stood silent
for a moment, as if expecting either that "Williani
would withdraw, or mention the purport of his visit.
At length, appearing to recollect himself, he selected
one of a few broken chairs with which the room was
garnished, and, with a forced 'heartiness of manner,
invited him to sit down.


## p. 48 (#492) #############################################

48
THE GAME OF LIFE,
William hesitated at first, but the scene around
seemed to explain the apparent coldness of Burnet. A
floor without a carpet, a bed without curtains, and a
grate almost destitute of fire—although a cooking
utensil disputed with the family the little heat it
afforded—appeared to indicate the very extreme of
poverty. Three children were at supper, and it seemed
scarcely possible that the young creature who ministered
to their wants could be the mother of such a family.
She appeared to be quite a girl; and even the haggard
and care-worn expression of her features could not
conceal that they had been, very lately, both handsome
and agreeable. Her dress, however, was neglected,
and even dirty; and her sickly bosom, where an infant
lay, was exposed with an unconscious impropriety,
which awakened at once pity and disgust. Occupied
incessantly with her domestic cares, she hardly looked
at the stranger; her curiosity received no excitement
from matters that were out of her department; and
the only tokens she exhibited of being even aware of
his presence, were a slap and a "hush!” to such of
her little charges as merited the reproof, by allowing
any other sound to escape the lips than that required
in the process of mastication.
A discipline unusual, and, therefore, apparently un-
reasonable, produced the effect that might have been
anticipated. The children, silent at first in surprise,
were loud at length in remonstrance, and a sound arose
from amongst them, in which the shrillscream, the sturdy
roar, and the plaintive whine, were blended together like
voices in some musical composition: certainly not a
glee. Poor Burnet sat like the image either of pa-
tience or despair. He raised his voice, for some time,
so as to be heard above the din; but wearied at last
with the hopeless struggle, held his tongue. In a mo-
mentary pause he sighed; but while he did so, no
deeper depression than usual appeared in his manner,
and no bitterer reflections on his fate seemed to be

passing through his mind; his sigh was without cha-
racter or expression, and seemed more the effect of
habit than a token of sorrow or regret.
“ You have not introduced me to Mrs. Burnet,” said
William, at length, so much shocked and embarrassed
by the scene before him, that he hardly knew what
to say
“ That is my wife,” replied the husband. Mrs.
Burnet sighed.
“I remember, Clive," continued Burnet, suddenly,
while a kind of smile played on his dejected features,
“ I remember when you and I were younger than we
are now; when we used to walk out on a still evening,
or a moonlight night, along the hawthorn hedges lead-
ing to the heights of Llanwellyn—there was a cottage,
a little mud-walled, straw-thatched, ruined hovel, near
the bottom of the hill. Poor fellow !' said I once, when
we were speaking of its new tenant, “what a comfort-
less place to live in, what a wretched fireside to go
back to from his hard day's work! “Say rather,
happy fellow,' returned you; "he has married the girl
of his heart, and he has a whole world to himself in
that enchanted cottage. You will find what he will
make of it; he will trim the garden and re-thatch the
roof, and I will help him myself to train honey-
suckles round the walls. In another summer or two,
when you see a little chubby face looking out of the
casement, which by that time will be encircled with
leaves, you will own it to be a very paradise of love
and content!' And so you did help him, and you
both worked very hard; but it would not do. Chubby
faces came fast enough, but the cottage grew worse
and worse; and at last, when there were more mouths
to eat than bread to fill them, the man died, the wife
and children went to the work-house, and the hut fell
into ruins, on which, I am told, younger boys than you
and I were then, throw looks of superstitious dread as
they circle widely round on their way home from a

ramble on the hills.” Burnet was silent for a moment,
and then went on. “ It is singular enough,” said he,
“ that I cannot get that cottage out of my head. I,
too, married for love" and he cast an unimpassioned
glance on his young wife, who returned it with one of
pity and regret. “I brought my wife home to my
London hut, and looked forward like you, to the time
when I should be able to trim it a little ; but you see
how it is; things get worse instead of better; the fur-
niture grows old and scanty, and the family large; and
although I work harder, I am paid less. A fit of ill-
ness would wind up the affair in a week's time.”
“But, good heavens, Burnet!” exclaimed our ad-
venturer, both surprised and shocked, “is it not
irrational-I must say, unmanly, in a young and
well-educated man like you to talk in this manner?
The law is a profession which gives the widest scope
for talents and industry of all kinds ; and were it
otherwise, there are surely more ways of living than
one to be met with in London."
“For me," replied Burnet, calmly, " there is only
I was for some time the drudge rather than the
clerk of an attorney, and leaving my situation on
account of a quarrel with my employer, was unable to
find another. I was too poor for a merchant's count-
ing-house, where the salary of one so useless and
inexperienced would not have sufficed to keep me
alive; I was too proud to stand behind a counter or a
coach; and I was too weak in body--perhaps also in
mind to become a hewer of wood and a drawer of
water to my fellow men. Of all the qualifications
requisite for a man who must live by the wants of
his neighbours, I possessed only one I could write."
“ Then you do not still belong to the profession of
the law ?” interrupted William.
“ Yes: just as this pen belongs to the profession of
literature. I am one of the humble machines whose
task it is to copy papers, the production of other
one.

inen's brains; in short, I am what is technically called
a law writer. Thanks to the verbosity of the docu-
ments I allude to the natural characteristic of a
state of society in the highest degree refined and
artificial—I am still able to supply my family with
bread. This, however, becomes more difficult every
day. The same evil ingenuity which forces the honest,
or the suspicious, or the ingenious in their own way,
to entrench themselves against all things possible and
impossible, behind an infinity of terms and modes of
expression, leads them to inventions which diminish
the expense of so cumbrous a machinery. The nume-
rous copies for instance of a paper which some time
ago would have cost a round sum to the litigants, and
provided many families of law writers with a meal,
may now be struck off for a trifle by means of litho-
graphy. The progress of the schoolmaster, too, who
flogs so many aspiring youths into an ambition to
wear long coats and to be called Mister, raises claims
for our morsel of bread which before would have been
satisfied at the plough-tail; and in army and navy
officers who have learned to write since the war, and
even in that fairer portion of the human family, which
condescended formerly to no more unfeminine employ-
ments than brush-making, boot-closing, and mop-
spinning, we find a host of dangerous and greedy
rivals. I do not complain, however; I have no one
to find fault with; all these things are naturally and
necessarily born of the time; and the witling who
sneers at the redundance of our legal language, and
the ass who kicks against the advance of knowledge
common people,' appear to me to be
equally ridiculous.” Burnet had talked himself into
complacency, if not animation; and William, inex-
perienced as he was in the study of character, was not
slow in perceiving that the dejection so apparent in
his manner at first was the effect, not of grief and dis-
appointment, but simply of a mechanical and mono-
among the

tonous employment, the returns of which were too
small, and the leisure hours too few, to permit the
labourer to seek amusement for his naturally restless
mind in other pursuits. The sympathy of the ob-
server was decreased by this discovery: he had yet to
learn that in Burnet the disease exhibited itself in its
mildest form, and he would probably still have joined
in the exclamation of many good and sensible people
on witnessing some moral fall. Poor creature ! what
could have led him to vice? His employment was so
regular, so quiet, so easy, that not even a thought
was required in its prosecution.
Come, come,” exclaimed Burnet, when his lecture
was finished, we live, after all.
I'll shut up my
papers for the night, and in spite of the world, we'll
drink a cheerful glass' to old friends, and old times.”
He seized his hat, and went out of the room as he
spoke, and William, following him mechanically down
stairs, was glad to think that his friend possessed an
apartment for the reception of visitors in what seemed
to be a genteeler part of the house. Burnet, however,
strode through the hall, and emerged into the street,
where the noise and crowd prevented William for some
tirne from asking the question to which he was tempted
by such singular conduct.
“ This way!” cried the former, taking hold of his
friend's arm, and dragging him suddenly into a narrow
passage opening apparently into some house. On the
right hand a still narrower door admitted a motley
crowd of the lowest order into a compartment fur-
nished with a counter of polished pewter; across which
glasses of all dimensions, and filled with liquids of all
colours, were handed incessantly to the claimants.
William paused for a moment in curiosity, for he per-
ceived that he had entered for the first time one of
those peculiarly metropolitan rendezvous which are
neither taverns nor coffee-houses, but are known by the
still more appropriate name of public houses. Burnet,

kowever, shouted to him from the further end of the
passage; and, following the voice, he found himself
the next moment in an apartment, the atmosphere of
which was so loaded with tobacco smoke, that for some
time he could neither see nor breathe freely.
“You are surprised," said his conductor, as they
seated themselves at a table nearly filled with company.
“ You manage these things differently in the country.
This is my parlour!”-slapping the table with a
violence which made the guests start and look at him,
although only for an instant--"this is my reception-
room, open to me and my friends from morning till
night; neither wife nor children may follow me to a
haunt sacred to the dignity of man. Here I am at my
ease, my fire is cheerful, and my servants attentive;
and I will show you that my cellar can boast a cup of
ale, as good as ever was brewed in Wiltshire.” Wil-
liam, during this speech, sat in awkward and fidgetty
silence, his cheeks burning with a blush, half of shame
half of anger, as he felt the attention of the company
so obtrusively and unnecessarily drawn upon him; but
the next moment, to his great relief, he heard the
interrupted conversation around return to its former
channels. Some individuals, indeed, who sat smoking
their pipes with as solitary an air as if they had been
in a desert, testified their approbation of the speaker's
eloquence by drinking his health ; but even they very
speedily returned into the philosophical abstraction
characteristic of their class, and the two friends, sur-
rounded by gingling glasses and talkative guests, found
themselves to all intents and
purposes
alone.
“ Is this the custom,” inquired William, with some
hesitation, “among the rich and respectable classes
of society?"
As you know nothing of the composition of London
society," replied Burnet, “ you can only mean, among
the gentry, or among such, at all events, as make
some pretensions to gentility. Certainly not. In the

country, when a thriving shopkeeper has retired for
the day from his counter, he enters the harem as good
a gentleman as any lord in the land. He receives his
friends at home; his wife gives tea-parties, and his
daughters play to the company on the piano. Indi-
viduals of this class are termed, somewhat indefinitely,
people in business,'-a cognomen, however, which
by no means includes the wholesale merchants. In
town, the shopkeepers are simply “tradesmen;' and
even those who may be said to form the aristocracy of
the body are not ashamed of the title. This class of
society, which comprehends the vast portion of the
wealth of the metropolis, live in the public-houses ;
their shops being their stalls of business, and their
houses their dormitories. They are fond of the public-
house from habit and early association, but still more
from a knowledge of its convenience. There is no
commodity in London so dear, nor so merchantable, as
house-room; and thus their dwellings are in many
instances crammed with lodgers from top to bottom,
to the utter exclusion of guests: but even when this
is not the case, they know that it is here only they
can meet with their associates. As for that crowd of
nondescripts, who are neither tradesmen nor mechanics,
nor gentlemen, but who, wearing a good coat upon
their backs, pass by the courtesy of society for misters,
while they live no human being knows where,-per-
haps,” added Burnet, with a dejected smile,)“ in a
three-pair back-room, with a breeding wife and three
squalling children ; what would become of them if no
such place as the public-house existed? They would
be obliged either to descend and talk to their visitors
in the streets, or to unveil to the unhallowed eyes of a
stranger the most sacred mysteries of their domestic
life. As it is, a man's house is literally his castle
and almost as impregnable as if it were a castle in the
air; no one insults another, whatever may be his ap-
parent circumstances, with the question where do you

live?' It would be resented, in most instances, as
fiercely as the still less answerable one of "how do
you
live?' The same custom prevails among the non-
descripts who have not a good coat on their backs,
although a different and somewhat cheaper room is
provided for their reception; and among the mecha-
nies also, who style themselves the 'useful classes,'
conceiving, with infinite wisdom, that they are more
useful to their neighbours by giving him a pair of boots,
than he is to them by giving them money to buy
bread. With regard to the upper ranks, including
the aristocracy of trade, they live as people always do
who have plenty of room; but even they are making
a rapid approximation to the manners of the lower
classes; their clubs, I am told, being constructed on
the same principle as a society of tailors and one of
shopmen which meet in this very house, with the
sole difference that among the vulgar, a fund, or post-
humous “benefit' is subscribed, and thus they may
be said to eat and drink for the good of their surviving
families.”
When Burnet had reached this point in his oration,
a little elderly man, wearing a shabby brown frock,
and curiously dirty linen, entered the room.
received by the company with sundry salutations, in
various degrees of familiarity, from,
to-night, Mr. Wilkins?” down to “Ha, old boy, how
dost?" To all of which he replied with scrupulous
politeness. By the time this ceremony of reception
was over, his quick grey eye had fastened for an in-
stant upon every face in the room; and at length,
fixing upon that of our hero, it “held him” as securely
as the Wedding Guest, when taken into custody by the
glance of the Ancient Mariner. Mr. Wilkins, then re-
jecting the proffer of a seat made in two or three
quarters at once, glided up to where William sat, and
addressed him in a sort of confidential whisper.
“ Fine seasonable weather, sir,” said he;
He was

country looks as if it did not know that the winter is
just at hand. Been lately in Wales?”
“Why, yes,” replied William, drawing mechani-
cally back, as a thousand stories of the peril which the
hapless stranger in London is doomed to undergo,
flashed
upon
his recollection.
“ Knew it!” said Wilkins. “ Have you seen the
new plough, or the patent harrow? I could show you
an assortment at a friend's warehouse that would asto-
nish you.”
** I am not an agriculturist,” replied William, reso-
lutely.
“1 dare say not; you look like one who would care
less to sow a corn-field than to trample one down, run-
ning after a covey of partridges. Talking of par-
tridges, I know a gentleman who might be induced to
part with a beautiful little setter, on reasonable terms.”
William shook his head.
“ A friend of mine has a fowling-piece for sale at a
mere nothing; I could get it turned into a detonator
for a few shillings.' William buttoned
up
his trow-
sers' pocket.
“I'll tell you what, sir,” said the persevering
stranger, “these cravats require to be bought by a
person who knows what he is about. You flatter
your-
self, I suppose, that you are wearing silk! Now, an
acquaintance of mine in the city could be prevailed
upon to dispose of a dozen, or any smaller or larger
number, of a quality that would make you wonder at
the price. As for waistcoating,” drawing a parcel
from his pocket, “ a friend of mine has just put into
my hands an article which I can absolutely vouch
for;” and he spread out upon the table a few yards of
figured silk. Many of the company gathered round
this miscellaneous dealer to look at his wares, and
William's awkwardness returned, as he found himself
placed in so conspicuous a situation.
* I take it upon myself,” at length, said a very

57
gentlemanlike person, who appeared to be on tolerably
good terms with himself; I take it upon myself to
say, that there is more worsted than silk in this
article.” Some of the company appeared disposed to
join him, while others strenuously rebutted the impu-
tation; and Wilkins, now appealing to one party and
now angrily arguing with the other, forgot entirely
the customer he had been so anxious to secure. In the
mean time the waistcoat piece was handed from one
to another, and presently the tumult rolled to the far-
ther end of the room.
Burnet appeared to be amused with the look, half
of alarm, half of curiosity, which the novice turned
upon him.
“You need not be afraid,” said he; “ they will not
eat you alive, for all you are a country cousin. Wil-
kins, strange as you may think it, will sell you any-
thing you can imagine quite as cheap as you could buy
it at the shops."
And this out of mere benevolence?"
“Not exactly. Competition runs so high in these
last days, that methods of obtaining custom are re-
sorted to which our ancestors never dreamed of. A
man would formerly recommend his wine or coal mer-
chant to a friend, without thinking of receiving ten
per cent. from the trader for his trouble. Now we have
changed all that; everything is marketable, down to
our very conversation. As for Wilkins, he has carried
the business to the pitch of caricature: he is in the
most general sense a general agent; but where he
lives, or how he lives, no living man knows; he is a
shrewd, clever fellow, and withal good-natured; but one
of those unfortunate devils with whom nothing pros-
pers: a very Tantalus, who would choke with thirst,
even if
up
to the neck in water.”

way.”
“ He is a shopman in the city, a denizen of the vast
establishment of Messrs. Dot and Co. Why do you
stare? He is really a well-looking fellow, and, for
aught I know, a gentleman's son. Some young men
have less spirit than you or I; or, which is the same
thing, more philosophy. His parents, no doubt,
taught him to write; but we all write, every one of us.
He, as it happened, was one of the many who could
find no employment for this universal qualification;
and he had probably the sense to set himself to learn
a business, easy in itself, and little embarrassing either
to mind or body. He is somewhat of a puppy, it is
true, but this is the fault of circumstances. Accus-
tomed from morning to night to handle, and to talk
and think of articles of dress, and to be stared and
simpered at by the women, it would be a wonder if
some effeminacy of mind and some puppyism of person
were not the result. One business makes a sloven,
another a dandy; and the latter is less ridiculous and
more amiable than the former.” At this moment
Burnet's full glass vanished from the table, and the
friends looking up, saw its contents poured into a ca-
pacious mouth behind them, somewhat in the manner
of the Hindoos, who fling their drink into their throats
without touching the vessel with their lips. Having
satisfactorily performed this feat, a man who was by
far the shabbiest of the company, nodded with a comic
familiarity to Burnet, and moved towards the door.
“ Put me in mind, Dick,” said he, “ to stand the
next time," and he disappeared into the passage.
Burnet did not seem to be in the least disconcerted
by the laugh which arose from the company at his
expense.
** He will be as good as his word,” said he; “ay,
and better : if Wigwam was not so intolerable an ass,
he would be a fine fellow. You look, William,” he

continued, “ as if you were disgusted by the dissipated,
desperate air, and poverty-stricken garb of this unce-
remonious acquaintance. Wigwam, nevertheless, is a
man of some talent, and great good-nature; and he is,
moreover, and I am sure the announcement will
awaken your respect, a 'gentleman of the press.'
“ Are you serious?”
“ He came to town a fine, frank, high-minded young
fellow, as sober as a hermit, and as devout as a mar-
tyr. Literature was the profession he adopted, but
whether he had ever a chance of success I never could
learn. It was his fortune to meet soon after his ar-
rival with a young girl, like himself an adventurer from
the country, whose qualifications for making a fortune
lay also in her head and fingers, for she could both
devise and execute a bonnet or a pelisse. Wigwam,
as simple and innocent as herself, and possessed withal
by a gallant and adventurous spirit, paid his addresses,
probably to the tune of the old ballad:-
'A heart as soft, a heart as kind
A heart as sound and free,
As in the whole world thou canst find-
That heart I'll give to thee!'
His offer was accepted: they were married Burnet
stopped suddenly, and shoved back his chair.
“And what became of them? what became of her!”
inquired William, with interest.
As to her, I do not know," answered his friend,
coldly; " you see what has become of him!”
Does he still live by literature?"
“He is a reporter for the newspapers, of that class
which is paid three half-pence a line for their para-
graphs.
· Three half-pence a line! That seems a magnifi-
cent sum to me.”
“It is a sum on which a man might live with toler-

able comfort, were it not for the trifling circumstance
of the editor having it in his power either to cut down
or reject altogether. This renders the profession—for
it is a distinct and crowded profession--one of the
most precarious imaginable; and as its followers, in
order to give themselves a chance of making as many
three half-pences as possible, are in the habit of spin-
ning out their sentences and distending their details
beyond all reasonable rule, they have fallen into obloquy
and contempt.”
Burnet became graver and more
sullen every moment. Some unconscious analogy be-
tween his own circumstances and those of Wigwam's
family seemed to be weighing down his spirits. “Come,
come,' said he, at length, starting up; “I have no
more lions for you to-night. These people are all
decent tradesmen, fat and greasy citizens; I will walk
with you to the bottom of the street and put you in
the road to your inn. Good night, gentlemen!”
“Good night, good night!”

The excitement of William's feelings had not abated
when he parted with his friend, but its character was
changed. There was nothing in common, he knew,
between himself and the persons who had just been
described to him, but there certainly seemed to be a
marvellous similarity in the circumstances in which
their course of adventure had commenced. An uneasy
sensation arose in his bosom; a sort of qualm run
across his heart, and he stopped suddenly in the street,
and threw a bewildered glance among the dark forest
of houses by which he was surrounded. The night-
air was cold and yet heavy; it seemed as if he could
not breathe freely; he felt that he had no chance of
sleeping very soon, and he determined therefore to
try the effect of a walk before betaking himself to
bed.


## p. 62 (#506) #############################################

THE GAME OF LIFE.
And onward he did walk, he knew not, and cared
not in what direction, and so deeply immersed in spe-
culation as to be utterly unconscious of the lapse of
time. The streets were gradually deserted; the lights
disappeared from the windows; and at length one
o'clock pealing from the tower of a distant church,
startled him to recollection. The solemn sound
seemed to awaken a thousand echoes around, for it
was repeated in various tones, and at various dis-
tances, for a considerable time; and, mingling with
them, near at hand, some hoarse human murmurs were
heard, which his ear was at length enabled to separate
into their component words, “past one!” By and bye
the bells and voices died gradually away, and all was
silent as before.
William was, by this time, although he did not then
know the locality, in Piccadilly, beside the Green Park.
He observed, on the opposite side of the street a man
leaning on the rails, and apparently looking attentively
at the jet d'eau which plays in the pond; and taking
this person for a watchman, he crossed over to ask
him the way to his inn. The man did not at once
reply to his question, but, on its being repeated in a
louder tone, jumped suddenly round, and, rubbing his
eyes
“Od so!” said he, “I declare I was almost asleep.
Hang that drowsy water; I always hated the liquid as
if it had been poison. But how—is it you? My dear
fellow, I am glad to see you!” shaking him heartily
by the hand.
“ How have

been?
up to, eh? So, you have left our friend Dick at his
muddy ale. Have you quarrelled with your land-
lady?” William had by this time identified the stranger
with poor Wigwam, whose story had so much interested
him a few hours before; and forgetting, or uncaring,
that not even the ceremony of introduction had passed
between them, returned the grasp as cordially as it
was given.

his
“ Come, what are you up to?” repeated the repor-
ter.
“ I was just about to ask you to point out the near-
est way into Holborn. I have wandered from the inn
where I arrived this evening; and it is now full time
to think of bed.” Wigwam turned a look of comic
incredulity upon his companion; but the expression
vanished at the first glimpse of the clear eye and open
brow of our adventurer. He hesitated for a moment,
and turned away his head; but rallying suddenly, he
cocked his weather-beaten hat, and hemming away
confusion-
“ Come along, then,” cried he; “step out, my fine
fellow; you could not have met with a better pilot in
England.”
“Not for the world!” exclaimed William; “I would
not take you a yard out of your way at an hour like
this, much less a distance that appears to me to be
several miles.” Wigwam turned suddenly round, and
looked him full in the face.
“I thought I had told you,” said he, “that I had
quarrelled with my landlady. Sink me, it has been
the lot of many a good fellow before now!
But never
mind, there is a moon above, although obscured by
these sulky-looking clouds; and for me there is corn
in Egypt, my boy, corn in Egypt still. Come along!”
and he strode rapidly away.
William read the meaning of his companion's meta-
phor in his features, air, manner, and dress; and with
a feeling of commiseration mingled with horror, fol-
lowed him in silence through the gloom. Can this be
London, thought he, the queen of cities, the wealthy,
the generous? or are these so many omens sent from
heaven to warn me of the ruin into which I am about
to plunge? Resolving, at all events, that the misery
he could not remove, he would at least relieve for the
moment, he asked Wigwam whether he knew of any
house of public reception where they could both be

accommodated for the remainder of the night. The
inn was out of the question: so vagabond a figure as
that presented by the reporter would not be ad-
mitted.
“Where we can both be accommodated?” repeated
the latter. “ To be sure I do, my dear fellow; a
dozen, if that were necessary; only put me in mind
that I stand the next time. I will take you to a
house much nearer than the inn, where
you will see
what London is made of. I knew there was corn in
Egypt,” continued he, half aloud, and rubbing his
hands, as he quickened his pace almost to a run, “I
said there was corn in Egypt!”
But, sir,” said William, catching hold of his arm,
“I do not wish just at this time, to inquire into the
materials of London society; my object is to get to
bed as speedily as possible.
“At your option, lad, at your option,” replied the
reporter, “but I like the fireside as well, sometimes.
There will be only a few of us, owing to the great
fight at Epping; quite a family party, I assure you.
Musing on what connexion could possibly subsist be-
tween the great fight at Epping and the family party
they were about to join, our adventurer followed his
guide in silence, and in due time they stopped before
a house in James's Street, Covent Garden.
Wigwam tapped, apparently in a peculiar manner,
and after some difficulty the wanderers were admitted.
The apartment into which they were received was di-
vided like a coffee-room; and with its bare wooden
benches, stained walls, and dirty floor, strewed with
sawdust, looked as if it was intended only for the very
lowest classes of society. The company, at first sight,
seemed to be as much out of their sphere as the shop-
man at the Three Puncheons. It consisted of fifteen
or twenty men, for the most part genteelly dressed,
and nearly the same number of women, in silks and
satins, and a few in downright ball costume. The

most fashionable freedom prevailed. The jest went
round—not delicate, it is true, but sufficiently pointed;
and this was followed by the stroke of manual humour;
while the whole received a certain poignancy from the
frequent oath and imprecation with which the speech
of both sexes was garnished. Here and there a stranger
might be observed, apparently from the country, glaring
with drunken curiosity upon the unaccustomed scene,
evincing a sense of his danger by surly defiance, or
affecting to brave it it by impertinent intrusion. These
were the men, no doubt, destined to raise up their
aching, empty heads, and great calf's eyes, to Sir
Richard Birnie in the morning, complaining of evils to
which their own stupidity had exposed them, and im-
ploring redress for injuries which their own imprudence
had provoked. As for Wigwam, he made himself
perfectly at home in a moment, shook hands with the
men, rallied or tickled the women, sipped everybody's
coffee—for “the sober berry's juice" was the refresh-
ment at least in this apartment, and seemed to be a
prodigious favourite with the whole company.
William
gazed at first in amused surprise, which was gradually
succeeded by disgust and aversion; and at length slip-
ping a piece of money into Wigwam’s hand, he made
his retreat. The reporter pocketed the gift with great
complacency; but as our adventurer vanished into the
lobby, he bawled after him-
“ Hollo, Bill, be sure you put me in mind that I
stand the next time!"
It was late before William awoke the next day, and
while running over in his memory the scenes and cha-
racters of the previous night, he dressed in haste and
almost trepidation. A few hours, he felt, would vir-

court, what interest they were disposed to take in his
affairs, and what benefit he was likely to reap from
their good offices. Of his two letters of introduction,

ness; he
the one addressed to Mr. Irvine, the East India mer-
chant, seemed the most important; and he therefore
inquired his way to the Royal Exchange, near
which was situated the counting-house of his expected
patron.
He mounted the steps with a beating heart. Mr.
Irvine was within; the visitor's name? William Clive.
In an minute, the clerk returned to ask his busi-
gave
him the letter of introduction, and was
speedily ushered into the inner counting-room. Mr.
Irvine, a handsome, middle-aged, gentlemanlike man,
received him politely, asked a few questions, was sorry
he had no vacancy at present, did not know of any
elsewhere, and seldom heard of such things; would
keep the affair in mind, however; was in the habit
himself of applying to a situation-agent when he wanted
an assistant, his clerk would give him the person's ad-
dress, wished him a very good morning, and would be
delighted to hear of his success.
Little time lost, however!" said William, bitterly,
as he descended into the street. “This is the true way
of doing business! So—h! here is one anchor gone!
God help me when I shall be entirely adrift on this
boisterous sea, with no dependence but on my smooth-
water sails, and fair weather skill!” He resolved,
notwithstanding, to call upon the agent mentioned by
Mr. Irvine, although, it must be confessed, with little
hope of deriving any benefit from his assistance. He
found him in a court near Lombard-street, in a little
counting-room at the top of the house. He was a
grave, elderly, respectable-looking person, and a huge
book lay open before him. The agent desired to know
his qualifications.
“I know a little Greek, and Latin, and French,
and Italian. I learnt book-keeping at school, and I
have been considered to write a good hand.'
“Shall I enter your name, and address, and qualifi-
cations, and references ?”

“If you please.”
“ The fee is half-a-guinea.” William reddened,
and thrust his hand hastily into his pocket. He drew
the coin half way out from among its few, few com-
panions; but his heart failed him, and he allowed it to
drop again to the bottom.
"I would prefer, sir,” said he, paying you double
or treble the money when I obtain a situation, and
even allowing you a reasonable per centage on the
salary.”

“ That is contrary to my way of doing business,"
said the agent, calmly.
Then, at least, tell me, if it be in your power,
what are my prospects of success, supposing I enter,
my name in
your books."
“ Certainly; I wish to mislead nobody. The quali-
have mentioned are almost wholly useless,
some of them worse than useless; and the fate of your
application, therefore, will depend upon the respecta-
bility and friendship of the parties to whom you mean
to refer.”
" It is enough; I will not trouble you; good morn-
ing." He hurried down the stairs, and strode, in a
kind of desperation, to a house in the regions of Fins-
bury, which was pointed out to him as the residence
of the Blanks. Here he was ushered into a room
where several ladies were at lunch, eating soup; and
he was hardly permitted to deliver his letter till he had
joined them in the amusement. Genealogies were then
settled, and family likenesses detected; and, at length
he secretly congratulated' himself on the safe esta-
blishment of the fact, that he had really some of the
rich blood of the Blanks, however diluted and adulte-
rated, in his veins. They then treated of his business
in town, and declared themselves highly interested in
his inquiries, and absolutely certain of their successful
termination.
“Your son-in-law, ma'am," hinted William, “I

have heard is in extensive business, and of course em-
ploys a suitable number of clerks?"
He is one of the greatest merchants in the city,"
said Mrs. Blank; “but as to our recommending
his clerks, we do not meddle with these things at
all; indeed we have declined it on several occasions :
however, we dine at five precisely, and shall be most
happy to see you any and every day you like."
William looked grave.
“But you have many other friends, no doubt, equally
capable of assisting me in my views, and to whom å
word from you would be a command.”
“Oh, no! you are quite mistaken, we have no in-
fluence now in the world; indeed, we never lay our-
selves out for these things.”
“But
you
will be sure to come to dinner,” added
one of the daughters.
• Yes, do,” said the other, “take apartments in
the neighbourhood; it will be so convenient just to pop
in at five, and we are always happy to see any body
at dinner!” William, with a burning cheek and a
labouring bosom, took his leaves and was again in the
midst of the crowded part of the city, before awaken-
ing to a distinct recollection of the circumstances of
his situation. He was now upon his own resources.
Of what did they consist? and in what way were they
to be employed ? A thousand puzzling questions sug-
gested themselves to his mind, and at length he stood
stock still in the middle of the footway, and looked
about like one who had lost his way.
Indecision, however, of this kind, will not do in
London; the next passer-by elbowed him out of his
way, and a woman, into whose path he was thus thrown,
swore at him like a trooper. This feminine creature
was one of the girls employed by the newsmen, and a
bundle of papers she carried under her arm suggested
an idea at which he grasped with eagerness. He pur-
chased from her a journal celebrated for the number

69
of its advertisements, and posting himself up against
the wall, opened the important page. The very first
advertisment which caught his eye made his heart beat
and his eyes sparkle.
“Wanted immediately, a gentleman under thirty,
to undertake a situation of high respectability, and
considerable emolument. References required. Apply
to R. W. No. 90, Westley Street, Borough." He
crushed the newspaper into his pocket, inquired the
way to the Borough, ånd sprung impetuously forward
to the adventure.
Crossing London Bridge, he saw the Thames for
the first time. Its broad bosom, studded with innu-
merable barges, glittered in the sunlight; here and
there, amidst the crowd of canoe-like skiffs, a silken
pennon, or a painted canopy, or a gilded prow, marked
the path of wealth or civic honour; all was mirth and
motion; the shrill laugh of ladies leaped along the
water, and mingled with the sound of the bugle or the
flute; barges passed and repassed; the river tumbled
along in music and in joy, and every component atom
of its surface seemed to move and quiver in the sun.
William's heart, too, danced at the sights and sounds;
he seemed to acquire fresh vigour from the breeze
which blew over the water, and fresh hope from the
gladsome scene around. He pushed gallantly forward,
and at length dived, on the southern side of the river,
into a new wilderness of houses which rose from the
water's edge.
It was a considerable time before he could find the
place indicated in the advertisement, and his dread of
being too late increased every moment. At length
the fortunate words, “ Westley Street” appeared on
the corner of a house, and he ran forward with renewed
celerity. He was in hopes that the mean appearance
of the buildings would disappear, as he had sometimes
found it to do, on advancing into the street; but here
the very reverse was the case : and at length when he

found himself in a dirty, narrow lane, surrounded by
all the usual indications of wretchedness and vice
which distinguish the abodes of the congregated poor
in cities, he became convinced that he had mistaken
his way, and bitterly regretted the time he had lost in
exploring so worthless a channel. On arriving, how-
ever, at the required number, he had the curiosity to
look in at the
open
door.
The only furniture which graced the apartment,
that seemed to have been transported from an Irish
bog, was a fragment of a counting-house desk, the
rents in which were here and there concealed from
prying eyes by patches of brown paper, and behind
it, a stool, minus the third leg. That the latter article
was able to maintain so handsomely as it did its
position on only two legs, was owing to an individual,
the solitary denizen of the room, who poised himself
upon it so ingeniously, that an unobservant spectator
would have imagined the feat had been performed for
the sitter's own convenience or recreation, while he
hung over the pages of a huge mercantile-looking
book before him. William was staggered by this ap-
pearance of business; and drawing forth the news-
paper, compared the number again with that on the
door. The man still did not look up, and our adven-
turer, at length somewhat abruptly asked, -
Pray, sir, are you R. W. ?”
• Thirty-two-forty-one-fifty-five- fifty-eight,"
muttered the accountant, running up the money column
with his eye and pen. “I shall attend to you in a moment,
sir.”
William, after waiting two or three moments,
threw another glance round the apartment, and, in-
dignant at having been seduced into hope by so very
shabby a concern, repeated his question with an em-
phasis he did not use on ordinary occasions.
“ I say, sir, are you R. W.?”-upon which the
accountant, placing his finger upon the figure at which
he had been interrupted, raised his head slowly to ex-

amine the face of his customer, and to the great
astonishment of our adventurer, disclosed the features
of the universal agent, Mr. Wilkins. The advertiser
stared at his client with unmoved gravity, and then
bowing solemnly, saluted him by his name.
• Allow me to place a chair for you, good sir. Never
mind, they are all up stairs. By the way, it is no bad
idea—that walking-cane which unfolds into a seat, the
thing may be useful sometimes. The original inventor
is a friend of mine, and I could get one for you at
prime cost.”
“ That is not the question now, Mr. Wilkins,” said
William, half provoked and half amused. “ I have
wandered here in search of R. W. and I am desirous
of inquiring into the nature of the situation he ad-
vertises."
“ The situation,” said Mr. Wilkins, “is a very good
one, a very good one, indeed. Our custom is, for the
applicant to deposit a trifle, only a shilling, merely
for the trouble of booking; and thus, being in posses-
sion of his name, address, qualifications, and refer-
ences, if he happens to be the successful candidate,
we can, in due time, let him know all about it, you
know.' William could not help smiling in the midst
of his vexation.
“ Come then," said he, “ admit me as a candidate:
there is your shilling.'
Not from a friend!” exclaimed the agent; “never
from a friend! No, no, my dear sir, if you were a
stranger it would be another matter. Well, if it
must be so this is really uncivil: never mind, we'll
go over the way, and I'll treat you to a pint of ale."
William, with difficulty, excused himself from accept-
ing this liberal offer; but Mr. Wilkins would, at least,
see him to the door.
“ Adieu!” said he, shaking him by the hand;
“if we succeed, you may depend upon hearing from
ine."

amuse me.
“ After all, Mr. Wilkins,” remarked William,
taking a last peep at the office, do you think this is
exactly the place for-for-?”
Oh, you don't like the situation? Central, I
think, rather central; but you don't know town yet.”'
“I do not altogether mean geographically; but the
appearance—the appointments-the-"
“ You think it a little queer! a little rum-looking!
I dare say you do; but that's not much matter. We
don't ask half-a-guinea, like some folks: what can you
expect for a shilling?”
“ That is just the point. We expect, I think, as
much for one shilling as for twenty: we expect proba-
bility.”
"Probability! Pardon me, my dear sir, you quite
ility!
Go to the lottery and count probabilities:
go to the gaming-table, and calculate chances: go to
a common public-house raffle, and study philosophy!
He whose merchandize is hope, is above the petty laws
of trade. Who, after taking the trouble of coming
here, would lose his chance, however remote he might
think it, for the sake of a shilling? Adieu, now,
adieu. For aught you—or I-know, your money,
has
not been ill-spent: at least, when every other hope
shall fail you, you will think to yourself, if only for a
moment, 'I wonder whether anything will ever come
of it!' and that one thought, my dear boy, at such a
time, will be richly worth a shilling!"
William walked more leisurely-homewards? He
had no home; another night at the inn would almost
empty his pockets. What was to be done? Situa-
tions did not come, it appeared, when called upon; and
it was as absolutely necessary to eat and drink before
obtaining one as after. He resolved, in the first
place, to hire a cheap apartment; and in the second
place, although this was not without a struggle, he
was ashamed to think how violent, to offer Burnet as-
sistance in copying, the law-writer having informed

him that he was sometimes under the necessity of em-
ploying the pen of another. Both these affairs were
speedily managed. He was admitted as a lodger in a
respectable-looking house, on paying a week's rent in
advance; and Burnet, having luckily received that day
more work than he could himself get through, was
glad to accept of his friend's assistance, and did not
appear to be in any manner surprised at the offer.
This sort of employment was better than nothing; it
would at least support life till something better ap-
peared; and there was surely nothing degrading in
supporting life by such means. He had promised to
meet Burnet the same evening at the “ Three Pun-
cheons,” the public-house where they had been before;
and although wearied with his long wanderings, and
faint from want of sustenance, for he had been unable
to swallow a morsel of food the whole day, he set out
at nine o'clock to keep the appointment. Where was.
the necessity, it may be asked, for making such a pro-
mise at all, surely not very commendable in itself, and
peculiarly absurd on the present occasion? Burnet
had paid the night before. Of such are the reasons
that determine the actions of youth!
The company assembled at the “ Three Puncheons"
was much the same as on the evening before, although
with the exception of Simpkin, the gentleman shop-
keeper, there was no one present who had on that
occasion attracted his particular notice. Burnet had
recovered from his gloom; Simpkin indulged the com-
pany with a song; the joke and the merry story,
neither destitute of decency nor point, ran from table
to table; and at length our young and buoyant adven-
turer, awaking from the lethargy both of body and
mind into which the events of the day had thrown him,
began to feel a sensation of absolute enjoyment steal-
ing around his heart. This sensation increased; it
became more tumultuous; the hilarity was communi-
cated by degrees to Simpkin and his associates; and

at length even to the phlegmatic Burnet. If we only
remember for a moment his previous situation both
mental and bodily, his fatigue, his want of food, his
inexperience in drinking, we shall be prepared for the
result, which the patient reader will find detailed in a
future chapter.

When Mr. Vesper, the next morning after we left
him at Llanwellyn, awoke from a sleep unbroken ex-
cept by happy dreams, he heard with some vexation
that the London coach had already passed, and that
there was not a post-chaise to be had in the town.
“ Poor boy!” thought he, “I must not leave him long
to himself; he could not be in more dangerous com-
pany. He will discover, perhaps this night, the trick
I have played with his Bible, and the consequences
may be serious. After musing, however, some time
on the disappointment, with that happy philosophy
which usually prevails in a well-regulated mind, he
discovered that all had happened for the best. How
did he know, he inquired, what was the real character
of her who was to make or mar the happiness of his
protégé? Was he to be satisfied with the instinctive
interest inspired by a pretty face; to fall in love at
first sight, and yield up the government of his judg-
ment to his eyes? He determined to cloak his curi-

osity under the privileges sometimes claimed by elderly
gentlemen, and to spend the forenoon, perhaps provi-
dentially allowed to him, in prying into the recesses of
Helen's mind. " I will wink hard,” said he, smiling,
as he finished his morning's meal, “and her beauty
shall not bribe me; neither shall my senses be charmed
with that rich melodious voice, charm she never so
wisely.” The half-quaker hat and the shining brown
cane were then gaily assumed, and our speculator
sallied forth to business.
The morning presented a very beautiful specimen of
that most beautiful of all seasons, an English autumn;
and the scenery around the little town, with its varie-
ties of height and hollow, wood, lawn, and water, was
worthy of the lovely light which called forth its beauty.
Mr. Vesper, who was as much in the habit of rejoicing
with external nature as if he had been a pantheist in
his heart, walked joyously along, and reached the little
porch where he had seen the lovers part, at an hour so
unseasonably early that he hesitated some time before
knocking. The house was of the same size and form
as the neighbouring cottages, but distinguished from
them by a certain air of neatness, cleanliness, and even
taste. The little patch of ground before the wall was
laid out with botanical precision into a display of
various families of flowers, and defended from the foot-
way by a neat green paling. The porch, of rude
lattice-work, hung round with jasmine, looked like
a garden-bower; and the brightly clean glass of a little
window on each side glanced through a wreath of vine
leaves. “I am not too early,” determined Mr. Ves-
per; “with the mistress of this house it is already
mid-day.”
In the room into which he was shown by a little
girl, he found Miss Howard at a table with nearly a
dozen children at their studies. She was seated with
her back to the door, and repeating some verses to her
pupils, in a voice so singularly sweet that every word

seemed to sink into his heart. The lines he suspected
at the time to be her own; and as the sentiment
pleased him, and he was not very fastidious in poetry,
he took pains afterwards to ascertain the fact.
THE BUTTERFLY.
“Is this the type, as poets paint, of man's immortal doom,
When into life and light we spring victorious from the
tomb?
Alas, poor fly! a fleeting hour is thine, thy struggles
vain;
And, sinking soon, the child of dust returns to dust again.
Of human weakness rather thou the type dost seem to me;
Of thoughts that, from the grovelling earth, take wing and
upwards flee;
But, unsustained by heavenly power, yield to the passing
storm,
And, from a winged and glorious thing, descend a sordid
worm.
Father! to Thee for help I call, to aid my insect flight;
Invite me heavenward by thy love, sustain me by thy
might:
But if the taint doth still remain that waits on mortal
birth,
Hasten, O Lord, and break the chain that binds me to
earth!”
The young school-mistress, on recognising Mrs. Clive's
friend, rose up, and with an easy yet dignified polite-
ness, invited him to be seated. The apology for in-
trusion was then made with old bachelor-like formality,
and received with graceful good-humour; and Mr.
Vesper, whether remembering or not the caution he
had imposed upon his eyes and ears, found himself in

familiar conversation with the most interesting daugh-
ter of Eve he had as yet met with in the course of his
studies of human nature.
“ This is a serious charge, Miss Mordaunt,” said
he, after some time, and looking round at the little
students; “ a heavy responsibility on one so young.
The introducers of infant schools, I fear, did not con-
template their being followed up so soon by the appear-
ance of
“ Infant school-mistresses,” suggested Helen, with
a smile.
“ But you do injustice both to me and myo
establishment. This is not precisely what is called an
infant school; for all these children are capable of re-
ceiving methodical instruction without injury. The
danger, however, even with them, lies in teaching too
much, not too little. A child is always learning some-
thing; its faculties are never idle; and although for
the first short period of its life, it is, and ought to be
employed in trying and exercising the instincts of its
nature, yet very soon something more is discovered
than merely what is requisite for a being destined to
perform only the functions of animal life. Whenever
this is perceived, either in the acute question, or the
perplexed monologue, indicating that the struggles of
reason have begun, it is our duty not to develope pre-
maturely the faculties of thinking, but simply to give
a tone and direction to the infant thoughts. Those
would exist and go on, whether we interfered or not;
and our interference, if gently and tenderly exercised,
can do no harm.
child may be taught many useful
lessons with as little exercise and injury to its thinking
faculties as would have been the consequence of its own
unassisted attempts to reason; and as these lessons
must of necessity be plain and simple, as well as use-
ful to the mind, there can be no reason why a person
even so young as I am, should not be intrusted to teach
them.”

They were my mother's,” replied Helen,
rather they are my own; for I was never allowed to
form an opinion on any subject but one, till I had first
examined and found it correct.”
“ Which one do you except?”
I allude to religion. I was a Christian before I
knew that other forms of belief existed, and I was
taught to look for a confirmation of my faith, not in
books and arguments, but in the convictions of my
own breast.
The doctrines of infidelity, when I at
length read and listened to them, could not stand a
test like this: they had no witness within responding
to their truth; there was no moral connexion between
them and my soul; and thus their sophisms were not
the less impotent, because I was unable to expose them
logically; for I could even admire the ingenuity, while
I abhorred the doctrine—just as one may still retain a
detestation of murder, while he handles admiringly a
polished dagger, or sees with a smile the sparkle of a
cup of poison.
• Excellent mother!” exclaimed Mr. Vesper, mus-
ingly, and only half aloud.
Oh, yes; excellent mother!” cried Helen, elasp-
ing her hands, and breaking at once from the some-
what lecturing position she seemed to have taken, into
all the girlish enthusiasm of her age. “ Do you know,
sir, I sometimes cry when I think of her suddenly
(shaking away some glistening drops from her eye-
lashes) but then, when I think of her long and well, I
am so happy!”
“ Continue to think of her! Oh, continue !”—said
Mr. Vesper, taking both the hands of the fair young
creature within his; her memory
will be worth more
to your soul than all the saints in the calendar!”
He walked up the room with a troubled step, and
leant for a few moments out of the casement, which

opened into a little garden at the back of the house.
“I am my own gardener,” said Helen, “ so it is not
much expense; at least I am only helped by William,
that is, Mrs. Clive's son, when his mother comes some-
times to tea. I often grudge the time, but I love
flowers almost as well as if they were living things.
“ The time is not mispent,” remarked Mr. Vesper,
“provided the indulgence involves no sacrifice of more
important duties. There are some amusements, and
some perfumes, but not the cosmetics of the toilet,
young lady, which are conducive both to inward and
outward health. The Eastern nations, in the midst of
all their ceremonial absurdities, are not very unreason-
able in that beautiful connexion they would seem to
advocate between the purity of the soul and that of the
body.
Do you read French and Italian?” continued
he, looking at some books on a hanging shelf.
"I read the few books I have,” replied Helen, “but
these are so few that I hardly think I can know the
languages.”
“ And you play; this piano-forte takes up more
room than

Do
you play well?”
“ I think I do,” replied Helen, with simplicity, "I
have even thought that I played well enough to teach,
but, although I tried very hard, I could find no pupils-

“Why, did not your friends exert themselves; your
relations ?”
• Mrs. Clive did all she could, and so did William.”
“ But your relations ?”
“I have no relations; my mother, as you have heard,
was discarded by her family, and my father was a
stranger in the country. We left the place where we
were known, on account of an occurrence which made
us resolve never niore to return; here my poor mother
became unwell, and drooped-and drooped: we could
not go out, we were not very rich-and-and somehow
or other, we made no friends but the Clives."

Mr. Vesper's lip trembled, and his eyes glistened
as he looked at the poor, friendless, solitary girl, stand-
ing in the middle of her little apartment, surrounded
by the evidences of her industry, and the tokens of a
pious, graceful, and accomplished mind, and yet pre-
senting so touching a picture of loneliness and desola-
tion. "Is it possible, thought he, that this frail and
lovely bark could continue to float unhurt, amidst the
stormy elements of the world? Are the fables of poets.
and novelists merely fables, or is innocence really its
own protector, as virtue is its own reward? A vain
and daring imagination flashed across his mind; what
an opportunity to solve the problem! Suppose I were
to make the trial, to cast her into the seven times
heated furnace, and assay the seemingly pure metal of
her soul! But the next moment, rejecting with horror
the idea—with what face thought he, could I after-
wards pray for myself, “lead me not into temptation?”
What right have I to snatch the sceptre of God from
his hands, and assume the exercise of one of the most
awful and terrible of the functions of his government?

alone; you as much need assistance as I yearn to give
it. Although an old man, however, I am not yet quite
old enough to make the house of a bachelor a proper
asylum, according to the custom of the world, for so
young a woman; but allow me, I beseech you, to act
the father notwithstanding. Allow me to inquire into,
and supply your present wants, and to place you in a

every grace and accomplishment a traitor.” Helen
listened with deep emotion to this singular address; her
eyes filled, and for some moinents she could not com-
mand her voice to reply.
“I am very grateful,” she at last almost sobbed;
“ indeed, indeed I am; but look round you, my dear
sir; there is nothing here that bespeaks a poverty
which could tempt me to rob the more needy objects
of your benevolence; you see that I have plenty of
scholars, and plenty of health"
“And plenty of pride,” added Mr. Vesper,
Oh, no! it is not, indeed it is not; at least I think,
I hope, I am almost sure, it is not pride!”
“ It is nothing else," said Mr. Vesper, angrily,
looking at her fondly and admiringly through his
anger. Helen pondered for a moment, and then said
firmly
“Well then, sir, this night, when my head is on my
pillow, I will try to disembarrass myself from any sug-
gestions, either of pride or meanness; and think calmly

to come here, I will tell you what counsel I have re-
ceived."
“ To-morrow forenoon I shall be on my way to
London!”
“To London!” and her cheek flushed, and her eyes
sparkled" then perhaps you will see William Clive.
Oh, if you knew how much his mother is rapt up in
that only son! He is young, wild, and thoughtless;
but high-minded, and high-principled-generous, af-
fectionate.”
“ To you?” Helen cast down her eyes, but the
next moment looking up, answered proudly-
“ To all mankind, except the base, the sordid, and
the mean.”
“My good girl," said Mr. Vesper, “I did not mean
to affront you; but what connexion has William Clive

with the subject before us? Tell me only what your
wishes are, candidly and at once, and to me they shall
be commands."
“I have no mother now,” replied Helen, “to rejoice
in my success, or be cast down even to the grave with
my failure. I have a profession adequate to my sup-
port, and I am of that sex which ought to be un-
tr bled with the stirrings of worldly ambition. In
all these respects I am different from William Clive.
Transfer your benevolent offers of assistance to him!
To reject them for myself, in the easy
circumstances
in which I am placed, could cost me no reasonable
sacrifice; but if it did, it should be cheerfully made,
being due to friendship and gratitude.'
“It shall be done!” said Mr. Vesper suddenly, and
he shook the young orphan's hand with an agitation
that seemed like the trembling of a nervous affection.
“ Farewell! but not for long; think of your mother,
my dearest child; pray for the strange old man who
would have been unto you as a father; remember
William Clive; hope all things and so farewell, and
may the blessing of the Almighty remain with you!"
Helen followed him to the door, and looked through
tears at his retreating figure till it was lost in the dis-
tance.
The rest of that day was spent by Mr. Vesper in
the pleasing, but not very profitable occupation of
castle-building; to which a letter written to his friend
the curate, in the evening, might be considered as no-
thing more than a sequel.
"I have at length found,” said he to the worthy
backgammon player," the very thing for which my
soul thirsted. The vague and general instincts which
formed my attraction to the species of which I am an
individual, are now, in one point, twined and concen-
trated. I do not, however, love the number of man-
kind less. The social sympathies and affections, of
which the human heart, when in a healthy state, is

way, are not to be marvelled at, or considered as an
anomaly in God's government of his creatures by the
laws of nature; our palate in the same manner doats
upon the sweetmeats which are destructive to health,
and turns with loathing from the medicines whose pro-
perty it is to preserve and restore it; and in both
instances we are presented with a striking and beauti-
ful proof of the intended subjection of the animal by

and as he leaps to shore I run and fall upon his neck,
and weep aloud for joy.
“ The moral history of the young woman will be of
a less exciting character. I shall allow her to remain
in the calm but useful retirement befitting her sex; I
shall supply her from time to time with books, and
with such things as are required for the harmless or
beneficial accomplishments; I shall watch over the
progress and development of her mind; I shall pry
curiously into the nice and delicate change which takes
place when the innocence of ignorance and inexperience
is gradually absorbed into that of principle and reflec-
tion ; wearied with the strife and excitement of my
other thoughts, I shall retire into the purity and
domestic quiet of her mind as to a pleasant home; and
at last, when my little romance has drawn to a close,
in the intimate union of the two characters, so distinct
yet so much alike, I shall possess a happiness without
fear and without alloy, and in the calm bosom of that
family of love, so far at least as this world is con-
cerned, shall find an abiding place, and a continuing
city."
The reply of the curate, although it interrupts our
chronology a little, may as well be given here.
“ Better stick to the dice,” said that sensible divine,
“boys and girls are troublesome things to play with.
Well
may you call your plan a romance, and it is not
the least foolish of the few I have read in my day.
The mole may ape the lynx, and be only laughed at
for his pains; but when a wise man like you thinks of
usurping the place of a providence, it is time to cry,
. God be with us!' No man can calculate to a nicety
the effects of human causes. Your intromission, for
instance, with the lad's Bible may be the occasion of
his ruin. Your continued action on his destiny must
also in any way be injudicious. If it is open and
avowed, he can have no merit in braving misfortunes

of which he knows the extent and termination; and if
it comes like a hap-hazard affair, just in the nick of
time, as they say, unless his mind be very well ballas-
ted indeed, he will soon forget that there is a God
above him. However, I do not deny that these growls
of mine may be partly the effect of ill humour; and of
a surety it is enough to injure the temper of a saint to
behold the winter at hand, and the nights drawing in,
and the fire already looking so cheerful on the hearth,
while nothing is seen on The Mount, when I take my
evening walk, but dark windows, or, if I peep sadly
in, an empty fire-place and a closed dice-board. Do,
my dear friend, think of it; bring the young couple

CHAPTER VI.
A BLOT.
A bletherin, blusterin, drunken blellum.
BURNS.
A LONG 'enough time had elapsed since his last visit to
London, to give an appearance of novelty to Mr.
Vesper's feelings as he found himself once more enter-
ing the huge metropolis. One exulting smile, one
throb of patriotic pride, were given to nature, as this
colossal monument of his country's greatness broke
upon his view; but when the carriage rolled into the
crowded streets, where famine was seen standing
abject at the door of plenty, rags elbowing gay em-
broidery, smiles sparkling on one face, and tears on
another; where were heard, mingling in wild chorus,
the groan and the laugh, the curse, the hail, the shout,
and the scream, his smile vanished, and his heart was
still. Not that his mind was cast down by the vicinity
of misery, or his brow drawn into frowns at the aspect
of crime; at every step he found a redeeming good for
every evil, and in contemplating the “mingled yarn”
of human life, his adjusted feelings unconsciously

settled into the calm which it is the labour of philo-
sophy to seek.
His first business after arrival, was to look for his.
intended protégé, but here an unexpected difficulty
occurred. He went to the East India merchant, on
whom he knew William was to have called as soon as
he reached town; but Mr. Irvine, although patiently
and good-humouredly endeavouring to recollect the
circumstance, was some time before he could call to
mind that a young man, whose name he did not re-
member, had, indeed, been with him on the business
mentioned by Mr. Vesper a few hours before. Wil-
liam had not left his address, which the man of busi-
ness thought informal and improper; but he had no
doubt that the inquirer would find it at the office of the
situation-agent in the neighbourhood, to whom Mr.
Irvine usually referred the young men who applied to
him on such matters.
To the agent, accordingly, Mr. Vesper went, and
was abruptly informed that no such person had been
there.
“ That is very strange,
remarked Mr. Vesper;
can there be no mistake?”
“ You see, sir,” said the man, turning down his
folio, “his name is not here: no one entrusts his busi-
ness to me whose name and address, together with his
wishes, qualifications, and references, I do not set
down, in his own presence, in this book.”
Mr. Vesper, surprised, sorry, and almost angry, now
bent his steps towards the residence of the Blanks.
“He has been here,” said they, “but he did not leave
his address; and, what is odd, he would not come to
dinner!”
What is to be done? debated Mr. Vesper within
himself, when he was once more in the street, surely
the young man is more than usually careless and im-
prudent. If he depends upon Mr. Irvine alone, does
he expect that he will advertise for him when he finds

89
a situation?
What could be his reason for not taking
the advice so judiciously given, to apply to a man
whose interest it would be to assist him? And why,
at least, would he not dine with the Blanks, who
appear to be good, hospitable sort of people, and both
able and willing to assist him in his search for employ-
ment?
Meditating in this manner, but, at the same time
casting a wary eye at the passers by, in the vain hope
of finding, accidentally, the object of his search, he
passed the time in traversing the principal thorough-
fares, till the evening drew definitely in. At length,
passing one of the numerous newspaper offices in Fleet
Street, the idea struck him that an advertisement
would be at once the speediest and most efficacious
means he could adopt. He will see it, thought he,
to-morrow morning; for no expectant mind in London
can rest without reading the daily advertising columns,
and I shall be in possession of his address in the course
of the day, and at liberty to commence the line of
operations I have determined upon. Having written
the notice in a coffee-house, he went into the first
office he could find, and presented it to a man who sat
upon the counter in a singularly familiar posture,
bestriding it with his legs, while he harangued with
much unction the clerks behind.
The man had no sooner cast his eye upon the
paper,
than he sprang from his seat with so sudden a jerk as
to expose and enlarge an already considerable rent in
his coat beneath the shoulder, through which linen
was discovered, innocent to all appearance, for many
months, of soap and water.
“W. C. of Llanwellyn!” cried he, reading the
advertisement, “ Fetch me, if it is not Bill Clive he
means! By the powers that be, my old buck, we will
put the seven shillings to a better use than giving
them to these cormorant ragamuffins. There-
tearing the advertisement in pieces, “I'll undertake

to place you before the eyes of Bill in twenty
minutes; although, if by that time, he is beyond
the seeing point, it is neither your fault nor mine, you
know.”
" Then you know where he lodges?" inquired Mr.
Vesper.
"Where he lodges!" repeated the other, with a
stare of drunken humour, “Fetch me, if that is not a

know where the cuckoo roosts, or
the rock-cod turns in! Bill lodges, like many a capi-
tal fellow, where he likes, or where he can; but the
exact meridian of the spot I believe is what few can
tell, except sometimes when the watchman catches
him dozing in his box, or the police offices in the
morning prate of his whereabout.
“ You know at least where he is to be found,” said
Mr. Vesper, disgusted, and half-alarmed, although
aware that his informer must have been almost abso-
lutely ignorant of William's character and habits.
“I know the house he uses," replied Wigwam,
“and to prove it, if you will promise to stand some-
thing, I will take
you
there incontinent."
“The house he uses???

and that you are disinclined to open a new one?”
"No," said Wigwam, "I mean quite the reverse;
that
my account is not paid, and that they won't let
me open a new one.” Mr. Vesper, ashamed of his
companion, and unwilling to enter the haunts of such
company, hesitated for some moments; but his so
lately-born affection triumphed, and he at length pro-
mised to "stand” as much as would do the drinker
good—a quantity which Wigwam appeared to think an
exceedingly liberal allowance, for he shook the old

gentleman heartily by the hand, and declared him to
be the honestest fellow he had ever met with in his
life. They had not journeyed long, however, along
the crowded streets, till he began to think that he was
letting his evidently country acquaintance off too
easily.
“Odd so!” cried he, stopping suddenly short, “I
was like to have committed a grievous error in my
reckoning. Down this blind alley, not above a score
of doors off, there is a place where it is ten to one our
friend Bill is at this moment, rattling the dominoes,
on his way to the Three Puncheons. Call for what
you like,” continued he, whispering, as he dragged
his companion into the hall of a low public-house;
“ anything better than mere heavy, and I will pay you
to-morrow. In another moment Mr. Vesper found
himself coughing, spitting, and weeping as bitter
tears, in
physical sense, as he had ever shed, in
an atmosphere of tobacco smoke, where some hu-
man figures appeared dimly through the gloom, and
various ill-assorted voices rang tumultuously in his
ears.
Wigwam, after having given his order, cautiously
followed by the words “for this gentleman,” joined
eagerly in the conversation around,
and speedily made
himself so much at home that he was invited by more
than one unwashed artificer to drink out of his glass.
This compliment he returned by freely submitting his
own, and Mr. Vesper's untasted measure to their
discretion; and he was at length only prevailed upon,
by a stern whisper from his companion, to bid adieu
to the genial scene.
A second time the same trick was successfully
played, and our philosopher found himself dragged
into a society assembled in a house in Holborn, where
the quiet and respectable appearance of the company
made him view with a sidelong look of shame the
shabby exterior and flustered manner of his companion.

." That is Tom Spring," said the latter, eagerly,
pointing his finger to a well-dressed man of agreeable
features, with the exception of a broken nose,
" that
is Neat; that is Belcher himself,” running over a
catalogue of names, which Mr. Vesper remembered to
belong to the most celebrated heroes of the Fancy.
After emerging from this pugilistic resort, the re-
porter, finding from the lateness of the hour, that it
was absolutely necessary to push directly for their
ultimate destination, gave a loose to his imagination,
before occupied in schemes of spunging on his compa-
nion's inexperience, in topics more interesting and
important. His ideas probably received their direction
from Mr. Vesper's question:-
“How, sir, did you happen first to become acquain-
ted with Mr. William Clive?”
“ Is it with Bill?” said Wigwam. “By the Lord
Harry, that is a thing not ill to do! It is but two
days since we set eyes on each other, and yet, would
you believe it? we are like two cherries, as Shakspere
says, growing on one stalk. We met at the Three
Puncheons the first night of his coming to town.
There were a dozen of us, good men and true, all
quietly engaged in discussing the affairs of the nation,
when the young rake-hell made his appearance, hissing
hot from Wales. It is surprising the power of moral
attraction. In less time than I could pen a paragraph
we were sitting elbow to elbow, lighting pipes at one
another's mouths, and drinking out of the same glass.
Drinking, indeed, is his fault, though a friend says it;
and it was not without some coaxing, and I may
add,
a little well-meant violence, that I got him on his legs
at twelve o'clock. Well, sir, you may think I had
more bowels than to leave the young man to himself
at such an hour, in a strange city, exposed to all the
casualties of the night, drunken watchmen, and bad
women-for you know, in his then state, a little queer-
ish or so, he might see · Helen's beauty in a

it.'
“What is that you say, sir?” said Mr. Vesper,
fiercely; "did he mention the name of Helen?”
“ Helen!” said the reporter, “I'll take it upon my
conscience he did! • Helen's beauty,' exclaimed he;
well, never mind; where was I? Oh, in Piccadilly!
‘My dear friend,' says I, 'where are you going; what
are you up to?' - Anything,' says he, have you any
tin?' •No,' says I, 'I have left my purse at home,
and my jade of a landlady will not let me in to fetch
Never mind, my boy,' says he, we will make
a night of it, if it costs me fifty pounds!' Here Mr.
Vesper groaned. “And so," continued Wigwam, “in
spite of all my dissuasions, he took the way to the
Finish in James's Street, to which I followed him out
of sheer compassion for his youth."
“Pray how did he find his way to that den of
infamy?" inquired Mr. Vesper.
“ 'Fore George, it is more than I can say,” replied
his informer; “ but he is a forward youth, that is the
truth of it; a lad of genius, upon my honour, only
too much given to drink—a little too much given to
drink.'
* Your testimony on that subject,” said Mr. Vesper,
“I consider to be worth nothing. The young man is
just out of the bosom of his mother's family, in the
country, and must be as ignorant, I should think, of
the vice of drunkenness as you appear to be of the
virtue of sobriety."
Fetch me, if ever I heard the like!” cried the
reporter. Hollo, watchman, what's o'clock?”
Half-past ten," muttered the fellow, sulkily, as
he passed.
"Look ye then, sir," continued Wigwam, laying
hold of Mr. Vesper by the arm, and making a dead
stop; we are within a dozen yards of the Three
Puncheons, and I'll bet you a sovereign, that Bill
Clive is drunk now!”
“Pooh, nonsense!”

“Bet then, only bet,” fumbling in his empty poc-
kets, “ I'll stake the money at the bar, if you doubt
my honour; come, is it done? Do say done! Done?”
" Done?”
Why, then, done! Give me your fist, my boy, I
always said you were a game old cock,” and so say-
ing, he shook Mr. Vesper by the hand with much
cordiality. As they approached the door of the public-
house, loud voices were heard within, which Wigwam
pronounced to indicate 56
a row,” The ery of “watch!
watch!” was at length heard repeatedly, and as they
entered the hall, a storm of acclamations, curses, and
defiances, mingled with the dragging of tables and
chairs, and the grating noise of shoes on the floor,
declared beyond all question that they were entering
a field of battle. The reporter pushed forward with
the alacrity of his trade, and dragged his companion
after him.
“ There they are at it!” cried he, come along,
my fine fellow! now is the time-go it, my boys, keep
up the glory!” and the two strangely assorted com-
panions burst into the room.
“ Well done, Clive!” shouted Wigwam with re-
newed vociferation, and slapping Mr. Vesper on the
back-“there is the man we want, that is Welsh Bill
the leek for ever!”
Mr. Vesper's shocked and terrified glance had
already sought and found his protégé.
He was
standing in the middle of the floor, with his waistcoat
and shirt torn open; one hand was twisted in the
neckcloth of an antagonist, and with the other he
brandished the fragment of a chair; while in his
hoarse voice and gleaming eyes were but too visible
the traces of intoxication as well as rage. The next
moment several watchmen burst into the fray, and a
a general rush was made to the door. Mr. Vesper
was carried out into the street by the torrent, which
melted suddenly away from before his
eyes--all

except Wigwam, who stuck pertinaciously by his
side.
Good night,” said the former, in a voice divided
between sorrow and anger, good night: you were
right, and I thank you.
“Good night?” replied Wigwam, “what do you
mean by that, I should be glad to know? You don't
mean to hedge off, do you?”
“ Leave me, sir; I am in no mind for further fool-
ing,” replied Mr. Vesper, sternly.
“ Oh, bloody noses!” cried the reporter, “ here is
fooling with a vengeance! I am done as brown as a
plum-pudding; so you don't mean to pay the sovereign
you betted me about Bill's sobriety?”
“ There-there,” said Mr. Vesper, putting the
coin into his hand, “ and now rid me of your impu-
dent company this moment.” Wigwam looked at the
money for some moments with a gaze almost of in-
credulity, and then called after Mr. Vesper in a
softened tone.
“Stay, sir,” said he, “ the night is cold; are you
sure that you, too, have not quarrelled with your

house opening as he passed, to let some person out.

BYRON.
It was late the next morning when William Clive
awoke, and looked round his apartment with some-
thing of the dismay which may be supposed to agitate
a guilty spirit on rising up from the sleep of the grave.
His temples throbbing with almost intolerable pain,
his whirling stomach, his swollen eyes, his giddy
brain, and his cold and clammy limbs, gave fearful
token of a first intoxication; but within, all was doubt
and confusion, indefinite dread, remorse without an
object, and memory without circumstance. Indistinct
sounds rung in his ears, shapeless forms sailed before
his eyes, and, although it was broad daylight, a
“ horror of great darkness” seemed to brood over his
heart. Presently a pang of recollection darted across
his brain, and he would fain have taken refuge in the
original gloom from a light still more dismal. Then
the circumstances of the scene, in which the night

before he had been a principal actor, came one by one
before his mind, with all their absurd and debasing
details, and a feeling almost of wonder attended the
sense of shame and degradation.
“A gentleman's son!” he repeated, bitterly, as his
mother's parting advice sounded in his ears:
thinking being—&—” but the word that was to fol-
low refused to pass the foul and parched lips which
would have uttered it; and he hid his face in the bed-
clothes.
“But my mother will not hear of this,” he ex-
claimed, starting up: “my saintly Helen will be
spared the shock—and never, never, will it again be
possible even for the tongue of malice to whisper such
à tale! They will not hear of it,” he continued,
pressing suddenly his trembling hands to his temples.
“How will they not hear of it? Good God, what
phantom is this which passes before me? A dream
--nothing but a dream! a fragment of my hideous
sleep, which remains to terrify my scarcely awakened
senses! Surely it is impossible that the malice of
hell itself could have sent to so obscure and distant a
spot an accusing witness of my shame;" and he turned
a fierce and glaring eye upon the void of his chamber,
as if eagerly inspeoting a crowd of objects before him.
6. The old manl the old man!” he at last cried, dash-
ing himself down violently upon the bed. • My
mother's friend l-spy-traitor-devil!” and he gave
loose to an ungovernable fit of rage, of which he was
himself the principal object.
When his feelings had spent their force, he dressed
himself more calmly, and then sat down, in spite of
headache and nausea, to the paper he had undertaken
to copy. The attempt, however, was vain. Whatever
power may be exerted over the mind by moral resolu-
tion, it sometimes fails of immediate effect when ap-
plied to the body, which is actuated proximately by
machinery peculiar to itself; and thus William, al-

though capable of controlling his sensations of pain
and sickness, which craved relief in air and exercise,
was unable to compel his shaking hand to draw one
straight line, or form one legible letter. He at length
gave up the hopeless task, and with feelings of shame
and anxiety, took his way to Burnet's house, who he
knew was under the necessity of delivering the original
and its copy to his employer in another hour.
The law-writer was busy poring over his accus-
tomed manuscripts, and instead of the look, either of
ridicule or reproof, which William was prepared to
encounter, he turned upon his visitor, when he entered,
a glassy eye, which indicated no recollection, whether
pleasant or unpleasant, of anything except the employ-
ment in which he was immediately engaged.
You have brought the paper, ," he remarked
William laid it on the table.
“ And the copy?” William shook his head.
“ What do you mean?” cried Burnet, in alarm.
“I have been, and am unwell, very unwell; I could
that
paper to save myself from starvation."
Burnet threw himself back in the chair, and opened
his
eyes upon his friend with an expression made up of
wonder, fury, and contempt.
6. You are aware, sir,” said William, getting angry
in his turn, “that I am altogether unaccustomed to
drinking: you must have known last night what the
effect of the debauch would be this morning; and in
making myself both criminal and ridiculous, I have as
much your encouragement and example to blame as my
own folly.
Burnet had by this time began the task of copying
the paper himself in great perturbation. “It is very
well," was his reply—“Oh! it is very well—very weil
-very well,” muttering the words between his teeth;
but when William attempted to recommence his
harangue-
S’death, sir!” cried he, “ leave me alone. I am

a hard-working man; I cannot afford, not I, to be
either sick or lazy. Get you gone to your starvation,
since you like it; but remember for the future that
you
have no right to endanger another man's bread, either
by drinking more than your nerves will sustain, or by
undertaking more than you have resolution to per-
form.” William, abashed and conscience-stricken, did
not venture a reply, but descended the stairs in silence,
and plunged into the living street, one of the most
miserable of the beings by whom it was crowded.
A stranger in London, without a single respectable
friend to advise, without funds to live another week
without employment—what was he to do? To go
home? This was yet possible; he had money enough
to pay his fare to Llanwellyn, and to support life on
the road. But with what face was he to present him-
self before his mother and Helen; how account for the
time he had spent; how meet the accusation which
Mr. Vesper had perhaps already forwarded against
him? How rational and manly an effort he had made
to secure that independence for which his childish
longings had embittered his mother's life for years!
What an account he was prepared to give of the won-
ders of the metropolis—of the treasures of antiquity-
the curiosities of history—the marvels of art which it
contained! No,” concluded he, “ I cannot, must
not, will not return; even Helen herself, while she will
unconsciously exaggerate my folly, will be unable to
make due allowance for the insignificance of my means,
and the paucity of my opportunities; here must I live
as long as life is possible; here must I achieve a sub-
sistence or perish.
Everything, however, was new and strange around
him. He was like a mariner shipwrecked on some
foreign coast, in danger of famishing from very igno-
rance of the people's language and manners. If he
could but discover in what manner he might be ser-
viceable, or in what terms he ought to offer his services,

101
to the many thousands around him, to whom affluence
and conventional custom rendered necessary the hired
assistance of their fellow men! How little in the mean-
time, would suffice for his wants—how circumspectly
he might live, till even in his low and humble situation,
he should be caught by the tide of fortune in its flow;
till something should turn up! Magical words!
Most potent of all the spells that are uttered in the
superstition of youthful hope! A bright glow rose
into William's cheeks, as the thought passed through
his mind, and his perturbed spirit fastened upon that
undefined and undefinable something, with the tran-
quillity of Sinbad's crew, when they anchored on the
whale.
“Yes," said he, quickening his pace along the
street, as if in pursuit of some visible and determined
object; "anything whatever will do in the meantime,
just till something turns up!"
Among the few individuals with whom he had formed
a casual acquaintance, he found himself attracted most
strongly, perhaps by the sympathy of desperation, to
Mr. Wigwam, the reporter. The others had seemed
to treat him with a respect due rather to his hopes,
than his means, and to Wigwam alone, he could reveal
his real situation, without embarrassment and shame.
There was besides another reason, which determined
him in his choice of a confidant. His mother's pre-
judices against a mercantile life, although unsupported
by even a show of reason, and therefore always care-
fully kept in the back.ground by him, had nevertheless
sunk deep enough into his heart, to have some effect
upon the dreams and reveries which fill up so much of
a stripling's life. The literary ambition, on the other
hand, at which we have hinted, although hardly enough
formed to deserve the name of a passion, was yet suffi-
ciently strong to cut a formidable part in the mental
contest, which takes place when a man's predilections
are consulted, and his resources examined, in a case

that may be decided by the turning of a straw. To
literature too, he was attracted by the very desperation
of his mind, just as a man will usually prefer carrying
his last guinea to the gaming-table, or the lottery, no
matter what denomination they assume, rather than to
a common market of profit and loss. A single fortu-
nate hit, thought he, may attract the attention of the
public, and raise me to the pinnacle of my hopes; a
congeniality of thought, a similarity of subject, nay,
even a turn of expression, may be the means of intro-
ducing me to those who will be proud to promote my
advancement; it will be exhibiting to the world the
stores of my mind, be they rich or scanty, and a just
value cannot fail to be put upon them by those who
have no interest whatever in disguising their sentiments.
Amusing himself with this precious reasoning, he
took the way to a newspaper office, where he knew
Wigwam was frequently to be found in the forenoon.
It should not be disguised that William was perfectly
aware of the dissolute habits, and somewhat disgusted
by the vulgar effrontery of this person; nay, even at
this moment, he felt a kind of reluctance to be seen
associated in broad day-light with so shabby a ruffian.
The man's principles, it is true, would have been
the same whether his coat was whole or not, but
our adventurer knew that the world is accustomed
to argue on outside premises, and, besides, he was in
that respect one of the world himself, and felt strongly
the instinctive disgust of old clothes, which is the
moral shiboleth between the Jew and the Christian,
If a man of Wigwam's appearance and manners, he
argued, can make a living at all by so confined a
branch of the trade of literature, what may not I
expect? But while he was in the midst of this
specu-
lation, he saw the reporter issuing hastily from the
door of the office.
He was for some time in doubt as to his identity,
so great a change had taken place in his external

103
appearance: but Wigwam's physiognomy was of too
striking a character to be long mistaken. He was
now dressed in a fashionable great coat, which,
although by no means new, was whole and well brushed,
and covered very handsomely the multitude of sins of
his under-garments. His hat was nicely smoothed,
his shoes bright and clean, and above all, his face was
well washed and trimmed. In this guise, Wigwam
appeared to be really a personable man; there was
something portly in his figure, which is frequently
taken for dignity by the lean, and the impudent per-
tinacity of his stare might have passed very well for
the habitual freedom of a man of consequence.
With
merely a nod of recognition, he was about to pass
quickly by; but William, whose desire for an audience
was strangely increased by the metamorphosis, laid
hold of him by the arm, and kindly inquired after his
health.
“But you seem in a hurry,” continued he,
perhaps you see your friends only in an old coat, by
way of avoiding the appearance of formality?”
“ That is a good one,” said Wigwam, delighted
with
any body's joke, at any body's expense; " but
the truth is, a little stroke of good luck has befallen
me, and I am determined to make hay while the sun
shines.”
“ What—a legacy, perhaps? or your rich friends
have at last relented ?"
“Yes," answered Wigwam, “my uncle has given
me something !” and he looked up with a significant
smile, which William did not then understand, at three
golden balls dangling from the wall over head.
“I should rejoice at your good fortune at any rate,”
said William, " but more particularly at the present
moment, when 'I feel ambitious of taking your place of
reporter, should
you
be inclined to retire."
Wigwam stared, and William continued, more
abashed than he expected to have been.

“ The truth is, I must either find employment at
once, or return to Wales; there is no other alternative.
My friends give me no immediate hope of a respecta-
ble situation, and, till something turns up, I should be
glad to employ whatever talents I may possess in
ministering to the curiosity of the public as a reporter
of domestic news, with the purpose of extending my
views to the higher departments of literature, when I
shall have acquired a sufficient knowledge of the locale
of the London Parnassus.
William spoke quickly, but Wigwam seemed to have
great difficulty in keeping his gravity till the speech
was concluded; at the end of which he broke into a
loud chuckle, for he never laughed outright.
“ Pardon me, my dear fellow,” said he at length,
perceiving a flush of resentment gather in his young
friend's cheek; “it is not at you I laugh, upon my
soul it is not, but at myself. Do you know where my
thoughts were at that time? Why some ten years
back-
O'er the dark rereward and abysm of time.'
I was then marching along this very street, a fine
young fellow of five and twenty, a good oaken stick in
one hand, and my wardrobe, tied up in a pocket-hand-
kerchief, in the other. Those spires of St. Paul's ap-
peared to me to surmount the temple of the muses--
this Ludgate Hill was a Parnassus, and that muddy
kennel a Helicon ! I too talked of literature, and
dreamed of fame, and lived soberly, and slept soundly
--ha! ha ha!-why don't you laugh?”
There was something in the tone of voice in which
the sudden question was put, which sent a cold thrill
through William's veins. A stage-coach rattled past
them at the moment, loaded with passengers and bag-
gage for the country, and it was with a bitter sigh he
read the word “ Monmouth” on the sides. The streets

appeared to narrow around him, and the atmosphere
to become thicker, and when the reporter addressed
him again, he heard his voice with a start and a gasp.
“ You have no prospect of other employment ?'' said
Wigwam in his usual manner.
“ No immediate prospect,” replied William, hastily.
The reporter smiled.
6. Your
purse is empty?”
“ Almost.”
You are firmly resolved not to return home ?"
"Absolutely.
“And you would still eat?”
66 To be sure.”
" Then I commend, nay I applaud your purpose ;
and although I have no immediate thoughts of quitting
the profession myself
, you are as welcome to my ser-
vices and my advice as if I had. What—there is room
for us all—the more the merrier, say I.”
They had now dived deep into the city, and William
found himself in an unknown region. Their conver-
sation was interrupted by the denseness of the crowd,
through which Wigwam plunged with an adroitness,
which excited the envy of his companion, who by this
time began to exhibit symptoms of fatigue that would
probably have been still very distant in a ramble
through a thicket. The moving mass became thicker
every moment, and its motion more headlong and
tumultuous; and at length on turning a corner, a sound
as if of near thunder was heard, and a fire-engine, on
which eight or ten men were quietly seated, some of
them smoking their pipes, rushed at full gallop into
the bosom of the multitude.
Splitting like an enormous wave torn by the prow
of some headlong bark, the crowd gave way on all
sides; but closing again instantly with all the com-
pactness of a fluid body, it followed the machine with
emulative fury, till compelled to re-open by the same
interruption. Engine after engine rushed past in quick

succession; the windows were filled with eager faces;
the shops were shut up; and the roar of the living
torrent became mightier and mightier, till its progress
was stopped by some seemingly impassable barrier,
and the rear thrown back many yards by the re-action.
In front nothing was seen but a cloud of smoke
surmounting the houses, through which the smothered
flame was observed to rise perpendicularly at intervals,
like a golden pillar dimly seen at night. Presently
streams of water were descried entering the body of
vapour in all directions, and their splashing on the
walls, and the crashing of the glass windows which
followed, were heard above the human noises of the
street. In some places the smoke appeared to be
swallowed up by the conquering flames, and when a
mightier glare arose, illuminating for a moment both
heaven and earth, the huge rabble below sent forth a
shout, as if applauding a scene in a tragedy.
William gazed on this novel spectacle with intense
curiosity, chastened by an awe so profound as to lend
much of the sublime to his feelings. As for Wigwam,
he stood with his back to the wall, projecting his
knuckles and elbows for the defence of his person, and
appearing to look with cool and business-like attention
on what was going on. Some human figures were at
length seen through the smoke at the windows of the
devoted buildings, and various articles of furniture
were thrown over, and crashed upon the street below.
“ This is dreadful !” whispered William to his com-
panion, as the painful predominating in his feelings,
overthrew all ideas of the sublime.
" Fine! Isn't it?” said the reporter, “a capital
beginning for you, a practical lesson worth a thousand
lectures. Take care that you are not looking with
your eyes shut; see and hear everything that is to be
seen, and imagine more than it is possible to see. In
half an hour the whole affair must be down in black
and white; in half an hour more it must be tumbling

through the press; and in two hours inore it must be
in the hands of the whole town. To show the good
will I entertain for you, you shall have the task of
writing the paragraph, and we shall divide the produce
between us.
This announcement renewed the trembling of Wil-
liam's nerves, and he was on the point of remonstra-
ting against the imprudence of putting so weighty an
affair into the hands of a novice.
“Really, Mr. Wigwam,” said he, “I cannot help
dreading the suddenness of the trial. I never saw a
fire before, and I fear my account of it would be
thought by the experienced to be somewhat turgid and
redundant.”
“Redundant, my dear fellow!” replied Wigwam,
“make yourself perfectly easy on that head; it shall
be cut and clipped, and pared and gutted, to your
heart's content, I assure you. Bless you, you will not
know your own manufacture when you see it in
print."
“There is little,” remarked William, without ap-
pearing to notice the consolation thus offered, “ little
of the merely human interest about this scene which
we usually find in the printed details of a conflagration.
Perhaps we are not near enough to hear or witness the
particulars of accidents in the crowd and the fire, the
escapes or fate of the inmates, the thousand circum-
stances of fear, surprise, and curiosity, which fill up
the awful detail.”
“ The deuce we are not!” exclaimed Wigwam.
“Look at that window to the left, where the flames
are just beginning to take hold. Do you see a lady
leaning over, with an infant in her arms-
“No, I don't!”
" Which she
appears in the act of dropping into the
street, when a cloud of smoke envelopes the whole
building, and leaves the horror-struck spectators in
ignorance of the event?”

“ I see not a tittle of all this."
“ Did you not observe that one of the firemen, a fine
young fellow, by the way, with a wife and eleven chil-
dren, was hurried to an untimely fate by seven of the
engines playing upon him at once while he was en-
deavouring to fix a ladder at one of the burning
windows?”
No, indeed!”
“You at least hear it whispered among the crowd
that the wife of one of our city members, as she hap-
pened to be cheapening a cod's head and shoulders at
the fishmonger's opposite, was so terrified by the
ap-
pearance of the flames, that the honourable house is
likely to be disappointed of a son and heir-
“No, no!"
“But this wants confirmation. And finally,” hurry-
ing him away, “you know it to be reported, on too
good authority you fear, that the number of lives
ascertained to be lost was thirteen-"
• Not a word of it!'
" When we went to press.
Wigwam buffeting his
way with sturdy strokes, was soon clear of the crowd,
and darting into the first obscure public-house he fell
in with, the two friends sat down to concoct their
account of what they had witnessed. Our adventurer's
power of composition, such as it was, did not desert
him on the pinch; and Wigwam dictating his own
apocrypha, besides many really important details that
had as completely escaped the observation of William,
the whole business was finished in a very short time,
and the adept and novice hurried away with continued
speed to the printing-house. The next morning,
William had the satisfaction of seeing his first para-
graph in print, and almost entire, and of eating a
dinner, for the first time in his life, of his own
earning.
“This is your treat, lad,” said Wigwam, when they
had finished, “you observed how they left out all my

109
ingenious circumstantialities, except the mere details
of place and person!” Our author was not yet polite
enough to tell a lie, and therefore he did not say
he
was surprised.
“Hang them," continued Wigwam, “they smoked
the old hand! But what can we do? The knaves
know very well that the public will not swallow a mere
catalogue of accidents, like the bankrupt list, and a
man cannot easily get up a new fire fifty-two times in
the year. By the way, I breakfasted too at your
expense to-day. You will see the paragraph in that
newspaper of last evening, read it carefully when you
go home, it will give you another lesson in your new
business.”
That night, before going to bed, and just
after indulging in a happy reverie, our adventurer
pulled the paper from his pocket, and read with great
admiration the following specimen of Mr. Wigwam's
genius:
“INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCE.—Last night the neigh-
bourhood of Dean Street was thrown into the utmost
consternation by cries of murder and other appalling
sounds proceeding from the respectable tavern called
the Three Puncheons, kept by Mr. Miles Froth, brother
to the late Mr. Froth of the Cheshire Cheese. The
alarm was first communicated by Mr. Jenkins, the
tobacconist, of No. 47, to Mrs. Ball, the lady of Mr.
Ball, the pawnbroker, of No. 48, who, with the utmost
promptitude, ran down in person to the corner of the
street, and awoke the watchman. The watchman
sprung his rattle, and having succeeded in collecting
four of his bretliren, they proceeded direct to the spot,
accompanied by Mr. Jenkins, Mrs. Ball, and other
respectable neighbours. On entering the parlour, a
scene of uproar presented itself which beggars descrip-
tion. A young man of lofty stature, and more than
half naked, his clothes having been torn in strips from
his back, stood in the middle of a field of contest,

strewed with the fragments of his weapons, and the
victims of his vengeance. He was evidently fresh from
the country, and fresh also in another sense, and had
quarrelled with an individual present for having won
from him at dominoes the severed half of a sixpence
presented to him as a true love token by his mistress.
The company interfered, affirming that the half six-
pence was fairly won; and the infatuated youth, in-
stantly snatching up a chair, run a-muck all round the
room. We are happy to say that no lives were lost
in this singular affair, which was terminated by the
young man being kindly advised to go home. Mr.
Jenkins, the tobacconist, and Mrs. Ball, the pawn-
broker's lady, with the other respectable neighbours,
soon after separated to their respective houses, Mr.
Jenkins bidding Mrs. Ball good night, and Mrs. Ball
remarking, • It was well it was no worse.
Our hero had no sooner perused this anecdote than
he clapped his hat on his head, and cast a ferocious
look about the room in search of his stick. The stick,
however, had absented itself ever since the affair so
faithfully and minutely chronicled above, and being
thus allowed time for reflection, his good humour re-
turned, and, indulging in a hearty laugh, by way of
supper, he went to bed.
William was soon able to go on without the assist-
ance of a master, and continued for some time to derive
a subsistence, more precarious and more miserable
every day, from what he began at last to think was a
prostitution of his talents. His reports, it is true,
possessed in a high degree the charm of imagination,
but this is a quality altogether distinct from falsehood;
and although he was frequently obliged to mingle in
scenes revolting both to his heart and judgment, it
was not as one of the actors, but as an observant
spectator, extracting wisdom from folly, and reading
lessons of virtue in the acted history of crime. We

are not to imagine, however, that, like the Babylonian
Jews of old, he walked through the furnace without
an hair of his head being singed, his coat burned,
or the smell of fire passing on him.” Alas! although
at the sound of the flute, and the harp, and the dulci-
mer, he fell not openly down before the golden image
which the King of Darkness had set up, yet his ear
was often charmed by the syren music of sin, and his
heart secretly enticed after its idolatry.
In that heart there was a store of pure thoughts,
and tender and holy recollections not yet exhausted.
Helen, the first object of his love, was the first being
who had awakened within him those sentiments of
piety which are the only stable foundation of moral
principle. To think of her was to recall to his memory
not only the blissful dreams of youth, but all the
lessons of virtuous fortitude which had fallen from her
lips, and which he had ead in her onduct-all the
religious associations which make even this world of
ours a vast temple, all the lofty and ennobling aspira-
tions which separate and sanctify the soul of man
from the spirits of the beasts which go down to the
earth.
A little portrait in China ink, which he had himself
taken of that dear face, and which he still fondly
treasured, was a talisman of peace to recall his wan-
dering thoughts, and lead them through paths of love
and beauty to the Fountain of all good. It is not
sufficient condemnation to say, that if this link had
been broken, this medium of connexion withdrawn,
the hold would have been loosed which held his feeble
principles aloft from the gulf of the world: the remark
could only suggest itself to a thoughtless mind, for-
getful that “God hides his providence behind second
causes,” that we have all, whatever be its form, or
nature, or denomination, our store of hidden thought
-our secret portrait, or lonely image--our monitor
and remembrancer, in the day of danger.


## p. 112 (#556) ############################################

112
THE GAME OF LIFE.
William consulted his talisman every day with
less and less self-satisfaction. “ Severe in youthful
beauty," holy in virgin purity, Helen seemed to bend
sorrowful and reproachful eyes upon her lover. His
time running away unimproved, his task appearing
every day more mean and sordid, his very style of
writing becoming debased, as he found himself drilled
and hackneyed into the trade—what was he to do to
withdraw himself from the hasty perdition into which
he was sinking? Was it possible that the fate of
Wigwam awaited him? and he shuddered as the
question flashed across his mind.
“ There is still a chance for me!” he exclaimed ;
“ I will try the magazines. I am at present lost in
the crowded letter-press and chaotic variety of a news-
paper. Who, on reading the account of a murder, or
a fire, or a natural prodigy, thinks of asking the name
of the writer? Let me stamp the impress of my mind
upon a page even of a month's endurance; let me
familiarize the public, if possible, to the sight of my
name; or if this be out of rule, let me at least have
something to refer to, in offering my services to the
booksellers.
On the same day he fell in with Mr. Wigwam; no
longer the steady, fat, respectable, great-coated man
he had been for some weeks, but a spare, dirty,
ruffian-like fellow, buttoned up to the shirtless chin
in a tight, rusty black coat. The moral cycle had
gone round, and Wigwam, instead of a being of some
natural sense, and some acquired shrewdness, rendered
interesting by some dream-like glimpses, caught from
the dimmed glass of memory, of worth, and honour,
and early hope, was now a vulgar; reckless, dissolute
and most desperate vagabond. His mind, however,
still retained in some respects, its peculiar form and
pressure, and his remarks, if neither just nor original,
in spite of the redundance of absurd or revolting ex-
letives, were sufficiently striking.

“ And so, young one,” said he, “you are at last
come to your ulterior views of the higher departments
of literature ?' I thought it would end in this, split
me! You gape at the stars, and pay them honour
because you fancy they are above you. Go, study
astronomy, and it will tell you that there is no such
thing as up or down in the whole region of space. It
is just so with periodical writing. The penny-a-line
reporter, the weekly journalist, the monthly magazine
hack, and the quarterly reviewer, are all on an equal
footing. In what do you suppose the difference to
consist? In subject? Is there a single subject in
the whole range of literature, which possesses more
interest, and even dignity to men, than the crimes,
follies, and accidents of human life?
Are you sore
at the clipping your articles sustain? Ask the maga-
zine writer how many of his he sees entire; and if he
answers, every one, inquire again, how many do not
go in at all, in consequence of the restriction which
his own or the editor's delicacy imposes upon the
scissors. Do you strike for wages? How many of
our lines would fill a sheet of sixteen pages, averaging
more than six hundred words per page? You stare
at the question ; but I will save you further trouble,
by pronouncing at once, that the product of your work
will indicate something just about half-way between
the maximum and minimum of magazine prices. You
thus see that we possess that golden mean, about
which the poets prate so much and know so little.
What, then, are the advantages which these upper
classes of periodical literature possess over us? They
are kept in suspense for a month or a quarter, we for
a minute or a night; if their shot misses, they lose
the labour of many a weary day, and many a sleepless
night; we, the pastime of an idle hour, or the frolic
of a jolly evening. Does your conscience start at the
poetical flight we are sometimes obliged to take? Oh!
there are worse things than that in other branches of

the profession! Only fancy a poor devil, compelled
by hunger and request of friends,' to write. Look at
him," continued Wigwam, grasping his companion's
arm; “look at him, with his pale face and hollow
cheek, bending over the portentous page. Perhaps
his thin and solitary candle plays upon some little
sleepers by his side, feasting on a supper in their
dreams, of which their waking hunger had been
cheated; perhaps a wife, an aged mother, an or-
phan sister, aye, or all three, flit like shadows through
the apartment, conversing only with their eyes, and
silent both in their hope and their despair, lest their
voices should disturb the studies so fraught with doom.
Or fancy him-sink the pathetic! fancy him alone.
Oh, not alone! His chamber is filled with a thousand
phantoms of delight, a thousand hope-gilded visions
pass one by one before him. Look, he throws down
the pen, as some happy thought has tinted the paper
couleur de rose, and while reading over the passage,
beautiful perhaps only in imagination, his voice is
broken into sobs, and warm tears gush from his eyes.
The book is completed, printed, published. The
critics praise it. Ha! ha! ha! only look at him
now! See the women, with their frozen cheeks, and
stony gaze, and the hungry children, with their
gaunt forms and tearful eyes--ha! ha! ha!”
• My dear sir,” said William, in some alarm at
his vehemence.
“ But you don't see the author himself, the de-
lighted dreamer, the fairy castle-builder! Look at
his white lips, as silent as death; his fingers crushed
within each other, his jaws locked-ha! ha! ha!

his voice, and speaking sternly and distinctly.

to have heard that Wigwam was a widower, and a
childless father,
“I was once an author myself,” said the latter,
resuming his apparently constrained jocularity, “and
so I can tell you a thing or two on that head. Could
you guess what I wrote ?”
No, I cannot."
“ Ha! ha! ha! It chokes me to think of it; it
does, indeed; I wrote--how you will laugh--a poem!”
· You! a poem!”
“By!" said Wigwam; and, seeming to be in
reality almost choking with the convulsive chuckle
which he was in the habit of substituting for laughter,
he shook William vehemently by the hand, and, turn-
ing down a narrow alley, was soon out of sight.
William, as it usually happens, had not asked his
friend's advice till his resolution was taken; nor in
fact till an article had been written, and even sent to
one of the magazines. The interim of suspense, in
spite of Wigwam’s croaking, was not all “a phan-
tasma and a hideous dream,” but, on the contrary, a
period of busy and happy anticipation ; and when, at
length, he saw his first essay in print, and soon after
hurried to the banker with a check for a larger sum
than he had ever before possessed in his life, he
enjoyed his success not as a lucky hit,” but as the
realization of a well-grounded hope. Something had
at last turned up something well worth the price
even of years, instead of months, of suffering and pri-
vation. He was now entered on his career; the eyes
of the world were fixed on him, and all he desired was
a clear stage and no favour.
The next day, when glancing over a newspaper, he
saw, with a flush of the cheek and a throb of the heart,
a notice of the magazine. His own piece was not
merely mentioned with commendation, indeed with
praise, but it was stated to be the production of “Mr.
Clive, a young writer of extraordinary promise!" How

strange that a secret had transpired so well concealed
under the mask of initials! How extraordinary that
the prying eyes of the world should have found him
out even in the obscurity and loneliness, and poverty
of his present situation! His thoughts, so far from
straying to the well-meaning friend who had procured
insertion of the “puff,” kept carefully aloof; and when,
at length, a country echo pronounced the article to be
• worthy of the elegant pen of Mr. Clive," poor Wig-
wam was dropped like a bankrupt patron. William,
for a few days, seemed to tread on air; he already
looked on himself as a public character; and when
taking his seat in the mean eating-house where he con-
descended to dine, his eyes stole consciously round the
room, as if hoping that no one there recognised "Mr.
Clive."
During this blissful period, he wrote to his mother;
his communications hitherto had been few and brief;
each letter referring to a future one, and forgetting the
promise of the last. Now, however, he made amends
for his reserve; his full heart overflowed upon the
paper, and he painted his prospects in all the gorgeous
hues of youthful hope. “In another month,” he added,
in a postscript, with affected moderation, “I shall
write to Helen, when I trust to have something to
communicate more worth her hearing.
In the mean time, his expenses increased in propor-
tion to his new-found revenue; credit, that before had
never been dreamed of, was asked with coolness, and
granted with customary facility; and when his purse
was at length entirely exhausted, recourse was had,
with friendly indifference, to the pockets of his com-
panions.
The last day of the month arrived-magazine day,
as it is called among the trade—and he flew with
breathless expectation to the office. The table of con-
tents was ransacked, but in vain; and the leaves then
turned over one by one with trembling care. His piece

was omitted. Stupified, at first, with the blow, he
allowed the pamphlet to drop from his hands upon the
counter; but the next moment, eagerly catching it up
again, he turned to the "Answers to Correspondents
-where he found these chilling words — W. C's
article is inadmissible.”
That evening, while sitting before his expiring fire,
gazing with a vacant wildness at the portrait of Helen,
which, a few days before, he had framed and glazed,
and hung up above his little mantel-piece, the post-
man's knock was heard at the door. William's heart
quailed at the sound. The door shut, and slow steps
began to ascend the stairs.
“ It is for the first floor!” he said aloud, as if to
arrest the further progress of the messenger; but the
slow steps passed the landing place. They stopped
for a moment at the second floor, and William had
already begun to thank God, when the pat-patting was
recommenced, ascending higher and higher, and strik-
ing deeper and deeper, till the tread seemed to be upon
his heart. Two letters, one from his mother and one
from Helen, were put into his hands; and so affected
were his nerves at the sight of a hand-writing which
had been wont to make his spirit leap with joy, that it
was some minutes before he could muster courage to
open them.
• My darling William,” wrote Mrs. Clive, “the
wishes of a mother's heart at length are gratified, and
a career is opened for you befitting a gentleman's son.
I always thought you would turn out to be above com-
merce; and I confess it was not without a struggle, in
spite of their wealth, that I ever gave you a letter to
those low-born, low-lived, and low-minded Blanks; for
you are not to learn, my love, that although certainly
relations, they are of a very mean and distant branch
of the family. I am still not without anxiety on your
account. Taken notice of, as no doubt you are by this
time, by the rich and the noble, you have a card to

play not very easy for so young a hand. Young as
you are, however, you are now absolutely become
a man, and will no doubt speedily perceive, as your
acquaintance with the great world goes on, that it is
now time to think of forming an establishment for your-
self. Your playmate, Helen, too, has already taken
leave of the girl, and no doubt casts round her eyes,
demure as they are, in search of what luck will send
her. She laughs, of course, at the childish nonsense
which you and she used to prattle together; and even
if she did not laugh, which I assure you she does,
she is far too good a creature to stand in the way of
the advancement of a gentleman's son. William, for
a few moments, covered his face with his hands,
ashamed of blushing for a parent; and then took up
Helen's letter, which ran thus :-

“ WILLIAM, --Your last agreeable letter to your
mother renders the task I have now undertaken much
easier. That task, believe me, is not undertaken on
loose report, or without mature deliberation. While
you were at your mother's fireside I esteemed the
many
virtues, and passed over, with, perhaps, a too partial
many foibles of your character. What you
were then, was unknown even to yourself; and the
friend with whom I walked so often, and talked so
freely, and dreamed so wildly, was no other than a
creature of my own imagination. You were then in
the dark, reclining under the shadow of the roof-tree
of your house; now the colours of your mind have
been brought out and exhibited by the sun, and I can
no longer plead the excuse of ignorance for my folly.
Your course in London has been carefully traced, but
from the most tender and affectionate motives, by one
whom I love as a friend, and honour as a benefactor.

sides the uniform carelessness which you exhibited
from the beginning in the search; the despicable and
dissolute society in which you have passed your time
-are all known to him. I will not, in addition to
these enormities, introduce a circumstance trifling in
itself—the mention in the most base and vulgar ears
of an obscure, and, perhaps, little regarded name;
but, oh! I should be so happy if I could touch even
that spirit of worldly honour which I mistook for some-
thing nobler, and rouse you from the lethargy of the
senses, if not of the soul! The task, however, has
passed from my hands; you are to me from this day
simply as one of the mass of mankind, as one whom
I love and pray for only as a brother of humanity.

CHAPTER VIII.
A MAN IN JEOPARDY.
Night drew her shade over the earth: the mariners contem-
plated from their ships Helice and Orion; the traveller and
door-keeper were drousy; the sleeping mother forgot her
dead children; there was no barking of dogs heard through
the city, nor any loud sound; and silence attended upon the
black darkness.
APOLLONIUS RHODIUS.
The minds of men are not merely different from each
other in their capacity of suffering, but from them-
selves. In some moods of thought, Helen's letter
would have been productive simply of indignation;
William would have drawn up with the restrained fury
and haughty air of one who had received an insult
which it would be unmanly to avenge; and his sense
of the wrong would have been signified only by a cold
and gloomy silence. In the present case the feeling
was different, and yet to external indication the same.
His heart had already been seized with a panic; his
hopes had withered in the bud; the gulf was closing
around him, and whichever way he turned, darkness
and terror met his view. It was natural under such
circumstances to call himself to account; to hold an

121
inquest on his dead prospects, and inquire how they
came by their doom. The “ injustice of the world” is
only a sneaking paltry excuse, and deceives no one,
not even the apologist himself; the rankling of self-re-
proach is seen and felt beneath it; and when the lips
are loudest in complaint, the heart with its still small
voice is heard to whisper, “Oh, that I had done those
things which I ought to have done, and left undone
those things which I ought not to have done!" William,
in spite of himself, inquired rigidly into his conduct
since his arrival in London, and, like a hard master,
demanded account of every talent. What had been
his efforts to procure the subsistence he had come to
seek! How closely had they been followed up! How
instantly had every opportunity been embraced ? Had
he suffered himself to be led astray by the suggestions
of vanity, or caprice, or mere indolence? A thousand
such questions forced themselves upon him, and the
answers were vague, flimsy, and unsatisfactory. How
circumspect had been his personal bearing in a situa-
tion so momentous ? How careful had he shown him-
self in the choice of his associates? What opinion
would have been formed of his conduct by an impartial
spectator? And what even would have been the judg-
ment of a Being able to penetrate through the maze
of circumstance and coincidence which envelope the
actions of men, and to whom darkness itself is as
noon-day?
In the midst of this rigid self-examination, Helen's
letter arrived. Her “farewell!” descended like a
death-blow
upon
his heart. It was the answer to his
questions, the natural result of his own conduct, an
inevitable link in the chain of the events of his history.
At times a sudden and rebellious feeling would start
up in his bosom, and striking his hand furiously upon
his forehead, he would exclaim, “What have I done
to deserve this?” then flying to the worst refuge of
human weakness: “ It is my fate! it is my fate!” he

would cry, covering his eyes with his hands, and
throwing himself back in his chair, as if overwhelmed
and annihilated.
There is something at once pleasing and horrible to
the feeble mind of man in the idea of being carried on,
on the rushing stream of destiny, with the wildness of
a straw dancing on some headlong river, and yet its
lightest or most extravagant motion under the controul
and direction of those unerring powers which wield
the universe. This undefinable feeling, with all its
darkness, and mystery, and dread, was not long of
resolving, in the mind which received it, into some-
thing more applicable to the phenomena of human
life, and more germane to the other feelings of human
nature. Gathering around him, like a mantle, the
gloom which was above and about him, fortifying
himself with his very despair, William stood in the
middle of his little room, the very image of hopeless
pride.
“She shall never know how she has wrung me!”
he exclaimed. “Incapable as she is alike of pity and
of error, I shall at least spare myself her contempt!”
Following, if not mingling, with this resolution, there
arose that loftier and better train which, in minds
capable of receiving them in such circumstances, are
so often the pioneers of fame. His pale cheek flushed;
his dull eye lightened; visions of glory swam before
his sight; of glory attained by moral courage, by self-
denial, by study, by devoted industry; and to which
the rugged and precipitous steps were hunger, and
thirst, and poverty, and patient suffering.
"She may yet regret her injustice!” he exclaimed,
with a softened voice; but, at the moment, a blush
crossed his young brow, as the passing idea disclosed
that the foundations of this poetical resolve-
“That column of true majesty in man,"
rested on mere human weakness, and still lingering

love. A restless and feverish night was followed by
a languid and miserable day. Another, and another,
and another passed on. His plans became like dreams,
without substance or definite shape: his thoughts, one
by one, were forgotten; his temper was captious, his
voice querulous, and the low fever which preyed upon
his vitals, was soon mistaken for an indication of the
want of that talent and energy, which, to a poor and
friendless adventurer, are the very basis of hope. The
people with whom he lodged became every day more
remiss in their attention, as every day their prospects
of ultimate remuneration seemed more remote. His
meals were unsuitable and irregular; his apartment
was neglected; and at length, his pale and ghastly
appearance induced his benevolent hosts to think of
consulting, not the physician, but the overseers of the
parish. At this period his door was opened, and for
the first time, one of his London associates made his
appearance as a visitor,
“You are unwell,” said Burnet, in his usual mono-
tone. “Yes, very unwell. I thought how it would
be; few constitutions could stand the sort of life which
must be led by a companion of Wigwam. In case of
your death, you would like me, I suppose, to write
to your mother? However, there is time enough to
think of that; you will live, no doubt, as long as you
I myself would do the same!”
“ I live,” replied the invalid, “not because I can,
but because I must. What is there to attach me to
life?”
“Very true; you are a lucky fellow. Your mother
has an income independent of your exertions; you
have no wife, no children; yes, you are a lucky fellow,
you can afford to die, but you will live for all that.'
“I cannot live without food; food cannot be obtained
except in exchange for money or labour; neither of
these can I give, and therefore-
“Rare syllogism! But I deny a part of the pre-
can.

mises, and therefore hold the igitur to be, as we
lawyers say, a non sequitur. Money is merely the
representative of other property, and when the princi-
pal is present, you may dispense with the locum tenens.
That trunk, for instance, contains more clothes than
you can carry on your back at one moment; above
your mantel-piece there hangs a pair of pistols, for
which, till your case becomes more desperate, you can
have little use; and below these, a wretched daub-
some atrocious caricature of a face which it would be
libellous to call human-acts the foil to a frame not
inelegant nor uncostly. These articles are neither
money nor labour, and yet they will purchase both.'
“The daub, Mr. Burnet,' ” said the invalid, with
some heat, “I would not part with for all your legal
knowledge thrown into one bundle; and indeed, if I
may judge of the value of your other acquisitions by
your taste in the fine arts, they would hardly be a fair
equivalent for the bit of gold leaf which covers the
frame of that drawing.”
“Well, well,” said Burnet, with a cold smile, “let
us talk of the wardrobe.”
“ These trifles I have already thought of selling;
but,” and William added, hesitatingly, “just suppose
that I recover from this illness, the plight I should
have to stalk about the world in would be rather an
awkward one.”
“ You have not thought of selling them,” replied
Burnet, calmly, “you are not such a fool. You have
not meddled so long with the little miseries of your
neighbours to be ignorant that you may lend them for
as much as you could sell them.” William blushed.
“Ay, ay,” said Burnet, understanding the feel-
ing, “you will soon get over all that. Your course
is clear, you may writhe as you please, you may shut
your eyes, you may fancy you are walking back-
wards, but on you

• What is my course?” cried the invalid; “ speak,
prophet of evil!"
* Prophet of nonsense!” said Burnet, coldly. “You
will not die this bout: you are too young and strong;
you are buoyed up with too many hopes; your life is
anchored with too many pleasant recollections. No,
no, you will not die this bout. You will lend your
wardrobe, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker who does
not want it, and he in return will lend his money, piece
by piece, to you who do. When you are able to go to
work again, you will in due time release a part of
your
property; and thus you will do very well, rich and
poor, well and ill clad alternately, for some years more.
You will perhaps in the interim
get married: your love
will turn out a--wife; some of your children will die
in the measles; you will work much, and eat, if not
drink, sparingly: and thus you will do very well, very
well indeed, for some years more.
“And then?” asked William, with a gasp, as Burnet
quietly finished his sentence.
• Inquire some time hence,” replied the law-writer;
“I speak of things as I find them. I see with mine
own eyes.
I am no theorist, not I. You would not
like, I fancy,” continued Burnet, while he turned out
the contents of the trunk, and made up a small bundle.
“You would not like, I fancy, to undertake this affair
yourself? You would shrink, I'll warrant me, under
the inean and treacherous eye of the successor of the
Lombard bankers, like a thief offering his stolen goods
to a receiver whom he suspected to be honest. It
would never enter your head to think that you were
lending him your old clothes in exchange for his money,
and that the shame-if
any
shame can be supposed to
attach to a transaction which has so splendid an an-
tiquity to recommend it—ought to be on his side
rather than yours.” Burnet had nearly reached the
middle of the stairs on his embassy when he met with
an interruption; and William, who had not yet shut

the door of his room, listened with intense mortifica-
tion to a dialogue between him and the lady of the
house, who strongly insisted on her right to prohibit
the export of her lodger's property before his bill was
paid. Burnet at length frankly confessed the nature
of his mission, assuring her that a part of the proceeds
was intended for herself; and the good woman, soften-
ing immediately, not only assisted him to refold the
packet, which indeed had fallen asunder owing to the
vehement manner in which she at first suited the
action to the word, but kindly counselled him as to
the amount it would be proper to demand. Before the
conversation had taken this friendly turn, William,
boiling with shame and indignation, had descended
the stairs.
“I thank you, Mr. Burnet,” said he, “for the
trouble
you
have taken; but I am now well enough to
go on my own errands." Burnet followed him in
silence to his room, and having shut the door, inquired
with a mysterious look, whether he would really venture
out before Sunday?
• Why not?” said William, fiercely, still chafing
with his late
exposure.
“Because, I apprehend, there are sharks abroad,
An elderly man, looking as like a creditor as he could
stare, called on me some time ago, and made very
queer inquiries about your affairs."
• Oh! and you told him I had refused employment
on the plea of illness?"
“ I told him the simple truth,” said Burnet, " only
concealing the affair of the night before; drunkenness,
you know, being an aggravation of offence in the eyes
of the law."
“And how did he receive the information?”
“He groaned to the very bowels, and remarked, as
if to himself, that he had seen you that very morning
at the fire in the city, arm in arm with one of the most
abandoned profligates about town, and looking as well

127
and as happy as ever.” It was now William's turn
to groan; and indeed for some moments he stared so
wildly that his friend began to think the fever was at
work in his brain,
“ I am in the toils, I am in the toils!” cried the
unhappy young man; “ I am beset like a wild beast;
and whichever way I turn, there is a snare and a
hunter!”
* God forbid!” exclaimed Burnet; surely matters
are not so bad with you as that. I am almost afraid
you have been a sad boy, however; but let us all live
as long as we can: it is a maxim of nature;” and he
hurried away again on his mission without being even
observed by his distracted employer. That same night
William received the following elegant epistle:-
“Three Puncheons, 10 o'clock.
• Dear Bill,
“'Ware hawk! There has been a rum-
looking customer waiting here for you all the evening.
He wears a brown coat, and a brown cane, and does
not look like a true man, as he neither drinks nor
smokes. He is very anxious to learn where you hang
out, but mum's the word with,
Thine,
WIGWAM.”
>>
On reading these lines a curse escaped from William's
lips, which startled him, both by its vulgarity and
impiety.
- What fiend is this,” he exclaimed, " who haunts
me so pertinaciously; who dogs my footsteps, pries into
my actions, and distorts my misfortunes into follies,
and
my follies into crimes? Shall I meet and confront
him, expose the impudence of his truths, and the base-
ness of his falsehoods, and drive him from my presence
with insult and reproach? Or rather shall I not fly
from him, and from all to whom my ill-omened face is

known, bury myself in some distant obscurity, and
rise or fall unimpeded and uncared for?”'
After the excitement of these little events, the mind
of the invalid began to recover in some measure its
tone, and in a few days he was able to go out of doors
and resume his employment. The run of ill-luck,
however, as his friend Wigwam would have said, had
made a beginning, and run it would to the end of its
His reports seemed to have lost their novelty,
or whatever other charm they possessed, in the eye of
the editors; and in less than a week, poor William,
notwithstanding his great industry, and greater eco-
nomy, was under the necessity of having recourse
again to the trunk. On this occasion he was his own
agent; and, his first reluctance conquered, his first
feeling of generous shame wiped off, his mind adapted
itself with a terrible facility to the circumstances of
his situation.
For the next few weeks we will not pursue the path
of his degradation.
At the end of that period Burnet visited him again,
and even the composure of the law-writer was disturbed
at the alteration exhibited in his appearance. A
shabby black coat buttoned up to the chin, and grey
trowsers, which seemed by their scanty length and
width, as well as faded colour, to have served out their
time long ago, exhibited, with much more precision
than fashion permitted, the outline of his striking
figure; while a rusty, weather-beaten hat, shoes long
unacquainted with the blacking-brush, and stockings
neither whole nor clean, conspired to produce an air
as completely vagabond as could well be imagined.
The trunk was open and empty in the middle of the
floor; the pistols had deserted their post above the
mantel-piece; and the daub, minus its frame and glass,
looked with a melancholy eye at the scene of desolation
around. When Burnet entered, William was in the
act of wrapping a genteel frock coat in a handkerchief;

and the first motion of the former, after he had cast a.
hasty glance round the room, was to seize hold of his
arm.
66
“Not that, my dear fellow," said he, “ anything
but that! To part with your last decent coat, is
absolute suicide; it is a signal of despair, which will
be received with a triumphant shout by all the devils
in hell."
Why, Dick," said our adventurer, with an affected
gaiety, “ I thought you had been quite a philosopher!
What signifies the shape or colour of the coat a man
covers his back with?”
“It signifies little," replied Burnet, “to those
happy dogs of day-labourers, those comfortable car-
penters, those luxurious bricklayers, those magnificent
and magnanimous draymen; but to us,” added he,
while a bitter smile lighted up for an instant the
gloomy serenity of his features, “to us who are
gentlemen, it signifies everything. Do, my dear boy,
be persuaded: something better will turn up; you shall
take another bout at copying; and, although I am too
poor to pay you in advance, yet if a something-a
nothing can be of use for the moment and,
after searching in his pocket, he drew forth, without
eliciting a single social tinkle, and thrust into his
friend's hand a trifle which the historic muse conde-
scends not to name. William shook the hand which
contained the gift, with a wild and startling vehemence;
he attempted to speak, but burst, instead, into a
hoarse, broken laugh; then, shutting his friend's
fingers upon the coin, he caught up his bundle, and
hurried him out of the house.
The next morning, wearied with the fruitless exer-
tions of the preceding day, ill in health, broken in
spirits, and as pennyless as before, having paid a part
of his debt, William was still in bed, when he heard a
knock at the door of his room. His heart beat at the
sound, for everything startled him now, and he hesi-

tated for some moments whether he should not allow
the visitor to suppose that there was nobody within.
The knock, however, was repeated in what seemed to
the timidity of poverty and misery, to be an authorita-
tive manner, and drawing the bed-clothes to his face,
in order to hide from profane eyes, not his skin, but
his shirt, he cried “come in.”
The face of the visitor was familiar to him; but it
was some time before he could recognise, in a plain
blue coat, drab trowsers, and dirty shoes and stockings,
the top-booted, fur-collared, and eye-glassed gentleman
he had met at the Three Puncheons, on the first fatal
evening of this fatal visit to London. Mr. Simpkin,
after saluting him with punctilious politeness, broke
the subjeet of his visit; which was nothing else than
to offer him a situation in the counting-house of Messrs.
Dot and Co.
“What is that you say?” cried William, bending
eagerly forward on his elbow, to the grievous exposure
of a remnant of dirty linen, and fixing his fierce and
haggard eyes upon those of the shopman. Simpkin
repeated the offer, and proceeded at some length to
explain the nature and duties of the situation.
He talked, however, without a listener. A bright
glow had at first risen into William's cheek, and his
eye shone with dazzling light; but the next moment,
the glow died like a flame, sinking in the ashes, and
the light was suddenly extinguished, like a torch by a
gust of wind in a stormy night. He fell back upon
his pillow, with a sigh that seemed loaded with whole
years of misery; and when Simpkin, at length inquired
what answer he should carry back to his employers, it
appeared to be with some difficulty that he compre-
hended the question, or remembered the object of the
visit.
" I thank you,” said he at last, “ but the offer,
kind as it is, comes too late. Yesterday I could have
accepted it!” And as the circumstances of his parting

with the last remnant of his wardrobe which could
have rendered it at all possible for him to accept of
any situation, came again bitterly home to his recollec-
tion, his voice was choked, and he pressed his hands
upon his burning eyes.
" What, you are somewhat hippish this morning?"
said Simpkin, breaking at once from business, and
mingling the air of the puppy with that of the shop-
“Curse me, if these doings altogether agree
with me either; but, sink the shop! a man must spend
his evenings somewhere. So you have cut the Three
Puncheons? Well, I must be off; I am very glad
you have found a better situation than we could offer
you, very glad, upon my honour. Au revoir!”
Stay, sir,” said William, “ will you add to your
kindness by informing me to whose good offices, I am
indebted for this proposal ?"
Why,” replied Simpkin, hesitating, “you know
every good fellow thinks himself bound to help another
at a pinch, and I assure you, Mr. Nollid, the manager,
no sooner mentioned your name to me, than I swore
you were cut out by nature for a clerk. I said you
wrote a fine hand, were a surprising arithmetician,
and a sober, honest, and industrious young man. In
short, I told fifty lies about you.”
** I am much obliged; but how came the manager
to be acquainted with my name?”
“Faith, I hardly know that; but just before he
spoke to me, he was in conversation for some time
with an elderly gentleman, with a brown coat and
brown cane.”
“Enough! enough! Good morning."
“Ta, ta!”
When Simpkin had shut the door, William sprung
from his bed, and threw on his clothes, with what he
confessed to himself to be the first prudent resolution
he had taken since his arrival in London.
“I will see
this strange being,” said he, “incomprehensible alike

in good and evil; I will find him out, if he be above
ground! Misery, real, palpable misery, such as mine,
is surely enough without the horrors of imagination.
I will no longer be ridden by a night-mare, or tor-
mented, for aught I know, by a fiend !”
He first walked direct to the warehouse of Messrs.
Dot and Co., where he saw the manager; but all this
gentleman knew of Mr. Vesper was, that he had been
introduced by a friend of the house, 'a linen-draper at
Monmouth. Seizing the vague hint conveyed by this
information, he then went successively to the different
inns where the Welsh coaches arrived, and at length
succeeded in discovering some clue to the object of his
search. The porter at one of the inns remembered
carrying his portmanteau to a house near Charing
Cross; and thither William bent his steps. Mr. Ves-
per had just paid his bill, and removed his luggage in
a hackney-chariot. Where? It was supposed for the
purpose of returning to the country by the night-coach.
William flew to one of the great coach-offices in Picca-
dilly, where he was absolutely certain of intercepting
him if he had not already passed.
A stage-coach was at the door, and in the act of re-
commencing its journey; the whip flew noisily about
the horses' ears; the animals struck fire with their
heels from the granite stones of the street; and as the
first convulsive motion of the vehiele brought it within
play of the pavement lamp, the pale light streamed
upon a face in the inside which William knew to be
Mr. Vesper's. The next moment the coach dashed
of at full speed; and William, spent with fatigue,
anxiety, and illness, only prevented himself from falling
by clinging to the lamp-post.
It was late before he reached his lodgings, and his
knock for admittance was answered from the parlour-
window.
“ I did not expect you back," said the mistress of
the house, “nor indeed do I think you intended, in the

morning, to return; for I see you
have removed every
article of your property, down even to an old bible
which lay on your mantel-piece, with the exception of
a trumpery picture, no doubt of some trumpery slut,
who seemed to mock me from the wall as I went in to
clean the room for another lodger.'
William hugged
the bible, on which his coat was closely buttoned, and
thanked God inwardly for the instinct which had pre-
served it.
"I did not intend,” said he, "to remove in your
debt; God knows I would have paid you if I could, and
that I still will when I can. Give me only one night
more; it is all I ask or will
accept.
.
“The room is let," replied the woman, roughly,
" and the lodger asleep in his bed long ago."
" Then give me, at least, that little portrait, it can
be of no use to you.” She shut down the window.
William rapped loudly on the glass with his knuckles;
and the landlady, throwing it open again, exclaimed
in a fury-
Dare, sirrah, to disturb my house in that manner
once more, and I will give you in charge to the watch!”
She then shut down the window with violence, but not
before William had inserted his hand between. The
blood spouted from the crushed fingers; but with the
other hand he held up a shilling before the window,
and with a gentle though earnest voice, entreated her
to accept of it in exchange for the portrait.
“ Do take it,” said he, “it is my last, or I would
offer more; surely that little bit of paper cannot, to
any one but me, be worth a shilling !
The landlady relented. She handed him the por-
trait; nay, she even hesitated for a moment before
accepting the money.
Had it been only eleven pence
humanity might have triumphed; but the devil bid
another penny more, and she clutched the bait. As
the window shut for the last time:-
" There was a friend of yours here to-day,” she said

in a softened tone, a gentleman with a brown coat
and a brown cane; make your peace with him, if
you
wish to do well in the world!”
William, as he pressed his Bible with one hand, and
his tiny portrait with the other, walked on for some
time more with the air of a conqueror in a Roman
triumph, than with that of a homeless and friendless
wretch in the streets of a mighty city.
It was nearly twelve o'clock, the public-houses had
already emptied their lawful contents into the vast
thoroughfares of population; the shops were shut, with
the exception here and there of an avaricious pastry-
cook's, which still gaped upon the street for the pur-
pose of tempting stragglers on their way home from
the playhouses; the customary noises of evening had
died away, all but now and then a drunken shout, or
the rattle of a hackney-coach, or the hoarse voice of a
watchman bawling the hour. By and bye, the theatres
flung their gushing volumes into the stream, which
gave token of the addition to the furthest corners of
the metropolis. Men and women, boys, girls, and
children, flowed rapidly along; some absorbed as they
passed into the ducts and creeks which opened by their
side, and others disappearing in the gloom before.
The eager remark, the abrupt question, the recollected
laugh, echoed on all sides; and when the crowd gra-
dually melted away, and their voices died in the dis-
tance, the loneliness of the desert street seemed strange
and startling. The silence was now only broken at
long intervals by the scream of the female night-van-
derer, driven by intoxication and despair to remonstrate
with the sullen guardian of the hour; but elsewhere
the drowsy voices of the watchmen themselves seemed
to add to the calmness of the scene,
“Imposing silence with a stilly sound.”
As Willian turned into Bridge Street, by the Obelisk
at Fleet Market, he heard a singular ery, which even

his practised ear was unable to syllable into any of the
customary sounds of a metropolitan night. A figure
in white came rushing along the pavement, uttering a
short, shrill, definite seream, repeated in rapid yet
regular succession. As she approached, he could see
that she was dressed in the extreme of fantastic finery,
and that her wild and bacchanal air denoted a profes-
sion of shame. • Lost! lost I lost!” was her cry as
she ran; “Lost! lost! lost!” she shrieked more wildly
in William's ears, as she swept past him like a spirit.
Shocked and heart-stricken, he stood still, and gazed
after the phantom; and when her form had melted
into the darkness, and the voice of the lost one fallen
for the last time upon his heart, it was with a gasp of
unutterable relief he pursued his aimless journey.
On the neighbouring bridge he stood for a while,
contemplating instinctively the imposing scene before
him. No sensible perception, however, of beauty or
sublimity at first entered his mind, He seemed to be
awakened gradually from a dream, of which he re-
membered not the form nor meaning, by the moon
breaking from the clouds which had till now enveloped
her, and calling out from the chaos of darkness the
elements of a magnificent city. The proud dome of
St. Paul's raised its head supreme amidst the mass of
buildings, while meaner spires, countless in number,
and various in form and character, were scattered
around. To the west, the more definite part of
the view was bounded by Waterloo Bridge, which
threw its superb length, as straight as an arrow, over
the wide and glittering river; and beside it Somerset
House, rising, with its palace-walls, from the water's
edge, seemed a building ereated and existing only in
the fancy of a painter, On the north, a forest of
dark houses burthened the earth as far as the eye
could
reach, oppressing the imagination by their multitude,
and their close and compact array; on the south, the
line of Blackfriars Road extended its rows of bright

lamps with mathematical nicety to such a distance
that it seemed to terminate in a point; and to the
east, the cast-iron bridge, bestriding the broad stream
like a giant, seemed to guard the tract beyond from
view, into which nevertheless, the eye could penetrate,
although dimly, as in a dream, through darker clouds
and shadows, which it learnt by its past experience
to shape into houses, and towers, and spires. Every
thing was vast, and mighty, and indefinite. No grasp
was afforded to the mind of even a part of the picture.
The buildings melted into other buildings; the streets
were absorbed into other streets; and the boundary
line of the whole was hidden in darkness. In dark.
ness arose the mighty volume of waters which rolled
in silence through the silent city; and in thick dark-
ness its course was lost and swallowed up.
William gazed with a feeling of littleness, which
at last diverged into absolute terror. He forgot that
he was himself an individual of that species of insects
which had created the wonders around him! By and bye
the moon withdrew her light as suddenly as it had been
given ; and the night-wind, which seemed to have been
charmed to rest by her beauty, came forth with a wild
and wailing cry. Heavily the moaning gusts swept
along the bridge, and cold, cold was their breath upon
the wanderer, who stood there in silence and darkness.
William turned shivering away into the thicker houses
of the city, but his chilled limbs were hardly able to
perform their functions.
While passing through St. Paul's Church Yard,
where the winds are never still, the icy blast seemed
to cut into his very heart, and he felt a momentary
relief in escaping into Cheapside from the dark cold
shadow of the cathedral. Soon the Mansion House
was at his back, the palace of the City kings; Lom-
bard Street on his right, the mistress of the city purse ;
the Bank on his left, at once the agent and comp-
troller of the government of the empire ; and before.

him, the Royal Exchange, the grand rendezvous of the
intercourse of the world. In that dead and lonely
hour, when the interruptions of business and the
thousand suggestions of self were still, the associ-
ations connected with these objects in the imagination
of an Englishman arose in all their strength and
grandeur ; and it was with a proud step and a swelling
heart that the poor, friendless, moneyless, homeless
youth strode up the slight ascent of Cornhill. The
excitement had hardly abated when, in Leadenhall
Street, the palace of the merchant-kings of half a con-
tinent stood before him; the depository of the destinies
of hundreds of millions of their fellow-men, grand and
terrible, and lovely, in its associations with power and
crime, and holy mercy, with all that is brightest and
meanest in the human character, and all that is vast
and magnificent in the human history.
The re-action in his feelings, however, was almost
instantaneous. The cold became more intense, his
threadbare clothing felt thinner, his limbs grew heavy
with fatigue, and want of food, although without the
sensation of hunger, weighed down his heart. Hardly
conscious of the circumstance of motion, he traversed
Aldgate, and passing through some streets to the
right, saw the blood-stained towers of Julius before
him, as mean and impotent in their aspect as they are
grand and mighty in history. When turning again to
the right, he passed into Thames Street, where, in the
day time, the voice cannot be heard for the roar of
waggons, the silence by contrast seemed strange and
awful. At the Custom-house, the grand portal of the
commerce of half the world, a solitary sentinel slum-
bered on his post ; and when he had nearly reached,
at right angles, the great artery which communicates
between the heart of the city and London Bridge, the
place seemed so favourable for a moment's repose, that
he was tempted to rest his trembling limbs on a win-
dow-seat.

THE GAME OF LIFE.
The change of feeling, for the instant, was delicious.
His eyes began to close, and a forgetfulness of imme-
diate misery stole softly over his senses, when a watch-
man, who had been concealed in the shadow on the
opposite side, crossed over, and rapping the pavement
with his cudgel till the streets rang again, ordered him
to move on."
“My good fellow," said William, faintly, “I am
doing no harm.”
“That is no business of mine,” replied the function-
ary; you have no right to sleep in the open air ;
and if I find you transgressing the law within my beat,
why, I must take you up for a rogue and vagabond,
that's all.” William moved on.
He turned down by London Bridge; and, uncon-
scious of any particular feeling or purpose, found him-
self standing on the middle arch, and gazing upon the
dark surges tumbling below. The moon was entirely
hidden beneath the dense cloud, which hurried across
the sky; and the wind, sweeping in longer gusts,
wailed over the waters like a voice of lamentation and
despair. The wanderer stept upon the ledge of the
parapet, and leaning upon his elbows, looked down
into the gulf. A sensation of fierce joy first attacked
his mind as a thousand wild and mysterious sounds
rose upon
his ear from where the winds and headlong
waters rushed through the arch below. He felt that he
smiled bitterly at the darkness and strife; and, half
controlled by a nervous affection, half in mockery of
his own despair, he at length mingled his voice with
that of the night in a hoarse and hollow laugh. Then,
startled by the sound he had himself produced, which,
as the gust at intervals died moaning away, seemed to
issue from lips not his own, he paused in expectation
and horror.
Recalled to himself, he was met by a feeling par-
taking in a scarcely less degree of the horrible. All
within was dark, darker than all without; all within

was tumult, more tumultuous than all without. But
no gleam of light illumined the darkness of his soul ;
no bright and lovely moon struggled with the clouds
of his destiny; no sinking of the voice of the moral
storm was heard. Was a continuation, then, of the
analogy impossible ? No: there was hope on one
side, and death on the other. In vain he looked round
for that saving light; in vain he examined the whole
circle of his horizon. To-morrow he would be as
wretched and forlorn a being as to-night, and the mor-
sel of food which chance or charity might present to
his hunger, like the cordials of the Inquisition, would
only preserve his life for new sufferings. The other
alternative—death! But the daring and dreadful idea
which rose into his mind was choked by a feeling of
religious horror, and he only formed the wish without
planning the deed. He even implored his Maker to
take again the breath he had given; he madly com-
manded his ministers to execute decrees that had not
passed; he called upon the winds to sweep him from
the bridge, and upon the waves to hide in their dark
bosoms his degradations and despair.
His reason tottered; his brain swam round; a
thousand strange voices muttered, and hissed, and
groaned, and shrieked in his ear; a thousand horrible
faces grinned and mocked and chattered before his
eyes. A maniac rage took possession of his heart,
and he tore and buffeted the empty air. Farther and
farther he leaned over the parapet, grasping and
springing at his phantom foes; but some obstacle,
some pressure, like that which is felt in the night-
mare, still preserved him from losing his balance. At
every tug it tugged the fiercer ; at every plunge it
pierced into his side; and William, at length putting
down his hand to effect his release, found that Helen's
Bible, over which his coat was buttoned, was caught
in a broken part of the stone.
His face drooped upon his hands; the fountain of

his heart was broken up, and his phrenzy wept itself
away. Long he wept, long he reflected, long he
prayed, without altering his position; and when at
length he raised his head the bright moon had risen
like a spirit from her grave of clouds, and William
blessed aloud the omen and Him who sent it. On de-
scending to the pavement he drew forth the talisman
of love; cold and fatigue had departed from his limbs,
as well as sorrow and despair from his heart; and he
sat down on one of the stone seats of the bridge, and
opened the holy book to read it by the moonlight.
What sortes have met his enlarging eyes ?
What
text of wonder has struck upon his heart ? Breathless
and immoveable, he sat for some minutes gazing upon
the blessed page; and then slowly lifted up at arm's
length a loose paper, as if to raise it nearer the light
of the starry lamp-it was a fifty pound bank-note.

fectly right; boys and girls are troublesome things to
play with—but more especially the former.” A little
while elapsed, however, and then a little while longer,
and still Mr. Vesper was busy with his game of life,
where the moves were so difficult, and the event so
desperate.
It is plain, thought he, that the character of this
young man has been altogether misunderstood even by
himself. The vulgar phrase of "coming into the
world,” as applied to the plunging of a youth into the

great reservoir of society, is metaphorically correct.
His
eyes and ears are opened for the first time; he
gasps in a new atmosphere, and his moral being ac-
quires new attributes, and is governed by new laws.
Happy is the infant—if to live is to be happy-whose
constitution is so strong as to receive the shock of
being born without destruction; whose lungs can inhale,
without suffocation, the gross air of our earth; and
whose awakened functions can adapt themselves with-
out injury to the new and trying circumstances in which
they are placed! Happy the young man whose moral
constitution is so perfect as to withstand the trial un-
shaken of “coming into the world”—whose principles
are able to remain steady amidst the whirl of life
whose soul can extract a wholesome nutriment even
from the poisonous atmosphere of sin!
While making those allowances, however, for human
weakness, which are only refused by the blaspheming
bigot who distorts, not only the spirit, but the express
words and actions of his Master-while acknowledging,
to use his own words, that, “ with divine assistance,
the blind might be made to see, and the cripple to
walk, and the withered arm to stretch forth,” he per-
suaded himself that he had other duties not less im-
portant to perform.
" It is not impossible,” said he, “that he may yet
turn out a fine young man: would I could say not im-
probable! but in the mean time my poor Helen's life
must not be suffered to run away in a drean. God
forbid that I should sunder two such beings on the
trial of a few days, but it is necessary to prepare her
for what perhaps may be the event. Let me not cast
down the image in her pure and holy heart, but let me
teach her at least to regard it without the idolatry
which invests with attributes almost divine what may
turn out to be a cold and worthless stone.'

conversations took place beforehand ; and, not satisfied

with the masonic sign which introduces the good and
the devout to each other, he probed deeply into the
recesses of her character. Decision he found to be the
most striking trait; and he even acknowledged, that if
there was any thing at all in her which deviated in
the slightest degree from the amiable and the truly
feminine, it was the external characteristic of this
quality.
Helen, in fact, had been so long her own mistress
that she was a woman in mind while yet a child in
years. Owing to the ill health of her mother, almost
ever since her unhappy marriage, she had been the
manager and organ of the family, at an age when
other girls are busy with their baby-houses; and at
those years when the young woman, clinging to the
arm of a parent, looks timidly round upon the world
of society, our fair orphan stood intrepid and alone,
providing by her own labour the necessaries and even
comforts of life, and regarding its luxuries with
indifference, if not contempt. Her manner thus
must be supposed to have expressed a certain de-
gree of self-dependence; and this, taken conjointly
with the extreme youthfulness of her appearance,
may have seemed unnatural, and, therefore, some-
what unbecoming in the eyes of a stranger to her
history.
Yes, thought Mr. Vesper, after his examination was
over,

may act freely here, without the fear either of
overturning her own well-grounded tranquillity, or of
doing a cruel injustice to her lover. She will join with
me calmly in inquiring into his conduct, and reasoning on
its principles and results; and when our experiments
have become numerous enough to afford materials on
which to build a decision, she will either separate her
fate at once from that of a being marked out for
destruction, or, in an union in which the wishes of her
heart receive the sanction of her judgment, she will
enjoy a happiness as complete as this world can afford.

THE GAME OF LIFE.
So reasoned the male philosopher; and he forthwith
disclosed his secret to the female one.
Helen grew paler and paler as the discourse pro-
ceeded ;* and at length, when she sat, faint, breathless,
and bloodless, like a statue of white marble, her friend
began to think that he had committed some error in
ratiocination. When he arrived, however, at that
passage in his disclosure in which he related that he
had heard her own name bandied by one of the base
and profligate associates of her lover, her bosom
throbbed quickly and wildly, her eye lightened, and the
blood rushed in a torrent into her face. These various
signs of emotion, however, lasted only while Mr.
Vesper was speaking. When he concluded, they had
passed away like clouds flitting across the moon. She
then calmly but earnestly investigated what she had
heard, questioning him as to the details, and suggest-
ing possibilities of exaggeration or mistake; and
finally entreated him, “for Mrs. Clive's sake,” to
return instantly to London, and draw her unhappy son
from the perdition into which he was sinking. The
letter which concludes the eighth chapter of this history,
was dispatched on the following morning. Some
people may think it betrays a little inconsistence with
her present manner and language ; but we, who are
learned in the mysteries of human nature, think no
such thing.
When Mr. Vesper reached London, he had still
more difficulty than at first in finding his protégé.
William's residence was unknown at the Three Pun-
cheons; and although his pursuer attended there on seve-
ral successive nights, he did not make his appearance.
Many of the company, indeed, knew him, or pretended
to know him, by description ; and not a few were so
polite as to mention some other houses-situated,
generally, at several miles distance—where he was to
be found in the evening. Mr. Vesper, after many
fruitless walks and rides, discovered that, in common

145
parlance, he was hoaxed by these informants, and de-
termined therefore to conclude his acquaintanceship
with the Three Puncheons and its witty frequenters
with a single other visit.
On this occasion, while repeating pertinaciously his
inquiries, a person whom he had never seen before in-
stantly stept up to him, and offered to become his
agent in the discovery. An easy business-like address,
and considerable sincerity of manner, induced Mr.
Vesper to question him as to his means and probability
of success ; and Mr. Wilkins, the accommodating
genius whom we have before fallen in with in the same
room, entered with prolix plausibility into an explana-
tion.
“ The gentleman you say, sir,” said he, “is Welsh;
very well. I know the residence of another gentleman
from the principality-one Burnet, a law-writer; and
Welshmen, I have observed, stand together like the
blades of a leek. There are also several houses of
public entertainment, where you will be sure to meet
with a Welshman if he is above ground. There is,
for instance, the Hole in the Wall, justly celebrated
for its toasted cheese, and also another house, but of
rather a lower grade, where the same Runic aliment
is devoured cold, with raw onions. We have also the
Barley Mow, incomparably the best in London for its
Welsh ale, which, indeed, in the facetious reports of
Mr. Wigwam, a gentleman of newspaper fame who
frequents this house, except in his short intervals of
sobriety, has received the appellation of “Taffy's
Elixir.
“I am inclined to think, sir," interrupted Mr.
Vesper, “that
your first suggestion is the best; and,
at all events, it would be worth while calling on Mr.
Burnet before giving yourself further trouble.”
“No trouble at all, sir; none in the world; but I
make it a point to attend religiously to the instructions
with which I am honoured;" and drawing forth his

book and pen, he entered the commission with great
formality. “ The expense will be trifling,” added he,
“coach-hire, letters, time, trouble. 0: quite a trifle."
“I would prefer," said Mr. Vesper, cautiously,
“ instead of paying you a trifle for your exertions,
engaging to double or treble the sum on your bringing
me face to face with Mr. Clive."
“Is he above ground, my dear sir?" inquired the
agent with great delight.
“ I have reason to know,” replied Mr. Vesper,
" that he is in London at this moment.
name and address, and unless you are particularly
unreasonable, I believe that you will not consider that
your trouble has been thrown away.” Wilkins had
no sooner cast his eye upon the card, than he started
and changed colour; then throwing a deep but hasty
glance at Mr. Vesper's face, he rose suddenly from
his chair, and applying his hand to his watchless fob,
declared that he had not another moment to spare.
“ Your business shall be attended to,” said he, “good
night!” and catching up his hat, he darted out of the
This is my
room.
Mr. Vesper experienced an emotion of alarm, but
scarcely of surprise, for he had himself been attracted
by something peculiar in the man's appearance; and
when he vanished so abruptly, he felt as if relieved
from the presence of some phantom face which had
haunted him in a dream. While musing on the singu-
larity of the circumstance, a sudden light darted
through his brain, and striking his hands together
“My God!” he exclaimed almost aloud, “that was
my wretched brother's associate, the villain Watson!”
To his eager inquiries, the company answered to a
man, that they knew him as well as the gas-light.
“ He is a tea-dealer,” said one; “no, a situation-
agent,” said a second; “rather a wine or a coal
merchant, I should think,” said a third; “not at all,
he is a tailor,” insisted a fourth; but they all agreed

in their ignorance of his place of abode, and of the
particular house he used, if indeed he used any in
particular at all. The landlord declared that all he
knew of his profession was, that Wilkins had lately
paid him by a cart of lime for a small drinking bill he
had run up, receiving the balance in old puncheon
staves; and another person declared, that only the
other week he had been in treaty with this universal
dealer for a box of Havannah cigars and a side of
bacon.
In the feelings which this unexpected rencontre
revived, Mr. Vesper almost forgot for several weeks
the ostensible object of his visit to London.
man living could throw light upon the fate of his
brother's family, it was Wilkins! His yearnings
after those only relations reconimenced; and the
“ lady with the long dark hair,” and the “child,
with its innocent eyes,
began once more to haunt
his dreams. Wilkins, however, had vanished, as
traceless as a spirit; and to tempt by further bribes
in advertisements a man who must have already re-
fused so much, was useless. Mr. Vesper; therefore,
at length left the affair in the hands of Providence,
and turned his thoughts to those who were to supply
the place of friends and family.
Although he conceived that Wilkins would have
been a fitter person to deal with such a man as he
imagined Burnet, from his cold and gloomy manner,
to be, yet since this mysterious agent had no doubt
thrown up his commission, he ventured to undertake
the task himself of wresting from the reserve or design
of the law-writer his knowledge of William and his
place of abode.
He found Burnet sitting at the fire-
side with his wife and children, hanging over a few
dying embers. The implements of his occupation
were on the table, but no law-paper, or other symptom
of actual business, visible; and Mrs. Burnet's hands
were rested idly on her knees, while her eyes were

fixed with a vacant stare upon the almost cold grate.
An air of poverty, amounting to absolute want, reigned
throughout the apartment, and the children, leaning
their heads round their mother's chair, with neglected
dress, and faces channelled with tears, seemed to have
cried themselves to sleep. Mr. Vesper was power-
fully moved with this scene of desolation, and the
rather that it seemed but too well to account for the
air of coldness and selfishness which had prejudiced
him against Burnet. Can this be the man, thought
he, who furnishes others with employment, and who
thinks himself entitled to feel indignant at their neglect
of' his orders? The law-writer seemed to hesitate for
some moments whether he should, or should not, take
the trouble of rising to receive his visitor ; but appa-
rently resolving to indemnify himself in another way
for the civility, he at length got up.
“ Well," said he, you have come, I suppose, to
ask me whether Mr. Clive has now accepted employ-
ment, and what sum of his I may happen to have in
my hands. Is it not so?”
“ I confess,” replied the visitor, “ that I should
feel interested in the reply to those questions; but my
purpose in coming here was simply to ask, whether
you can now furnish me with the young gentleman's
address; and to offer you I trust I do not offend--a
compensation for the trouble.” At these words the
young wife raised her head for the first time, so sud-
denly, as to draw forth a sleepy moan from the children,
and fixed an eager gaze upon her husband's face.
Burnet answered her with a furious look, and turning
with flashing eyes to Mr. Vesper, seemed about to
give vent to a burst of indignation; but the next
moment his cheek resumed its sallow hue, his lip
trembled, and he pointed with a silent gesture of grief
and aversion to the door, and turning his back upon
his visitor, sat down.
“I perceive that I have offended you," said Mr.

Vesper, gently, “and yet I can hardly conceive how.
I know little about the punctilios of pride or vanity.
I am a plain man, Mr. Burnet, and have been accus-
tomed, like yourself, to work for my living.'
“You are not a plain man,” replied Burnet, with
his usual dogmatical abruptness; 'you are a man so
disguised in the artifices of society, so covered with
the incrustations of worldly interest, that nature her-
self would not know her own handiwork. The last
time you were here, when you saw that I had work to
do, and that my family had bread to eat, you did not
dare to offer me a bribe to betray my friend; but now,
when you find poverty-nay, hunger in the room,
and read impatience of suffering in the eyes of my
wife-
“Nay, Richard," interrupted Mrs. Burnet, in a
hollow whisper, as she stole her hand round the table,
and took hold of his, "you know it was for the chil-
dren!” Burnet replying with a look of self-reproach,
as he secretly pressed her hand, continued
If you were really a plain man, I would not hesi-
tate to trust you with William Clive's address. You
would see him as destitute and desperate a wretch, as
can be found within the bills of mortality.”
"And why, in the name of heaven, will you hide
him from me? Am I a wolf?”
If you were all wolf,” said Burnet, coolly, “I
should not mind, for wolves will not fasten on the
throat they cannot prey upon: but the English creditor
mingles so marvellous a portion of the ass with the
fiercer animal, that a prudent man will not expose to
his stupidity what he might safely trust to his blood-
thirstiness."
Mr. Vesper had considerable difficulty in removing
the impression which the mind of the half-lawyer had
received with regard to his business with William; but
when at length he succeeded in persuading him that he
was in reality an old friend of the family, and sought

out the young man from motives of the kindest solici-
tude, Burnet seized him by the arm, and hurried him
out of the room.
· Fly,” said he, “fly for God's sake! There is his
address, to-night you can save him; to-morrow night
may be too late!"
“And you?” said Mr. Vesper, hesitating, as he
shook him warmly by the hand-
“0, I!” replied the law-writer, “I am used to it;
I ain no worse off now, than I have been before, and
shall be again:” and as he spoke, he fixed his glassy
eye upon vacancy, while the light of the slender candle,
with which he showed his visitor down stairs, fell
dimly on a brow of twenty-five, where care and dejec-
tion had placed the marks of at least middle life.
continued he, starting; “take care that,
at all events, you allow not to-morrow forenoon to pass
without seeing him. Beware of the striking of the
twelfth hour!”
His first trial is over, thought Mr. Vesper, as he
walked along the street; he has been weighed in the
balance, and this time found wanting. His money is
spent, and his health no doubt impaired; and he sees
the hopes of the vicious dissolving away, and want
rushing down upon him like an armed man. The
hour is propitious; to-morrow morning it shall be put
into his power to live; not in idleness, however, not
like a gentleman's son, as his silly mother would say,
but by patient, honest, and laborious industry. The
duration of the experiment will depend upon his own
conduct, and then we shall see.
The next morning, considerable speculation was
excited in the establishment of Messrs. Dot and Co.,
by the
appearance of a brown-coated and brown-caned
elderly gentleman-evidently no customer-stalking
through the covered streets and squares of their city
of haberdashery
When Simpkin had been dispatched on his errand,

the manager left Mr. Vesper to his fate, and our
philosopher, surprised, and for some time amused, by
the scene before him, had abundant leisure to gratify
his curiosity.
The shop extended its narrow length to a vast dis-
tance from the street, and was furnished with two
parallel counters, running from end to end; behind
which ministered numerous genteel and pretty-looking
young females, assisted in smaller numbers by the
compeers of Simpkin. The whole area between the
counters was crowded with customers of both sexes
and every rank; and a degree of confusion prevailed,
which struck Mr. Vesper at first as being unbusiness-
like. His eye, however, had not been long accustomed
to the spectacle, when the confusion seemed to dis-
appear, and a surprising regularity to be the result of
sounds and motions apparently so heterogeneous.
Wandering to the middle of the area, he perceived
an opening to the left, leading apparently to an inner
shop, and following some persons who were conducted
by one of the young men, he found himself in a narrow
passage, walled with boxes and packages of all kinds.
A counter extended to the right, strewed with haber-
dashery, and a single warehouseman behind it was too
busy with his occupation to raise his eyes to look at
the passer-by. At the end of this counter were two
dark and dismal little dungeons, into the doors of which
Mr, Vesper, whose alarm was mastered by curiosity,
popped his head for a moment. These were the count-
ing-houses, the engine-rooms, on which the whole cum-
brous system of operations depended; and the ma-
chinery consisted of some half-a-dozen sallow-looking
young men, bending over the desks with the most
phthisical devotion, and in profound silence. Turning
to the right, he found himself in a territory where the
staple commodity was hose; but as the stocking-king
threw a glance of inquiry at the unauthorized adven-
turer, he turned away into what seemed to be a mighty

continent, classed into kingdoms by arbitrary lines,
unknown to the geography of nature.
Here were seen the natives staggering under loads
that would have foundered an Irish porter, and wan-
dering to and fro in the most confused regularity ima-
ginable. Immense bales and boxes cumbered the
ground; and the faint light of day wandering among
silks and stuffs of every possible description, was repaid
for its trouble in insinuating itself into these regions
of gorgeous mystery, by being enriched with a thou-
sand various and dazzling hues. Far to the right, in
the meridian, as it appeared, of the shop, a glimpse
was caught of furs, feathers, flowers, and other gay
and glorious things, and flitting in the midst, appeared
some female forms of corresponding elegance and
beauty; but the traveller, turning to the left, continued
his progress till the near view of the further wall made
him congratulate himself on having achieved the ex-
ploratory adventure.
On approaching nearer, however, a confused noise
assailed his ears, and presently a cavern yawned at
his right hand, filled with moving figures, and wheeled
carriages drawn by men, and loaded with bales and
boxes. On either side of the long but narrow excava-
tion, a line of clerks were seated in successive boxes,
writing with almost inconceivable rapidity, for their
labour appeared to be original composition, not copying.
Ever and anon the monosyllable “Done!” broke from
their lips, but not one of them stirred for all that, or
so much as lifted his pen. When Mr. Vesper's ear
became in some measure accustomed to the din, he
discovered that at the further end of the vista sundry
voices were occupied in communicating with these ad-
mirable machines; and when at length he reached the
termination, he found that numerous waggons without,
were emptying their contents at this landing dock.
On emerging into the street, all was terra incognita;
and when he inquired, in some alarm, for the establish-

ment of Messrs. Dot and Co. he was directed to another
street apparently at a considerable distance.
He at
length reached the shop-door in safety, where he found
Simpkin in the act of entering.
*Well, sir,' said Mr. Vesper, “ you have found
Mr. Clive? You shake your head. Is he out?”
“No, sir, he is in."
“ And what answer has he given to the offer?”
“Oh! much obliged of course, but he has been in
since yesterday.”
What do you mean? He has mistaken the
message!” And Mr. Vesper's heart quaked as St.
Giles's clock struck twelve.
· Why, I mean, of course,” said Simpkin, “ that he
had already found a situation, and is, therefore, able
to give up his claims upon the Refuge for the Desti-
tute.” Mr. Vesper, not aware that this was a slang
term for the house of Messrs. Dot and Co. shuddered
at the extent of his protégé's sufferings. On inquiring
into the nature of the situation he bad obtained, the
shopman declared he knew nothing about it; adding,
that Mr. Clive was in bed when he called, and “.
cessive hippish.” “ In bed! That looked ill. But,
perhaps, he had too good reason?" Simpkin smiled,
and holding his head with both his hands, and mimick-
ing the woeful and haggard look of a man after a de-
bauch, vanished into the shop.
Mr. Vesper, vexed and surprised, walked immediately
to William's lodging. Surely the devil himself, thought
he, must assist in a visible and tangible manner those
who are willing to do his work; or how could a man,
in circumstances of such deplorable necessity, continue
to be guilty of a vice like this? When he reached the
house, he found the landlady employed in cleaning out
the room for a new lodger, as she afterwards informed
our unfortunate hero, and in a state of irritation
amounting to fury.
“ Mr. Clive at home!” repeated the virago, “A

pretty mister indeed; truly a gentleman's son! If
he was to offer to show his face again within a door of
mine, I would show him the way out with a vengeance,
that I would !"
“. What is the matter? What has he done?” in-
quired Mr. Vesper in alarm,
“0, nothing at all! Only bilked his lodgings, and
absconded this morning.”
Are you sure, are you absolutely sure, that he does
not mean to return?” The landlady, who was ab-
solutely afraid that he did mean to return, scorned
to tell a lie about the matter, and therefore replied
only by a general philippic against dishonest lodgers
and beggarly gentlemen.
Mr. Vesper stood for some time utterly confounded
by a villany so mean and so atrocious. He has lived
upon this poor woman's credulity, thought he, till he
obtained a situation; and now, when for the first time
a prospect opens of paying his debts, he sneaks out of
her way! The fact of his desertion did not rest on
the landlady's suspicion alone. The open and empty
trunk, the room void of every thing but dust and filth;
all confirmed it, to the bare walls; no, not altogether
bare, for a china-ink drawing still hung neglected over
the mantel-piece. It was Helen's portrait, the house-
hold god of the renegade, thus left, and here! Oh,
lost! lost! lost!
Mr. Vesper paid the deficiency in the rent, caution-
ing the tender-hearted landlady, who actually wept
with joy and surprise, to beware for the future of
trusting a lodger merely because he looked like a
gentleman's son. He then strode down stairs, with
more bitterness of heart than he had ever felt in
his life.
Reprobate!” he exclaimed, taking the way to his
own lodgings, the “twelfth hour has indeed struck, and
I wash my hands of him. On Helen my hopes shall
anchor; there I cannot be deceived ; to her my heart

some
returns as to a pleasant home, where all is warm, and
bright, and happy.” He was recalled from these parti-
coloured dreams by suddenly observing Wigwam stand-
ing at a little distance before him, with his back to the
wall, and busily engaged in taking notes, while ever
and anon he raised his eyes to the houses on the oppo-
site side of the street.
A few persons had already stopped to gaze—for a
man who stands in one of the great thoroughfares of
London, and looks intently on any object, will collect
a thousand spectators in five minutesmand
heads were protruded from the neighbouring windows.
Altogether a disagreeable sensation was produced on
Mr. Vesper's mind, and he felt, without knowing why,
as if about to witness some terrible catastrophe. His
first impulse, however, in the present state of his
feelings, was to avoid the vagabond companion
of his discarded protégé, and he crossed over to the
other side of the street. The next moment he felt a
thin shower of lime-dust descending on his head, and
as a shriek broke from a female at one of the opposite
windows, a sensation of instinctive alarm swept across
his mind. A low, grating, crashing sound followed ;
and in the midst of cries of warning and fear from the
spectators, a cloud of rubbish rushed down into the
street around him. Blinded and stupified, he stood
still, not knowing which way to fly, till a louder roar
was heard above him, and at the instant he felt him-
self caught up in the arms of a man, and saved from
the destruction which must have overwhelmed him had
he lingered another moment on a spot on which the
ruins of a lofty building were now raining.
The deliverer and delivered, however, had hardly
gained the middle of the street, when both rolled upon
the ground, the leg of the former being broken by the
rebound of a fragment from the wall; and Mr. Vesper,
now in his turn the preserver, while endeavouring to
drag the disabled body out of the reach of further

danger, recognised, in the pale face before him, the
features of Wigwam.
“ Bless my eyes, man!” said the reporter, “what
about? Don't you see that your
head will be
broken into by these burglar bricks in half a second?
Run for your life, and leave me alone!”
“ The Lord do so to me, and more also, if I leave
you !" was the reply of Mr. Vesper ; and with another
.convulsive tug, he dragged him within reach of assist-
ance from the spectators. “Now, where would you
be carried to, my good friend?” he continued, pressing
the hand of the wounded man with affectionate grati-
tude.
“ To the nearest hospital !” replied Wigwam; and
he added, as if to himself, “ I always expected this;
I foresaw that the dissecting-table would be my
fate
at last; I knew I should never be buried quietly with
my poor
” and as the word was lost in a trem-
bling of the voice, Mr. Vesper looked eagerly in his
face, expecting-hoping to find in his eyes the
blessed harbinger of peacema tear.
But he was
mistaken ; the next moment those eyes were turned
with a gay recklessness upon the crowd, and, as he
waved his hat over his head
Come, heave away, my boys !” he cried. " To old
Bartholomew, at last, with Jack Wigwam !” It was
not to the hospital, however, he was carried, but to a
more private, if not more comfortable asylum ; where
every assistance that professional skill could give, and
every comfort the magic of wealth could summon or
create, were assembled at his bed-side.
Mr. Vesper, after a busier day than he had spent
for some time past, took his seat in the night-coach
for Wales; and, with a sigh of relief, found himself
emerging from the crowded streets, ceaseless din, and
thick atmosphere of the metropolis. On reaching
Llanwellyn, his first business was to walk straight to
Helen's cottage; and as he approached the door, he

dismissed with a still heavier sigh the crowd of thick-
coming fancies which had gathered deeper on his heart
than all the clouds of London. A hum broke
upon
his
ear, which he persuaded himself, while yet at some
yards distance, was nothing more that the noise inci-
dental to the breaking-up of the school; but soon a
ruder call, then a merry scream, then a shout of
laughter, invaded his senses; and when, at length, his
tardy and unwilling feet had carried him to the door,
a bacchanalian song, given forth by some blustering
railer,” broke upon his heart like a voice of boding and
dismay.
The neat green paling on one side of the door,
was broken down and trampled; on the other it was
entire, except the paint, and strengthened by some
thicker stakes, for the purpose of defending from an-
noyance a numerous litter of pigs which wallowed on
the heretofore bed of flowers. The jasmined lattice-
work was hanging in ruins about the door; and either
window, minus one of its four panes, was garnished
instead, on one side with a bundle of rags, and on the
other with a wisp of straw, On the shutters some
hieroglyphical emblems of good cheer, taken in con-
junction with the sounds within and the signals without,
gave token that the cottage, so late the abode of beauty,
taste, and virtue, was now converted into what is called
a hedge alehouse.
In vain Mr. Vesper rubbed his eyes and opened his
ears, and examined again and again the relative bear-
ings of the house; the metamorphosis was neither the
coinage of his brain nor owing to a geographical mis-
take; and he at length, in a state of mind rendered
indescribable by its darkness and confusion, turned
suddenly round, and ran at full speed to Mrs. Clive's
house, clattering along the stones of the little town
with a vehemence which brought the neighbours to
their doors and windows as he passed.
“My son, my son; what of my son?” cried the

widow, as he entered. Why has he not sent me his
address? Is his head turned yet with the notice his
talents have excited? Who is he among ? Has he
put on his winter flannels, as he promised me faithfully
he would ?” Mr. Vesper repressed the answers that
had risen to his lips, and listened in respectful but
sorrowful silence to the inquiries of a mother.
“ Your son,” said he, at last, “has obtained, I
understand, a situation, and he will, doubtless, himself
let
you know the particulars. As for me, I discovered
his address too late to be of any use.”
“I knew it!” cried the proud mother, while tears
of joy started into her eyes. My heart foretold that
he would not be long in London before obtaining all
he wished. With a figure and talents like his, and
the education and manners of a gentleman's son, it
would have been strange indeed if he had failed to
succeed!” An expression of benevolent and almost
admiring pity rose into Mr. Vesper's face, and he
could not find in his heart to destroy the poor
mother's
delusion.
“ Let us talk now, my dear madam,” said he, “ if
only for a moment, of our other friends; where is
Helen Howard ?” Mrs. Clive drew up, for an instant,
with an air of prudish dignity, but soon returning to
her natural manner, replied, with unaffected distress,
“ Indeed that unhappy girl has almost broken my
heart. You could not believe it, Mr. Vesper; I am
sure you will not believe it; and as for
poor
William,
when he hears it, as hear he must, it will drive him
out of his mind!”
“You alarm me, madam; be brief, in the name of
goodness, and let me know the worst!”
“ Think the worst, and you will not think too bad.
For my part, there are times when I cannot believe it
yet; when I fancy, in spite of reason, that some
monstrous miracle, such as we meet with in novels,
will occur to make one swear that black is white and

white black. So young, so innocent, so religious!”
Mr. Vesper caught hold of the widow's two hands,
and looked a conjuration from under his shaggy eye-
brows which she could not withstand.
"Well, then, sir," said she, half frightened, "the
story is this.
You had no sooner turned your back
upon Llanwellyn, than Mr. Fisher, our county member,
who happened by some whim to be in church, saw
Miss Howard, some say, although others deny it, for
the first time, and was vastly taken, as young men
will be, you know, with her beauty. You have heard
of Mr. Fisher, I dare say; a young man of good family,
and large fortune; something wild, no doubt, but quite
the gentleman. Well, all on a sudden Helen left off
coming to see me in the evening, when she knew I
most wanted her; although she would run up every
now and then in the forenoon, to the detriment both
of her own school and my house-keeping. In all this
I suspected nothing; and, having no visitors, heard
nothing, till, like a clap of thunder it came upon me,
that her scholars were dropping off one by one, in
consequence of reports that had arisen respecting her
conduct. At length, when her school was entirely
deserted, she chose to mention the subject herself,
although certainly not with the air of one deprived
suddenly of her bread. She told me that Mr. Fisher,
I am ashamed to repeat her effrontery, that Mr. Fisher
had offered her marriagel and that she/it really
would be a good joke on a less melancholy occasion-
that she had refused him! This was too much. If
she had confessed her weakness, I do believe I should
have forgiven her; but as it was, I of course quickly
gave her to understand, that she was taking a liberty
with me which it was not permitted her to repeat.
She then left me, telling me as a secret, that she was
going to Lambton, where a lady, who had been an
acquaintance of her mother, resided, and who was the
only human being of her own sex she could be said to

know in the world, except myself. Well, sir, you will
think me weak, indeed; but when she was gone, my
heart reproached me, and I sent to desire her to come
and speak to me again. My messenger found Mr.
Fisher's cabriolet at the door, and Helen left Llan-
wellyn the same day without seeing me.
Shall I con-
fess
my
weakness farther? I even employed a person
to make inquiries at Lambton, to ascertain whether
that part of her story was correct, but I need not tell
a man who has lived in the world, that no such person
had been seen or heard of there.”
“ And have you not yet traced her; have you heard
nothing further?”
“ Not a syllable."
“ Then what is it you believe? What
says
the
town? Speak out at once, openly, honestly, boldly."
· La, sir! what can be said or believed, but what
everybody thinks and knows; that she went off with
Mr. Fisher, and that she is now his whispering.
Mr. Vesper clapped his hat on his head, shouldered
his stick with a ferocious look, and rushed out of the
house without uttering a word.

SUCKLING.
As it happens, perhaps in a majority of cases, that
what everybody thinks and knows has no existence
except in everybody's imagination, sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of envy, or pusillanimous revenge, or the
sheer innate malice and meanness of human nature,
we shall now proceed to give our own version of
Helen's history for the last few but eventful weeks.
There seems to be something, indeed, so radically
base in the mind of man, that one would think there
was no need for a divine revelation to teach us the
doctrine of original sin ; although, perhaps, the ob-
viousness of the truth does not suggest itself till after-
wards, as was the case in that easy and natural way
taught by Columbus of making an egg stand on end.
To torment is the favourite occupation and delight of

THE GAME OF LIFE.
boyhood, whether a fly or a playmate be the object;
but as the boy progresses towards the constitution of
manhood, he finds at every step that, to tear the lower
animals limb from limb, at least with his own hands,
or to point the finger, and dance and halloo at the fol-
lies or misfortunes of his neighbours, would subject
himself to many an elongation of the nose, and many
a sound and exemplary kicking. The lessons of hu-
manity are thus inculcated through the medium of
fear and self-interest, which form no inconsiderable
portion of what is called the light of nature; and as
the same sort of process takes place in favour of nearly
all the social virtues, we need not be surprised to see,
in
process of time, the individual whose youthful recre-
ations were those of devils, acting the part in society
of a kind master, an attentive husband, and an obliging
neighbour. His mind, however, is still the same, for
the miracle of a second birth cannot be wrought by
the world; and the old instinct of cruelty, in the ac-
commodating spirit of Hudibras's dagger, has only
changed its occupation:-
“It was a serviceable dudgeon
Either for fighting or for drudging:
When it had stabbed, or broke a head,
It would scrape trenchers or chip bread;
Toast cheese or bacon, though it were
To bait a mouse-trap, 'twould not care."
The most trivial circumstance or coincidence in human
life, and the meanest individual of the human race,
suggest an employment and a victim. Beauty is no
availing intercession, virtue no shield, and poverty and
humility no refuge. The nod, the wink, the cough,
the sigh, the upturned glance, the “if,” the hint, the
meaning question, the treacherous defence, the quali-
fied assertion, the round, plump, direct, deliberate,
undaunted lie, all follow in succession more or less

rapid and regular, and all are the ministers of that
solitary demon of cruelty, without whose dominion in
the human heart one half of the Law and the Prophets
would be a dead letter.
It would be needless to inquire what crime our he-
roine had committed against the individuals whose
outrageous malice at length drove her from Llanwel-
lyn; in what way her beauty and accomplishments
had excited hatred instead of admiration; and by what
strange process her sweetness of temper had turned
sour the “ milk of human kindness” in the bosoms of
her neighbours. Here, at least, the inquiry would be
worse than needless; for although no word nor action
of man is without a motive, even if this should lie
hidden beneath the stagnating surface of habit, yet
some questions, and the present among the number,
would only lead into a train of metaphysical subtleties
very foreign to our present purpose. It is sufficient
for us to say, that no sooner was Mr. Fisher observed
to
pay what is called “particular attention" to Miss
Howard, than the whole town was in arms against
her.
Not, however, that hostilities were suddenly com-
menced. There was first the look of discontent, then
the shake of the head, then the whisper, then the
sneer, then the burst of virtuous indignation; to these
succeeded meetings among the malcontents, whether
at the tea-table or the shop-door: arraignment, trial
by witnesses in the French fashion, “on their honour
and conscience,” but not “as they should answer to
God;" condemnation, and—no, not punishment; this
they would leave in better hands. • Heaven forbid,”
said they, “ that we should cast the first stone at her,
sinless though we be ourselves; we will merely take
our children from her school, and so reduce her to
beggary and desperation.”
As for Mr. Fisher, his part of the business was not
a whit more out of rule. He was taken with the

young woman, and resolved therefore to take her in
turn if he could. * To love excellence is natural,”?
says Johnson;
" it is natural likewise for the lover to
solicit reciprocal regard by an elaborate display of his
own qualifications. Mr. Fisher, however, was either
unacquainted with the pompous oracle, or, like a true
lover--for Samuel knew about as much of love as of
dancing-was withheld by the timidity of passion from
making any display whatever. Certain it is that one
evening, when a well-dressed, and indeed noticeable
man-for by that word we understand Mr. Words-
worth means good-looking-lifted the latch of her little
parlour and walked in, Helen was as much at a loss
to recognise the features of her visitor, as to under-
stand the purport of his visit. She did not invite him
to sit down, partly because his air was evidently that
of a man by whom such little civilities would be either
unnoticed or disregarded; and partly because his man-
ner betrayed that he had been drinking more freely
than was likely to make him prove a choice companion
for a young woman. The latter fact was made evident
by his introductory address.
“ I have been drinking,” said he, “ drinking my
angel, drinking your health so long--that, egad, I
could not help coming here to-to-to-tell you?”
“I should feel obliged," said Helen, coolly, " by your
telling me your name and business.”
“My name! now that is hard; savage, upon my
honour! Why, didn't I stare at you the whole time
of service last Sunday?"
Oh, I remember; you are my landlord! If you
call for the rent, it is ready, although I shall request
you another time to choose the forenoon for your
visit."
“ Now that is downright ferocious! You have no
idea how you massacre me by such tomahawk expres-
sions. Rent—and from you! No, most divine Helen;
here you are the mistress, and I only the tenant at will ;

or if you must pay me, let it be with kisses, my
charmer of Troy, for no coin will I accept at the hands
of beauty but the currency of love."
"I understand you, sir,” said Helen; “even the
bad I see can be serviceable to virtue by making vice
in themselves appear foolish and contemptible. Be-
gone, sir!” and she threw the door wide open, and
pointed with so commanding an air, that Fisher, to his
infinite surprise, found himself in the act of obeying.
Surely you are not in earnest,” said he, rallying;
" this is the most unheard of soleciam in hospitality-
turning your own landlord out of doors! Come, let us
talk quietly and rationally, since you dislike the
poetical; you will find me a very sensible fellow, upon
What can you be alarmed at? What
harm am I doing here?”
“ I feel no alarm whatever,” replied Helen; “I live
like yourself, under the protection of the laws, and
surrounded by neighbours, whom a single cry could
summon to my assistance.
“A hint,” cried Mr. Fisher; "a hint, my lovely
ingenious, by all that's clever in woman! Now, cry

And he seized both her hands. Helen
neither screamed nor struggled; but, fixing her eyes,
filled with scorn and indignation, upon his, pronounced
the word “coward!” and Mr. Fisher, dropping her
hands, and staggering back, half with shame, half with
intoxication, left the house without uttering a word.
When he awoke the next morning, it was with a
heart-ach, as well as a head-ach. Mr. Fisher was one
of those men, who are literally overwhelmed with
business, partly of their own, and partly of the nation's;
and it sometimes happened, as it had in the present
case, that he had no time to bestow on the proper
management of his pleasures. How it had happened,
notwithstanding, that he could have been guilty of the
blindness and folly of mistaking Helen for a common
character, surpassed his comprehension.

It is true, she was nothing more than a poor school-
mistress of a dozen poor children; a tenant of his own,
renting a cottage of a few pounds a year; and, what
is more, a young, friendless, orphan girl; but our
legislator piqued himself on his knowledge of mankind,
and womankind too; and firmly believed that he could
see farther into the millstone of the human mind than
any other honourable gentleman in the House. How
could he have looked, he inquired, even for one mo-
ment, in her face, without being struck with the impress
stamped upon the features of those who are distin-
guished from the herd by some peculiarity of confor-
mation independent of rank and circumstances? How
could he have burst with the shout of a satyr upon a
solitude so pure, because so ignorant? How could he
have plunged so rudely into the cold and beautiful
calm of a mind which would be sure to rise, and fret,
and boil at the intrusion in exact proportion to its
abruptness? He pondered upon the subject of his
visit till even the charms of our charming heroine
became heightened in his imagination; the mortal out-
line of her form was lost, and she became as much a
creature of fancy as any dream that ever flitted before
the
eye
of a lover.
While exalting her person, however, into that of a
goddess, he did not forget that she must possess a
woman's mind; and his reasonings on her conduct were
all founded on the data he had received in the course
of his common experience of the sex. Pride, he con-
cluded, after a minute examination of every possible
and impossible motive of human action-pride is her
ruling foible! She can despise wealth, she can subdue
the love of pleasure, she can laugh at lattery, but the
public homage of rank she will not fail to receive as a
sweet-smelling incense.
The line of action he adopted in consequence proved
equally ruinous to himself and Helen. He called in
the forenoon, apologised with gentlemanlike hurnility

for the outrage he had been guilty of the evening
before, and suffered her, who had successively roused
his passions and captivated his imagination, to win
his heart.
“ The truth is, Miss Howard," said he, after having
already pleaded his
cause with
very
tolerable success,
" the truth is, I am very little accustomed to excess in
wine, the disagreeable proof of which is, that when I
am foolish enough to yield to the circumstances which
beset so abominably a man whom ambition, or patriot-
ism-call it which you will—incite to angle for popu-
larity, I am always sure to cut a figure most particu-
larly asinine.
As an example: I saw you in the
forenoon, and in church, and so far from meditating
an insult, it was my earnest and laborious study for
the rest of that day, and the one following, to repress
the thoughts which started up like the spirits in the
midst of the meditations which ought to have been
absorbed in matters of public importance. How far
you were concerned in the excess I committed after
dinner—whether your image acted the Hebe of my
feast, and presented so bewitchingly the enchanted cup
of intoxication, that I could not pass it by-I leave
you to guess: but no sooner had the potion taken
effect than you seemed to stand in lith and limb before
me; time, place, distance—all were forgotten; how I

folly, but are haunted instead with an indistinct con-

charms, and that I enacted the part of a Circean
victim, with the most hoggish felicity.”
There was nothing in this, or his other similar
speeches, very alarming to Helen.
She had never

verses even with a single individual who has enjoyed

this enviable distinction, cannot make any very re-
markable mistake in estimating either a compliment
or a bow.
That our heroine did not know she was
beautiful, it would be the most trashy of all affectations
to assert; and aware of the fact, as she was, not to
have been pleased with the admiration of another,
would have argued either a want of tact in the praiser,
or a want of human nature in the praised.
To com-
mend the beauty of a child gives delight to the mother's
heart; and to commend the beauty of the mother her-
self, if delicately done, will give a delight altogether
as natural and as pure.
Trust not a woman who
resents a compliment as an insult!

Though art's hid causes are not found-
All is not sweet, all is not sound.”
Helen, in truth, was highly pleased both with Mr.
Fisher and his compliments. These, it must be under-
stood, were incidental to the speech, not the speech
incidental to the compliment. He was not guilty of
the absurdity of laboriously demonstrating his admi-
ration, to one who could not possibly have any
doubt
about the matter. He rather allowed such allusions
to escape, as a matter of course, which it would be
idle to insist upon, and affected to withold. With his
own feelings he had more to do than with her charms.
It was his business to prove, not that he saw her
beauty, but that he felt it; and this was not to be
done by enumerating and extolling her perfections,
like an auctioneer, but by the side-long look, the
hurried and repented word, and the interrupted breath-
ing of an eager and terrified purchaser.
He ransacked her little library, characterised and
criticised the authors, carried on the history of their
subject to the present day, and by remarksmno matter
whether his own or not-sometimes ingenious, and
sometimes profound, created in the mind of the listener

It was
no less surprise at the versatility, than respect for the
depth of his mind. He even ventured, at length, to
rally her a little on the prudery of her selection, and
to mention one or two books in the older taste, which
would give an agreeable lightness to her reading.
“I remember one of the books you allude to,” said
Helen; “I once borrowed it from a circulating library;
but my mother told me, that to read it would be both
an unprofitable, and an unlady-like occupation.” Mr.
Fisher smiled.
“Ladies,” said he, “after all, are women; and, as
partakers themselves of the follies and frailties of
human nature, they should forgive the artist who paints
them in an agreeable and amiable manner.
Helen's turn to smile.
“ If you imagine,” said she, “that we have nothing
to do but to reconcile ourselves to frailty and folly as
well as we can, your observation is correct; but as it
would apply with equal propriety to all the weaknesses
and vices of the human race, some little irregularities,
I suspect, would be the consequence of our amia-
bility some heroic murders, for instance, some
high-minded thefts, and some devout and praise-
worthy perjuries!”
“ The irregularities already exist—"suggested Mr.
Fisher; “is strength or weakness, courage or fear
exhibited in avoiding so sedulously to contemplate
them even for an instant?”
“ Neither one nor the other,” replied Helen ; “to
shun familiarity with vice, in a well-regulated mind
will be as much a matter of taste as of duty. We
may be soiled within as well as without; and why
should not the soul, in passing through the world,
shrink from pollution as well as the foot ?” There
was nothing very new, we believe, in this answer to a
stale sophism ; but there was visible in the face and
manner of the speaker so much purity, mingled with
so much loftiness, that the tempter stopped suddenly,

seeming to exclaim, with Comus, to his attendant
spirits
“ Break off, break off, I feel the different pace
Of some chaste footing near about this ground.”
The next forenoon he called again; and with an
appearance of much vexation, mingled with more
dejection, delivered a message from his sister, Lady
Rosemary. Her ladyship regretted, in terms of the
politest bitterness, that she had only known of the
existence of an individual, whose acquaintance would
have been so invaluable in a neighbourhood like that
of Llanwellyn, at a period when she was overwhelmed
with the insipid formalities of taking leave, for a time,
of the country. She hoped, however, on her return,
to obtain the happiness of a friendship, which, from
all she had heard, would prove the greatest, if not the
only charm possessed by this cheerless and uninte-
resting district.
“I am sure you would have liked her,” added Mr.
Fisher, “she is talented, kind-hearted, and high-
minded, somewhat romantic in her attachments and
predilections; only a very few years older than your-
self, and withal, the wife of a fool.” Helen pon-
dered for some moments, and then replied, hesita-
tingly-
“ That is a strange description : we do not marry
blindfold, or by compulsion, in this country; and
although we read in history of wise men acting the
fool successfully, yet I think it scarcely possible that
a fool could pass himself off for a man of sense upon
a talented and high-minded woman.
“ You think, then, that women of that description
only marry men of sense? Happy ignorance ! Oh,
would that I, too, moved in a station where I could
wonder at the sacrifices of birth and rank!”
“ But we do not understand each other. In ordi-
nary affairs, I can easily conceive that birth and rank

are very annoying and unmanageable things; but you
must allow me to say, that unless compelled by cir-
cumstances altogether unimaginable by us of the vul-
gar class, a woman who marries a fool can have no
pretensions to the praise of talent or high-minded-
There was nothing, one would think, very
ambiguous in this speech, or in the point selected for
emphasis by the speaker; but the passions convert
everything into food, and Mr. Fisher dared to misin-
terpret, for a moment, her meaning.
“ Marries!” he repeated, “oh no! you are right;
that is an anomaly in the human character; and yet,
should we be less guarded, less punctilious, I may
say, in those dearer and closer attachments into which
neither pride, nor avarice, nor ambition enters; which
are felt only in the heart, and can be read only in the
eyes; which have no part in this grosser earth and its
unmeaning distinctions and cold formalities—"
“Of what are you talking ?” asked Helen, with
surprise and doubt gathering gradually into painful
conviction.
“Of love, adorable Miss Howard!” exclaimed Mr.
Fisher, half perceiving that he had gone too far to
recede, and half hurried away by his natural impe-
tuosity. “Of that divine ethereal essence which is the
soul of marriage, or, rather, of which marriage is the
cold and stony image, set up by the grovelling hypo-
crisy of men to represent an original too lofty and too
pure for their base conceptions!
“We wander from the subject before us, sir,”
replied Helen, with cold disdain, “we talked of your
sister, the daughter of your lately deceased mother.
Tell her, in reply to her polite message, that I fear,
from her channel of report, she must have altogether
misunderstood my character, and that, at any rate,
from the difference in our station and habits, there
can be too little in common between us to admit of
intimacy, or even permanent acquaintance.”

172
THE GAME OF LIFE,
There was
no mistaking her manner while she
spoke; explanation on his part would have been use-
less, and a show of contrition mean. Mr. Fisher left
her presence, and, as he walked hastily from the door,
he exclaimed to himself aloud in a voice that would
have been inarticulate to another, burdened as it was
with shame, astonishment, and rage, “I love her! I
love her! by -- I love her!”
It was in vain to curse his folly; the deed was
done. Helen had too much good sense and natural
shrewdness not to have perceived his drift, especially
when she compared this unlucky speech, as no doubt
she would, with divers parts of the context of his con-
versation. To understand her purity of mind was not
difficult to a man capable of reflection; and Mr. Fisher
could even carry back his thoughts to a period when
he, too, could have loved without sin, and admired
virtue without a wish to tarnish it.
“It is in vain to think of her,” he exclaimed; “she
can be mine only on terms that would make me the
scorn and ridicule of the world!” He did think of
her, however, through many a fretful day, and many
a feverish night; he made use of his opportunities as
a landlord to visit again in her house; he did not ex-
plain, but avow his error; he imputed it to neglected
youth, to evil association, to pride, folly, ignorance
to the world; he entreated her to forget his madness
to think of him as a friend, as a brother; to enlighten
his darkness with her knowledge, and to lead him to
virtue by her example. When his soul had thus
hovered, moth-like, around the light till it was ab-
sorbed in the blaze, he asked himself, with a start of
alarm, what he was to do? Mr. Fisher was a man of
large fortune and strong passions; he was an only son,
and a spoiled child of the world; what was he to do?
what did he mean to do? The answer was obvious
under all the circumstances, but for some time no tor-
ture could have wrung it from his lips. “I will marry

173
her!” at length broke from his heart; and as the
demons of pride, avarice, and ambition, fled yelling
from their cherished home, he raised his head, ex-
panded his chest, looked the heavens in the face, and
felt lightened of whole centuries of years, and whole
mountains of care.
Helen, in the mean time exposed to the little mise-
ries of a shrinking income, for her pupils had by this
time began to desert her, had no refuge upon earth
for her harassed thoughts. Mr. Fisher's attentions
had become troublesome--nay, alarming; there was a
wildness in his air, and a fixedness in his gaze which
surprised and shocked her.
So little was her experi-
ence in the language of passion, that the very magni-
tude and exaggeration of the characters rendered her
unable to decipher them.
“ If Mr. Fisher loves me,” she said, “it is with
the love of insanity; but surely this is nothing more
than the exuberance and overflowing of a restless
spirit, condemned for a time to the inanity of a coun-
try life. When parliament assembles, he will, no
doubt, collect at once his wandering thoughts, and
rush with wonted enthusiasm to the levée of his
loftier, sterner mistress, Ambition.”
Having once or
twice been joined by him in the street, she had deter-
mined, although with much reluctance, to interrupt a
custom, she had maintained for years, of visiting Mrs.
Clive regularly every evening; and owing probably to
resentment for the supposed neglect, which she could
not bring herself to explain, her reception from that
lady, in the hurried forenoon calls she made at the
expense of her meal hours, was so cold and constrained
that Helen frequently was only successful in concealing
her tears till she reached the street.
As for William-but that name recalled ideas on
which it was dangerous to dwell. Often, while sitting
at her humble task, as some tone of voice, some
favourite passage, one of those somethings or nothings

which are the touches to which the heart vibrates, re-
called his image, a sudden flush would rise into her
face, and her heart would beat with a thick and con-
vulsive motion. Was it possible, she inquired, that
she had wronged him? Had she dwelt too peevishly
on the disclosure of her name? Might not his offence,
if properly sifted and examined, merge into the folly
of a single intoxication ?
Who could tell what were
his motives for declining to follow up the introductions
he had received, and for rejecting the employment that
was offered him? Who could tell that there was not
something even praiseworthy in his conduct; some-
thing, at least, that might excite as much admiration
as displeasure, when viewed as the impulse of a young,
lofty, and generous heart? He was always so good, so
disinterested, so high-minded! His faults were the
faults of temperament—perhaps the peculiarities of
There was nothing selfish in his rashness, no-

Helen,
as the spirit she had thus conjured, rose upon her
*lonely dream, would cover her face with her hands,
and burst into a passion of tears.
“Oh! why did he not write?” she exclaimed on
these occasions; “why, if innocent, did he not repel
the accusation, and upbraid my decision with cruelty,
or at least treat my hasty harshness with scorn? But
can any defence, in such circumstances, be more elo-
quent and at the same time more scornful than silence ?
In him at least the wounds of pride do not bleed
openly, nor would the pangs of disappointed love draw
a single audible sigh from his lips. He is at this
moment I know it-I feel it-struggling manfully
and uprightly, and bravely through that dark, cold,
selfish world into which he has plunged; and I, who
should have gleamed like a lonely beacon on the shore,

whose voice should have risen clear and bright above
the storm-Oh cold, dim, silent lip-eye, and cruel,
cruel heart!”
Mr. Vesper too, this kind and mysterious personage,
who had stolen round her heart like a parent, had his
share in her meditations. He had seen William in
London, but seen him only once, and for an instant.
He was wise, it is true, and good, and liberal-minded,
and compassionate; but was it impossible that he had
been the dupe of circumstances, if not of artifice?
Where was he now? In what strange manner had he
vanished, after loading her, almost forcibly, with the
gifts of a father and a friend, and appearing to wait
only for her consent to carry into effect his arrange-
ments for receiving her into his house and heart as an
adopted child? The dangers and distresses he had
foretold were now around her; and where was she to
seek him in the hour of need? He seemed, in fact,
more like some wandering spirit commissioned to mis-
lead and betray, than the good angel her fancy had
painted him.
From these distressing and perplexing thoughts she
invariably took refuge in the grave of her mother; and
well could she exclaim in the language of Scrip-
ture, “I thank my God for every remembrance of
thee!”
Associated so intimately with all that is holiest in
the human affections, and brightest in the human hopes,
the recollection of her mother, her patient sufferings,
her Christian heroism, her undying love-led her soul
direct to the Fountain of strength and mercy, and when
she rose up from her knees, it was with an assured
heart, and an untroubled eye.
The decline of her school went on with unaccount-
able rapidity, and at length it was reduced to a single
pupil. One day the mother of this solitary scholar, a
neighbour to whose family Helen had rendered some
service in sickness, and at the side of a death-bed, burst

into the room, and demanded her daughter in an alarmed
and angry tone.
“ I have used the freedom,” said Helen, “ to send
her to the Castle with a book.”
They told me so; impudent as you are!” inter-
rupted the mother, “but I could hardly believe them.
Surely the devil should be painted fair, not black!
Not satisfied with disgracing yourself, you must send
my innocent child to your paramour!” The last word
of her exclamation, for which we have substituted the

plained in a single breath the loss of her scholars, the
coldness of her only friend, and the headlong and irre-
trievable ruin into which she was plunged; and for
some moments she sat gazing upon her sudden visitor
with an expression of the most helpless dismay. When
the woman, however, was about to retire in silence,
half-pitying the effect which her coarseness and vehe-
mence had produced, she started up and seized her by
It ex-
the arm.
*Oh! Mrs. Merton," she cried, “ * you do not, you
cannot believe what you have said. You know it is
an invention of malice which I have not deserved; you
feel that however imprudent I may have been according
to the forms of society, I am as innocent of the guilt
and shame you would impute to me as your own sin-
less child! Tell me, is it not so? Confess that
you
have wronged me, that you have been overpowered by
clamour, or deceived by circumstances. Speak! just
one word, one little word, and I will bless you!” The
woman sobbed aloud as she answered-

the first, and I held out to this day. I told them you

it!

dered for a moment.
“No,” said she, with a long deep sigh, "your
daughter shall never enter this door again! She
could do me no good, and seen as I am through the
distorting glass of prejudice, the connexion might do
her some harm.. Better, if it must be so, to drown
silent and motionless than catch gasping at a straw!”
The voice of the little girl that moment was heard
without, and Helen, gently pushing the agitated
mother out of the door, locked herself in; and sitting
down at the deserted table, covered her eyes
hand, and with the other, like the lost ones in Vathek,
pressed her burning heart.
She was slowly awakened from her trance by a rush-
ing noise in the street, and the prancing and pawing
of horses which succeeded, as they were suddenly
checked before her humble porch.
The next moment
a loud and ostentatious knock shook the cottage to its
foundations, and she ran mechanically to the door and
with one
threw it open.
An open carriage, with four horses, and servants in
splendid liveries, stood drawn up in proud array before
her; and Mr. Fisher, leaping down the steps, pulled
off his hat, and bent his head as if in the presence of
a queen.
She walked before him into the room, and
when he had shut the door, turned round, and fixed
upon him a look, so strange, so solemn, that the lover
was struck with involuntary awe, and remained gazing
for some moments in her bloodless face without utter-
ing a word.
Surely you are unwell,” said he at .length, “ or
you are distressed by some sudden tidings of misfor-
tune. Share with me even in your griefs, and it will

be happiness to me! Or, allow me first, my match-
less Helen, to plead for a title which will enable me to
claim your confidence more boldly, and enjoy it with
more full and honest delight.” Helen started, and the
blood rushed in a deluge to her face.
“Yes, Miss Howard,” he continued, once the
slave of your beauty, I am now the convert of your
virtue. i feign no “raptures quaint and tame;' my
heart is too full of the reality of passion to hold the
figments of poetry. I have struggled long and fiercely
with the fiends which haunt the worldly mind, and I
have gained the victory. My pride I cast down at
your feet; my avarice will be only too happy to become
the jailer of your charms; and my towering ambition
I bring in chains before you, that, like the damsels
of old, you may impose upon it what task you
please.
“You see me as I am; I stand before you without dis-
guise-or, rather, you see me ready and anxious to
throw off, with your assistance, the still lingering folds
of education and circumstance, and to appear at length
the being whom even my Helen may love without
remorse. Reject not the task, I beseech you; save
me from myself by making me truly yours; become at
once my friend, my mistress, and my wife!”
At these words Helen sunk into a chair which stood
beside her, her head fell back, and a few sobs of hys-
terical laughter escaped her lips. Mr. Fisher would
have clasped her in his arms in consternation; but,
mastering with a strong effort the weakness of her
sex or constitution, she repelled his hand, and again
stood up.
“I was not prepared for this,” she said; "the con-
tingence never once occurred to my thoughts; you may
guess, therefore, that your declaration has startled,
nay, even stunned me. Very differently occupied was
my mind before you entered; but let that pass now;

although declining humbly and gratefully the share
you offer her in your fame, will never cease to remem-
ber you in her prayers.
Mr. Fisher did not hear the concluding third of this
speech; her answer was couched in her air, her man-
ner, her tone; and so absolute a faith did he place in
her sincerity, that he felt the fate of his proposal to be
decided before the words of rejection had suggested
themselves to her thoughts. A mist swam before his
exes, a knell rung in his ears, and he stood for some
moments, after she had concluded, like a man who has
come forth in his sleep to fright the world with a
walking image of death:
“ Answer me!” he at length exclaimed, almost with
a shout, as he started from his trance;
Answer me,
truly, solemnly, and at once; are you betrothed to an-
other? Does any engagement exist which dictates
your refusal?"
"No."
“ Then there is hope! Give me but time; give me
months--years; put me to the trial; name a task and
a labour; say only that I may
think of
you as the sin-
ner thinks of heaven, and I shall be satisfied. Silence!

Not a word! Dare not destroy my hope! Oh, Helen!
Helen!"
Helen stood in grief and almost consternation at the
violence of his emotion, without the power to utter a
word. The carriage had returned for its master, and
the horses once more struck their proud heels into the
pavement opposite the house. Mr. Fisher seized her
by the arm, and half dragged her to the window.
“ That was for you!” he exclaimed. you
like
the horses, the liveries? Command, and they shall be
changed! Cast your eyes round those fields, those
gardens, those houses, those castle-towers, those dis-
tant hills, they are all yours! Do you like them?
Does the sun shine bravely enough on them—Ha?
But you care not for such things; you spurn alike at
the gifts of man and the mercies of God. Oh! what a
paradise you might render this place! How many
hungry you might feed! how many naked you might
clothel how many orphans you might bring up! But
you do not care for these things. Here you will sit in
your starched pride, rejecting without a motive the
power to do good, and destroying without a pang the
happiness of one who so truly and devotedly loves you!”
Helen wept aloud.
“ Then you will think of it,” he eagerly exclaimed,
“ for a week, a night, an hour; give me but an hour;
do not drive me to desperation!” Helen dried her
tears.
“I dare not, and will not trifle with you,” she re-
plied; .“ I cannot be your wife; and the best evidence
I can give you of my friendship and gratitude is to
rouse you at once from a dream which can never be
realized.”
Mr. Fisher's face grew livid as she spoke, and an
expression which seemed contending between love and
hate crossed his features. No word, however, escaped

rushed into the carriage without turning his head, the
footman bounded up behind, the coachman flourished
his whip over the horses' ears, and the splendid equi-
page swept out of sight like an apparition.
No rest visited Helen's feverish pillow that night.
Even the sleep which crept upon her wearied senses
when the light dawned, was but a change of restless-
The living figures which had haunted her
waking thoughts became spectres in her dreams; and
the real and palpable terrors of her situation, which
had wrestled with the drowsiness of nature, were
resolved, when the latter triumphed, into a dull and
heavy consciousness of misery, that lay like a weight
upon her heart, and hung like a cloud upon her
brain.
When she got up, her head was giddy, and her dry
eyes felt as if they swam in tears, It was necessary,
however, to look her fortune in the face, to consider
seriously the aspect of her affairs, and determine on
what was to be done. To remain at Llanwellyn was
not only disagreeable, but impossible, unless she was
contented to sink into pauperism; and, besides, her
soul was beset with a vague idea of still heavier dan-
ger.
Mr. Fisher's last look was still fixed upon her
eyes, and it contained, she knew not what, of dreadful
meaning, which froze her very heart. Had he reviled
her with open menace, and retreated from the house,
“Rage in his eye, and threats in his adieu,"
she might have pitied the weakness, and despised the
meanness of his passion; but the livid colour which
overspread his face, the baleful glare which shot from
his eye, and the deep and terrible silence which hung
upon his lips, that were of that dull white hue which
sometimes paints the thunder-cloud, startled and
appalled her.
Where else could she betake herself? What other

spot on earth claimed peculiar regard? Should she
set out, like some wandering damsel of the old romance,
and trust her fortunes to accident, and the direction
of her route to the turning of a road, or of straw?
Alas! the woods and wilds of that heretofore world
were less treacherous than the crowded haunts of this,
and the giants and magicians of that brave region of
prodigy, were courteous knights compared to the crea-
tures of flesh and blood whom we now eneounter!
There was an obscure town, called Lambton, about
forty miles distant, where a lady had resided, whom
she recollected her mother had been accustomed to call
a friend. Mrs. Caldwell was a widow, without children,
and possessed some trifling annuity sufficient to pre-
serve an appearance of respectability; she was now, if
alive, well up in years; and her mind had always been
of that serious cast which is usually associated with
ideas of sincerity. The town where a friend of her
mother lived, or even had lived, did not seem to be al-
together a strange place to Helen; and, catching
eagerly at the idea the instant it presented itself, she
determined to remove to Lambton, introduce herself to
Mrs. Caldwell, and endeavour either to obtain the si-
tuation of a governess in a family, or at least to sup-
port herself, however humbly, by undertaking the
tuition of the children of the poor. The interview with
Mrs. Clive, which that lady described to Mr. Vesper,
took place the same day; and when Helen returned
for the last time to her cheerless cottage, the indig-
nation with which she had left the mother of William
melted away in a shower of the bitterest tears she had
ever shed. Her little articles of furniture she pur-
posely dispatched by a chance cart, that no trace of
her route might be discovered; and turning her back
for ever on the house where her mother had died, she
went straight to the churchyard where she was buried.
This circumstance saved her from another interview
with Mr. Fisher. As she turned the corner of the

wall she saw his cabriolet drive furiously down the
street, and stop at the door of the deserted cottage;
and entering thankfully, the “city of the silent," she
determined to remain in that Mecca of her heart till
nightfall, for it was now the afternoon, and then to
walk to a neighbouring village, and take her seat there
in the coach as it passed northward.
The time flew quickly by in prayer and meditation,
and in clearing and setting in order the little quiet
home of her mother; and the shades of night falling
around, began to warn her that the time of departure
approached. On rising up, she saw at a little distance,
in the footway, a female figure enveloped in a cloak;
and, unwilling to interrupt her meditations, she lingered
for some minutes longer. The female, however, did
not move; and Helen, sinking down for the last time,
kissed the cold stone that covered her mother, and,
with a swelling heart and trembling steps, retreated
from the grave.
The supposed mourner, as she ap-
proached, raised the hood of her cloak, and discovered
the features of Mrs. Merton, convulsed by passionate
weeping.
“My dear child,” she exclaimed, in a broken voice,
“I mean my good, my kind young lady, I did not
mean to interrupt you in your sweet and holy farewell!
I have come to warn you against the base bad man
you are flying from. Conceal yourself securely, effec-
tually, or you are lost! You do not know him; your
heart could not imagine what he is. Take the path
through the fields; do not trust yourself in the high-
way, where his spies are by this time posted; and,
above all things, wrap yourself carefully in this poor
cloak, which will shelter you at once from the eyes of
men, and the cold breath of night. I have come, too,'
she continued, “I could not sleep without it, I have
come to ask your pardon on my knees;” and she threw
herself on her knees as she spoke, " for my conduct
this morning.”

Oh, not to a creature!” cried Helen, sinking down
beside her, “not to a creature, my dear Mrs. Merton!
If
you have offended me, I forgive you; and if I have
offended
you, I entreat your forgiveness. But let us
consider—our knees are on the grave; the dead are
lying silent around; and the Lord of life and death is
above us!” Mrs. Merton pressed the monitor's hand to
her heart, and they both remained in that position for
some minutes, with mute but moving lips. They then
rose up, and Helen accepted the cloak in silence. Her
friend kissed her pale forehead, pushed her gently
away, and stood with tearful eyes and uplifted hands,
till the figure of the homeless orphan was lost in the
gathering shades of evening.

CHAPTER XI.
THE BACK GAME,
And though it but a day-dream be,
Yet let it like an odour rise
On all the senses here;
And fall like sleep upon the eyes,
And music on the ear.
BEN JONSON.
Have you never heard that the Nobility were at first cre-
ated, not of persons sent down from Heaven, but of such as
could ascertain their fathers?-SPEECH OF Decius Mus, IN
Livy.
We left William on London Bridge, with a fifty pound
bank-note in his hand, and without a meal, a home, or
a friend; we now, on revisiting him, find him minus
the bank-note, but lodged in a comfortable home, with
abundance of vivres, and surrounded with those inti-
mate associates, denominated friends by the world.
These contradictions are not of rare occurrence; a man
frequently lives more sumptuously on the reputation
of having had money, than on the reality of possessing
it; and we have known a ruined gentleman to be
prouder in his recollected greatness, than he had been

in his real prosperity; Dogberry, we will warrant
you, thought more of his “losses," than of his “two
gowns.
With the quickness of lightning, William traced the
bank-note to its true source: Mr. Vesper; and he even
attempted to persuade himself that he ought to recollect
having seen him slip it between the leaves of the Bible,
on that fatal night, when he parted with his happiness,
and with Helen. The subsequent conduct of this mys-
terious friend, was therefore perfectly susceptible of
explanation. He must doubtless have believed, that
for Helen's sake, if not from a still better motive, the
book was opened long ago, and the treasure found; he
must have been indignant at the folly and dishonesty
which dissipated the little fortune in a week; and he
must have been unutterably disgusted with the mean-
ness of spirit, which chose rather to feed upon his
bounty, till it was exhausted to the dregs, than to
attempt by bold adventure or manly industry, to
achieve independence. His refusal of employment
from Messrs. Dot and Co. by convincing his intended
patron that his indolent and vagabond habits were
irreclaimable, must have heightened to the last degree
his scorn and aversion; while the fact of his having
been turned out of his lodgings, never of course ean-
didly explained, must have hurled him from the "lowest
deep,” in that gentleman's estimation, into a “lower
still.'
In conclusion, the circumstances of this singular
intermeddling with his affairs, convinced him that
though for what purpose he could not divine--he had
been put upon his trial; that during the process he
had been treated with fairness, if not favour; and that
at length, he had been fully condemned with as much
justice, taking everything into consideration, as could
be expected to appear in human decisions.
This was by no means a very comfortable way of
explaining matters; but it was the true one. His

187
course was now to be taken; and as he had the choice
of just two ways of proceeding, there was no risk of
long detention, or much perplexity. He might either
go to Mr. Vesper--for in his search after that gentle-
man, he had discovered the name of his solicitor-
relate candidly the history of his adventure in London,
plead guilty to a little folly, a little vanity, a little
wrong-headedness, but not guilty to the heavier counts
in the indictment, which charged him with indolence,
dissipation, and meanness of spirit; inquire into the
real
purpose for which he had been brought to the bar,
and the competence of the tribunal; and, finally, if a
satisfactory explanation of these things was offered,
demand a new trial.
Or, proud in his innocence, silent in unmerited
wrong, he might throw out his arms, and grapple
again with the slippery world, from the vantage ground
of his bank-note; with a lusty arm and an indomitable
spirit—with a heart that might pant but never fail,
and a foot that might quiver but never slip, he might
rise, fearless and alone, to the summit he aimed at,
though all the voices that confounded the brothers in
the Arabian Nights, should thunder in his ears; and
from that haughty eminence he might address his
mysterious friend or foe-"Lo, here am I whom you
once condemned as a sluggard, a debauchee, and a
dastard !”
Of these two modes of action, one had prudence to
recommend it, and the other spirit; and perhaps, with-
out any additional preponderance, our adventurer would
have chosen the latter. But what an advantage, in
another point of consideration, did it possess over the
more sure, and cautious, and cowardly alternative!
William trembled with delight as he paced to and fro
on London Bridge in the cold eye of the moon.
The
same instinct which impels a woman to admire courage
and love the bold, incites a lover's heart to high and
gallant adventure; and he who finds himself guilty, in

& visit to a mistress, of dismounting from his horse to
open a five-barred gate, should turn back incontinent,
and make for home. Let him betake himself to poli-
tics, or even to war --but love is not his field !
William drew forth the rescued portrait from its
hiding place near his heart, and held it up in the chaste
light, with hands blue and stiff with cold; he then
pressed it with rapture to his pale lips, and to his
cheeks sunken and colourless with hunger, illness, and
long misery, and depositing it between the leaves of
the Bible, with proud eye, erect head, and open chest,
strode loftily away. Brightly, as he walked, the
moon looked down upon the glittering Thames, and
brightly the Thames smiled up again to his mistress
moon; brightly shone the old white towers of St.
Paul's, and brightly their golden cross, the centre and
standard of the Christian city; brightly gleamed the
walls, and glanced the windows of the silent streets;
and brightly shone the face of the solitary adventurer,
as ever and anon he turned up his eyes to the bright
heavens, and blessed the lovely light and Him who
made it.
When day at length arrived, his first care was to
reclaim as many of his articles of dress as were neces-
sary to the genteel appearance of a man worth fifty
pounds; and then to provide himself with lodgings,
not equal indeed to the apparent merits of their tenant,
--but William, by this time, knew something of the
philosophy of London life. He then called on his old
landlady to offer payment of the balance which he sup-
posed to be due; but this woman, who did not eat an
ounce less supper for having defrauded a starving
youth of his last shilling, was shocked at the idea of a
dishonesty which might bring her in troublesome con-
tact with a man like Mr. Vesper; and she therefore
repressed indignantly the suggestion which rose in-
stinctively in her mind, and told the truth-only
altering the date of the transaction a single day.

While surveying, with complacency, the metamor-
phosis in his appearance, she even began to make
overtures touching his return to her maternal care ;
but her eye falling accidentally upon his left hand,
which was neatly wrapped up in a black silk hand-
kerchief, she stopped suddenly short--for our landlady,
be it known, was not only an honest, but a modest and
sensible woman, as times go.
William took leave of her in perfect good humour;
and now, his arrangements for the present being com-
pleted, he set himself seriously and anxiously to
prepare for the future.
Among the thousand schemes which suggested
themselves, he could not find one which suited at the
same time his means and inclination. Either his capi-
tal was too small, or his knowledge too little; one plan
was too mean, and another too ambitious, and a third
too tedious. His acquaintances, whom in the phra-
seology of the world, we have not scrupled to call
friends, were neither numerous nor select; they all
seemed, in fact, to hang with somewhat a loose hold
upon the world, and a prudent man would depend as
little upon their judgment and advice as a poor man
would be likely to benefit by their purse or credit. Of
these gentlemen Mr. Wilkins, the agent, appeared to
be the most business-like person. He was somewhat
eccentric, it is true, in his motions, and somewhat
mysterious in his whereabout; but, as far as William
could learn he was strictly honest in his dealings, ex-
cept just when in the depths of destitution; and he
certainly appeared to possess very considerable know-
ledge of the world, quickness of perception, and
shrewdness of mind. He seemed, in short, the very
man to give a good advice, and take a bad one, and to
manage the affairs of any body else, and mismanage
his own.
The grand difficulty, however, was to find Wilkins,
who flitted about to all appearance like one of those

birds that are said to live and die upon the wing. A.
clergyman, who once wanted him to treat for the purchase
of some manuscript sermons, found him accidentally
at Brixton, working very hard at the tread-mill, for
the purpose of showing an acquaintance how to step
out with least inconvenience; and another gentleman,
from the country, whose business with the agent was
to arrange the exchange of a pointer, having sought
all London in vain, at length stumbled upon him
mending Mr. Paris's pencil in the cage at the top of
St. Paul's. Wigwam, however, who both feared and
disliked him, was accustomed to say that nothing in
the world was easier than to produce him at a moment's
notice ; and one evening, at the Three Puncheons, to
make good his assertion to the company, he burnt
some snuff in the candle, and pronounced his name
three times, when, sure enough, Wilkins bounced into
the room.
Our adventurer contented himself with calling at
two or three places where he knew the agent was
sometimes to be seen; and the same evening, while
musing with a smile as he returned home, on Wigwam's
conjuration, and his face of alarm when he saw its
successful result, he beheld, on entering his apartment,
which he had neglected to lock, a figure standing
before the fire, and gazing upon Helen's portrait,
restored to its frame and its post above the mantel-
piece, the identical figure of the man he sought.
Wilkins was now genteelly, nay, even elegantly
dressed, and became the change as well as Cinderella's
fairy footmen did their novel position behind the
coach.
There was something, however, in his care-wrinkled
forehead, and shrewd, sharp eye, very different from
the common characteristics which bespeak the wearers
to be gentlemen merely by disavowing a relationship
with any thing else; and William, so far from being
unable to discern from his face and air what he was,

(which indicates an ambiguity supposed to be decisive
of the question of gentility,) would have been abso-
lutely at a loss, if the inquiry had been made, to say
what he was not.
“ Your pardon, Mr. Clive," said Wilkins, “I came
here because I knew you wanted me; and finding the
door of
your
chamber
open,
I of course concluded that
the owner, a man who has gone through the horrors
of initiation in London life, could not be many yards
off. I have been detained, however, for fourteen
minutes, and,”-looking at a very handsome watch,

bargain, with or without the fire-irons,) and gazing at
this portrait, the frame of which should not have cost
you more than eleven shillings, although, I dare say,
say, you paid a guinea. You have a pretty talent, a
very pretty talent, Mr. Clive, for such things. I
know a carver and gilder, who thinks of going into
the picture line, and I should be happy to recommend

I mean; I should not be indisposed to treat--really I
am much obliged to you!'
“ Yes, yes, you may rely upon me. A friend of
mine, who does not draw much better than you, makes

“ Just thirteen and ninepence per week, all but a
fraction. But this portrait: it does not look like a
fancy-piece; the nose is a little awry, and there is a
slight twist in the neck, as if the patient laboured
under a distortion of the spine, for which I would re-
commend her mamma to use the straps lately invented
by a gentleman of my acquaintance. Not a fancy-
you.”

“No," said William, somewhat sulkily.
Well, perhaps it is a secret,” continued Wilkins;
“I am sure I ought to know it nevertheless, that face is
as familiar to me as my own. Where I could have seen
it, however-really I never caught my memory tripping
before. And now, sir, what can I do for you?
you have no watch."
“ To be frank with you, Mr. Wilkins,” said William,
who, was by this time almost cured of his false shame,
“although I certainly have money enough to release,
I mean to procure a watch, I wish in the first place to
earn one; and my purpose in desiring to see you was
to ask your advice, as a man of experience, with re-
gard to the quickest and surest mode of doing so. I
have a small sum, a very small sum-say about forty
pounds, of ready cash, beside me; and it has occurred
to me, that even this might be turned to some account,
if I knew how to set about it.”
To be sure it might,” replied the agent, “to be
sure it might! I know a lady who would board you a
whole year for that sum, if introduced by me; toast
and water at dinner included.”
“But the question is, not how long I could exist on
the money, but how to make the pounds breed; you
understand me?”
• Certainly. There is a friend of mine in St. Mary
Axe, who thinks of retiring from the grocery line.
He would ask you fifty pounds for the good will, if
you went yourself, but I could get it for forty; and
he will be glad of a bill for the stock and fixtures.”'
“ That would not be an impossible plan,'' remarked
William, smiling, “if I had only a wife to sit behind
the counter.'
“Oh!” said the agent, “I know several young
ladies
who want husbands very badly. I will engage to suit
you in eight and forty hours; Doctors' Commons busi-
ness included.”
Ha! ha! ha!” laughed William; “but I see you

do not understand me; and in good faith I begin to
think I do not quite understand myself.”!
“I understand you very well,” replied Wilkins;
"you will not stand behind a counter? No. You
will not trudge about town to beg commissions, hat in
hand? No. You will not travel with books published
in numbers, and indecent prints for the boarding
schools? No. You will not hawk bandboxes, or
attend funerals, or auctions, or sell smuggled brandy,
manufactured at Smithfield? No. You have no turn
for the stage, and no knowledge of drugs or surgery?
No, no, no. Very well: there is many a small mer-
chant in the city, who would be happy to allow his
wife, or mistress, to pocket your forty pounds as a
premium for introducing you to his counting-house,
provided you were qualified to manage the business.
You can write? You are master of the various forms
of accounts, as they are kept in London? No! You
have been accustomed to keep books? I'll warrant
me, no-
“Yes, at school."
“" Oh, murder! Then you are a lost man; for you
would not only have to learn, but to unlearn. But
you would tell them in your application, no doubt,
that
you understood Latin, and Greek, and French,

marvellously well pleased at the idea of engaging a
servant, unfit at once by his knowledge and ignorance,
for the duties of the desk. Come, come, confess the
truth; you want your forty pounds to hatch them-
selves.'
No, only to act as a nest-egg:

dear sir!

good soft seat on the woolsack, the archbishoprick of
Canterbury, or the honour of feeling the pulse of
majesty. As it is, the only really useful qualification
you possess is the art of penmanship; for, alas! you
are a gentleman's son, and your destiny, therefore, is
neither in your keeping nor mine. You are as a straw
in the water or on the wind, and must sink or swim as;
wills the gale or the tide." William's countenance
fell as the agent spoke; and, when he had concluded,
he rose hastily up, and took two or three short-paced
uneasy turns through the room.
“Mr. Wilkins," said he at length, stopping sud-
denly before him, “ I am at least different from a straw
in the power
I
possess of throwing myself into what
current or upon what wind I please. At present I am
lying rotting on the bank, listening with a wistful ear
to the leaping of the waters and the rush of the gale:
I want action, were it even strife, and motion, if it be
but downwards. I shall either mount or plunge, and
that instantly; counsel me, therefore, as to my first
essay; if I fail, you will only have lost so much breath;
if I succeed, I pledge myself that your commission will
be handsome."
At the word commission, the agent's hand sought
instinctively his pocket-book; but the next moment,
raising the fore-finger to his deeply marked forehead,
and pondering for some time-
Well,” said he, “at this time to-morrow evening,
you may expect to see me again. There is a gentle-
man of my acquaintance in want of a but I will
not anticipate. Now, I would give something to know
who that girl is with the twisted nose and the de-
formed neck. Good bye, good bye!” and he retired
with his head turned over his shoulder, and his
eyes
fixed upon Helen's portrait. Our adventurer had sunk
into a reverie, when the door again opened, and the
agent pushing in his head inquired-
“ Is her name Vesper?. I mean Ormond?” “ Neither

one nor other,” replied William, in a tone of displea-
sure; and Wilkins disappeared.
Still more uneasy and irregular were William's
paces through the room, when finally left alone.
Forty pounds, it seemed, were not a very large for=
tune; London was not the universal field it had the
credit of being; and a man who would live in a nation
of shopkeepers must absolutely know how to buy and
sell. The art of penmanship was a very good thing,
but it was somewhat common; and as for Greek,
Latin, French, and Italian, these, no doubt, were of
considerable utility to that enviable class of mortals
called school assistants. William, however, was pre-
vented from aspiring to a profession he was so well
qualified for, by a doubt of its being as short a cut to
fame and fortune as he could wish. He had seen in
the newspapers an advertisement for a
complete
classical scholar,” who was offered “full board and
lodging," although without salary, and required only
to find his own washing. Burnet, he feared, was
right; labourers and mechanics were better off than
those who were but gentlemen's sons..
It was yet early in the evening, and he determined
to call
' upon this cold-mannered but kind-hearted friend,
and inquire how he was getting on; but first he un-
locked his golden hoard, and transferred a few pieces
to his pocket. Poor fellow! thought he, it will not

occurred to him of a coin which we had not the
indelicacy to name: it is so uncomfortable to blush in
the light.
For some days past he had been on the look-out for
the reporter, with a similar intention, but this person
had disappeared. The newspaper offices could give
no news of him; the Three Puncheons had been

himself at Burnet's door; and when a strange voice
answered to his knock, his heart quaked with indefinite

to inquire; poor fellow, what has become of him? And
he was moving away with a slight apology, when he
heard his name announced by the portress.
The door of the room was then thrown wide open,
and William almost fancied the picture which presented
itself to be a delusion of his senses. A cheerful fire
blazed in the grate, and a candle, though single, yet
of perfect respectability, burned on the table. A book
and some sheets of inusic at one end, balanced a hand-
soine work-box at the other; and all received a certain

richness from the deep green cover, which was not a
piece of casual baize assuming with tawdry effrontery
the airs of its betters, but a legitimate table-cover, with
yellow border, and a great yellow something in the
middle; the carpet was a plain sober field of brown
cloth, conveying at the same time an idea of snugness,
and suggesting a hint of something richer underneath;
the chairs, although of the common imitation rose-wood
with cane bottoms, looked comfortable and substantial
in stuffed covers with chintz drapery; the two tables
were of solid mahogany, 'made for use as well as sale;
the window-curtains hung on a plain gilded roller, and
matching the chair-covers, descended majestically from
the roof, and overflowed the floor with a look of ease

articles of London household paraphernalia, a chimney
glass, by its ample dimensions, the heavy gilding of
its frame, and the rich glitter of its surface, was cal-
culated to impress the visitor with feelings of unquali-
fied respect.
Mrs. Burnet, with the youngest child in her arms,
was in the act of rising hastily to welcome the visitor
with good old-fashioned warmth. A glow of pleasure,
heightened but not rendered unaimable by the thin
transparent surface of vanity through which it shone,
threw a lustre over her pretty features, which made
her seem almost beautiful; while with her bare head,

Burnet himself, brandishing a flute in one hand,
and a child's doll in the other, was striding with
slippered foot to the door. A genteel undress, at nine
o'clock in the evening, proved that he was not fool
enough to sacrifice a jot of comfort to become the ape
of fashion; and he looked, indeed, in every respect like
a man who was not afraid to romp with his children,

and kiss his wife, and call his morning gown a house-
coat. The apathetic gravity which, but the other
week, had given him so old and withered an appearance,
was metamorphosed into a strong broad shade of manly
sense; and his years, which so lately might have been
reckoned at two score, had dwindled into the short
span of twenty-eight. The child who had let William
in, stood staring at him, with an acquaintance-claiming
look, all the father in her open brow, and all the
mother in her bright blue eyes; while a young girl,
apparently in the capacity of a domestic, was on her
krees on the carpet endeavouring to insinuate into his
night-gown the head of a little naked boy, who dis-
puted with sound lungs and lusty arm her authority.
William's rapid glance had hardly completed its circle,
when his surprise disappeared in an expression of
benevolent delight; and the two friends, gazing on each
other, and each calling to mind, no doubt, as he gazed,
the circumstances of their last meeting, shook hands
two or three times before their feelings subsided to the
speaking point.
Oh, how glad we are to see you!” exclaimed Mrs.
Burnet, unlocking her husband's hand, and presenting

past, and meant to-morrow to make the tour of the
workhouses in search of you; beginning at St.
Olave's.”
William had by no means reached the philosophy of
his friend, and he winced at the ideas his speech sug-
gested. He was beginning therefore to reply to the
politer surmises of the lady, but Burnet interrupted
him.

world that I did not withhold your address from him,
and thus allow you to sink, out of mere goodnature.
I called at your lodgings the day after I concluded he
had been with you, but that amiable landlady of yours
told me you had not seen him. I questioned and
cross-questioned, however-I have a natural turn for
the law-till I wrung out of her that he had paid her
the rent, and that afterwards she had cheated you out
of a shilling-perhaps the last you had in the world—
for handing to you out of the parlour window, that
poor daub you used to scare the flies with above
the mantel-piece. On examining minutely the pre-
mises, I then discovered, you may guess with
what horror, marks of blood upon the window seat;
and I was not long in terrifying the Jezebel into con-
fessing that the casement had come down upon
your hand accidentally. There is your shilling,”
continued Burnet; “ but I have now the business
of her landlord in my hands; and if the rent is
not forthcoming at a day's warning, if it should
be twenty,, years hence, the Lord have mercy on
William smiled at his friend's heat, and, to turn the
conversation, as well as to gratify his curiosity, put
some questions to Burnet about the manner in which his
salvation had been effected.
Burnet's anger melted into a look of complacency
as he replied:
Really, I do not know that there is any thing which
ought to appear very strange or startling in the change
I was brought up to the law, you are aware,
and must have obtained some slight smattering of know-
ledge as I went along. This I have improved by read-
ing, when I had nothing more important to do; and, in
short, these things cannot be hidden for ever; attorneys

“ That is a large salary,” remarked William," for
an inexperienced clerk. But the gentleman of course

cannot say I knew him at all.”
“ But no doubt you took some mode of making
your knowledge and talents known to the profession?
Really, I cannot call to mind that I did.”

more than once; and I never exchanged with him more
than half-a-dozen words in

Who is he, then; what is he?”
“I know nothing at all about the matter."
No reasoning or comparison of notes could throw
the slightest glimmering of light upon the subject, and
they at length gave up the speculation in despair,
after having come to the conclusion that Mr. Vesper
was a very rich, a very benevolent, and a very odd
man.

have just been reading :-
‘Be merry, man! and take not far in mind,
The wavering of this wretched world of sorrow!
To God be humble, to thy friend be kind,
And with thy neighbour gladly lend and borrow:
His chance to-night, it may be thine to-morrow.
Be blithe in heart for any aventure;
For oft with wisdom 't has been said aforrow,
Without gladnesse availis no tresure!!”
The sight of Burnet's happiness had a beneficial
effect on our hero's nerves. That night he slept and
dreamed well; and the next morning he arose to weave
at will the sleepless visions of buoyant, restless, and
high-spirited youth. The boding voice of Wilkins
died
away in his ear, and the suggestions of hope and
vanity rose in their stead. The agent, indeed, did not
appear to be half so clever a fellow as he had
thought him; his experience seemed to have lain ex-
clusively in the mean ways of traffic; and his views of
profit were chained to the snail-creeping pace of a fair
per centum upon capital employed. His process was
entirely mechanical, and appeared to be more suited to
the abilities of a steam-engine than to those of a
gentleman's son. He never dreamed of making allow-
ance either for the inequalities of talent and intellect,
or the thousand circumstances which fill the sails of
adventure. William, in fact, almost regretted that he
had promised to meet him in the evening, from the
fear that some proposal of preposterous vulgarity
awaited him.
In the mean time his position with regard to Mr.
Vesper was not in the slightest degree altered. The
bank-note was changed, and partly spent, the Rubicon
was passed; and the advice still to seek an interview

with the donor which he had received from Burnet,
was both mean-spirited and injudicious. It was now,
also, from the lapse of time, absolutely necessary to
allay his mother's fears by throwing off the mystery he
had hitherto preserved on the subject of his real situa-
tion; and in addition to the other urgent reasons he had
for desiring immediate employment, the recollection of
his late walk on London Bridge swept across him
sometimes like the the icy breath of despair. Upon
the whole, therefore, he waited with a mixture of re-
luctance and expectation for the visit of Wilkins.
The agent made his appearance at the appointed time
to a minute.

you do me the favour,” said he, as he entered
the room, “ to inform me, whether the original of that
portrait resides, or ever did reside at Wells ?”
“I never knew her to reside any where but at
Llanwellyn,” replied William :—“but you, Mr. Wil-
kins, who are a man of business, will excuse my
reminding you that we have met on business.”
“Your business is done,” said the agent; "you are
engaged in the capacity of private secretary to a mem-
ber of parliament."
Upon my word, I am very much obliged to you,
replied William; “but I cannot say that I fancy very
much being engaged in any situation whatever without
having been previously consulted. What is the gentle-
man's name?”
“ Clarence Fisher, Esq.” A momentary shade of
suspicion had crossed William's mind, as the agent
mentioned a description of employment so absolutely
antipodial to the business of barter and sale, as any
thing connected with the House of Commons; but the
name, which he recognised as that of a gentleman of
high influence and fortune in his 'own county, at once
restored his confidence; and the note which Wilkins
presented immediately after, sent a tingle of delight
through his frame.

or Sir,
“ Your name having been mentioned to me
by a mutual friend as that of a gentleman of high
literary attainments, and a periodical writer of emi-
nence, I am desirous of profiting by your abilities in
the manner which will be explained by the bearer. If
you will favour me with your company at breakfast to-

arrangements.

William was unable to speak for some moments, so
thick was the crowd of ideas which demanded words ;
and he had recourse, therefore, to his old expedient of
striding through the room.
• You are debating,” said Wilkins, with a kind of
sneer,
- whether it would not be proper to stultify me
in the eyes of Mr. Fisher, by refusing to ratify the
agreement I have made in your behalf. It is good,
however, to be cautious; who knows whether there is
not a vacancy in the list of ambassadors ? A perio-
dical writer of eminence, and a gentleman of high
literary attainments, should not throw himself away!
Come, come,” continued he, his voice softening, and
a smile almost of benevolence playing on his features,
"you know you are glad of the offer. I can almost
see the beating of that young heart through your
dress; and I can quite see the soaring of your young
imagination in those sparkling eyes. Beat high, noble
heart! Soar loftily, unsullied thoughts! The time
will come soon enough when you shall have forgotten

to tremble to the touch of joy, or mount on the wings
of hope!”
“Mr. Wilkins," said William, taking hold of his
hand, you have read my mind. I am overjoyed at
a circumstance which opens a prospect to me I have
not lately contemplated, except in dreams. Your own
evidence, as well as everything else around me, had
begun to force home upon my mind the conviction that
I was unfit, from my education, and the circumstances
almost of isolation in which I was placed, to enter into
successful rivalry with the crowd that strives and
jostles in this human wilderness.
There now opens to
me a more lofty and more lonely path to the temple of
fortune-a path which will bring me into contact with
the mighty spirits of the time-with the wise, the
noble, and the great; and where the heart of the
climber is strengthened, and his foot steadied by the
excitement of worthy emulation, and the hope of
honourable reward.” The benevolence of the agent's
smile degenerated into ridicule as William went on ;
and when he had concluded, he answered drily-
“Ay, ay, you will meet with members of parliament
enough, I'll warrant you; with many a justice of the
peace, and custos rotulorum, and many a limber-
shanked
young hero from Oxford and Cambridge, who
has been forced away from his Christmas pudding, by
paternal or patronial authority, to worry a fox, or å
goose, ay, or a rat in St. Stephen's, and yelp'yes,'
no,' and bark ‘ya-ya-ya!' at the signal of
the whipper-in of his pack. And then, the emulation
-true; the hack of a party, or of a public man, must
not be nice; he will not stick at trifles in the race
roads dirty or clean, low ruts or no ruts, all's one to
him; a strong stomach, and a willing tit of a con-
science, are the main things. And as for the reward
-why, a hundred a year in the Excise, or the guard-
ship of a long stage, or even a curate's gown, is no
bad exchange for a little dirty ink.” William's heart

beat loudly enough to drown the voice of the agent,
even if his ears had not been engaged in watching the
flight of his imagination, which sung as it soared. A
few of the concluding words, however, caught here and
there, induced him to turn a look of pity and contempt
upon the speaker. A shopkeeper, thought he, a mere
ragman! as Wilkins abruptly took his leave,
“ And left him alone in his glory.”
The next morning, the agent called betimes, and
found William at the toilet, at which he assisted with
the most valet-like assiduity.
“I am sorry you have shaved,” said he, “I could
have done it much better than that. By the bye, the
best way to get your razors, is to purchase a dozen
from a Jew boy in the street. You will get the lot for
ten shillings, and be absolutely sure of finding three or
four of them good, the rest you may sell to your old
clothesman for fourpence a piece. What, a white
cravat to breakfast! By no means; they would take
you for a shopman, calling with your master's bill.
This black silk handkerchief, that brown frock, and
where are your boots ? If you have norie, I will cut
you straps in a twinkling, from the back of your
trowsers, and if you draw them tight, your shoes will
pass well enough for Wellingtons. The white cravat
will do better, pinned as an under waistcoat; there, it
looks pretty and genteel. No watch yet? That will
never do; put money in thy pouch, and we'll buy one
as we go along, or at least a few seals and a ribbon.
Be sure, however, to take a needle and thread with
you, to stitch them to your waistband; I have known
of accidents in my time; and we must remember to
get the ribbon long enough, that you may not be
obliged to pull out your no-watch to seal a letter."

ment,

The fact is I have one-but I have-a-lent it for a

“Oh! up the spout? Well, so much the better;
we'll call and get it. This beaver won't do; give me
some of your hair oil, and I'll make you a new hat.

never knew a single gentleman's landlady who had not
a duplicate key to every door in her house. Proved
the fact in one case myself, by piling up all the glass
and china in the cupboard in such a way that if the
door was opened incautiously—my eye, what a crash!
Heard it when I was half way down the street. Now,
come along, my dear sir; but step circumspectly, or
your straps will go.” Wilkins run on in the same
way during the whole of the walk, exhibiting much of
the shrewdness as well as littleness of a man who lives
by artifice, or, in the common phrase, by his wits.
When they reached Mr. Fisher's house, he nodded
familiarly to the servant who opened the door, and
whispered : “How did you like the stockings, John?" '
and when admitted to the presence of the member of
parliament, his first words were
“ I have brought you the snuff-box, sir, two pounds,
twelve and six; and here is Mr. Clive-Mr. Clive, Mr.
Fisher.” Mr. Fisher was a very gentlemanlike sort
of youngish man, and did not by any means resemble
a senator. He received William with the most polite
affability, and rushed at once into a stream of remarks
on literature and politics, which seemed to be the
sequel of a train of thought which he had been pursu-

tionary, where you meet with meanings and definitions
without being troubled with the process by which these
are arrived at or manufactured. Some of his proposi-
tions, indeed, might have been susceptible of dispute;
but many were self-evident, and many ingenious, and
those which were neither one nor other, were at least
new.
William, who of late had been a constant reader"
of the reviews and magazines, detected occasionally a
striking resemblance between the thoughts and facts
of his intended patron, and those which were the most
fashionable in these floating surfaces of literature; and
indeed the numerous pamphlets scattered about the
room, in covers brown, blue, and
green, gave
additional
token that Mr. Fisher's studies lay a good deal in a
class of reading, perhaps the best calculated that could
be imagined to give an appearance and a polish of
knowledge, to him who has no time, or no inclination
to grapple with the reality.
In politics, William had the pleasure to find that
he could side with his patron without hurt to his con-
science. Mr. Fisher was a patriot; but whether the
patriotism of that day was ministerial or popular,
whether it opposed or advocated Catholic emancipa-
tion, and which side it took on the questions of corn,
taxes, and poaching, we do not know. It is pleasant,
at any rate, to think with a member of parliament,
especially when one is eating his rolls, and drinking
his chocolate; and William rose from breakfast with a
very profound respect for the talents and probity of
Mr. Fisher. This sentiment was greatly increased at
the opening of the main business of the meeting.
“Here," said Mr. Fisher, unlocking a portfolio of
papers, “ here is a sketch by which you will be enabled
to perceive more completely the character of my poli-
tical sentiments. It is a mere sketch, remember, or
rather a series of memoranda for a pamphlet, which I
intended to have written during the last recess. Busi-

ness, however, pursues a public man even to the
country; and so much engrossed have my thoughts
lately been, that I have found it quite impossible to
fill out my idea into a shape fit for publication. Now,
with talents like yours, and study so intense, united
to that sleepless assiduity which characterises the
gentlemen of the press, it has occurred to me, that,
perhaps with little expense of time or labour, you
might be able, under direction of these memoranda, to
supply the details. I may add, that although in the
main point my sentiments shall ever remain unchanged,
yet, I am not so vain as to reject counsel from your
superior experience, or to refuse you permission to
alter or modify the secondary views and general
arrangement of the subject. You need not be at the
trouble of reading the papers here; but when you have
thrown
your own
ideas
upon paper, under direction, as
I have said, of my memoranda, and taken into con-
sideration the form in which the work should be
presented to the world, we shall have another con-
sultation,
“ And now, my dear sir, you need be under no
apprehension that you will be for ever employed in the
capacity of a mere amanuensis. Although I shall
not, at present, be guilty of the vanity of entertaining
publicly a secretary, more especially in the person of
a gentleman so high in the walks of literature as your-
self, yet, in private, you must permit me to treat you
not merely as a secretary, but as a friend. There are
many little things, you must be aware, which would
be but the amusement of an idle hour to one like you,
and which to me are vexatious and overwhelming, on
the same principle that it is the additional straw, after
his full load has been imposed, which breaks the back
of a certain respectable animal, For instance, I am
to preside to-day at a public dinner, and speak on a
subject, flat, stale, and unprofitable to me, but into
which, perhaps, you could contrive to throw something

brilliant and striking. There is a newspaper, in which
you will find an account of the same annual ceremony
for last year, Lord Twaddle in the chair. Everything
will go on in precisely the same form to-day; and, in
fact, without the assistance of a secretary, I believe I
should be obliged to have recourse to the expedient of
an honourable
friend, who files his speeches regularly,
and makes them all serve, year after year, from one
dissolution of parliament to another. Do, my dear sir,
sit down, and set your wits to work, let me out-twaddle

Fisher, “to return to the twenty pounds; all this is
Sanscrit to you; we shall now go into another room
and get over some business more congenial to your
tastes and habits, and leave Mr. Clive to his amuse-
ment.'
When the agent followed the honourable member to
an inner chamber, he threw himself with a jerk upon
a table, and sat eyeing his patron in silence with a
sullen and dogged look, while the latter bolted the
door.
“Read that!” said Mr. Fisher, throwing a letter to
him, with the careless and yet churlish air with which
a beggar tosses a superfluous crust to a dog.
said the patron, when Wilkins had
finished reading, “you -see the hag Caldwell can be of
use yet. All has happened for the best. If I had caught
the fair fugitive, some noise and nonsense might have
taken place; but as it was, her fit of illness, by confining
her to an obscure cottage, concealed her as effectually
from my search as if the gods had changed her into a
tree. Then when she gets up from her bed, what
does she do? Why, she walks direct, as if under the
special guidance of Fatum itself, to Lambton, and
inserts herself between the jaws of the beldame Cald-
well, a pensioner at will on my bounty!"
“ I need hardly ask,” said Wilkins with a sneer,
“what your worship means to do with the girl?”
- You see,

“I mean," replied Mr. Fisher, “to make her either
my mistress or my wife, but she shall have her choice.”'
Wilkins emitted a scornful and incredulous chuckle.
“Why, you outcast cur!” cried the patron, striding
up to him in a fury; “ you pendulum between life and
death! the creature of my sufferance, the wretch over
whose neck the sword of public justice hangs suspended
by my policy, and withheld from falling by my mercy
do you suppose that I would deign to dissemble with
you?"
“ Call me felon," said Wilkins, “and you have said
all. In a moment of drunken desperation I robbed
your father, long, long ago.
The witnesses were few,
only you, and the devil, and one or two more, Well,
I was not afraid of death, for I could die then, although
I cannot now; and yet I sold myself, for a few years
of breath, of toil, of anxiety, of cold, and hunger, and
nakedness, with fits of repletion between; for this I
sold myself; the worst bargain I ever made in my
life!
You see I have not forgotten, I do not affect indepen-
dence, not I; but I have one comfort still; you cannot
hinder me from sneering and chuckling, if you were to
give your blood for it."
Mr. Fisher's fits of rage, to
do them justice, were seldom of long continuance, at
least in their external phenomena, 'and he replied in a
conciliatory, if not friendly tone.
“ You must acknowledge, Wilkins, you sometimes
provoke me to forget myself by your cursed imper-
tinence. As to your having sold yourself, that I
know nothing about; I only know that, in return for
the little services you have occasionally been kind
enough to render me, I have offered you again and
again a handsome situation in a Government office.
If you prefer the vagabond and uncertain life you now
lead to one of comfort and respectability, it surely is
not my fault.”.
" It is touching that situation,” said Wilkins,
* that I have come here to-day; and, with your good

pleasure, we shall discuss the subject before entering
upon any other. That you have made me the offer
you mention, I allow şi and if it was kindly meant, why,
it was kindly done, that is all. Its conditions, how-
ever, were rest and permanence of abode. How could
I rest, with hell in my bosom, and horror at my heels?
I am a good-natured man, Mr. Fisher; a humane,
charitable, kind-hearted man; I have nothing of the
fiend about me, not an inch, and yet I could not rest.
Well! I have hitherto rejected your offers, and con-
tinúed wilfully the vagabond which crime and folly
have made me: but my mind is changed, I now claim
your promise; I demand the debt, if debt it be, to the
uttermost-farthing, and then, perhaps, we may begin
a new score."
“ The debt shall be paid,” said Mr. Fisher, “and
that instantly.??
• But not to me. No, no; I am not such a fool.
Circumstances have not changed with me since yester-
day. I am the same' man, haunted by the same
thoughts, and surrounded by the same destinies. I
cannot rest, not I, with a halter swinging over my
head, swaying to and fro in the gale of events, and
hitting me, every now and then, a knock on the pate
enough to awaken the dead. In a word, bestow the
situation upon that lad who is writing in your break-
fast parlour, and I will acquit you of the debt, and
give you a receipt in full of all demands.” Mr. Fisher
pondered for a minute.
"You have sometimes, Wilkins," said he, "given
me credit for a certain sagacity in ferreting out the
mótives of others from their lurking holes; but, upon
my life, you fairly puzzle me now. Frankly, what
interest have you in the destinies of this young adven-
turer?!?
“ I will tell you," said Wilkins. “ He is, if I am
not grossly mistaken, the natural son of William
Vesper, the brother of the unhappy man whom I was

at least the proximate cause of leading to destruction,
The extraordinary interest taken in his fate by Mr.
Vesper, and the love, which I happen i to know sub-
sisted between the latter and the young man's mother,
convince me of the fact; and I am also aware, that,
owing to some youthful imprudences, the stern father
has now cast off the bastard from his protection.
Well, sir, I know, and from experience, bitterly,
bitterly, that the day will come when the ties of kin-
dred and natural affection, that only seem loosened by
the intervention of the passions, will close--and close
and close-till his heart shall feel choked with the
pressure. I know that Mr. Vesper will raise his head,
were it from even his dying pillow, and bless the man
who could say to him— Behold your son! I befriended
him in your desertion; I took him by the hand when
you cast him away; I saved him from the ruin to
which
you
devoted him!'”
“And what have you to do with all this?” asked Mr.
Fisher; “will you be one of the comforters at William
Vesper's bed-side?”...17
Perhaps not. For aught. I know it may be my
turn first; but if so, I shall at least die with an un-
covered face. It will be some satisfaction, after só
many years of winding, and sneaking, and skulking,
to turn at last to bay. The forgiveness of a good man
will be upon my head, and his blessing in my ears,
and I shall raise up my face boldly among my fellow
men, and cry with a last loud voice-Wilkins is no
more! Ho! I am Richard Watson!and my spirit
shall pass to its account with the satisfaction of having
enjoyed at least one moment's virtuous liberty in a life
of folly, and crime, and bondage.";.,
"You have earned the reward,” said Mr. Fisher,
with perhaps more appearance of coldness than he felt,
"and you may do with it what you
will."
“Give me your promise, then, on paper."
“You doubt my word?”.

“I doubt nothing, and I believe nothing. I am a
man of business; give me your written promise, or you
have given nothing."
Mr. Fisher wrote the promise, and put it into the
agent's hand.
“ And now, sir,” said he, “ since your business is
dispatched, you will condescend, I presume, to attend
to mine. It is my intention, however idiotical a face
you may think it necessary to assume on the occasion,
to marry Miss Howard, who has already, from some
punctilio, which neither you nor I know anything
about, refused my hand. Wilkins,' continued Mr.
Fisher, “I do not know how it is, but this project has
become a part of my soul; it is woven in even with the
dreams of my ambition, and the airy pageants of my
pride. Birth, riches, and political connexion, all these
I already possess; and, in addition to all these, I would
have the most beautiful and the most virtuous wife in
the empire!”
He walked
up
the
room, his face glowing, and his
eyes sparkling, and stood for some moments at the
window, looking into the street. Then turning again
to. Wilkins, with a composed look, and firm, proud
tone
“She lives,” said he, “ in a retired cottage in the
outskirts of Lambton. It shall be your duty, executed
with all gentleness, simply to place her in my chariot
which shall be in waiting. The rest I undertake my-
self. Clive shall accompany us.
Silence! not a word,
not a look! Slave! the saturnalia are past, and I am
master once more! I have felt deeply enough already
the inconvenience of having more tools than are neces-
sary. Clive will be useful; he possesses both talent
and manageability, two rare virtues in their union.
Talk him over; you know how. Promise anything,
everything. To-morrow night, you will be here at ten
to a minute; mark me, sir, both!”
He then left the room, muttering between his teeth,

when he had gained the passage, “ Aye, he will be
useful in more ways than one, he shall earn his col-
lectorship. Watson thinks himself clever; but I did
not pledge myself to time."
The agent slowly made his exit by another way,
muttering between his teeth, “He shall go then; but
to the rendezvous, as he shall think, of mutual and
adventurous love. Once safe in the collectorship, I
shall teach him to foil the villain, if I hang for it.'

“To the Mount! to the Mount!” cried Mr. Vesper, as
he issued from Mrs. Clive's house. "Let me shake
off this dotage of an unripe old age; let me awaken
from a dream, which has fastened upon my heart like
a nightmare. Fie! fie! let me return to the curate

years than a game at battledore and shuttlecock, where
I am myself the empty thing which is tossed about

laughed at by both. A shuttlecock, said I? Why,

and rushing, and tumbling from one end of the stage
to the other, knocking myself and others down, and
shoving in my head where I have no business, only to
receive a slap in the face for my pains.”
Before reaching the inn, however, some pangs almost
of remorse shot through his heart. Is it possible,
thought he, that she can be innocent?
So young, so
fair, so humble, so devout, is it yet possible that she
can have awakened the enmity of the base even by her
unpretending virtues? His heart answered “Yes;"
but his judgment shook the head. Absorbed in reflec-
tion, he strode up the stairs and entered his apartment
without being aware that he was followed by some
one; and, on turning round when he heard the door
shut behind him, he was, for the moment, startled to
find himself alone with a woman whose loose cap, dis-
hevelled hair, and agitated manner indicated, as he
supposed, something not very wide of insanity.
* Judge not,” cried Mrs. Merton, "judge not lest
ye be judged! I know what you have heard, and I
know, from that gloomy eye, what you believe. But
if
you
had seen her as I saw her, if you had heard her
as I heard her, if you had prayed beside her as I did,
with our knees on the
grave, and the dead lying around
us, oh! I am sure that you at least would not cast her
off to a second and bitterer orphanship than she has
yet sustained!”
“My good woman,” said Mr. Vesper, catching
suddenly hold of her arm,
" tell me all, and at once,
or rather tell me only which way
she has gone, for my
heart believes you.'
“She has Aed from a villain, although without
knowing half his villany, and from the malice and un-

one-who were too ignorant and too wicked to under-
stand her. Where she has gone-alas! I can only
point to the west; but money, spirit, and activity, can

Mr. Vesper had sat down exhausted) take a post-chaise,
and drive in the direction towards Lambton; she can-
not have got far, poor thing, alone, and on foot, and
without friends or money to speed her on her way,
Mr. Vesper started up, a hectic glow burning on his
withered cheek.
“I am surely not so old a man,” said he, as if com-
muning with himself, “not so very old! and yet I
feel
my
limbs
grow
and
my
breath fail. What
of that? My heart is still stout and true; I can at
least sit in a post-chaise and direct the pursuit. True,
she cannot be far off, and I shall be able to track her
as we do the moon through clouds, by her halo." He
had reason, however, almost to know, that she was
not at Lambton, and the nearer villages, therefore,
whether in or out of the line of road, were first to be
examined. “Can it be,” thought he," that any mis-
take has occurred ?” and he paused on the
the vehicle, “I will not trust Mrs. Clive's information;
and yet there will be risk in going direct so far as
Lambton. I will write; yes, Mrs. Caldwell, the woman
whose husband I saved froin prison, will be happy to
have an opportunity of returning the service by making
the necessary inquiries, and she can address to me at
the furthest town I shall have to visit in my search.”
The letter was written and dispatched, the journey
commenced, and finished, and towns, villages, and
hamlets visited and explored: the feverish glow yet
burned in Mr. Vesper's cheek, his limbs were weaker
and his breathing more oppressed, and as at length he
tore open Mrs. Caldwell's answer, it was with a quak-
ing heart and and a trembling hand.
“ Honoured sir,” ran the epistle," there is no young
lady of that name in Lambton. Happy should I be
to behold again my benefactor, but I must entreat him
to avoid a neighbourhood, visited at present by the
anger of the Lord, in the shape of typhus The
paper fell from Mr. Vesper's hands, and a loud groan

broke from his lips. The disease, brought on by un-
wonted hurry and agitation of mind, and hitherto con-
trolled by his moral energy, took advantage, like a
skilful foe, of the moment of weakness and confusion,
and he was carried to bed by the servants, and did
not rise again for many days.
Although still weak and bewildered, he was at length
able to stand once more upon his feet, and the first use
he made of his recovered liberty of action was to drive
express to Llanwellyn, to which place he had given
instructions for all his letters to be addressed. Two
of those heart-striking bits of paper awaited him, but
his eye turned sickening away from the masculine
characters in the superscription of both. Helen had
not written! The date of the post-marks, however,
awakened a painful interest; they were some days
old, and he opened them with a vague feeling of alarm.
The first was from Burnet, and ran as follows:
“Dear Sir,-I have acted upon your suggestion,
and I am overjoyed to say, with considerable success.
With the assistance of a Mr. Wigwam, whom I believe
you know, I was able to trace backwards the history
of Wilkins till I found him at Bristol, under his real
name of Watson. I immediately proceeded to that
town, and having ascertained by the files of newspapers
that a vessel sailed for America about the date of
Watson's disappearance, it became my business to dis-
cover the names of the passengers, and as many of
the particulars of their appearance and history as the
lapse of time rendered possible. These inquiries con-
vinced me that if a gentleman who had passed by the

name of Ormond was not the object of my search, he
had not sailed from this port. About Mr. Ormond I
could for some time learn no particulars whatever;
but at length on carefully inspecting the newspapers
of the period, I was led to conjecture that some cir-
cumstances of haste or concealment must have attended
his departure. A trunk was advertised as having been
left behind by him through mistake; and as it was
described as bearing the letter V, you may imagine
that the eagerness of my pursuit was increased ten-
fold. The trunk I found was claimed by a creditor at
Wells; and on proceeding to that town, I learned that
in fact a person whom I had no difficulty in identifying
with the passenger, had at the very time deserted his
family, and fled from his creditors, while the forsaken
wife resumed her maiden name of Howard, and left
the town, no one knew for what quarter. This lady,
I feel convinced, from the coincidence of dates and
other circumstances, was the late Mrs. Howard, of
Llanwellyn, a virtuous and amiable woman, whose
daughter-to whom you may be directed by Mrs. Clive,
you have a better opportunity of interrogating than I.
God grant that Helen Howard may prove to be your
niecel Unless she has failed in a very remarkable
manner in the promise of her youth, she will be an
honour even to you. I cannot help still feeling anxious
on the subject of this singular and interesting search.

If I do not hear from you in a very few days, I shall
conclude that some unforeseen circumstance has oc-
curred to prevent your being in Llanwellyn at the time
you expected, and shall instantly go down myself. It
is contrary I know to the forms of business, but my
wife will not let me close this letter without telling
you I do not know what, for her voice is choked, and
tears are in her eyes. I remain, dear sir, with sincere
respect and gratitude, your obedient servant,
"RICIIARD BURNET."
The effect which this letter produced on the shattered
nerves of Mr. Vesper, may be conceived. He wept
and prayed by turns; sometimes giving way to a burst
of joy and tenderness, and sometimes trembling and
turning pale as the withering thought assailed his
heart, that this perhaps too late discovery might serve
only as a mockery or a chastisement. The other letter
was, if possible, of a still more agitating nature; and
when he had read it, he stood for some time silent and
aghast, while a sense of evil almost amounting to des-
pair, seemed weighing him down to the dust.
“SIR, - Mr. Burnet having communicated to me
the result of his inquiries on the subject of your bro-
ther's family, I hasten to give you this additional piece
of information. You must know that at the village of
Lambton I have a bit of a chit--a little fair-haired
girl—my only child above ground, to whom I have

this poor
managed one way and another, to give a little school-
ing, and clothing, and boarding, and lodging. She
never knew, and never will know, that her father stole
the supplies from his hunger, when he could not wrest
them from the more fatal gripe of his thirst. I am
proud of it now; and God knows I have nothing else
to be proud of; for as to my picking you out of the
stones in Southampton Street, it was a mere impulse
of the moment, such as might have served me on
another occasion to knock a man down. Well, sir,
little creature writes to me once every month,
for I will not take the word of anybody else that she
is alive; and indeed I would have gone to see her
myself, but that, somehow or other it is a humiliating
thing for a father to say it I did not feel comfortable
in the idea of looking my own child in the face. But
to the point. Amidst the chit-chat with which I am
entertained in her letter of to-day, she tells me that
she has gone to a new come schoolmistress, one
Miss Howard,' who is so 'young, and pretty, and
kind, and sorrowful, and so and so. Now, sir,
neither the name nor the description is very common,
and schoolmistresses, you know, migrate sometimes as
well as their scholars. However, if she is not to be
found at Llanwellyn, do not, as you love your life,
lose a moment in proceeding to Lambton. If I am
not mistaken in her individuality, she is there in the

fangs of an old jade, Caldwell, who-although my
innocent child of course knows nothing about the
matter-has for many years past acted an infamous
part in catering for the pleasures of a Mr. Fisher, a
profligate man of rank whose property lies near
Llanwellyn. Where Dick Burnet can be in such
times, I cannot imagine; however, if I do not hear
from you in a day or two, I will myself put my broken
leg on the top of the coach, and go down to Lambton,
The business will be an introduction to my daughter
which I need not blush for; and the spirit of her
mother will no longer walk between us, as I have often
seen it, drawing a circle round her child which I durst
not enter.

When Mr. Vesper recovered from a kind of stupor
into which he was thrown by these letters, he jumped
into a post-chaise with all the activity of five and
twenty, and at ten o'clock the same evening reached
Lambton, All was safe! The name of the young
schoolmistress was known at the inn, and he was
directed to her cottage in the outskirts of the town.
He was weary-nay, faint and exhausted; and
Helen had in all probability retired to bed. Would it
not be better to prepare himself by a night's rest for
the agitating interview; and when the light of a new

day awoke her to intrepid thought and virtuous exertion,
to fling suddenly upon that noble heart the light of
hope and happiness? Restless, yet not uneasy, Mr.
Vesper by degrees forgot his fatigue; he fell into his
old habit of pacing up and down the room, and lost
himself in painful recollections, and delightful antici-
pations. Again he hung in fancy over the death-bed
of his father, and looked round the apartment with a
glance of remembered horror for the spectres conjured
up by the dying man. His breath came thick; he
was surrounded by the shadowy forms that gathered
round the pillow of death; his unhappy brother, the
* forsaken wife, the friendless orphan, all stood palpably
beside him. Then, suffering, rather than impelling,
his thoughts to flow downwards on the current of time,
he found himself sweeping past many a pointed rock
and overhanging precipice, many a dreary flat, and
howling waste in his life's voyage; till arriving sud-
denly within the verge of the present, his dim eyes
glistened with unexpected delight, and his heart
trembled both with fear and joy.
“ Tush!” cried he, striking his unsteady limbs with
the brown cane which he still held in his hand; “I
am not so old as you would persuade me! A walk on
this beautiful night will but compose my mind for sleep.
I will only just look at the cottage that contains her,
and lifting up my hands in that holy moonlight, thank
my God with an unfettered soul for his mercies."
It was indeed a beautiful night. The round moon
stood serene and bright in the heavens; supreme and
alone, for the stars that are her handmaids were lost
in the radiance. The distant hills, the stirless trees,
the lake distinguished by its deeper black and more
dazzling white, the crowd of human habitations, with
their lights and shadows, still, solemn, breathless,
impressed the spectator with a feeling of admiration
exalted, and yet tranquillized by awe: he could not
even have prayed aloud. On passing the opening of

a green lane, at the westward end of the town, Mr.
Vesper observed, half hidden in the shade, an object
which startled him at first merely by its incongruity
with the scene.
It was a handsome travelling chariot.
The postillion, dismounted, was leaning, apparently
asleep on the neck of one of his horses, and three
figures, concealed in the shade, sat motionless in the
interior. When Mr. Vesper had passed, his heart
began to beat thick, and a feeling of indefinite alarm
took possession of his mind. He pressed eagerly on,
however, to the cottage described to him, which stood
close by, and, striking the wall with his hand-
“We part no more!” exclaimed he aloud, though
in an under tone, “ in life and in death I am with
you!” Everything was silent within, and the little
windows in front were completely dark. He stole
softly round to the back of the house, where he found,
to his inexpressible relief, by the light issuing through
the chinks of the window-shutters, that Helen had not
yet retired to bed. He could even see into the inte-
rior; and he debated with himself whether he should
not tap at the window and warn her of the supposed
danger.
Helen was seated at the table, where lay some old
papers and a closed book. She leaned her head upon
her hand, looking downwards as if perusing some
paper before her, and Mr. Vesper was struck with
pity and alarm at the excessive paleness of her face,
which exhibited all the tokens of recent illness, while
her cheeks wet with tears denoted present grief. The
next moment her bosom rose with a convulsive throb,
but was arrested midway by strong resolution; and
she sat for some time like one of those beautiful crea-
tions of genius, in which the art of the sculptor seems
to seize and petrify an emotion or a passion, like tor-
rents, frozen in their fall. Slowly, almost impercep-
tibly, at length her bosom fell, and the unseen witness
imagined that he heard a low long sigh accompany

THE GAME OF LIFE,
the action; she then pushed gently away with one
hand the paper on which she had been gazing, and
rested the other on the book which lay beside her.
The paper thus placed within the scope of his
observation, Mr. Vesper could not avoid discovering
to be a china-ink portrait of William Clive, which she
had once shown him with her other drawings. They
had exchanged these memorials, it seems, in very
early youth. “God help my holy child !” said Mr.
Vesper, a tear starting to his eye, and a smile hover-
ing on his lip, “my poor Helen is a woman still!”
From a feeling of delicacy he retired from the win-
dow; and unwilling, if it could be avoided with safety,
to break in upon her solitude at such a moment, he
determined once more to examine the object which
had given him so much alarm,
If the carriage was still stationary, he might have
time to run to the nearest houses and rouse the in-
mates, although this in fact appeared to him to be
proper only as a precautionary measure against a barely
possible danger. The carriage was still stationary,
but not so the travellers, for Mr. Vesper, as he crept
along the shady side of the road, was very near plung-
ing into their presence.
“Mr. Fisher,” remarked one of them, “ should wait
no longer;" and Mr. Vesper, at once terrified by the
name and heart-struck by the voice, which awakened
a terrible suspicion, stood rooted to the spot. The
speaker was apparently a young man, of a tall and
elegant figure. He leant against a tree with folded
arms, and his face, concealed from Mr. Vesper, was
raised towards the moon. The next moment he turned
his head with a sigh, and discovered the features of
William Clive! Mr. Vesper quickly averted his eyes,
and recoiled as one would from some loathsome and
deadly snake.
Scarcely had he regained his post at the back win-
dow to give the alarm to Helen, and then defend with

his life if necessary the entrance, when he heard a loud
knocking at the door. Helen, he could see, started
up in terror and surprise; her first motion was to run
to the door, but she was arrested by a storm of
blows upon the shutter from Mr. Vesper. The knock-
ing was then renewed with greater violence, and an-
swered instantaneously by the window-shutter, which
Mr. Vesper, missing the bolt in his agony, in vain en-
deavoured to tear open. The affrighted girl looked
from one side to another, as the noise assailed her
ears, in the most helpless perplexity; and at length,
the slight fastenings of the door giving way, a man
burst into the apartment.
“I mean you no harm,” said Wilkins, “none, on
my life! and I know a man in the village who will
mend your
door for a mere trifle."
“What is your pleasure, sir?” inquired Helen in
a firm and dignified tone, as she recovered her presence
of mind.
Nay,” said Wilkins, “it is no pleasure of mine,
I
guess
from your situation and circumstances that it
can only be some passing caprice which has made you
refuse Mr. Fisher, and so, a ride in his carriage, which
waits in the lane, can do no harm. It is his whim,
and must be complied with; but if you fear violence,
I pledge myself solemnly that I will myself remain be-
hind the carriage to protect you." He seized her
hand as he spoke, and looked for the first time full in
her face.
“I will rather,” said Helen, after a moment's de-
liberation, “I will rather trust myself to the ruffian
master than his ruffian hireling. Inform your employer,
that before his strange invitation can be accepted, it
must be delivered by himself in person.”
Wilkins continued staring at her for some moments
after she had spoken, and then pressing his hand upon
his forehead, like one in pain.
". It is strange,” said he, as if unconscious of the

presence of another, “it is strange how events comé
round! What have I to do with this family? I re-
quired them not, I sought them not; and yet, go where
I will, they confront me like a witness, or lie in wait
for me like a snare. I ruined the father, and through
him I beggared and murdered the grandfather; and
now, in the third generation, the same destiny throws
me in perhaps fatal contact with the last living descen-
dant! Destiny!—idle, mischievous word! I feel at
this moment that my own soul is the master of my

juring one hair of her head! Clive," continued he,
as he went out, “behold the original of the portrait !"
and William rushed into the room.
Helen
sprang from a chair, on which she had sunk,
and ran with a rapid and unsteady step to meet him;
but, stopping abruptly in the middle of the floor, she
fixed a gaze of surprise and apprehension on his face.
William seemed at first so crushed and confounded by
her appearance, that he looked as if about to sink into
the earth, and when she approached him, he staggered
back like one whose path is crossed by a spectre; but
regaining almost instantaneously his firmness, he ad-
vanced, and said in a steady voice, but with a white
and trembling lip; "I came here, madam, prepared to
act my part in a comedy, but as I perceive we are alone,
there can be no need for such mummery. I am ready
to attend you to the carriage. At these words Helen
threw back her head aghast, and the colour fled from
her face; but the next moment, her eye lightened, her
cheek burned, her form seemed to rise and distend, and
she cast a look of withering disdain upon
her lover.
“ What in the name of God," cried he, “ does this
mean? Is it possible" and he rushed forward, and
seizing both her hands, looked into her scornful eyes
with a gaze that seemed to search for her very soul.
" It means,” cried Mr. Vesper, dashing the case-
ment to pieces with one vigorous blow, "it means that

you are a villain and a traitor; the hireling of a ravisher;
the meanest, and vilest, and most abject of the human
race!” Helen had turned her head at the interrup-
tion; but when she looked again for William's answer
to the accusing witness, he had vanished.
A scuffle was heard at the door, where Wilkins ap-
peared to have been listening; and as this was followed
by the hurried sound of their retreating steps, an ex-
clamation from the agent fell like a knell upon her ear.
"They are both armed, by --!"
She staggered some steps towards the door; but
her feet, as if transfixed to the ground, seemed to re-
fuse to bear her further; she threw back her long
tresses, bent forward her head, and listened with the
intensity of one whose whole faculties of soul and sense
were concentrated in her hearing. By degrees her
weak frame began to tremble, till at length the very
apartment was shaken by the fierceness of her agita-
tion; her repressed breath rose moaningly from her
bosom in spite of her struggles to withold it, and as
two shots were fired almost simultaneously without,
she fell without a start or scream, upon the floor.
When Helen recovered her senses, she found herself
sitting on the floor, supported by Mr. Vesper, who
knelt by her side. She cast her eyes feebly yet wildly
round the room, and the moment they had rested on
the face of her lover, who lay covered with blood upon
the carpet, she broke from her uncle's arms, and, for-
getful of time, place, sex-of everything which chains
the soul to the formalities of society threw herself on
her knees beside him, pressed his cold hand to her
throbbing bosom, kissed passionately his frozen lips,
and called upon his name with all the frantic tender-
ness of a woman who loves, and who despairs. After
the first moments of agitation were over, she assumed
the part of a doctress and a nurse; and when she had
washed away the blood and chafed his temples, the
wounded man opened his eyes.

At this moment a tumultuous sound of voices and
footsteps was heard without, and immediately after
Burnet entered the cottage with his hand twisted in
the neckcloth of Mr. Fisher, and followed by Wigwam,
hopping on one leg, and lovingly arm in arm with
Wilkins, whom he threatened with he hammer end of
a broken crutch.
“ Look ye, sir," said Wilkins, shaking of his guard
with one effort, and stepping up to Mr. Vesper, “that
young lady is your niece! I ask no further testimony,
and I can give none, than her very extraordinary re-
semblance to her mother, who is now a saint in heaven.
This information you should have had from me long
before now, had I not been ignorant of the fact myself.
I dared not venture for the purpose of making inquiries,
into a quarter, where my first step would have been
upon
the scaffold. My hopes and fears are now over;
I will be a slave no longer; I cheerfully exchange my
worthless and wretched life for one hour of freedom.
You, sir, are a justice of the peace: I charge this man
with a conspiracy against the liberty and honour of
Helen Vesper, lately called Helen Howard, and I offer
myself, having a guilty knowledge of the offence, as
king's evidence. Now villain, do your worst; I am
Richard Watson!”
“Rebellious slave," muttered Mr. Fisher; “I
will make you writhe for this! A word with you,
Wilkins."
"Watson, sir, Watson, Watson; Richard's himself
again!” shouted the self-delivered.
“ You are to take notice, sir,” remarked Mr. Ves-
per, who knew something of the unfortunate man's
story, " that I cannot act as a justice of the peace in
this county. I have heard your charge simply as a
friend; and, as a friend, I would advise, if relieved
from my fears for the life of this young man—to
whom I begin to perceive I have done gross injus-
tice"

“My dear sir,” said William faintly, “have no
fears for me. Agitation, it is true, and loss of blood,
hopes, dreams, memories—all gushing upon me at
once, have half drowned me; but I shall recover, you
may depend upon it, and that speedily--provided I am
well nursed," and he looked tenderly into Helen's face,
who in stooping to adjust his pillow, at once hid her
blushes and gave him assurance of her care.
“Mr. Vesper is right,” said Burnet, "compounding
a felony, to be sure, is bad in law; but, hang it, there
are some offences which we must try by the spirit, not
the letter of British justice. Come, Mr. Fisher, you
have to go before your constituents in a few months,
and a candidate at a popular election should take care
of what he is about!” The legislator pondered for
some moments.
“If Mr. Watson's conscience," said he, “has tor-
mented him, I do not see why it should be charged to

far from accepting his services, as perhaps he will
insinuate, in return for my forbearance, it was only
yesterday I presented to Mr. Clive, at his request, a
very handsome government situation. However, I am
ready to give ease to the poor man's mind in any way
that may be proposed. As for my conduct in the
present instance, as I am not now before my consti-
tuents, I do not feel myself called upon to explain ;
and Mr. Clive, I believe, will allow that he owes his
hurt to no other cause than his own impetuosity.
Miss Howard,” he continued, turning to her, “will
perceive that I have laboured under a misapprehen-
sion, caused by an assurance she gave me on a former
occasion, which now appears to have originated in
some self-delusion. Perhaps my condolence with her
on a circumstance so detrimental to her interest would
not at present be acceptable; and as the good com-
pany will doubtless feel more at their ease in my
absence, I shall have the honour of wishing all a

graceful obeisance to the young lady, and a condescend-
ing bow to the rest collectively, walked composedly
out of the room. Watson hardly waited for the con-
clusion of this speech before he threw up his hat, and
danced about the floor like a child.

and now at length we shall get back to backgammon

which my history has been crowded since I left the
Mount, I cannot choose but marvel at the wisdom of
God and the folly of man. Justly, indeed, did you
accuse me of presumption in placing myself as a pro-
vidence over these two young people; and by many a

bitter and contumelious token have I learned what is
my proper place in the scale of creation. In vain did
I put in play the common instruments with which a
man seeks to obtain and preserve an influence over
his fellows: wealth would not buy, power would not
control, advice would not prevail. In vain I stretched
forth my hand, its grasp was on empty air; in vain I
lifted up my voice, its sound was as the sound of a voice
crying in the barren wilderness. I exercised kind-
ness, and my benefits were scattered on the wind; I
endeavoured to be just, and my judgment was turned
into perversity; I strove to be merciful, and my mercy
was poured upon the head of its object like a vial of
cursing and wrath; I ran to and fro, like a man walk-
ing in his sleep, whose contact with his fellows must
be either vain or hurtful; I lay down, as if oppressed
with the nightmare, which presented to my desperate
eyes events of interest and doom, while with chained
limbs and stifled voice I writhed and struggled unob-
served.
"But, imagine me for a moment possessed of the
power I coveted! I shudder at the idea. Had I
been stone-blind, as justice, the most clear-sighted of
all the moral attributes, is absurdly represented to be
by the poets, I might hope that, deterred from action,
by doubt and timidity, I might at least have done
little harm; but, with distorted optics, surrounded

with illusions, reasoning upon falso appearances, and
building determinations upon shadows, I can only
render thanks to God that my efforts were as ineffec-
tive as my judgment was erroneous.
"I have at length heard tidings of my brother's
family; nay, the heroine of my little romance, is her-
self my neice. The coincidence is remarkable, and
not the less so that from the first moment in which
our eyes met, I found myself attracted to her, as if
by some magic charm! But, drop your eyebrows,
my old friend. In a world of mystery like this, there
would be nothing very strange, even in the discovery
of some nicer instincts than have as yet been demon-
strated by the moral anatomist; although in the pre-
sent case it is unnecessary to dive further into the
constitution of the mind, than we have already ex-
plored. The attraction was nothing more than a
resemblance to my dead brother, so exquisitely sof-
tened by the peculiarities of sex, and so delicately
blended with the more intellectual traits of the mother,
as to be invisible, till pointed out. At this moment,
I can hardly conceive how it could have escaped me
so long; everything is his except the expression.
“To understand thoroughly the character of this
young creature it is necessary to be acquainted with
her history. At present, however, I may just remark
that she exemplifies in a very powerful manner the

vast responsibility that rests upon a parent, and,
above all, a mother. Not so much the child as the
companion of that admirable woman from the very
dawn of intellect, her soul seems to have imbibed its
nourishment, and to have received its form and cha-
racter from her mother by a process as natural as that
which transfused the stream of life into her veins with-
out impoverishing the parent source. The remarkable
circumstance, to a stranger, would be, that the moral
resemblance continued to exist, and even to improve,
after the original had been removed for ever from her
eyes; that the intervention of the world, the collision
of other spirits and other opinions, the very growth
and development of the rebellious instincts of nature,
should not have warped her youthful mind from its
original forn, and stamped a new impress upon her
faculties.
“The explanation is, that her mother's precepts,
or rather the gradual influence she exerted, had no
reference to time but as a stepping place to eternity.
She wandered, it is true, through the world, dreeing
her weird,' like a participator in the first sin, and an
inheritor of its punishment; she wept and smiled, and
joyed and sorrowed, and hoped, and trembled, and
loved: but, although scorning not the portion that had
been thus meted out to her, although no more at-
tempting to extirpate the human instincts of her mind

than the cravings of the senses which watch over the
preservation of the principle of mortal life; although
conceding all due importance to the things of the world,
and feeling, with perhaps more than due intensity, all
the sweetness and bitterness of her woman's heart, she
knew that these were rather to be thankfully accepted,
or patiently endured, than shunned or cherished; that
they were nothing more than the flowers and weeds
shedding their poison or their perfume by the way-side,
where she journeyed,
- A pilgrim Zion-ward.'
Thus, even while walking hand in hand on this earth,
the speculations of the mother and daughter were ex-
tended beyond the narrow horizon of mortal views,
and their communings were like those of spirits as well
ås women; and thus, when the grave closed over the
former, the soul that cannot die seemed to remain as
usual to advise, to comfort, and sustain, and Helen in
the midst of the tears she shed for her earthly parent,
rejoiced in her continued intercourse with her immortal
friend.
“ So intimate is the union between the human and
divine affections in our mysterious nature, that I have
always observed the former to be strongest in those
breasts when the latter are most triumphant. As
conviction of her lover's unworthiness gathered thicker

in Helen's mind, I could see the glow of young life
withering on her cheek and dying in her eye. What
was the nature of her solitary meditations I cannot
tell—how strongly she hoped, how darkly she despaired;
but at length when she saw him lying pale, bleeding,
and deathlike at her feet, the human feelings had their
revenge. She saw him only as the being her fancy
had painted, when she admired without shame, and
loved without remorse; the interval of separation dis-
appeared from her memory; the doubts and fears that
had brooded like thunder-clouds over her head, were
swept away by the strong breath of passion; the very
delicacies and proprieties of sex and circumstance va-
nished from her eyes, and she threw herself upon
her
knees, and clasped him in her arms in an agony of
love, sorrow, and despair.
“Even her dismay, when returning recollection had
shown her on what a precipice she stood, was mingled
with a trusting tenderness. She seemed to exclaim to
herself: "Ohl no, he is not base! He is still rash,
and thoughtless, but high-minded, generous, and brave.
Who knows that the other calumnies which have
blackened his name are not equally unfounded?' The
instinct of her heart was true, the avowals and expla-
nations of his associates clearly proved his freedom
from any of the deeper moral guilt we had imputed to
him; and, although by no means absolved from the

charge of gross imprudence, he stood before us after
passing through the seven times heated furnace of the
metropolis, the same manly, upright, and single-
hearted young man who had won the affections of
Helen, and given over his own.
“ This letter will be delivered to you by Mr. Richard
Watson, a person, who, through a life of error and
trouble, seems to have preserved at bottom a kindly
heart. He is a man of considerable ability and much
knowledge of the common business of the world. It
is my wish that he should in the mean time be employed
as an assistant by the land-steward, with the view of
his taking the place of that respectable old man when
the increasing infirmities of age compel him to retire.

deared by the exchange of the social charities to my
niece. Inquire carefully into the actual circumstances
of the poor of the village and neighbourhood. I dis-
approve, generally speaking, of the unsustained bounty
which one day spreads a feast, and the next permits
a famine; but, nevertheless, I am determined that, on
the approaching festival of love and gratitude, the
whole neighbourhood shall rejoice with me, and more
especially that unhappy part of it who have few joys
of their own. In the mean time, my valued friend,

to do and to say; I shall demand my revenge for the

ostentation, could not find in his heart to stop it. The
party dismounted at the door, in the midst of the ac-
clamations of a crowd assembled to receive them.
Their first greetings were directed to their old friend
and benefactor, but the next moment the most eager
curiosity was manifested to discover his niece.
It happened that as the travellers passed through
the lines of gazers, the shawl of a paralytic old woman
was dislodged by one of their elbows, and fell from her
shoulders. One of the ladies immediately stopped to
adjust it, and as she pinned it carefully round the
trembling neck it had left bare, her own veil, left at
freedom, was blown from her face, and floated back
upon the wind.
" It is she-it Miss Howard. God bless her!
God bless her!” rung from the crowd, as the resem.
blance, both moral and physical, struck their imagina-
tion. As for William he was at once recognised by
the look of passionate admiration with which he
followed his mistress.
"Mother,'' he whispered, as they entered the door,
“why don't you say, God bless her?”
“ God bless her, then, my son!” replied Mrs. Clive;
“God bless her!” Wigwam closed the procession,
supported on one side by a crutch, and on the other by
his daughter, his heart swelling with all a father's love
and pride.
“ I say, Mr. Wil-Watson,” said he, poking the
agent on the back, as the shout arose,
think that was for my daughter?” Mrs. Burnet was
criticised as being too pretty and too natural for a
“ London lady;" but her kindness of manner, and the

devout regard with which she seemed to look up in her
husband's face made some amends.
The ladies, fatigued with their journey, and looking
forward to the greater fatigue of a wedding“We will
not say how near -retired early from the dinner table.
It was William who opened the door for them, and he
looked as if well repaid for his politeness by a stolen
glance from Helen, as she passed with trembling step
and tingling cheeks, from his presence-and, gentle
reader, from ours.
What was said at that table-how close the seem-
ingly ill-assorted company drew to each other in the
human sympathies—what after-dinner speeches were
made—what healths were drank-how gladly even the
reporter joined the ladies in the drawing-room-how
long and happy was the evening—how well Helen
redeemed the musical boast she had made to Mr.
Vesper—and whether the curate thought once of
backgammon during the whole time—are questions
that we leave to kindly hearts and glowing imagina-
tions.

SCENE I.-THE INN PARLOUR.
It is a very good thing, on a cold, dark, and stormy
night, on dismounting from a stage-coach, where you
have been sitting so long, that your mind has had
time to get as cramped and crabbed as your limbs, to
find yourself suddenly transferred to the parlour of the
village inn.
It is a very good thing too—nay,.some-
times a most excellent thing—in the midst of reflections
that imitate passing well the coldness and darkness of
a winter's night, or in the still more dreary vacuity of
mind which besets us now and then, like a calm at sea
in the middle of an important voyage, to find yourself,
in obedience to the spell thrown round you by another's
imagination, carried instantaneously from the local
habitation of your present misery, even into a scene
like this. The room is small, and yet dispropor-

tionately large for the house. A clear coal fire
illumines every corner of it, and displays to full advan-
tage, in their tarnished gilt frames and cracked glasses,
the courtly belles and famous generals of another age.
The white sand grits beneath your feet, and by a kind
of contradiction to one acquainted with the luxury of a
carpet, implies a nicety of cleanliness. The waiter is
just retiring with the memorials of a comfortable re-
past, leaving in their stead, with the necessary accom-
paniments, a crystal measure of respectable magnitude,
filled with a dark-coloured liquid, whose rich and heavy
perfume proclaims it to be the favourite of stage-coach
travellers—brandy. He has shut the door. Now,
who have we here?
Two young men, apparently belonging to the gen-
teeler order of society, are the only guests. They are
both what is usually termed fine-looking young men;
that is to say, they are reasonably tall and well-pro-
portioned, and in their countenances the bloom of
youth and health is still untarnished by the cares of
this work-day world. They are about the same age,
too; but one of them has the advantage of the other
in a certain delicacy, partly of complexion, partly of
expression, which, without diminishing the manliness
of his face, gives it that appearance on which ladies
look with complacency, and lovers with distrust. It
is to accident that these young men, formerly school-
fellows and early friends, are indebted for their present
meeting. Accident, do we say?--well, let it pass :
one word is as good as another; the fate of empires
has depended on circumstances apparently as trivial..
Although school-fellows, however, and early asso-
ciates, it did not seem to be altogether with unmixed
pleasure that they found themselves thus suddenly
thrown into one another's way, compelled by the rules
of society and of stage-coach travelling to pass the
evening in an interchange, if not of sentiments, at
least of conversational civilities: and yet this was not

betrayed at the moment of meeting, nor for some time
after, but seemed to grow, as it were, out of passing
circumstances, while a kind of reserve, which each
seemed ashamed of acknowledging, but which appeared
to increase every instant, threw an awkwardness over
the tête-à-tête, which might have been amusing to a
third party.
When the first warmth of greeting was over, and
the “ How are you?” and “How have you been?”?
were all proposed and answered, when the badness of
the roads and weather was fully discussed, and the
goodness of the late dinner (or early supper) fully
done justice to, when the cloth was removed, and the
glasses arranged, the table drawn nearer to the fire,
the waiter gone, and the door shut, when the two
friends found themselves alone, as if fairly placed for
a regular set-to at friendly chat, a pause ensued.
A few mouthfuls of the potent mixture were swallow-
ed in a silence which would not have seemed remarkable
to a looker-on, and yet to their conscious imaginations
was attended by a feeling of awkwardness and em-
barrassment. Their chairs were drawn nearer the fire,
and then pushed farther away; the tongs and the
poker were displaced without the slightest provocation,
and then re-instated with no more show of justice; the
geography of the table was disturbed, and a new ba-
lance of power created among the bottles and glasses,
while sundry clearings of the throat and smackings of
the lips came forward with additional testimony, if
any
more could have been wanted, that the silence was not
owing to the parties' disinclination to talk, or to their
having nothing to say, but simply to their having
something to do.
Brandy, however, will open the most stubborn lips,
and what is better, it will soften the most obdurate
hearts. Their constraint gradually wore off, and was
succeeded by a pause of meditation. They thought,
perhaps, of the days when their meetings were in con-

fidence and affection-of that school-boy time, which,
however embittered, while it flows, by its juvenile
cares and distresses, when contrasted with the gigantic
miseries of the world, seems so quiet and so beautiful,
and of the beginning of the succeeding era, that event-
ful and important period which gives the tone and
direction of our lives—that Chapter I. of the story
from which an experienced observer may gather the
outline of the plot, and foresee the form of the catas-
trophe, when they walked boldly together into the
crowd, and struggled side by side amidst “ the shock
of men,”
Their hearts were softened, their brows grew
smoother, their lips relaxed from the fixed horizontal
position they had taken, and looking kindly at each
other, they drew their chairs closer, and began almost
at the same instant to talk of their early friendship,
and call
up
for their mutual amusement, by the magic
of memory, the ghosts of the things and feelings that
had perished during its progress. you
remember
this ?” and “Have you forgotten so and so ?” were
bandied in quick time between them; while brief
epitaphs on the dead, and satires or eulogiums on the
living, were added as appendices, or thrust in as mar-
ginal notes to each chronicle of the days of yore.
Then the light laugh went round, but hardly inter-
rupting the stream of the story, which only forced its
way with more noise, but scarcely less rapidity; and
the as frequent sigh stole in with its chastening piano
effect, while both seemed to relish anew of the fresh-
ness of school-boy hearts. One anecdote and one
year succeeded another in chronological order, and the
glasses in their ebb and flow kept pace by sympathy;
and thus the historians unconsciously found themselves
within the circle of what belongs to the present, while
the bottle was fast wending in an opposite direction,
where it would soon have to be numbered among the
things that were. But they were both too much

heated by talking and drinking, to be aware as yet
that danger was near, till at length the headlong
stream of their mutual history brought them close
upon a point at which they must separate, or where
their meeting must be with a shock and a struggle.
Henry, the name by which we shall designate the
better looking of the two young men, was the first to
pause. He looked at the table, and at the ominous
appearance of the bottle, then put his hand to his hot
forehead, and then leant back in his chair without
speaking. But the other, whom we shall call William,
with flashing eyes and heightened colour, took up the
reminiscenes where his friend had laid them down.
“ It was there, you know,” said he,“ that we met for
the first time with-
“Yes, yes,” said Henry, while a flush of the deep-
est crimson overspread his face, “with Miss Stanley."
“With Emily Stanley;" added William.
Henry noticed the familiarity by a look; but imme-
diately recollecting himself, endeavoured gradually to
turn the conversation to some other occurrence of the
memorable evening they talked of, yet he could not
help saying, when the dancing came in question-
“ I danced with her almost the whole night.”
“And I,” said William, in a low voice, but with
fierceness, “ I went home with her-in the dark!”
The philosopher, at this point of the story, throws
down the book with contempt. Why so ? These two
young men may be considered the representatives of
the human race during one of the most important
periods of life; and during that period, the passion, at
whose existence in their breasts we have just hinted,
has ruled the destinies of mankind, from Adam down-
wards. There is a disposition on the part of story-
tellers to exaggerate its power, and multiply its effects;
with them it is an awful and mysterious influencema
superstition of the heart, which we can neither escape
from nor defy; its empire, they say, extends from the

cradle to the grave: it is like a stone thrown into the
smooth waters of a lake, though its first plunge only
be attended with strife and tumult, yet its circles
widen in continual succession; in vain they are dis-
turbed, retarded, broken, shattered, by the rock or the
weed, or the withered bránch--circumstances acting
and acted upon in the life of a lake--still they press
onwards in slow but constant, certain though irregular
progression, till in their magical ring they comprehend
the whole surface. Philosophers, on the other hand,
the sworn foes to fiction, puff away with their rude
breath the cloud of words, words, words, in which it
is enveloped ; they pierce into the very heart of its
mystery, and with laughter and derision, exhibit to
the world its form and substance. It is, say they, a
feather, a bubble, a gossamer, a shadow. Be it so:
but the meaning of the philosophers is as empty as the
words of the novelists. The wool shorn from the back
of a sheep, or the web spun from the entrails of an
obscene worm, and ornamented with little strips of
the skin of a wild beast, becomes a princely robe, and
receives homage, almost amounting to worship, as one
of the insignia of imperial power. A thing is ren-
dered important or otherwise by the effects in produces
in the world, not by the intrinsic nature of the thing
itself. Love may be one of those paltry deceits which
owe their strength, their very existence to man's
weakness; but it does not the less certainly exist on
that account, nor does it act the less formidably on the
character and destinies of men.
What we have related of the conversation may serve
as hints for a colloquy, which the judicious reader
may carry on, if he pleases, in his own imagination,
to the great saving of pens, ink, paper, and auctorial
trouble. Let him take care, however, that it wax
warmer and warmer by degrees; let sarcasm, insinu-
ation, ridicule, prove by their ill-timed and unnatural
jocularity, the earnestness of passion ; and through

these, let flashes occasionally of the inward fire burst
with a short but vivid illumination, to turn the thin
coverings of the crater into burning lava. The words
grew stronger, and the voices louder; their eyes
flashed, and their cheeks burned; glass after glass of
the treacherous beverage before them was swallowed
unconsciously, and added fuel to the fire. The
original cause of their dispute was at length almost
lost sight of, or only dimly seen through the fumes
of intoxication; they knew nothing, felt nothing
distinctly, but that the presence of the other was
like a mysterious weight, from the oppression of which
each would have gladly been delivered; and attended
by a sense of wrong, of grievous, intolerable wrong,
but without definite shape or tangible substance.
During the first hour of drinking, the hardness and
coldness and hypocrisy of society is worn off, and the
better part of man's nature presents itself; every-
thing that is generous or noble or beautiful in feeling
and sentiment comes into view; the very honey of our
secret cells, which we have gathered in our passage
through the flowers and weeds of the world, or in
which we were borne by the decree of heaven. But
this stratum is in turn removed, and the deeper the
poison sinks, the blacker is its track, till the foulness
and baseness of
"That naked sepulchre-the human heart,"
is revealed in all its deformity; we see in their native
mine the materials of all the bad passions ready to be
drawn out, and hewn into engines of destruction: we
come to the bottom of the mystery: the original sin
of humanity.
At the juncture at which the story has arrived, a
glass was swept from the table, either in the warmth of
action, or from unsteadiness of hand, and as it crashed
upon the floor, the door was instantaneously opened,

without, rushed into the room, with expectation and

some minutes, leaning both elbows on the table, his
face buried in his hands; but suddenly he rose up,
paced backwards and forwards across the room with a
quick and irregular step, then stopped in agitation,

sciously approached; stopped again, hesitated, return-

SCENE II.---THE GARDEN,
THE “ fresh air,” although not mentioned in the
Pharmacopoeia of the physicians, is a very excellent
medicine both for mind and body; it is exhibited by
the lungs, and through the pores of the skin. The
fresh earth is no less powerful in its medicinal effects :
it operates in the same manner as the quack—we beg
pardon—the patent medicine, which is said to cure a
disease, indigenous in Scotland, by smelling. The
fresh sea is perhaps the most powerful of all the
natural restoratives; and it may be used either by
immersion, or simply by turning the eyes for a reason-
able space on its invigorating waters. But obstinate
indeed must that disease be, moral or physical, which
resists a recipe made up of all three : air, earth, and
ocean.
The unsteady step of the young man who had first
sought the laboratory of nature for relief, his agitated
manner, the motion of his arms, the broken sounds from
his hot lips, which fell like curses, whatever might have
been their peculiar intonation, served to prove that his
was no common malady, such as might be puffed away
by a single breath from the cold heavens. The night
was dark and gusty; the moon was in her first week,
and gleamed in the sullen sky like a single lamp in
some vaulted cathedral, The garden which he tra-

It was
versed with quick and irregular steps, owed more to
nature than to man; for the former had given it a,
bold romantic site, and the latter only a few parallel
rows of potherbs and gooseberry bushes; and yet the
very awkwardness of its simplicity seemed to add to
the effect of its wild dignity of situation.
bounded on both sides by a hedge, not high enough to
intercept the view, which on one hand was met abruptly
by an impassable range of mountains, austere and rug-
ged even in the day-time, but in this dim hour covered
with tenfold darkness and mystery; and on the other,
after wandering over a track of smooth and sloping
pasture grounds, was carried over the broad and black
bosom of the ocean, until lost in the distance, or
stopped prematurely by the clouds of night. At the
end, about two hundred yards from the house, was a
line of broad and fantastically shaped rocks, forming
a kind of natural wall, which rose only a few feet
above the level of the garden, but on the outer side
descended to a considerable depth, its foundations
being in an inlet of the sea.
It was on these rocks that William now stood,
baring his feverish bosom to the wind that came in
cold and sullen gusts from the ocean, gazing alternately
on the earth and the heavens; now on the gloomy and
mysterious mountains on the left, whose fantastic out-
line was sometimes exhibited for an instant, as the
thin moon burst into momentary freedom from the
clouds that environed her; and then on those bare and
sloping hills on the right, hardly diversified with a
single tree, and that strange interminable expanse
beyond, which an inexperienced eye might have fancied
at this moment to be asleep, hushed by the night-
breeze, like a babe by the song of its nurse, but whose
real commotion was indicated, to one accustomed to
its phenomena, by the white specks on its bosom,
which gleamed dimly near the land, and the roar of
its far and viewless billows, which answered and min-

gled with the other voices of the night. It was a
kind of natural instinct that prompted the spectator
to attempt to drive out or to stifle the evil passions
which raged within him, by the introduction of a
mightier stimulus, caught from the forms and motions
and sounds of nature, to bare his very soul to the cold
sky, and feel its mortal denizens swept out, like pesti-
lential vapours from the lanes and alleys of a city by
the strong breath of heaven, to say to the night, which
was around, and above, and beneath him, let me fly
from myself into thy bosom,-
“Let me be
Companion of thy fierce and far delight,
A portion of the tempest and of thee!”
And yet it would have required no common effort
to
repress the thoughts which now warred in his bosom.
In vain the philosopher may reason, and the poet may
dream: there is something in the breast of both, which
gives the lie to their pride and their romance. Man's
feelings are fitted too well to the heart they inhabit ;
hunger was never appeased by the influence of the
scene in which it pined: the famishing wretch would
raise up his eyes amidst the beauty and grandeur of
nature, and curse the sea, and the earth, and the sky.
Yet this is only a misery of the body. The lighter
passions may be soothed, nay cured, by the influences
of nature, just as a slight degree of thirst or hunger;
the passions of the senses, may be forgotten in the
contemplation of a grand or beautiful prospect; but
there is a power in the stronger tyrants of the breast,
to convert everything to their own use, and turn their
very medicine into food. This fact was felt by William
at the moment; for in place of being himself in the
hurry, of nature, the gusts and the sounds of night,
the agitation of the clouds above and of the waves
below, the blackness of the mountains and the sea,

all seemed to enter into his heart, and mingle with,
and heighten his feelings.
There was more working in that heart than the
common exasperation of rivalship, heightened by par-
tial intoxication. His love was not one of those passing
fancies which are felt by every young man at a certain
age; and though looked on by himself with a ludi.
crous gravity of interest, is the scorn of every body else,
and of himself in after life. But it is sufficient to
“hint'' !_we have neither room nor patience for any-
thing more-that many circumstances had occurred
to deepen an impression received in boyhood. His
love for Miss Stanley had “ grown with his growth,
and strengthened with his strength ;” it had been
carried along with the development of his faculties,
and the formation of his character; it had a part in
his
very vices and defects, and lived in the fierceness
and strength of his mind, which time had gathered
around it, like an insect in the midst of a rock. He
had learnt that night, from the manner and insinu-
ations of his rival, enough, as he thought, with the
natural exaggeration of passion, to break that rock
into a thousand pieces. But it was not in his charac-
ter to sink readily into the apathy of despair; he
struggled with fierceness against the suggestions of
reason, and grappled with the hopes that were one by
one taking their flight, and which he knew must
finally be suffered to depart, as if for the mere excit-
ation of the strife.
At this unpropitious moment, Henry ascended the
rude steps of the rock, and the rivals stood face to face
on the summit. Their conversation could not here be
overheard, as it had been in the inn-parlour ; but in a
few minutes their voices grew louder, even than the
voices of the night; and a female servant of the house,
who from the first had been concealed by the hedge,
probably on some love-assignation, burst from her
hiding place with a scream. She could not hear the

cause or subject of their dissension; only one word
met her ear distinctly. “ Liar!” cried one of them,
and at the instant they grappled, as she afterwards
expressed it, like mastiffs, at one another's throats.
She neither saw nor heard anything further, but ran
to the house screaming for assistance.

SCENE III.-THE PRISON.
WERE you ever in a prison? The gentleman reader
perhaps answers, that he once sojourned for a few weeks
-possibly months—in the King's Bench, and asserts,
with the most elegant oath, that he would not desire
better fun; while the lady who does us the honour of
glancing at our pages through a quizzing-glass, gets
up a becoming shudder as the question brings to her
recollection some jumbled associations of donjon-keeps
and cells of the Inquisition, and declares that although
she never had the pleasure of being in a real prison,
yet the scene is as familiar to her as an opera box, or
a pew at St. George's. Neither the lady nor the
gentleman (begging
the pardon of each) knows any-
thing about the matter. This is no question of archi-
tecture. The lightest Grecian or the heaviest Gothic
has here the same effect; we care not whether its
arches be circular or pointed, whether its pillars stand
frowning in the naked severity of the Tuscan, or
smiling in the maidenly slightness and elegance of the
Corinthian proportions, it is still a prison. It is
the temple of guilt, where human sacrifices are con-
tinually offered up, sometimes to the vengeance of
outraged nature, and sometimes to the hellish Moloch
of human institution : law. There is a moral atmos-
phere about it, in the chillness of which the cold

damps that hang upon the walls of its sunless passages
and airless cells have no part. Bring a savage direct
from one of the most distant and unknown isles of the
Indian ocean; place him suddenly within the threshold
we have just now entered, and he will feel that he is
in a prison before he has learnt to pronounce the name.
The mind has its senses as well as the body, and the
same savage, who would be delighted with the perfume
of the rose, although to him an unknown flower, would
be shocked unconsciously by the deadly exhalations
from this moral charnel-house.
A female figure, of the most feminine and delicate
proportions, has entered before us; she is alone.
Her cheek is pale, but her manner and motions are
calm and collected; she has inquired for some person,
and the turnkey is conducting her to the cell. Her
dress is of white muslin; a shawl-handkerchief of some
light colour is tied loosely about her neck, and a white
veil hangs over a white satin bonnet. It is strange
that the very colour of her habiliments should attract
us so strongly; but here it seems to be so much out of
keeping, so inconsistent with the genius of the place:
one would think the visitors of a prison should be
dressed in black!
She has reached her destination, and the turnkey
unlocks the door of the condemned cell. Here, for
the first time, she pauses, a shudder runs through her
frame, and her cheek becomes even paler than it was:
but this weakness is not of long duration: not a tinge
of colour, indeed, revisits her countenance, but she
raises up her attenuated figure, which appeared for
an instant to have shrunk, as it were into itself; her
step regains its elasticity; her eye, the deep tran-
quillity of female devotedness, and she glides with a
soft but steady pace into the cell.
The prisoner, who was reclining on a pallet, raised
hinself on his elbow at this unwonted apparition, seen
with a shadowy indistinctness through the gloom of

the dungeon; an expression of surprise and incredulity
wandered over his features, and he passed his hand
across his eyes as if to drive away some phantom of
the imagination. In another moment, however, a flash
of joyful conviction lighted up his eyes, and he stretched
out his arms to receive her; but this was instantane.
ously succeeded by a start of terrible recollection, and
he threw himself down on his hard bed, and buried
his face in the pillow. His visitor sat down on a low
stool by the bedside, and bent over him with the cau-
tion and tenderness of a mother at the couch of her
sick child. After a few smothered soba, a few con-
vulsive heavings of his chest, it seemed that the efforts
of manly pride had subdued the rebellious movements
of nature, and the prisoner lay as mute and motionless
as the dead.
There is something at once repulsive and affecting
in this violent exhibition of suffering and weakness in
a man; and the female, during its continuance, hung
over him with as much horror as pity in her expression.
But when it was ended, she felt among the rustling
straw for his hand, and with a gentle force undid its
cold and rigid clasp, and twined her slender fingers
round his ; then bending down her head to his face,
whispered with a low and earnest sweetness, Henry
-it is--your own Emily!”
The trial had taken place only the day before, which,
in its result, had numbered Henry with the dead.
While his fate had been uncertain, Emily forbore to
visit him : indeed, to have done so, mixed up as her
name had been with the proceedings, in its connection
with the quarrel in the inn, would have required a
species of nerve which she did not possess. Besides,
it never once occurred to her that the trial would have
ended as it did: her fancy represented him as the tem-
porary victim of an unjust persecution, which, in its
result would only have the effect of restoring him to his
friends and to society, with a name brightened rather

than blackened by the fiery ordeal through which it had
passed. But when all was over; when he had been
publicly and solemnly arraigned at the bar of his
country, on a charge the foulest and the darkest in the
catalogue of human crimes; when, after a minute and
dispassionate investigation, he had been found guilty
of murder; committed, not in the temporary insanity
of passion, but some time after the dispute which had
roused the demon within him had taken place, after
the forbearance of his rival had afforded him an interval
of solitary reflection, and when he had been condemned
by the law of God as well as of man, to expiate the
crime by an ignominious death-what then? Why,
then the shackles of society were broken in twain; and
as the nicest modesty will not avert her eyes from the
death-bed even of a lover, so Emily thought her fame
could sustain no injury from her seeking Henry even
in his solitary cell, to gleam boside him for a season,
like a taper in the glooin of his dungeon.
But, a murderer? Yes; it is a vulgar saying, but
a true one, and as deep as it is true, that love is blind.
It makes no nice distinctions; it does not cavil about
appearances, or realities.
We would liken it to that
ring on your finger, which many a long year ago you
prized at something more than life, and which now you
prize at scarcely anything less. It was a gift-a token
--valued in its association with the giver, or the cir-
cumstances under which it was given. Time rolled
on; its lustre became dim; its pearls have now dropped
out one by one, and its original beauty has vanished
like a dream: yet you still value it for itself, and your
eye alone is unable to detect its deformity. Just such
is the love of woman: that precious trinket of the
female heart. No matter what has introduced it,
whether
Accident, blind contact, or the strong
Necessity of loving--"

there it lives and grows; years roll on, and bring with
them grief and folly and crime, to blacken and distort
it; but the image of her lonely worship, though to a
dispassionate eye divested of every charm, is to her
the same. Emily, in fact, never asked the question
of her heart; singular though it may appear, it had
never once occurred to her to inquire whether it was
possible that Henry could be a murderer. We know
not whether the beautiful lines of a contemporary poet
suggested themselves to her recollection, while she sat
by the straw pallet of her lover, but it is certain that
she at least felt, if she did not say--
“I know not, I ask not, what guilt's in thine heart,
I but know I must love thee, whatever thou art.”

SCENE IV.--AT SEA.
THERE is not one of the occurrences that befall us in
our passage through this world, which operates so
variously on the human character as a calm at sea.
It is a touchstone which the closest cannot escape, and
which the least observant cannot fail to use with
succes.
Just put on your seven-league boots, and step
out with us a few dozen of miles into the German
ocean, and we will place an example before you in the
twinkling of an eye.
Above our heads there is a whole
sea of lead-coloured clouds, cut out into the form
of waves ; although their silent motionless appear-
ance, and unnatural uniformity of figure, rather
give us the idea of a picture of the sea than of the
sea itself.
Among the items of our property scenery, you will
not fail to remark “ the sun behind a cloud,” for he
has more influence on the general effect than one would
think; and like the grand Signior in his curtained
recess at an audience of ambassadors; or like the
unseen prompter at a play, with his bell, book, and
candle, gives the cue to the whole. You will detect

him by that light round spot, in a direction inclining
towards the west, and shaded so delicately at its
edges, that it is impossible to say with precision where
are its liniits.
Below, there is another expanse of sky still more
mellowed, and quite as motionless ; indeed, it has all
the effect of sky to the sight, for looking towards it,
even at the distance of only a few feet, we find it im-
possible to catch the palpable surface of the water, but ·
are carried downwards to a fathomless extent, till we
reach the shadowy heaven beneath.
There is no land in sight, not a rock nor tree-
nothing that can remind us of grosser elements than
air and water; a cloud, indeed, of a darker hue than
the others, but scarcely more substantial in appearance,
is resting, in one direction, on the very verge of the
horizon, and this, the pilot with his mysterious, and
to us apocryphal, science, would perhaps pronounce
to be some point or foreland of terra firma. In our
eye, however, it is nothing better than a Cape Fly-
away.
A small cutter lies studded in the midst of this
mighty sky of water, which seems for the moment
as if created for the sole purpose of supporting the di-
minutive sea-planet on its bosom. Standing, as if from
habit, near the useless helm, there is a middle-aged
man in the dress of a common sailor; his frame is
rather muscular than large, and seems to derive its
appearance of strength more from the fitness of its
proportions than from the quantity of material. The
lines of his face are strongly marked, and the features
good, if not handsome; but a coarseness, although not
that of vulgarity, pervades the whole, and an expression
of keenness and cunning, so deeply marked as to be
totally distinct from that tinge of them which is ob-
servable, if you come not too close, in almost every
sea-faring man, (arising from his habit of peering per-
petually through his contracted, crow-footed eyelids,

265
rather than look the wind full in the teeth), gives a
sinister appearance
bis swarthy countenance, which,
in conjunction with a certain air of ferocity, excites
mistrust not unaccompanied by fear. The calm of
nature does not seem to have sunk into this man's
soul. His quick eye glances from heaven to earth,
from earth to heaven;'' and his muscular arm is ever
and anon applied with a sudden and impatient jerk to
the helm; he looks occasionally towards the quarter
of Cape Fly-away, with an expression both of fear
and longing, and then, with a sweeping, yet detailed
glance, as he whirls round on his heel, takes in the
whole sea-ward horizon. He seems to be out of his
element in a calm: and the idea occurs to us for the
mind is naturally fond of contrast--that in the
presence
of real danger, in a storm or in a battle, this unquiet
spirit would be as hushed, and collected and relentless,
as it is now tumultuous and impatient.
A large, lazy, good-humoured looking man, is lying
at full length on his back in the forecastle, gazing
right up into the sky, but not so much for the purpose
of observation, as because it is the object he can look
at in his present position with the least inconvenience.
He seems to be one accustomed to take the world rough
and smooth as it runs; and, indeed, if he had any
choice, to be rather disposed to choose the calm than
the tempest, although his weather-beaten face does not
appear too well acquainted with the luxury of looking
up to heaven from a smooth sea.
A third individual is sitting on a coil of ropes, resting
his elbow on the gunwale, and looking at the expanse
of water with a vacant listlessness of expression, which,
at a casual glance might be taken for the indication of
habitual indolence of mind. He, too, is dressed as
a common sailor; but this is one of the most difficult
characters to support in the whole range of the drama
of human life. The least observant spectator could
not fail to discover, in an instant, that he is only a

masquerade sailor. One leg hangs over the other, its
toe pointing to the deck in the identical angle inculcated
by the most approving dancing-masters, and his cheek
reclines on the bend of the fore and middle finger of
the right hand, and is supported by the thumb, in a
position that would make a portrait-painter's digitals
itch to see it. And yet there is no restraint about his
attitude; he seems to have fallen into it from a habit
contracted in genteel life---on shore.
You must now see two strongly-built rough amphi-
bious looking creatures crawling up the companion-
ladder: it is impossible to tell, from their appearance,
whether the land or the sea has the honour of claiming
them for its own; but it is certain that at present they
form part of the complement of hands, singularly great
for so small a vessel,
At the sound of their footsteps, the good-humoured
looking commodity we have described as burthening
the forecastle with his ample premises, after protruding
a tremendous yawn, gathered himself up and lounged
•"* abaft the binnacle." “How now, my messmates,”
quoth he, “ gone to sleep with the wind? De me
if I have heard a human voice these two hours. For
myself, I am as melancholy as an oyster on a sunny
rock, and as dry too, for the matter o’that; but where's
the use of taking it so to heart? Come, come, let us
have a can of grog to keep out the blue devils, and
I'll give you a catch that shall wake the ocean.'
The
man at the helm, who appeared to be the captain of
this ill-ordered crew, only answered with a gesture of
impatience; but the two nondescripts who had come up
from the cabin suffered an expression of complacency
to steal over their hard features, and wiped their lips
with the back of their hands, in a manner that seemed
to imply a ready acquiescence with so reasonable a
proposal.
A can of grog did accordingly make its appear-
ance, under the superintendence of the mover, and

soon after certain dissonant sounds were heard boom-
ing along the deep-
“Which, unto ears as rugged, seemed a song."
In the mean time the sham sailor kept aloof, amus-
ing himself with his own fancies and scarcely seeming
to be aware of the interruption which the stillness of
the hour had sustained, till the rosy president of the
orgies of Neptune, taking compassion on his loneliness,
after a shrewd wink to his messmates, stole slily behind
him, and let his hand fall on his shoulder with a slap
that would have gone nigh to have foundered an ox,
and which was attended by the desired effect, a start
on the part of the saluted, and a hoarse laugh from the
rest of the crew.
“ Holloa ! young chap,” cried he,' at the same
instant, “what the devil's the matter with you?
Mayhap you don't like my song because there is no
love and nonsense in it, just as you turn up your nose
at our sea-grog because it has no sugar; but come,
my boy, if you will only look up like a man and
drink like a sailor, I'll show you that I have
warefor all dealers. What! I was not always on
the water."
“ You are too much on shore, Jack," said the
captain; "it has almost spoiled you for a sailor; but
come,” said he, falling into the vein of his mate for
the nonce, we have not yet had the news you picked
up yesterday at -
• That's true, by
-!” said Jack, “ if the devil
had spoken it. But this dull weather puts the best
thoughts out of one's head;" and then rummaging
hastily through his pockets, he pulled out a mass of
dirty and crumpled papers, purporting to be new
ballads, and horrid murders, and dying speeches: a
kind of commodity which he seldom visited the shore
without laying in an ample stock of. After some

minutes spent in selection, he pitched upon a true-love
ditty, which he gave out in the true style of a nautical
ballad-singer, who has seldom more tunes to his lyrics
than a barn-player has scenes to his tragedies. To
diversify the entertainment, he then proposed to read
a full and particular account of a trial for murder,
which had been the result of a quarrel between
two young men about their sweetheart, one Miss
Emily
“What—what's that you say?” interrupted the
stranger, appearing to listen for the first time. “Nay,
niy, hands off, brother!” said the sailor; “if you wish
to hear it, you must take it as it comes; and, to ac-
commodate you, I'll begin at the beginning. He
then read the report of a trial which developed the
story we have so far related in the preceding scenes,
but with an addition which, as veracious historians, we
declined making use of, although it would have added
greatly to the melo-dramatic interest of the scene; viz.
that the rivals had fought on the rock; and that Wil-
liam, who was the most intoxicated, had been dashed
over the precipice into the sea.
The witnesses examined for the prosecution, were
the waiter at the inn, who described the quarrel in the
parlour, and the agitated manner of the intended as-
sassin before he wrought his mind up to the resolution
of following his victim into the garden; and the servant
girl, who had heard their loud voices on the rock,
and actually saw the commencement of the fatal
struggle.
A host of others proved their going out into the
garden at the cries of the last witness, the prisoner's
walking hastily past them into the house, and instantly
ordering a post-chaise, and the total disappearance of
William from that moment.
The usual plea of "Not Guilty" was put in by the
prisoner, but he called no witness except as to cha-
racter. He did not blame, he said, the laws of his

country, or the men who administered them. He felt
himself to be the victim of circumstances, a solitary
but terrible example of the weakness of human wisdom,
and the imperfection of human institutions. His only
consolation was derived from the absolute conviction
he felt, that a long time would not elapse before, in
the common course of events, his innocence would be
demonstrated; when his family, bowed down to the dust
by his untimely and ignominious fate, would raise up
their heads once more in society, and when she -- Here
his manner became unsteady, and his mind appeared
wandering, as if carried away by the current of his
ideas from the rigid proprieties of time and place: some
person compassionately touched his arm, and with a
start of recollection, he instantaneouly gathered around
him, like a mantle, the pride and firmness and coldness
which so often hide a broken spirit, even from the
sympathies of mankind; he bowed calmly to the court,
and stood silent and collected while his sentence was
passed.
The proof, it seemed, had been enough for the
jury. The corpus delicti, indeed, had not been
found, but the circumstantial evidence was complete,
the prisoner was found guilty, and ordered for execu-
tion on a day which fell to be the one after the time
of the present scene.
To such intensity were the stranger's feelings wrought
up by this narrative, that to the uninformed eyes of
the sailors, he seemed to feel nothing at all. Long
after it was concluded, and a new one begun, he sat
staring into the reader's face, without uttering a word
or altering a muscle, till at length roused from his
stupor by a burst of laughter from that rude audience,
at some stroke of congenial humour in the piece, he
started up, and rushed rather than walked to the fore
part of the vessel. The measureless expanse of sky
and ocean was around and above him, and yet he
seemed to have no room to think; he gasped for breath

in the midst of the pure and boundless air, like one
who pines in the exhausted closeness of a dungeon.
It is probable that he himself was scarcely conscious
at this moment of the thoughts which rushed through
his breast, like the confused and hurrying masses of
cloud in a stormy sky; for at intervals he would start
and shiver, as if some lightning of the mind revealed
with a sudden glare their blackness and horror. At
least, we hold it to be rather for the honour of human
nature to throw a veil over the struggle between
the good and evil feelings which now took place in his
breast.
But of what use are his wishes or intentions, be they
good or bad, in his present situation? Far from the
land, in a dead calm, and surrounded by ruffians,
accustomed in the course of their unlawful trade, to
look even on murder without shrinking.. Were it even
in his power to command seeming impossibilities,
is his resolution taken? It is. He darts towards the
convivial
group; he makes a proposal to them, which
they receive with shouts of laughter; he redoubles
his efforts; there is a vehemence in his harangue, a
wild eloquence of despair, which persuades more
than his lavish promises or ridiculous threats. They
ship the long oars, with which small smugglers are
usually provided, and the vessel at least moves in the
coastward direction; but the futility of their exertions
in this way, which his fancy had exaggerated into a
certain means of success, is soon apparent, even to
the landsman. He is restless, feverish, almost insane.
He becomes superstitious in his despair, and actually
whistles for a breeze!
Is his call answered? What sweeping blackness
is that which appears in the far verge of the seaward
horizon? The
very heavens seem to have caught the
impulse, and the clouds begin to move and mingle
like billows of the ocean. The blackness approaches,
ruffling the face of the waters as it goes; and at

length, as a strong breath of wind reaches his burning
forehead, he sinks on his knees on the deck. The
smuggling captain swears a terrible oath, as he finds
himself once more in his element:—“Hurrah, beauty!"
cries Jack, as the vessel bends forward beneath the
breeze.

SCENE V.--THE DROP SCENE,
It wants more than an hour of mid-day, and yet
the sun seems as fierce as if he had reached his
utmost height. The road is perfectly dry, and covered
with a fine dust, the very appearance of which
might suffice to give the traveller a feeling of suf-
focation, although there is not a breath of wind to
raise it to his parched lips. The ditch, by the side
of the foot-way, formerly filled with stagnant water,
covered with a rich green cream, is totally drank up;
where be the frogs and the tadpoles that were wont to
sport in its congenial wave? There is only a clotted
slimy mass at the bottom, into the substance of
which we do not wish to pry too curiously. The
grass and weeds by its sides are scarcely recognizable
in their dull yellow dress, even to that forlorn ass,
who applies his nose successively to each discoloured
knot, and then shaking his slouched ears, turns away
in disappointment and disgust. The heaps of grey
stones that attract our attention by their precise ma-
thematical figure, are mute, and the hammer and
hammerer absent; the parched fields are deserted;
the stage coaches have ceased to fly, and the fly-vans
to crawl; the foot-traveller, perchance, is wiping his
brow in the shady rear of some cottage inn: at least,

he is not here: the sun is alone in the heavens, and
we on the earth.
A light cloud, far off in the line of road, has been
for some time in sight, and we can now perceive that
it is moving towards us. As it comes nearer, some-
thing black may be distinguished in the midst, and
the cloud changes to a line of dust, streaming in the
rear like the smoke from the funnel of a steam-ship,
although in colour rather resembling the volume emit-
ted from the safety-valve. At length, as it gains the
summit of yonder eminence, the object assumes a
definite form, and we perceive that it is a single
horseman, who comes thundering down the hill at full
gallop.
He comes nearer and nearer ; the furious tramp of
the horse is heard distinctly, and now, the choked sobs
that burst convulsively from his breast. At this mo-
ment his speed is broken, he groans and reels; but
the remorseless rider dashes his spurs into his sides,
from which the blood spouts smoking; the stimulus of
pain imparts a momentary vigour to his fainting spirit,
and an unnatural tension to his quivering muscles; he
springs forward with a cry resembling a smothered
shriek, and the apparition flashes past us like light-
ning.
The horseman might be recognized by his sea-dress,
and the moral likeness his features bear to those of one
who journies on a matter of life and death, at a moment
when the minutest divisible particles of time are more
valuable than years in ordinary life, to be the same
whom we have seen in the smuggling cutter ; and he
in turn was no doubt identified with that unsuccessful
lover, whose sudden and mysterious disappearance has
been the proximate cause of the doom which, perhaps,
at this identical instant, is carried into effect on the
unfortunate Henry.
The cunning and apparent self-possession evinced
in some cases by madmen, has often been remarked;

and the measures successfully taken by William, to
bring him, in the midst of difficulties, which a really
sane person would have considered insurmountable, in
a space of time so incredibly short, to within a few
miles of the scene he is about to witness, must be
referred to something of the same nature. The state
of his mind, indeed, was so apparent, that his procur-
ing a horse for this last stage of his journey, after
having already ridden one to death, was absolutely
owing more to intimidation than promises. His man-
ner was wild and agitated; he seemed to be totally
incapable of explaining the cause of his haste: he
might have been a murderer escaping from justice, as
well as a man whose frantic impetuosity was caused
by his anxiety to prevent a legal murder; and yet,
such is the effect of fierceness and determination on
the still life of society, that he was not merely suf-
fered to proceed, but aided in doing so. This is the
secret of the success of highwaymen, who will singly
attack a whole coach-full of travellers; and we have
known men submit without a struggle to this violence,
who, on another occasion, would have stood without
flinching before the pistol of their enemy. His words
were few for deep feelings, like deep waters, are
never noisy; perhaps, in the state of his mind, he was
unable to collect and combine his ideas; and thus his
demand for another horse was expressed as briefly,
and almost as extravagantly, as that of Shakspere's
Richard. The effect which the news of the trial had
had on his imagination, was great in proportion to the
coldness and apathy from which it had startled him,
just as the agitation produced by a stone plunged
into the sea, is in proportion to the calmness of its
waters.
The moment which Henry had chosen for a com-
munication, which put all doubt to rest on the subject
of their dispute, was a most unhappy one; had an
angel of heaven come down with the intelligence,

William would have cursed him for his officiousness.
And yet even then a conviction of the falseness of
the epithet he bestowed on his rival in the heat of
passion, made him shun the contest it gave birth to;
he shook him off by main strength, and, partly to
escape from a quarrel which he felt to be unjust, and
partly to escape, if possible, from himself, he clam-
bered down the dangerous precipice till he reached
the brink of the water below, intending to pass along
the sides of the rock, and walk round by the beach.
Here, however, his passage was stopped unexpectedly.
A small boat, manned by three men, was in waiting, as
if on purpose. With the promptitude acquired in the
wild life of smugglers, these men did not hesitate for
an instant as to how they should dispose of their
unwelcome visitor, but dragged him into the midst of
them with their boat-hook, gagged him with his own
handkerchief, and rowed off to a cutter which was
anchored near the opposite side of the inlet,
be imagined that there was something in this adyen-
ture which, after a time, was not altogether disagree-
able to a person in William's state of mind. Indeed,
he almost instantly resolved to attach himself for
some days (which he afterwards suffered to amount to
many weeks), to the roving and stirring life of a
smuggler. Money was in this, as it is in most in-
stances, all powerful; and he was permitted to become
a kind of lay-brother in this wandering monastery,
and to witness, without participating in, their ceremo-
nies and services. It is not to be supposed that in
this short time he could forget, but his remembrance
by degrees became divested of its bitterness; and he
found the healthful exercise of the body restore, in
some measure, its tone to the mind.
This is all we
have to tell, or rather to hint: and now let us pursue
him on his journey.
He arrived at the bottom of a hill, from the top of
which he knew, from his local acquaintance with the
It may

country, that a view of the place of execution, although
still at a considerable distance, would present itself.
At this moment he thought it would have been com-
parative happiness to be permitted to dash on with
the same furious and headlong speed, forgetting him-
self, as it were, in the excitement produced by the
rapidity of his motion, and the physical efforts which,
at such a pace, it is necessary to make against the
very resistance of the atmosphere. When the part
he was about to act had presented itself to his imagi-
nation, in some of its saner moments, it had been
unattended with any of the sickening details, any of
the fearful doubts and misgivings, that now crowded
into his fancy; and, so mere a creature of circun-
stances and natural vicissitudes is man, that the
change which “came o'er the spirit of his dream,"
was produced simply by the necessity he was under,
from the condition of the jaded animal he rode, of
slackening his pace when ascending the hill. He
had now leisure to attend to the forebodings of that
Proteus fancy, who is an angel of light to the happy,
but an imp of hell to the miserable, who is ever the
first to turn traitor at the hour of our utmost need;
and, not contented with simple desertion, which at
such a moment would be at least endurable, exhausts
the inventions of the deadliest malice, to cut more
keenly to the heart. He had time to wipe the black
and burning sweat from his haggard brow, and to
watch his strength oozing out of the relaxed porés
with every drop; to feel--not a doubt, but a certainty
that he had arrived only in time to witness the
dying struggles of his friend from a distance, near
enough to give to his sickening eyes all the shocking
details of the scene, but far enough to prevent the
possibility of his voice reaching the scaffold, and
arresting the arm of the executioner.
As he approached the summit of the hill his agita-
tion increased, the perspiration flowed from every

277
pore--hot no longer, but of an icy coldness-his
nerves became so relaxed that he lost all command
of his limbs, which shook with the unconscious con-
vulsion of palsy, he could scarcely retain the bridle in
his grasp, or strike his armed heels with sufficient
force, even to prick the already raw and bleeding
flanks of his horse. He has gained the summit; but
a mist swims before his eyes, which renders him in-
capable of distinguishing the nearest objects. It
vanishes by degrees, and the distant scene of execu-
tion comes, piece by piece, before him.
Nothing is seen at first but a black, confused, and
moving mass; this speedily separates, as the space
between is diminished by his desperate efforts, and
distant groups of human figures are observed, all
verging from different quarters towards a common
centre. Here they form and mingle, and become
ly: individuals are seen crossing the more distant
fields towards the scene of action, some of them still
continue to rush on with impetuosity, and others stop
short, as if transfixed by some feeling of horror or
pity, or by the conviction that their efforts to obtain
a nearer view are useless, that the last scene of the
tragedy is already going on.
This supposition is right, for the scaffold at length
appears, on which three individuals are seen standing.
These probably are, the victim who is to be solemnly
thrust out of our common world by his fellow-tenants;
the executioner, who is the officiating hierophant, and
the priest who follows the steps of the devoted to the
very verge of eternity.
At this sight, so fatal to the few hopes which still
clung around his heart, the rider almost falls from his
horse, and the worn animal, though still compelled to
continue at the same pace, staggers from side to side
of the road under the irregular pressure of his master.
The lungs of a giant could not emit a sound capable
of reaching the scaffold, and yet the horseman, in the

frenzy of desperation, attempts it; but his voice is
lower even than the common tone of conversation,
and sounds like the rattle in the throat which attends
the departure of the last breath of life.
He can
now discover the white cap which is drawn over the
victim's face, and in another moment that the rope
is
fixed about his neck; the third person has retired, the
executioner raises his hand to the fatal bolt. William
shuts his eyes. Is all over? Not yet! Is it possible
that he is observed, that his errand is guessed? He
tears the handkerchief from his neck, and waves it in
the air, and shouts anew with his low, hoarse, and
choked voice. He perceives a motion in the nearest
part of the crowd; he even hears a shout, which in his
frenzy he imagines to be “Stop the execution!” He
redoubles his efforts; he has gained the verge of the
scene; the executioner's hand is again raised; but
William cannot utter a word. The crowd makes way
for him, and a passage is opened instantaneously to
the very scaffold; he arrives, throws himself off his
horse, mounts the steps, and falls senseless into the
arins of his friend.
The news spreads like lightning through the crowd,
through the town; and Henry's friends in a moment
besiege the scaffold, and crowd the stairs. But there
is another commotion among the multitude; another
road is opened through it as instantaneously as the
first; and a figure in white appears rushing through
the mass.
It is a female in the dress of a sick person
who is confined to bed; her dark hair floats unconfined
over her almost naked shoulders; in her eyes you may
perceive the struggle between the temporary insanity
of fever and returning reason; she springs up the steps
of the scaffold, the crowd everywhere giving way, and
even leaping down to allow her to pass.
As she
recognises her lover still standing amidst the horrid
apparatus of death, and a figure near him which she
once knew so well, but through whose wild and wan

expression she can scarcely believe that she beholds
the lineaments of a living man, a mysterious doubt
flashes across her brain, bewildered by disease, and
grief, and sudden joy; and she utters a scream so loud
and shrill, that the rising voices of the crowd are
startled into silence. In another moment, however,
she is in the arms of Henry, and they sink on their
knees on the scaffold.
Look, it is William who stands behind, and bends
over them with uplifted hands! Do
you see the tu-
multuous rushing and rocking of the crowd, the waving
of hats, and handkerchiefs, and military plumes? Do
you hear that sound, the ringing of the soldiers' arms,
the roll of the drum, the flourish of the trumpet
united with the mingled thunder of a thousand voices?
Up goes the shout-Hurrah-hurrah-hurrah! Down
with the curtain!
THE END.
